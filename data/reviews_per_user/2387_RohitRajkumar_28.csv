Casablanca," Romance reaches new heights
","It is widely regarded as the most romantic movie ever made and there are no two opinions on that.It is true that there hasn't been a film like this in recent times so it is obvious that there is a possibility of liking this to the very extent.The chemistry between Bergman and Bogart,both brewing with confidence is electrifying.Such great actors definitely should have come more often together.The other actors play their part well.In short,Casablanca is romance like never before which is not to be missed at any cost.Do watch it with your partner,you never know their chemistry might have an effect on yours.",10,2,3,14 August 2009
Se7en," The best nail-biting thriller till date
","Se7en is a film released in 1995 which shows that a serial killer is on the prowl for 7 persons possessing the following sins: lust,greed,gluttony,pride,envy,wrath and sloth and starring performance oriented actors like Brad Pitt,Morgan Freeman,and Kevin Spacey.Two detectives,Pitt(David Mills) and Freeman(William Somerset) are hired to investigate the case and hunt down the serial killer. Mills,being the arrogant cop and Somerset,more of the mature one.The plot has been cleverly written and will keep you engrossed right till the end.The cinematography is of the highest quality and the tight script writing will keep you guessing.Brad Pitt puts in a sincere performance as David Mills and gives able support to Morgan Freeman who completely overshadows Pitt and delivers one of the most brilliant performances of his career as William Somerset.The surprise package of the movie has to be Kevin Spacey who is given limited screen presence but yet delivers a haunting and moving performance.But credit has to be given to David Fincher who has worked hard on each aspect of the film and directed this movie brilliantly. One of the highlights of the film is the seven murders being showcased on the screen perfectly.The climax is one of the best you will ever see in American cinema and will keep you thinking about it for days.",10,0,0,28 April 2009
Fight Club," A knockout of a film
","It is disheartening to see such a masterpiece was disowned by the critics and was a commercial failure. But that's how it is. Such films are seldom made and is truly worthy enough to garner praise and appreciation.Edward Norton,an underrated actor brilliantly plays his character to the core. His innocence and charm tells you about the talent this lad has. Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Marla Singer and is definitely the much needed impetus to the film.But Tyler Burden,one of the most memorable characters on screen played by Brad Pitt will make you say What a shocker of a performance!. Definitely,his best role till date.David Fincher the director gives us another gem from his pocket after the much critically acclaimed 'Se7en'. This one surely deserves top honors and a mandatory watch for all viewers.",10,1,3,14 August 2009
Citizen Kane," 'It's Terrific'
","You must have come across many hoardings describing 'Citizen Kane' to be the greatest cinematic experience ever.Initially,I laughed at it as I knew that it was a box-office disaster and how on earth could it be the best film ever?But out of curiosity I wanted to watch this movie.And guess what?It's terrific.I have never come across a movie which was technically brilliant in every department other than this.This movie deserves a top spot on every movie list just for its sheer brilliance and the execution.Orson Welles has acted,co-written as well as directed 'Citizen Kane' and I truly believe that no other actor could have done more justice to the role of Charles Foster Kane because Orson is 'Kane' personified.It is a masterpiece in terms of film-making and will be cherished for years to come.",10,6,8,14 August 2009
Ed Wood," Weirdest cinema at its best
","I had become a Johnny Depp fan after having appreciated his previous work in 'Edward Scissorhands'.He is truly the weirdest actor on screen and he is no less weird in 'Ed Wood'.'Ed Wood' belongs to Johnny Depp who plays the central character with humor and precision and Martin Landau who plays Bela Lugosi as if the role was tailor made for him.He undoubtedly deserved the Oscar he received for his supporting role.This film was a box office bomb in terms of gross revenue but believe me, you won't regret watching this film because if you are up for weird films,then there is no looking beyond this one.",9,2,2,14 August 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Musical comedy at its best
",Tim Burton delivers yet again.This has to be among his most prized works since it received a Best Picture Golden Globe.It wouldn't have been possible without Johnny Depp who undoubtedly deserved the Golden Globe for Best Actor.He was well supported by Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman who in their respective performances were terrific.The songs were to a surprise well sung by the lead actors.It would have definitely looked a bit artificial had the songs been entrusted to a professional singer.Johnny and Alan deserve kudos for taking this film to a higher level.The characters are well worked out by Tim Burton who deserves special mention for making a special musical film which would be thoroughly enjoyed by people of all ages.,9,2,3,14 August 2009
Taxi Driver," Brilliant
","Martin Scorsese had always maintained that he wanted to work with Robert De Niro after having watched his Oscar-winning performance in The Godfather-II.They came up with Taxi Driver and were surprised by the terrific reaction to the film.Robert De Niro is all over the movie.Playing Travis Bickle,he gives another Oscar worthy performance.He is surely among the greatest actors that this industry has produced when it comes to an all-round performance on screen.Jodie Foster as Iris is another terrific actress to look out for in the future.She has a brief role in the movie but she brilliantly plays her character.Martin Scorsese would definitely want to work with these great actors again in the future after their first collaboration being a huge success. Beautiful movie,terrific performances,brilliant direction.What else do you want in a movie.See it for yourself,its superb.",10,1,2,15 August 2009
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump has Oscar written all over it
","The concept of the movie at the first instant might seem a bit absurd because you might seem to wonder how a man can be intelligent and act stupid at the same time. But this is exactly what Tom Hanks manages to do and do it perfectly.This is a story of a man whose IQ is lower than that of a normal person but still manages to do everything in life on his own and manages to find love in his life through Jenny. Every moment in the film emotionally touches you especially the sequences between Jenny and Forrest. The dialogs are really gripping and makes you take notice of the hard-work put into writing those lines.Special mention has to go to the writing department. Not easy to create a character to which audiences can relate. A very subtle story, beautifully crafted and perfectly executed. Director Robert Zemeckis has put up a commendable effort for giving us his most-prized possession of his career.But the film stands firmly on its feet mainly due to Tom Hanks. The actor deserves his second successive Oscar after Philadelphia. He manages to bring out one of the best performances of his career, ably supported by Gary Sinise, a deserving Oscar nomination. The sequences between them are hilarious to watch and they share a great on-screen chemistry.The movie in itself is a revolution. Such movies are hard to come by. Do yourself a favor and waste no time in catching this movie. Just like in the movie all used to tell Gump 'Run, Forrest, Run.', I say to you, 'Run, Viewers, Run.'",9,3,5,23 December 2009
The Godfather: Part II," The best sequel ever
","There are bound to be comparisons to 'The Godfather',but it definitely comes close to surpass its predecessor but to no avail.But that doesn't take away any credit from another gem from Francis Ford Coppola.There would have definitely been immense pressure on Coppola to deliver the second time after the first one was a huge hit.Robert De Niro was outstanding as the young Don Vito Corleone and truly deserved his Oscar.John Cazale delivers on getting more screen space.But I was disappointed to see that Al Pacino as Michael Corleone after having overshadowed his previous work in the first and having reached greater heights in this one, did not get an Academy award.The film does not disappoint and matches the original in every aspect.Truly outstanding cinema.",10,7,10,14 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fantasy cinema at its very best
","The Lord of the Rings series has always been hailed as the one of the greatest trilogy of all time.So there was enough curiosity to watch this one.The first part already a huge box office success was a three hour long movie having enough elements to grab the attention of the onlookers.First things first.The acting was brilliant from each actor.The cinematography and the special effects were mind-blowing.You might get to see some great visuals, you may have never seen before.In all, a great movie to catch on a weekend.The first part itself is so beautiful generating enough hype to watch its successors.A true cinematic experience 9/10.",10,0,0,7 September 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," The comedy movie you wanted to see for years
","Let me put it straight. At the very first instant when we are shown the close-up of Olive(Abigail Breslin)watching a beauty pageant, we come to know that this story is based on dreams and your determination to fulfill it.The storyline is simple and cleverly written and tells us how a little girl has an ambition to become a beauty queen one day and shows us all the trails and tribulations she along with her family has to go through. It is a story all of us can relate to very easily. It is more of a drama yet you feel it has comedy written all over it. That's the beauty of the movie and its execution.The cast starring Kinnear and Colette in the leads and very well supported by Abigail, Carrell, Dano and Arkin all manage to bring out sincere performances individually. But the real star of the movie has to be Alan 'Grandpa' Arkin who definitely deserved the Oscar for his eccentric performance he manages to put up for us. He brought out loads of madness and stupidity on screen thorough his role.There are some extremely funny lines in the movie and the dance sequence by the whole family is extremely hilarious. Special mention to Carrell's performance. I don't know how to describe it but the way he runs throughout the movie cannot stop to make you laugh.All in all, a very brave effort by first time directors Jonathan and Valerie. Definitely the audience would love to see more movies coming from this duo in the future. If you guys out there enjoy light-hearted comedies, then this one surely tops the list.",9,2,3,23 December 2009
The Shining," 'The Shining' redefines the horror genre
","Stanley Kubrick is known worldwide for his sci-fi films all of them being massive hits but The Shining is right up there in his list.The movie itself is a revelation.Initially disregarded by critics all over now widely regarded as the greatest horror movie ever made.This was the effect the film had on us.It's Jack Nicholson all the way.He is terrific as Jack Napier and is venomous in every scene.After his Oscar winning performance in 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest',he carries the film on his own shoulders.Watch it for his sheer energy.His performance is among the finest you'll ever see.",8,0,0,15 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Better than the first
","Bad boy turns good boy.Arnold Schwarzenegger ,T-800 the evil cyborg in The Terminator turns good in this one.This film overpowers its predecessor in every department.The action sequences are tremendous and the acting is better than the original.Arnold kicks bad ass in this much-awaited sequel and remains his finest work till date.Rest of the actors are very good in their part.Robert Patrick as T-1000 is mind-blowing. The fight sequences between Arnold and Robert would surely amaze you and is worthy of calling it among the best sequels ever.T-800 or T-1000 who will it be?.Watch it.Know it for yourself.",9,1,1,15 August 2009
Edward Scissorhands," One of the best movies of 1990
","Movies are made to have a lasting expression on the audience for many days.Edward Scissorhands is one of them.This movie is showcased so beautifully by Tim Burton that you seem to think how could Johnny Depp (Edward)take up such a role and play it to perfection.The man has frequently been criticized for his expressionless acting and does not have the capability to carry a film on his own shoulders.But Depp's performance in the film has silenced his critics forever and made them stand to witness arguably the best performance of his career. Depp doesn't have many lines to boast of in the movie.But he portrays brilliant expressions convincingly in each and every scene.Editing and photography is top notch.Dialogues are superb and give a lift to each scene.Music by Danny Elfman is haunting,magical and outstanding.The melody of his songs is in accordance with the theme of the movie.Winona Ryder(Kim)was Depp's girlfriend during the shooting of the movie.She too plays her part perfectly and gives able support to Depp.The chemistry between them is the highlight of the film.They look so beautiful on screen no wonder they were a couple in real life. But the credit has to go to Tim Burton,who has handled his most personal project with dedication and sincerity.He has shown how Edward adapts to a new world outside his mansion and how he experiences various emotions in life.The movie is an honor to watch and the climax of the movie will move you for days to come.Excellent 9/10",9,0,1,25 April 2009
Aliens," ALIENS redefined the sci-fi genre
","Having not got a chance to watch 'Alien',I thought watching 'Aliens would not be a good option as I might miss the important links from the previous movie.So I read the story of 'Alien' and then viewed its sequel.Aliens surpasses the original in terms of story-telling.The story is gripping right through the end.We get to see the aliens which I heard were missing in the original movie.Sigourney Weaver as Ripley rips the screen apart with her presence and definitely is the star of the film.This is a new era in sci-fi genre and you definitely don't want to miss all the high-octane,blood-pumping and adrenaline-rushing action.",9,0,3,14 August 2009
Grave of the Fireflies," This movie doesn't move you,it shatters you
",Some movies are always made to make you shed a tear or two but BEWARE this might just bring about a tsunami in your house.It is a Japanese movie made in 1988 so I caught the English dubbed version.There is an anti-war social message and can be easily compared to great war films like 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.The dubbing artists have lent their voices perfectly to the lead pairs in the English dubbed version and retain the same emotions as in the Japanese version.It is definitely going to emotionally stir you and undoubtedly can be called as one of the greatest movies ever made.It's a crime to miss this outstanding piece of cinema.,10,11,13,19 August 2009
The Dark Knight," Mesmerising
","I do not think that I have ever seen a movie with so many memorable scenes in it.Every scene in the movie, the bank robbery, the pencil trick, the interrogation, the hospital blast, the batman-joker showdown is simply amazing..Nolan has simply outdone himself with this effort. And the effort clearly shows in every shot.A hell of a ride from start to finish with brilliant direction, rich storytelling, and extraordinary performances, The Dark Knight may be the best superhero movie ever made but it has definitely become my personal favorite.",10,1,5,17 November 2014
Toy Story," One of Pixar's finest works
","Having watched all of Pixar movies,this comes second to UP.After a string of hits like 'The Incredibles,'Finding Nemo','Cars','WALL-E', and the recent release 'UP','Toy Story' was the first addition to their list. The story itself is a huge bonus to the film's success.Beautifully written and told.And the characters especially Woody and Buzz Lightyear are among the funniest characters to light up the screen.Voiceovers are just about perfect by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.What more to say,there are enough comic elements in the film to keep a smile on your face throughout the film.Watch it with your family,it would be a great experience that you won't regret.",9,0,0,15 August 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Watch it for Jim Carrey
",The title says it all.This movie has Jim Carrey written all over it.'Eternal Sunshine' shows Jim Carrey play an altogether different character which you may have never seen before.The acting by Kate Winslet is simply brilliant no wonder she received an Academy award nomination.The elements of the film are very well put together having many funny and quite bizarre moments.Kudos to the writing department who put up such a brilliant script so that the actors get enough screen time to display their on screen brilliance. Definitely a big milestone in film making.'Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind' is surely not to be missed.,9,0,1,7 September 2009
Life Is Beautiful," One of the greatest movies of all time
","There have been many movies made on holocaust issues, Schindler's List and The Pianist being some of the best holocaust movies ever made. And Life is Beautiful is a highly deserving addition to this list.Roberto Benigni who acted, co-wrote as well as directed this masterpiece does full justice to the role of Guido Orefice. He is so subtle in his performance, so funny yet being so serious at the same time.He always will be remembered for this role.Dora, played by his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi did full justice to this role and the chemistry between the lead actors was nothing short of outstanding.The rest of the cast contribute significantly with Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini standing out among them. The background score is simple yet terrific and truly deserved its Academy Award.This one was genuinely loved and embraced by one and all, resulting in 3 Academy Awards and many numerous other awards. All in all, a movie that truly deserves all the laurels and recognition it is getting. This is one of those movies where you are definitely going to get moist-eyed and also obtain an experience of a lifetime. Please don't miss this one. Life is really short and of course very BEAUTIFUL.",10,3,5,13 February 2010
Up," Hands down,'Up' is the best animated movie
","Pixar has always made movies for people of all ages.So that factor made me go to watch 'Up'.Pixar's movies are something different from the rest of the lot,you name them,you have them.Right from 'Toy Story' to 'WALL-E',the quality of their work has never deteriorated.Many people cited 'WALL-E' to be the best work of Pixar but then came 'Up'.The script is a major factor in Pixar movies and 'Up' is no different.In fact,the first 15 minutes will move you and you shall remember it as one of the best moments you ever had.The characters of the movie are very well worked out and always manage to keep a smile on your face throughout the movie.A special mention has to go to the music department for creating music binded with emotions.The film itself is a revelation and is bound to win an Academy award next year.If not,I would be disappointed.Go for 'Up',there is not a single moment in the film which would let you 'down'.",9,0,2,14 August 2009
Some Like It Hot," The best comedy in years
","It's beautiful right from the word start.I had only heard of the beautiful goddess Marilyn Monroe until this movie.She was beauty personified throughout the film.Acting wise,this is perhaps her finest work to date for which she received a Golden Globe award.Jack Lemmon was brilliant as Jerry/Daphne for which he received an Academy award nomination.Really,he should have won this.Tony Curtis as Joe/Josephine is another great actor who delivers in this comedy caper.The film belongs to Billy Wilder who gave us a film having an unique combination of sensuality and comedy.STATUTORY WARNING:You will laugh your guts off watching this one.",10,1,3,14 August 2009
Psycho," One of the best films to come out of Hollywood
","First of all,a black and white movie is always difficult to keep the modern generation audience glued to their seats so Psycho is an exception.The script has been very cleverly written and the editing of the movie is top-notch .The performances are mind-blowing especially by Anthony Perkins.The actor so effortlessly carries off the role with innocence and confidence that he makes you stand and take notice of him.The gripping suspense intensifies with each successive frame and the shocking climax would make you stand and applaud the masterpiece.Alfred Hitchcock - The Master adds another feather to his cap after 'Vertigo' and delivers another blockbuster with 'The Birds'.If you liked Psycho,you would definitely like the other two movies and know what an era of quality cinema ,'The Master' has created.",10,0,0,15 January 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best stories ever told
","It is a great movie which received 7 Academy award nominations but lost to eventual winner Forrest Gump and ranked 1# on IMDb.So there was enough curiosity to watch this one.It is a very intelligent film in terms of story telling.The director deserves kudos for extracting such fine performances from his lead pair,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman who received Academy award nominations for their respective roles. Now the main question is does it deserve the top spot on IMDb.Well,the immediate answer is NO.The Godfather may be superior to The Shawshank Redemption by all means but it manages to hold its own and is complete as a film.Shawshank is a treat for the viewers.Do watch it for its gripping story well told.",10,0,0,15 August 2009
300," '300' will rip you apart
","Another adaptation of a comic book after 'Sin City',and this one too a success.Gerard Butler,plays Leonidas,a Spartan leading his army of 300 all the way against the evil Xerxes.Zack Snyder does not disappoint after his previous work 'Dawn of the dead' being a huge hit and directs 300 beautifully.The performances he manages to extract from the entire cast is what you have got to watch out for.A terrific display of great visuals,perfect storyline and terrific performances make this film a must watch.The fighting sequences are a treat to watch.300 is a winner all the way.After seeing this,watch out for Snyder's next 'Watchmen'.Another visual treat.",8,0,1,15 August 2009
Sin City," An eye popping experience
","There are very few successful adaptations of comic books and Sin City is for sure a success.The graphic elements portrayed in the film are wonderful and something very different.The story is laid out very well showing different situations.Bruce Willis is good in his role but I wished he had got more screen time.Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson,the ladies looked beautiful in the movie and played well their respective minuscule roles.Benicio Del Toro was the surprise package of the film as he played the corrupt police cop to perfection.But the scene stealer has to be none other than Mickey Rourke who is magnificent in his screen presence.The film itself has something new to offer and that is its plus point.Some critics have bashed this film for having less human emotions and giving importance to graphic content in the film.Leave the critics aside, you have got to watch 'Sin City' to have one of the best experiences of your life",9,13,17,14 August 2009
Goodfellas," Arguably the best mob movie since 'The Godfather'
","Another mob film and this too delivers.Goodfellas definitely comes close to The Godfather series in terms of mob violence and acting.And that too is a big achievement.The pace of the film is what you've got to watch out for.It is definitely fast as compared to The Godfather but in terms of acting it definitely lacks a bit to The Godfather stalwarts.Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro all deliver knock out performances in this gangster drama.Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made and would definitely haunt you for days to come.In one word,Amazing.",10,0,0,7 September 2009
The Godfather," The greatest movie ever made
","I had heard a lot about this epic masterpiece for so many years and so I tried to get a DVD copy or catch a T.V premiere or any possible way.Finally,the wait was over.And to my surprise it was worth the waitThe movie is not your usual type of movie.Its got brains,guts and glory all over it.The performances are extraordinary from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.You will have a great time watching this movie as every aspect of the movie is just perfect right from the acting department to the cinematography department.I am very happy to have lived to this day to have watched the best cinematic experience ever.......THE GODFATHER.",10,2,5,14 August 2009
