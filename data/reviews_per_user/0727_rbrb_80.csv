The Lobster," In the top 5 worst 'movies' of all time.....
","Made the mistake of purchasing this hideous movie as a DVD. Somehow lasted over an hour before switching it off, never to be viewed again.This is an extremely silly and unpleasant movie whereby animal and human cruelty are exalted; but not in a clever way but stupidly and incomprehensibly.I cannot be bothered to relate what the so called story of this picture is, except to say here does not seem to be one. The truth is there is no humor or cleverness at all in this ridiculous film.The whole movie looks like it is made up as it goes along and the zombie people who give it high marks are as brainless as those who gave the movie some awards and decent reviews:0/10 ( but rounded up to the lowest vote possible).",1,26,43,27 May 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Master Mess of a Movie!
","This film is garbage.Over long, muddled, confused, boring, with no likable characters.The story-as far as I can decipher-relates to a woeful future time when replicants/robots seek to destroy earlier models.But of course the film tries to dictate to us that there being no substitute for humans... the problem with that preaching is that it was, I assume, a human who made this total nonsense of a movie!What is just as bad as the blandness of this picture is that many so called professional film reviewers are writing treatises etc., on how wonderful is this film.The fact- as opposed to the science fiction- is that this flick is a disaster and an abject mess:1/10",1,61,128,9 October 2017
Angels & Demons," That's Entertainment!
","Entertaining yarn which rattles along at a high octane pace and is miles better than the Da Vinchi code.'Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon works to solve a murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican.' All action movie, colorful sets, locations and scenery, excellent music plus some intelligent dialogue; and the picture has an aura of realism even though the whole story is absurd and preposterous. Pity someone has not got the courage to make a true film about the current scandals in the RC church.This movie goes on a bit too long and at times is almost comical, nonetheless, mostly held my attention throughout, hence deserves:7/10.",7,1,2,21 July 2010
Vertigo," The Dizzy Heights of Excellence
","Retired detective, who is scared of heights, is hired to follow another mans wife and there follows intrigue, mystery and suspense. A super melodrama! The acting,directing, sets, costumes, script, music, etc are all excellent. And near the start of the film there is one brilliant 10 minute period when there is no dialogue but the action is controlled only by the music. A sensational analysis of the movie is by Roger Ebert: see external reviews. This picture is worthy of maximum marks.",10,124,214,29 April 2004
Black Swan," Psycho joins So you think you can Dance(?)!
","This is a highly impressive dark and intense drama.A ballerina gets the chance to take the lead in 'Swan Lake'. But she is engulfed by the part and by the demons in her mind. Her mother, co-workers and ballet director add further fire to the madness consuming her.Super production and first class acting all round.Its' said that insanity is one step from genius, and with the gnawing intensity of this drama it is only one step from high camp and black comedy but fortunately this movie stays on the side of brilliance hence:10/10.",10,1,4,1 March 2012
The New World," PC World
","English settlers arrive in primitive America, fight with the red indians, and an Irishman pretending to be English, gets his rocks off with a squaw who cannot get enough of the white man so she helps them and is later feted before English Royalty.What is wrong with this film:1. Badly directed and edited and and much of the time I could not understand what was said or was going on, and had to research the internet to learn the ending. I blame the director as many scenes I can only describe as lacking direction and focus.2.If you are making a film about English conquerors do not have some ham actor Irish actor, accent and all, looking totally bored, playing an Englishman.3.The film tries to be politically correct as if it was honest it would portray the Indians as the disease riddled savages they are, instead of giving them a westernized morality; it would also show how the arrivals plundered everything etcA few good location shots gives this a generous:3/10",3,0,3,30 June 2010
The Finest Hours," The Perfect Storm meets Captain Sully (or two!)
","Based on true events this movie provides a super show and merits a top vote.Set in 1952 the film tells the story of a small group of coast guards attempting to rescue men aboard a tanker that had split in half and seemed to be doomed.Fabulously graphic special effects, with 1st rate direction, this picture had me engrossed throughout. The actors, direction and whole production is excellent.The only negative is the female 'love' interest who is mainly an irritation and to me is wholly unnecessary in the movie. Despite that, I can still say this is a highly exciting and entertaining thoughtful show deserving at least:8/10.",8,1,1,27 October 2017
Spartacus," Spartacus Out of the Closet...
","Thank you Netflix for having this available. Despite around 60 years since it was released still mostly watchable.There was a real Spartacus though this picture is simply the makers fantasy about a slave who wants to be free so he fights the establishment.
Spectacular action and a cast of thousands..The British players totally steal the show. Tony Curtis almost ruins it with his New York accent and wooden performance; plus he and all the actors spout 1950/60's haircuts et al which makes a mockery of the intended era.However there is sufficient entertainment in this movie to give it a decent rating but a mark is deducted for the appalling Tony Curtis. The film also portrays the latter as the gay toy boy of some of the main protagonists in the movie. I do not know if that aspect was in the original movie in 1960 or revealed only in the restored version.All in all:
7/10.",7,1,2,26 May 2019
Deepwater Horizon," BP: hold your head in shame!
",Based or inspired by actual events this movie is a first class production. It shows events that led to a terrible oil rig tragedy. There is a highly intelligent script and the special effects are realistic yet of course awful and are the outstanding feature of this picture. As with many tragedies the greed to cut corners and make money was at the heart of this disaster. The victims deserved far better. 8/10,8,1,2,15 July 2017
It," Teenage Angst meets Stephen Kings' Ego....
","This for me is is a theater of the absurd ludicrous movie.In a small town a group of teenagers are going through puberty and other rites of passage including body development and monthly cycles.This in my view causes many of them to collectively imagine an evil presence-maybe a fear of the onset of adulthood-which is played out in various gruesome scenes featuring a killer clown. Notice that the macabre events seem to only arise in the presence of or in the minds of the children.Whilst Stephen King is a brilliant writer, the problem is that his stories are usually totally ridiculous.No doubt many film reviewers and others will rave over this nonsense which ominously reveals this is just a start being called : Chapter 1.There are a few scenes that will have some viewers frightened plus the cinematography is good, yet despite these pluses I can only award this picture:3/10.",3,25,52,7 September 2017
Monster," Acting....As Good As It Gets.......
","Brilliant drama with an excellent script, direction and acting, deserving top marks. The lead actress is stunning in her performance.The story is based on a true life event of a street prostitute who goes on a killing spree. The reasons for that and her relationships in the film are riveting throughout. Now of course the real life events and persons are highly likely different from how the movie portrays them and the film gives a wholly sympathetic slant to the side of the killer. My brief research however on the killer is that she was an abused child and adult, she was likely mentally ill, and was undeserving the fate she ultimately received.",10,0,0,21 February 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Disaster Movie: probably the worst 'film' I have ever seen....
","Shame on IMDb saying this is a drama/thriller/war film. Nothing of the sort. 'Saving Private Ryan' would come into that category, not this dreadful mess of a movie.It looks and feels like the writer/director so called has made it up as he goes along as the whole thing is uneven and drifts from drama to farce and various other genres.It is part parody, part fantasy, part black comedy(without being funny)and proved to be a total waste of my time and goodness knows why I did not bother to turn it off sooner. Brad Pitt is a complete embarrassment as he looks like he got out of his VIP chair to ad lib his role. And the actor playing Hitler is also an absolute joke but humorless.In brief the scenario is that a bunch of Jews in the 1940's go to get revenge on Nazi's, and the climax of this takes place in a cinema in Paris where all the German leaders will be present. The picture has unnecessary and needless violence, the plot and story are outrageously ridiculous and whilst Christopher Waltz steals the show even he cannot save this movie.Now have to ask rhetorically:Why do the members here give this movie over 8/10 on average? Further, why have are the box office takings almost twice the apparent budget? Seems that a few influential but totally out of touch film reviewers and some clever misleading marketing has duped a lot of people into believing there is some worth in this disaster of a movie.My verdict:What a load of rubbish,1/10",1,28,52,18 August 2010
Passengers," Robinson Crusoe is....Lost in Space!
","Super sci fi movie deserving a high vote. The likes of recent rehashed Star Wars and Star Trek pictures are poor compared to Passengers.On a journey to a new planet, one of the travelers is awoken by accident 90 years before arrival. He is doomed to spent his life alone and he must live a life like Robinson Crusoe unless he can find a girl Friday....The special effects are stunning. The story and dilemma's of the key passengers are compelling.Plus the two main leads give first class performances.The direction and whole production is superb and this film merits : 8/10.",8,10,19,25 December 2016
The Impossible," Realistic portrayal of Disaster.......
","This is an excellent movie about the tsunami disaster of 2004 concentrating on the experiences of one family. Mum, Dad and 3 kids arrive on a Thai island for what ought to be a wonderful Xmas holiday; instead disaster strikes and this film is a real tear jerker. Who will survive, if any, and where are they?! From my own knowledge and research and what I recall, the tragedy of the tsunami is accurately shown in the film. At the time of the tsunami I was in another part of Thailand about 1 hour by jet away from where it hit, yet I could still feel the after shock of it. The movie is superbly yet horrifically presented and the children in the picture give the stand out performances especially the actor Tom Holland. The family are portrayed in the movie as British, but in real life were Spanish, yet the change in nationality is justified in telling this story. Deserves a high rating:8/10.",8,0,0,16 October 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," The Desperate Housewifes of Windsor.....
","'Two sisters contend for the affection of King Henry VIII', so says the plot; more like wannabee royals desperate to get their daughters married off try for the big one on the throne. Unfortunately for them he happens to be into numerous partners and if that means creating his own church to get his rocks off so to speak, or even executing a few unfortunates, then well so be it.He is the King after all in a time when their power was absolute.Lavish sets and costumes, great production design and fine direction. Excellent acting from all the cast especially from the actress playing the unfortunate incumbent Queen before the Boleyn 'sister act' comes along.High entertainment and melodrama at its' best!7/10.",7,0,1,4 June 2009
The Irishman," Mafia 'Carry On' Movie...
","Wasted 3 hours+ of my life on this garbage. Some of the gushing reviews are totally wrong.. The only reason I give above the lowest rating is due to the film accurately capturing various era's plus the special effects in aging the players.
This movie is no different to all the other mafia type flicks. Glorifying violent and mass murderers.
Who cares what happens to any of the sick individuals portrayed? Good riddance to them all!
They are the lowest of the low.
Film is overlong by at least 2 hours.
Tells the story of a gangster who rose to the top by killing and treachery.Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are simply caricatures of themselves.
Both actors are the same in every movie they are in.Recommendation: total waste of time.3/10",3,9,26,29 November 2019
Billy Elliot," A Star Is Born
",This is an excellent film... This movie is not really about dance or ballet... its about trying to understand what it was like to be a striking miner in the North of England in the 1980's and supporting your children to pursue their dreams.... Sure there is dance in the film......the kid is cute and talented... but the real star is the actor playing his father giving a magnificant performance..... All the actors do well but the formentioned is stunning ....and this film can make you laugh and cry ..and is worth at least an 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,20 April 2001
Alexander," What A Bunch of Hammy Drama Queens!
","This movie must rate in any top ten as one of the worst of all time.The lead actor is totally mis-cast and he and others have broad Irish accents which in the context of playing a Greek Conquerer is a farce! Everything about this film is wrong: The script is nonsense and overlong; the direction and editing is wholly uneven and feeble, looking like it was put together by a bunch of autistic school children.And there is so much else erroneous about this pic, it ain't worth my bother listing them all.....Most importantly, the real Alexander was a gay but him and his lovers are playing their parts like a bunch of closest Queens which may or may not have been the true scenario in real life but it comes over in the film as a comedy.As to the actress playing the mother: like something out of a Drag Queen show; and the father with his one eye is played by an actor seemingly more music hall than serious....and as for Anthony Hopkins.....plays the part like an aging never has been.......Dear oh dear, what a load of absolute rubbish! 1/10.",1,3,4,16 July 2006
Terminator Salvation," $200,000,000 million for this pile of Junk
",For most of this film I could not understand what it was about or who was who or what was going on.And quite frankly I could not care less as the picture is sterile and literally full of junk. Apparently this is part of a series about a John Connors saving the world but the film makers erroneously assume all viewers would know about the series and the story. Big Mistake. Apparently evil- though mentally challenged- machines have overtaken the world and Connors plus others are meant to be doing something to stop that. The romantic female lead is a masculine looking and behaving woman who cannot act and thinks she is sexy when in fact for many of us she is a complete turn off as are all the other characters in the film.I give this a very generous 2 and half rounded up only because of some colorful special effects which however become tedious and there is nothing else of merit in the movie.IMDb estimates a budget of $200 million for the film.Has so much $$$ ever been wasted on such a pile of junk???!!!3/10,3,2,6,10 August 2010
500 Days of Summer," A film for the mentally challenged
",This film is worthy of nothing more than the lowest vote.Badly and unevenly directed the lead characters are not appealing and are totally self centered.The whole movie in in flash backs and flash forwards and is about a un-stable manic depressive youngish male who is miffed that the woman he loves does not love him; and with a few interludes of sanity the idiot spends his time feeling and looking sorry for himself.There is nothing else to the movie.Who on earth writes this trash? I get the impression this picture is intended for gullible wide eyed teens with a very low IQ.1/10,1,11,20,21 May 2011
Resident Evil: Extinction," 'A cross between the Mad Max Series and Night of the Living Dead'
","My summary title is thanks to professional reviewer Philip French and appropriately sums up this flick and my account of it.The opening scene shows the female lead nude in the bath and in the version of the movie I watched on cable has her naked body 'bubbled out' and when any actor smoked a cigarette there was similar censorship; yet countless scenes of bloody killing with heads and bodies blown to bits are left untouched! This film is part of a series itself but basically the world is infected with a virus, zombies walk the earth, our heroine has supernatural powers,a few 'goodies' are trying to survive in the desert, there is a mad scientist who is part of an evil underworld etc and whatever. Some clever special effects makes this 'nonsence' more or less watchable. 6/10.",6,1,2,1 July 2008
The Prestige," Trash
","After less than an hour I turned off this trash as could not fathom what was going on in the story.It starts with a Dicken's era magician's act apparently going wrong and someone to blame and then a confusing and muddled plot which is dreary, fake and boring with equally mixed up flash backs etc.All the characters are unpleasant and not likable in this film and speak with accents sounding like present day cockney.The whole movie is unconvincing, silly and hence worthy only of the lowest mark possible.What a load of rubbish: 1/10",1,5,25,12 August 2010
Cloverfield," How a director /filming technique etc can ruin a half decent Movie.......
","Recently saw a film called Quarantine at a movie house and the same technique used in that film as this one; hand held camera used to give more realism to the picture. Perhaps because it was on a wide screen the hand held formula worked in the afore named film, not in this one, and perhaps also because I viewed this one on the television. Indeed both films have similar story lines and similar endings; in essence a group of people trapped trying to escape monsters.Indeed I will be corrected but is not Blair Witch more or less the same?And also the same type of plot etc ? A lot of copying going on and not much originality, eh! So hence to repeat what is annoying about this movie is the way it is filmed; though despite that there are some good special effects and monsters but unfortunately none of the characters in the movie are particularly likable and indeed quite the opposite. Therefore a generous: 5/10.",5,0,1,30 March 2009
Hotel Rwanda," Tour De Force!
","This film is tremendous which is because of an inspired performance from the lead actor,Don Cheadle, and a brilliant director. The movie had me engrossed throughout.A hotel manager in Rhwanda is caught in a tribal war and uses all his intelligence and ingenuity to try to save his family and a lot of other people from falling victims to a genocide.How true the actual story is we will never know for sure but certainly the terrible events that happened in Rhwanda are factually correct as occurs in the African continent as a whole as indeed and other countries too. We are forever seeing film of Africans being exploited and starving and this picture highlights the evil of corruption and it seems to me that even where Aid is given to the starving millions the question needs to be addressed how much of it actually gets through to those it is intended for.Nonetheless this is a sobering, moving and powerful drama:9/10.",9,0,0,22 April 2008
Dear John," The misery of drama queens....
","People die, get sick, go to war, get shot, are autistic, have failed businesses, lose the love of their life, get cancer,and so on and so forth etc., et al, and blah blah blah. What a misery of a film.The lead actor I have to say is quite good and looks and acts the part of a soldier going to fight who falls in love but is eventually dear johned.Unfortunately the lead actress seems like a Paris Hilton type and its quite laughable that the story tries to pretend she cares for horses and wants to teach special needs children.... give me a break!The movie has its moments but tends to overdo the soap opera and goes on far too long.3 and a half rounded down, hence:3/10.",3,0,1,7 October 2011
Ocean's Twelve," What a Load of Rubbish......
","I wasted about an hour of my life on this garbage, as that is about the time it took before I switched it off, and hope in future never to do the same again. If I remember right Oceon 11 was about a casino heist, and this film is meant to be a follow on from that; the story relates to a bunch of people who are being pursued about the first robbery so need to do another 'job' to repay the victim or else.... However the plot is totally confusing. The acting is atrocious. The players try to be funny: they are not. The script is dismal and the directing even worse. It is all over the place. These people in the film are full of their 'celebrity' self importance and quite frankly it is embarrassing how bad this movie really is. Zeta Jones and Clooney look like amateur clowns. Total rubbish.",1,0,1,24 June 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Don't waste your time on this dated and unfunny film....
","Goodness knows how the voters here can give this movie such a high mark. It is totally dated, unfunny, with Peter Sellers giving a slapstick performance as different characters which is so poor and ham-ish it would make participants in a school play blush.The story is about a mad USA military commander who gives an order for fighter planes to bomb Russian, and the question is: can that order be countermanded or will their be a nuclear attack by mistake?The only reason I give this picture 2/10 as there is perhaps maybe a couple of scenes mildly amusing like when a cola machine is smashed and someone gets coke in his face. But any humor is barely present as the film is really a vehicle to show how stupid and over rated that goon Sellers is, and much of the play seems to be ad libbed and made up as it goes along.What a waste of time!",2,10,27,24 July 2010
Closer," Getting 'closer' to the truth....
","This is a raw adult drama,and is very good thoughtful entertainment. If you want a mushy Hollywood style 'romance' then this movie ain't for you. Two men and two women who are really into lust rather than love show us some of the sexual politics of real relationships and its' a game of cat and mouse where the strongest and cleverest is likely to win the day.This film comes from a play and whilst one of the leads,Clive Owen,is lauded by many for his performance,yet for me he came across as slightly artificial delivering lines that did not come from his character but from a writer. Seems the picture could have been ever better if the two male leads exchanged roles. Nevertheless the story is still an engrossing show and when movie makers start to try to tell the truth about life, as this film attempts, rather then portray things in fantasy terms, then we have a decent film experience. Seven and a half, rounded down, 7/10.",7,0,1,19 August 2008
Lost in Translation," Love Amongst The Ruins
","Generally an engaging love story.Two 'lost' individuals seeking solace find each other in a strange city,namely, Tokyo. That city is shown as a gadgetry nightmare in an urban sprawl. The local inhabitants are portrayed as half-wits when trying to speak English.The two lead characters are flawed. He,despite wealth and apparent health, is misery all the way and is suffering a middle aged crisis. And she is bored and has achieved nothing in her life.The opening title scene of near nakedness teases the viewer; and the 'crux' of the film is whether the lovers will ultimately consummate their relationship. And it is the conclusion to that tease which keeps the play alive.7/10.",7,1,3,19 February 2005
Doctor Strange," Psychedelic tour-de-force!
",This movie is first rate entertainment.A brilliant though selfish brain surgeon has a life changing accident. He is desperate to repair himself. To achieve that end he enters a mystical world of adventure and magic.Excellent special effects with plenty of humor and excitement.This is a fantasy movie and for anyone turned off by that genre I would say that one way to interpret the film is as a story showing the surgeon's psychedelic 'trip' to offset the injuries he suffered in the accident.8/10.,8,4,8,1 November 2016
Interstellar," 2014's 'Epic' idea of 2001: A Space Oddity
","This movie is around 3 hours long-and it felt like 3 days. And yes it is quite good, but an epic in pretentiousness and political correctness, which assures it of a clutch of awards.The earth is dying, so NASA needs to use a worm hole to find an alternative planet. The hero's are a father and his daughter. In brief the story asks the question will the search for another habitable world be successful or not?The film explores amongst other things that popular sci fi idea of time travel. Unfortunately much of the picture is full of junk science and techno babble. Throw in some strong ideas about 'love' and family and a famous poem, and that is about it.Good points: special effects, production design, a number of good one liners.Bad points: Far too long, an unnecessary complicated and convoluted story line plus having Michael Caine in the film. He very nearly ruins it as he speaks like a cockney selling fruit in a street market rather than a respected scientist that he is meant to portray.Because of the bad points I need to significantly reduce my vote and hence I give this:6/10.",6,1,6,18 November 2014
Lion," *****Magnificant*****
",A true story of a young child called Saroo who when in the slums of India gets lost from his mother and siblings. He finds himself miles away in an area where his dialect is not spoken. After harrowing adventures he finds himself in a horrible child detention center. Eventually he is adopted by a couple in Australia.When grown up he yearns for his family:But can he find them?Are they safe?This is a real tear jerker with superb performances from the young and older Saroo.The movie is compelling and says so much about love and family and throughout the picture it has vitally important things to say about the human condition.Magnificent!10/10,10,0,1,27 May 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Dreadful baby dreadful
","What ruins this movie is that the whole story is totally preposterous and ridiculous.A child is kidnapped and the film then embarks on a nonsensical whodunit which in the end poses a moral dilemma that in effect the chief of police stole the kid to give it a better life so why not leave things alone and allow the policeman to keep the kid....dear oh dear, give me a break! And no there is no argument, because in real life( not fantasies such as this) children no matter what the background of their natural parents should stay with them in most situations apart from abuse etc. Along the way getting to the nonsense ending we have all sorts of wholly unrealistic scenes and dialogs which I will not bother to relate as it wastes my time and are just completely far fetched. The lead actor is meant to be a outstanding person who faces the aforesaid moral dilemma yet in another scene he shoots an albeit loathsome yet unarmed man in the back of the head and is treated as a hero for doing that.No wonder the USA has a gun problem. Morgan Freeman gives an almost identical performance in every film; he is like a puppet except his mouth moves sometimes; Ed Harris wears a cocker spaniel hair piece which makes him look laughable. The romance interest of the lead is an excruciatingly bad actress. The makers of this film have an agenda: all celebrities because of their status and wealth are entitled-so the propaganda of the picture suggests- to whatever children they want and if that means kidnapping them so be it. Complete rubbish. 1/10.",1,32,68,10 March 2009
Bohemian Rhapsody," Celebrate Musical Genius!
","This is the best movie I have seen this year and amongst the best ever.It is compelling throughout with super music and convincing believable players all inspired by real events.The show-stopping stand out performance comes from Rami Malik who deserves a clutch of awards as does the film itself and everyone associated with it.Some professional critics and others have for what ever reason tried to be critical of this movie but once again they are totally wrong and the public ticket sales confirms the quality of the movie.
If some of the seedier aspects of the true events are not fully shown then need to remember that the central focus of this movie is the music.Freddy Mercury was the lead singer of the band Queen and the film shows how the band and their music evolved and at the same time explains the life and demise of the bands principal artist at a time when AIDs began its' cruel epidemic.This picture is a celebration of the music and artistry of genius musicians and showmanship and thankfully does not dwell so much on the plague of AIDs but when the movie does focus on that subject, it does so with devastating effect.There is one scene When Freddy Mercury is leaving the AIDs clinic and a fellow suffering has a ever so brief exchange with him: that is heart-breaking.
Another scene when Freddy tell his band members:
'I've got it', and they are clueless as to what he is talking about. That sadly sums up the previous apathetic attitude of the straight world to gay issues.
A lot of the public will of been perplexed with Freddy's apparent sexual preferences and the woman in his life. The movie unravels and explains it. Because of his ethnic background and the pressures on him he needed to be straight or believe that he was; or if not then the most he could do was to claim bisexuality.
He was of course always a gay even though Freddy resisted for a lot of his life that realization.Adding to the magical music and fine acting is a delightfully amusing but insightful script and with wonderful presentation and production I can award:

The Italian Job," A Brilliant Job!
","This film is excellent entertainment from beginning to end.A group of interesting characters plan a gold robbery and the whole movie rightly focuses on that theme.The story is unpretentious, unethical and gloriously engrossing in the superb special effects and action sequences.At last a script and director who realizes the viewing public want an uncluttered plot with great scenes and visual enjoyment.No wonder this movie made a mint at the box office and a sequel is on the way.Top marks!",10,3,10,14 May 2005
Baby Driver," Masterful Film Noir 2017
","This is one of the best movies so far in 2017. With a super mix of charismatic characters, catchy music a lot of humor this film is a sure fire winner. A genius get-a-way driver with problems and issues finds himself in a spiraling tangle of events. The opening car chase followed by a musical coffee dance is worth the price of the ticket alone! All the players in this film are likable for different reasons and the whole production is masterfully done:8/10.",8,12,21,14 September 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Trash Then, Trash Now.....
","One newspaper reviewer headlined his write-up of this movie along the lines: :'if you don't like this film you don't like movies'. he then proceeded to 'gush' over how marvellous the picture is.....along with all the other hobbits elves and dwarfs followers.....hence with few exceptions we are being told we have to love this film and if we don't there is something wrong with us. I remember when the book was in fashion and it was sort of shiek(trendy) to be reading it. Well let me tell you. I could not finish the first page of the book as in my opinion it was trash then and is trash now. So far as the movie is concerned.....ok nice scenery,locations,sets, costumes and special effects......but : 1. far too long at almost 3 hours. 2. A nonsensical storyline. 3. the ending is left up in the air no doubt in the expectation that it will get punters in for the sequel et al. Obviously millions have been wasted on this film.......what a shame... when such could have been spent on either a decent fairy tale story or even a sensible true life type movie.My companion and I almost walked out after an hour and a half and it was only because I fell asleep 3 times...and almost another 3 times that we endured it to the finish. Mind you...the good news is....if you are a cigarette smoker and then you can try to abstain for almost three hours whilst being totally bored by this nonsense. At least with a lot of popcorn washed done with plenty of coke-a-cola I was able to burp amply which caused the youngsters next to me more interest and amusement than anything on the screen. I am told Harry Potter is a far superior picture. But ....to be honest.... if I was given the choice to a) cut my toe nails...b)wash dirty laundry ....c) sit through this film ...I will without doubt go for either a) or b). Still its now 2002 and.... to be generous.....I give it 1 out of 10.",1,2,6,3 January 2002
Cast Away," Celebrate Humanity
","This film is brilliant. American movie-making at its' finest, deserving top honours.Following a plane crash and marooned on a desert island a survivor must learn to do just that---survive. The practicalities of how a human would cope with such a scenario seems to be realistically portrayed and the feel and sense of isolation and desolution is engendered superbly ...with depth, sensitivity and feeling. The real crux of this thought-provoking masterpiece is a truth about how the mystery of life's fortunes can affect an individual in the way events-and our attitude to them-unravel in determining our future.I missed the first few minutes of the start of the film and when I entered the theatre I thought I was watching a commercial for Federal Express; though the use of a respected brand name product in the film is not only wholly justified but is central to the meaning and equalibrium of the movie. When a picture can bring tears to the eyes over the apparent loss of a volleyball(yes...a volleyball!) that shows genius in the production direction, writing and acting. I for one will look forward to watching this film again....and for its' celebration of humanity....it earns a perfect 10.",10,0,0,3 February 2001
Armageddon," A Pile of Ridiculous Junk Science
","The only reason I give this above the lowest vote possible is because somehow I sat through this load of junk.Ludicrous story and bad acting pervade the whole movie. Its about a bunch of oil drillers called on to save the world by landing on an asteroid to blow it up before it destroys earth: blah, blah, blah.The film goes on far too long. Not sure who gets the prize for the worst actor. Either Bruce Willis for his conceit and smugness or the actress playing his daughter who is a total annoyance throughout. Indeed every actor and actress in the picture is exceedingly irritating. The film makers may think there is something funny about low life people being astronauts, but count me out on that one.Seems to me a lot of money wasted on some half decent special effects; its a pity nobody bothered to make anything else in the film worthwhile as most of the movie is pathetically poor, hence:2/10",2,4,7,4 October 2011
Cold Mountain," The Bridget Jones Show
","Entertaining yarn set in the American Civil war years. Bridget Jones... aka Renee XYZ....or whatever her name is....steals the show along with the other supporting actors. Mind you the movie is a success not because of, but despite, the two main leads.Both Jude Law and Ms.Kidman have trouble keeping their Southern accents in check;I for one was not persuaded that either gave convincing performances at all and because of that mis-casting the whole premise of the story that those two would fall in love at first sight is simply ludicrous. This film could have been a classic and for instance Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood would have made it so....don't say they are too old which would be Ageism. What makes this a good picture along with the supporting cast is the scenery, music, script, direction and editing.The audience is kept engrossed all the way.

North by Northwest," As Good As It Gets
","I must have seen this movie at least 5 times. It is a brilliant drama/thriller and the whole production which includes direction, writing, music, acting, etc., is top quality. By a quirk of fate a businessman is unwittingly dragged into a deadly spy game. A whole series of adventures follow with plenty of twists and turns and surprises along the way. All the characters are charismatic, the villains are suitably bad and the hero suitably brave as well as amusing and flawed. The story is presented in a straight forward interesting way, with no unnecessary sub plots or distractions and a tour de force of a storyline with a super climax. Its over 50 years since the movie was released, and what a pity so many of today's films cannot compare to this one:10/10",10,2,3,7 January 2012

Being John Malkovich," Being Brilliant!
","This is a brilliantly original movie. Virtually hilarious throughout with numerous memorable quotes(see the IMDb listing though they appear to have missed one of my favorite's...'the 'I' comes before 'U' ' one).The writer, film-makers, and actors all deserve top honors for contributing to a masterpiece of black comedy especially in my view the actress playing Maxine,who simply sizzles.The genius of this film is that the more preposterous the plot the more absorbing it becomes. Many reviewers have in essence interpreted this film as what it is like to have ones' 15 minutes of fame; I view this film as examining with great hum-our the concept of 'being'-played for and with maximum laughs. And in my opinion the strength of the picture lies in its' uncanny ability to examine that concept with an array of compellingly super characters. This is a 'feel-good' film.

Dunkirk," Re-writing History
",The cinematography and direction of this movie is excellent and for that reason at least it is worth viewing.However my understanding of the real events of Dunkirk and the truth about it was that it represented a retreat and a disaster.Yet the film puts a positive 'spin' on what really happened.Furthermore: there are many people in the world who are unaware of the history of the real Dunkirk and for much of this picture the events come across-to me at least- as muddled and confused.For the above and other reasons the best I can do is 6 and a half which after anxious consideration I round down to:6/10.,6,8,15,23 July 2017
Pearl Harbor," Lest We Forget........
","A magnificantly produced and directed film, highly recommended to see especially on DVD.It is a fact that in 1941 a attack was launched on the US base of Pearl Harbor, and this film correctly in my view portrays the surprise nature of that reality. Interwoven into the history of that attack is the story of the friendship and ultimate love and sacrifice between two boyhood friends. I find this picture compelling and brilliant and am mystified why so many 'critics' thought otherwise. Done with more gusto, enthusiasm and style than Titanic all the characters come across as interesting human beings and giving, as appropriate, humourous or dramatic performances. And the violent scenes are spectacularly good though horrific.Where this film rates so highly in my respectful view is that it can stand alone as explaining the surprise nature of what is Pearl Harbor, independent from the love story and vice versa. Further, the crux of this movie in post September 11 retrospect is about the failure of intelligence, or perhaps the failure to heed intelligence reports. Well done to the film-makers, please ignore the critics, you have a 10 out of 10 from me!!! -rbrb.",10,7,13,27 May 2002
The Conjuring 2," This is NOT a true story: but pretends to be one!
","If I were to rate this movie on the basis of its' scariness and watch ability, then I can happily give it around 7-8 as my vote. Unfortunately by the credits both at the beginning and end of the film the makers of it are trying to 'con' viewers into believing that the events in the movie are true:Not correct. The picture tries to suggest the story is based on true events occurring in London in the the 1970's know as the 'Enfield Poltergeist'. A child/children of a household claimed to be demonically possessed attracting widespread publicity. However in real life the evidence ultimately led to the conclusion that it was all a hoax. Any one can do a little research on the internet to discover the true events.If the film makers had produced a story exposing the lies of the hoaxers then they would have done a good job in film making and truth telling. But purely to sell tickets they have produced one big lie and totally fictionalized what really happened under the pretense that it is fact.Therefore I deduct 3 points from my vote and rate this movie:5/10.",5,1,7,11 June 2016
Jackie," Diary of a Housewife
",Most of this movie is hard work as it is slow paced and humorless. The film is meant to show the hours immediately after the Kennedy assassination with events involving the President's wife: Jackie Kennedy. The way Jackie is portrayed rightly or wrongly suggests a neurotic dizzy Queen who is miffed at losing her Crown to laud over 'Camelot'. She comes across as an annoying selfish person. No wonder her husband had many affairs.....! This picture tries to martyr Jackie. Yet she got over the President by marrying a Greek shipping Tycoon and she took the name: Jackie Onassis. The film is mostly dull and is lucky to get from me:4/10.,4,1,2,26 May 2017
A Quiet Place," 'Plan 9 From Outer Space': Updated!
","A family are in desperate survival mode as alien creatures have taken over the earth and any loud noise causes the monsters to attack what is left of humanity.
Sound stupid?
 Yes it certainly is, and the theme in this picture is mostly unoriginal and the baddies just up-dated clones from other sci-fi pics..
Despite this movie being science fiction it could have been so much better if the story line had some ingenuity, yet as it stands the whole crux of the play is totally ludicrous.
A great pity as the acting is first class, the direction and design excellent and plenty of super music.
Had there been even just a marginally credible premise, then I could of awarded maybe up to 8 and a half, but as it is, the best I can do is:6/10.",6,5,12,6 April 2018
The Illusionist," Mystical Fairy Tale.......
","An artistic magical movie for sure. Feels and looks like a fairy tale. Super direction, cinematography, artwork, costumes, locations, music and set in turn of the century Vienna with a seemingly realistic ambiance to match. This is a love story; think of the aura like that of a Sleeping Beauty yarn; but here we have a humble artisans' son, our hero, falling in love with a Princess; a love that can never be,or can it, but years later, he an accomplished magician, she now in the clutches of a want-to-be wicked Tsar. Can magic win back our hero's love? Can Romeo save his Juliet from the castle turret?! Brilliant performance from all the cast in particular the four main leads; indeed the wicked one and the police inspector even upstage the lovers with their superstar show.This is a top class production:8/10",8,2,2,18 February 2008
Children of Men," $76 Million to make this Pile of Garbage
","Unbelievable that people and film reviewers can actually be conned into believing, or try to con us to believe, this is a decent film.The story is nonsense and the actors are total hams.The plot, so called, is set in future Britain where after some kind of holocaust the hero of the film has to save the only mother with a child left in the world. To save from exactly whom and why we are never really told.So we basically have sight of acres of slum Britain which in fact ain't the future but is the current state of most of the place now thanks to the likes of Thatcher and Blair. Don't believe what you see in tourist brochures as the country has a vast underclass exploited by a minority. And ruined by the lax immigration system and high taxation.Much of the film shows people running around rubbish dumps,with explosions going off and considering the budget for the movie is given as 76,000,000 US dollars, well someone has more money than sense.The actress playing the pregnant woman is an amateur or gives that impression and the performance by Michale Caine as an aged Hippie is total farce.

What a complete mess. Wholly confusing the grossly and ridiculously over-rated director/writer opens this flick with about 5 or 6 totally different scenes or scenarios,which are ludicrous, confusing and utter nonsense, devoid of reality or any interest. I have no idea what this 'movie' is about, nor do I want to.

Big Fish," *Imagine Your Own Reality*
","Very interesting movie.A boy in childhood and growing up is told stories and tales by his father as factual events experienced by the father in his life.The stories involve a witch, a giant and a mermaid amongst other things.Now in adulthood the boy believes these stories are 'tall tales'(hence Big Fish) and seeks to discover from his ailing father the truth rather than the fantasy.Now, on one level this film could be said to be very silly; on another level, very profound.Often people who make up false stories as part of their own lives are irritating and obnoxious. They are frequently con artists, sales people, charlatans, lonely individuals or those leading a Walter Mitty existence. And such persons often do more harm than good.However: What if our lives and that of those around us can be improved by the dreams and imagination of others? Who is to say that the product of our dreams and unlimited imagination cannot be considered as real as anything else? And if enough people believe something is true, it can become part of reality.This is a thought provoking film which is entertaining, deserving to be highly rated.",Null,1,2,2 January 2005
The Insider," Revealing the Truth....Nazis of the New Millennium....
","A distinguished professional film reviewer from Chicago says this movie was more impressive than 'All the Presidents Men' as Watergate did not kill his parents but cigarettes did. This picture is a damning indictment of corporate crime perpetrated on us all... revealing how vested business interests control, determine and decide our lives. A company cigarette executive for whatever motive knows that the 'seven dwarfs'(CEO'S) of the cigarette industry lied about knowing the true effects of smoking and that chemicals are purposely added to cigarettes to cause addiction. The human cost of revealing 'the truth' is graphically illustrated in this brilliant movie, which is superb in every way. The main tenets in this film are true and begs the question how on earth can these drug traffickers(disquised as executives)not only get away with but prosper in their deliberate deceit and intent to harm and kill us all?? The film also importantly shows how these criminals attempt to censure the media from telling the truth. I am one of the millions of victims of cigarette addiction and this film makes it obvious to me that the scale of legalised drug trafficking in this film makes the perpetrators far worse than the Nazi's ever were.That begs the question however why do Governments allow the sale of cigarettes?? My own research knowledge reveals that from now to the year 2025 the equivalent of a shipload of Titanic passengers will die every 7 minutes from the effects of cigarette smoking. This is a 'must see' film ..... for cigarette addicts and everyone......it is 2 hours plus of intense and compelling drama....horrifyingly based on the truth.....10 out of 10.",10,0,0,24 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Pretentious Nonsense
","I have 'watched' or sat through this film more than once. Goodness knows why. As at one of the same time it is exceedingly annoying yet also slightly mesmerizing but only because of its pretentiousness.There are some good special effects, but then again a lot of the fashion is very much 1960's , when the movie was made.In essence the story is about some strange objects found on earth, 'monoliths' and a space ship which is sent to investigate. These 'monoliths' -so the picture nonsensically suggests- were on earth when man was still evolving from monkeys and (I later researched) the film suggests these monoliths influenced mankinds development. But that conclusion was not made at all clear in the film.On the spaceship there is an onboard computer, called 'Hal' who turns 'rogue' for no apparent reason. Again only after doing some research I learn that the computer went crazy because it could not take being forced to lie to the crew. And/or Hal's behavior shows how we are relying too much on machines, etc.Then after quite a lot of tedium in the film the main character a spaceman endures some type of psychedelic journey(note this movie was made in the 1960's) when those 'trips' were all the rage. He finds himself in a old fashioned bedroom, going through all sorts of transformations of himself until he becomes a fetus headed for earth.It is this last scene which is the worst failing of the film. As no way can or could the normal viewer have any idea what is meant to be happening. Seems the answer is-wait for it- that the spaceman has been captured by aliens and is going through some type of metamorphosis, only known to the aliens in its purpose. Blah, blah, blah.Despite some decent effects, music, production designs, et al the film is a total mess. Whatever the maker has said trying to justify this film, the whole thing looks like it was made up as it went along. The film maker believes he knows what the film is about but instead of conveying that to the viewer he causes them to be totally confused by a failure to communicate his vision properly or at all.And the movie is pretentious in the extreme and shame on all those people who claim this is some type of 'masterpiece' . The story itself is wholly ludicrous and only because of a few redeeming features can I award just above the minimum vote:2/10.",2,11,19,20 July 2014

","This is a compelling biopic-thriller. A government employee, Edward Snowden, with computer expertise decides to leak information to the public that illegal invasion of privacy is being committed against millions of people by his employers. Based on actual events. The movie is made from the point of view of Snowden, portraying him as a saint and not a sinner. Maybe the picture is accurate. In real life many of those who are appalled by the hero worship of Snowden try to say he is a traitor and leaked information that caused great damage. As the subject of this film is so topical and current, maybe the detractors can make a similarly engrossing movie showing the actual harm done by Snowden's leaks. Until they do that, and do it convincingly, then many will be persuaded that Snowden deserves praise and not punishment. Super film!8/10.",8,1,2,16 April 2017

Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes Wide Open....a New Ink-Spot Test...
","This is a thought provoking film, justifiably erotic with excellent cinematography, haunting music, great costumes, and very artistic direction. The story examines the relationship between a married couple over a few days and the sexual angst between them. This movie will be the subject no doubt of endless showings at film festivals as it is easy to read into or interpret from this film all sorts of hidden meanings and subtleties which the now deceased director is famous for notable 2001....a space odyssey......hence do we have here a sexual odyssey?? The best part of the whole film is the costume party...brilliant in every way. I must confess however after the film was over I read many reviews about the film as I was having some difficulty in deciding what if any 'meaning' was being made by the film-makers....assuming they know  that themselves.(I am still waiting to learn what the aforementioned 2001 was really about). From the reviews i read all sorts of fruedian and other interpretations were espoused including a lot of pscho-babble. Anyhow, my main criticism about the film...and perhaps only criticism is that the 2 main male actors were mis-cast. Tom Cruise was out of his depth playing this role.....he never gave the impression of being a doctor in his ill-fitting suits...and looked more like a cocktail waitor.. and Sydney Pollack was unconvincing and almost half-hearted.(Jack Nicholson would have been superb in either of these two roles).Despite the criticism this film is still in the Master-Class league for its sheer power and richly textured intensity. Keeping my eyes wide open though and giving my own interpretation of this film(which I hope is uninfluenced by the reviews I read....this may be a spoiler...so its only for those who have already seen the film)....I reckon the wife 'set-up' the husband to teach him a lesson for his philandering...and so with the help of the Hungarian dancer at the start of the film used the costume party etc to keep 'hubbie'faithful....hence the mask on the pillow near the end of the film..... Well anyway thats how I read the film before seeing the other reviews but rather like an ink-spot test what makes this movie compelling is that it analyses the viewer more than the viewed.",Null,0,0,13 August 2000

All the actors are atrocious especially the female lead who thinks she is something special which makes her performance even more excruciatingly abysmal. The story: Horrible things are 'happening' in one part of the States. Is it a terrorist attack? Perhaps some kind of nuclear fallout? Or is the environment fighting back against man? The idea of this picture might be good but it is totally ruined by a clueless idiotic production, direction, script and cast.

OK the film is intense with good battle scenes.....but the attempt to disguise this movie as truth is laughable. The essence of the picture is about 2 snipers battling it out for supremacy...one Russian and the other German at Stalingrad. Now.... what really irks me is that most of the lead actors have accents and mannerisms which are totally regional(south London circa 1980's at that) which from my perspective makes viewing this movie even more difficult as I am meant to be watching Russians in the 1940's! Ed Harris is the German Officer...Ed Harris you ask?....A fine actor normally but he is 100% Yank(and it shows)....and the really hilarious sight is to see Bob Hoskins with added nose as  Krushchev.....oh dear.....its all completely over the top with blazing eyes, cockney voice and market trader mentality....at least dear old Bob has now taken over from Donald Pleasance as the Greatest Living Ham..... The film is further ruined for me by silly sub-plots such as Joseph Fiennes re-doing his role...though this time its' Shakespeare-in-Hate...and so all in all a 3 out of 10 is generous.",3,2,5,22 April 2001

War of the Worlds," A 130 million + budget...but still not right!
","The good news is that this movie is worth a look and is watchable. In brief this is a science fiction film, and the earth is invaded by aliens intent on destroying the world or whatever.... The story centers on a family's struggle to survive the alien invasion and the adventures encountered when the lead character tries to take his two children away from the 'monsters' and back to their mother who is in another part of the country. And sensible of the film makers to concentrate on 'ordinary people' caught up in this rather than upon politicians, military leaders etc.The special effects are generally very good and it is that what makes the film viewable. However the bad news is: The main players are all obnoxious especially a screeching, screaming girl and too much of the story is taken up by the angst between the family members which I conclude is a reflection of the writers own family problems. And in any event the reason for this invasion is never explained, and the aliens with all their superior strength seem ultimately quite intellectually challenged. I read that the budget for this movie is 130 million dollars up, and its a pity a few bucks could not have been spent on creating some interesting non irritating characters or a half decent storyline.

A young Steve McQueen.And the film-makers show due homage to the U-Tube/mobile phone generation; and a hilarious line in the film re using X-Box must be amongst the best of the worst for an attempted pick up. Mind you the enthusiasm for violence in the play sends completely the wrong message as the injuries and damage which will result from the type of fights shown is never properly dramatized, indeed quite the reverse it is minimized and portrayed erroneously.

Vanilla Sky," Up in the air or down on the ground?
","Its only in the last 10 or 15 minutes of this film that we have an explanation as to what this movie is really all about;( a device which I found in context amateur-ish). Whilst the picture is often entertaining, it is confusing and uneven in parts and I had the impression that much of the film was made up as it went along even though at the end that was unlikely to be the case but that was the impression given to me. On the plus side....nice music, good special effects though the Spanish actress seem to be there more for her looks than talent. It is true that as the story unfold various 'clues' are given as to where the plot is going but unlike for instance Matrix which can be said to be in the classic category, Vanilla Sky is a victim of its own confusion and that dilutes much of what ought to be a thought provoking theme. Take a look at that normally articulate and erudite film reviewer Roger Ebert's comments who had to see the film twice and even then his review sounds like he was finding it difficult to make head or tail of it!

Iron Man," Comic Mentality
","The special effects in this picture are good but not much else worth saying that about this movie. It is made for people with juvenile minds or for those who take comfort in reading comics. The plot so called is about a super rich and clever arms' dealer who decides that he will create an iron 'superman' to fight what he perceives to be injustice. Where this movie errs badly it is pure and ridiculous science fantasy yet it brings in real life war torn Afghanistan and starts preaching politics and other self interested propaganda. The lead actor and actress are totally miscast and are wholly unconvincing; she thinks by just posing she is putting in a decent performance which she does not, and he is no hero and neither acts nor looks the part. The film is far too long. 3/10",3,4,9,14 May 2008
The Greatest Showman," One of the best musicals of the modern era
","Super songs, music, dancing and chorography!
Inspired by the real life PT Barnum, Hugh Jackman plays the great showman who specializes in finding 'freaks' to fill seats.
Hugh Jackman must be the best screen if not stage performer currently alive though in this movie the likes of the cast members :
Keala Settle (Bearded Lady), Sam Humphrey (Tom Thumb) and Zendaya (trapeze and sizzling) have such charisma, they more or less steal the show.
Some critics hate this picture yet in the same way as they flocked to the real PT Barnum, the public will love it as I did!9/10.",9,1,3,6 January 2018
Live Free or Die Hard," Breathless Show!
","Very Good!Highly entertaining action cum drama/comedy and the 4th in a famous series. First rate special effects where the hero cop is called in to tackle some nasty 'baddies' in their plot to destroy America via the internet. All the actors give convincing whole hearted performances, some interesting geeks on display especially the one played by Justin Long who has super screen presence and charisma. Bruce Willis seems made for the lead in these kind of films. The picture is full of high tech stuff and plenty of car chases etc too. Thus the real winner in the movie is the action which rattles along for about 2 hours with hardly a pause for breath.8/10.",8,0,1,18 September 2008
The Sixth Sense," Excellent.....superbly eerie and thought provoking.
",No wonder this film was the peoples choice winner.....American Beauty is really high class but this picture is a work of pure art. Virtually every moment of the film is spooky and I for one have never felt so many tingles in my back.....indeed after watching this movie on video I double checked that all the doors were locked in my home(not that that will save me)......the biggest star in the movie is of course the child actor....and the actress playing his mum is a close second. The director ought to have won the Oscar as he has this uncanny knack of making ever scene in the film filled with tension and anticipation and the climax is brilliant.... What ought to be a lesson to all other film-makers is that both in the direction and writing the movie is not overdone and in many scenes slightly under-stated giving an air of reality and realism to this scary and thought provoking masterpiece.,Null,0,0,1 May 2000
Heat," Fooling some of the people all of the time......
","I lasted about 90 minutes before turning off this nonsense.What had the makings of a decent cops and robbers film is totally ruined by too much talking, multiple sub plots, and a storyline I was unable to follow.It really ought to be perfectly possible with a decent cast to give us a semi believable and exciting story about robbers being pursued by cops, right? Wrong: What we get is being exposed to the exceedingly soap opera-ish private life of some of the main characters in this film. Boring, boring boring. This movie bears little resemblance to real life and is unrealistic. The picture goes on far too long. I would think it runs into thousands the times we get films about policemen who have families who resent the irregular hours the cop works and the difficulties their jobs cause to their home life etc etc and blah, blah, blah. Who cares.....as most people watch movies to be entertained and not to have to be tortured in viewing the tedious domestic lives of others. Incidentally: A good way to know if a movie is worth watching is to see what the critic Roger Ebert says about it. As a general rule if he raves over a film, then usually it ain't worth seeing. If he says its' not his taste, then take a look!1/10",1,15,45,19 November 2011
Cube," Classically Cubed
","This is a philosophical/science-fiction masterpiece.Intense, compelling and claustrophobic, this movie is hypnotic throughout. A group of individuals are mysteriously ensnared in a deathtrap cube wherein to escape primal instincts and human emotions are examined and tested to the limit..and perhaps beyond.The plot and the characters of this film could be viewed as questioning the unanswered questions of the purpose and existence of humankind; are we mortal or immortal? do we have a better 'world' to escape too? does indeed our lives or existence have a purpose?This is a superb drama of human existence and emotions and relationships deserving the highest recommendation as a film..raising it to an art form. I for one was mesmerised throughout this 'classic'.",10,0,1,18 December 2000
Spectre," Saving you from THIS 'James Bond'!
","Apart from the first 10 minutes including the opening sequence this movie is dreary, predictable and boring.The James Bond franchise is so famous and popular it is a disgrace that the film makers in my opinion have totally failed to live up to the standards expected of both the James Bond character and a James Bond movie.James Bond in the movies is historically known as a clever charismatic womanizing spy; he plays with glorious gadgets and glamorous women whilst saving the world. But the James Bond in this movie is an introverted bland subdued character with none of the attributes of either the likes of Sean Connery or Roger Moore etc.Throughout the movie Daniel Craig looks bored and simply going through the motions. A blue eyed man in a well cut suit is nothing if he ain't interesting. And the rest of the cast are just as banal, including the main baddie who is tame and pathetic.The story focuses on Bond trying to avenge his previous now deceased boss.The only reason I can give this movie 3 out of 10 is: i) The Sam Smith song that opens the film; ii) a spectacular sequence at the start of the movie; iii) the lead female who has a normal figure, and does not look like she is under fed.I am so disappointed. We expect James Bond to save our world, instead I write here to save you from THIS Jame Bond.3/10.",3,10,22,8 November 2015
Sully," A Real Hero....vs. little paper pushing people......
","This movie is engrossing and deserves a high vote.It is based on true events, when a passenger plane needed to make an emergency landing in a city lake. Without doubt the hero of the event was the planes captain.Believe it or not there are a lot of people especially world wide who never heard of the events portrayed in the movie as at the time it was a sensation all over the planet.At first I was puzzled as to why the movie makers instead of putting the attempted plane landing at the center of the picture, concentrated on the awful bureaucrats from the airline safety board who were it seems trying perhaps unfairly to find the captain at fault.However my research suggests that from the perspective of both the captain and co-pilot they felt they were being investigated in such a way that if they could be blamed for what happened, they would be; hence the movie takes the point of view of the captain and co-pilot.Both the attempted landing and the investigation are certainly compelling viewing.The lead actor gives a fine yet restrained performance.Even if the decision to land on the lake was not the only alternative the captain is a Real Hero.All in all, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded up so:8/10.",8,1,2,9 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Downhill and boring after the first few minutes.....
","Most of this movie is muddled, unconvincing with a cast of plain uninteresting performers. Many of whom look like each other.Near the start of the film not only did I lose interest in it but was unable to understand what on earth (or rather in the heavens) this poor picture was all about. It was only after viewing it that I was told and read about the film and then it started to make a little sense.The story is meant to show events prior to those depicted in the original 'Alien' film.In brief, a synthetic human is really out to get the human race.Nothing memorable in the flick, deserving only 1 and a half rounded up as the opening sequence is the highlight:2/10.",2,15,30,19 May 2017
The Fighter," Drama and Redemption In Every Round.......
","Excellent boxing movie this even though the real story are the events and drama outside the ring.The film says it is based on a true story. Boxer Micky Ward is part of an interesting though dysfunctional family who are often quite hilarious; the brother of the boxer is also his trainer, but his own life is spiralling out of control with drugs and crime.Despite the family problems, the boxer,Micky Ward, is attempting to prove himself in the boxing world and his drug addicted brother will either be engulfed by his drug addiction, or maybe he will survive and the question is: can he too redeem himself?This film is engrossing and inspirational.Christian Bale steals the show as the troubled brother, but the entire cast and production is first rate, the music is super, and the boxing scenes are stunning.This movie deserves at least:8/10.",8,0,1,13 October 2012
