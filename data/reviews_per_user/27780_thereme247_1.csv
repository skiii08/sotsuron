Walk the Line," I loved the movie!
","Joaquin and Reese did an amazing job of bringing Johnny and June to life. I had grown up on their music but after seeing their life story it put it all in a new perspective. The ups and downs in their lives kept me riveted to my seat. Even my daughters (who never listened to their music) loved the movie. Joaquin did such an amazing job at singing the songs and you could hear the little quirks in his voice that resembled Johnny. Reese's renditions of June's singing voice was great as well. Even though her voice is a bit higher than June's, she picked up all of the perkiness and giddiness that June put forth. Whoever cast them both in the movie deserves an award.What an amazing and interesting couple they were! I can't wait to purchase it on DVD and also the soundtrack. That foot stomping rhythm in the beginning keeps going through my head. Kudo's to everyone involved in the movie!",10,0,1,30 December 2005
