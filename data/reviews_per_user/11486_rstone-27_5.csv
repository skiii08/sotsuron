Wanted," Fiction - Very good watch
","I've spent some time out of my life reading the ridiculous postings of a very few idiots. Someone that would watch a 'MOVIE', and expect believability in everything you see, must not watch many movies. The very first thing you learn in any course on literature, writing, movie making, story telling etc.. is you 'MUST' suspend the audiences belief behaviors.This being said, this movie is a very good example of just that. They don't pretend for this to be 'From The Real World' or 'Based on a True Story' etc.. they immediately let you 'KNOW' without a shadow of a doubt that your belief in reality 'WILL' be questioned. -- the man jumping from the window, firing and hitting with each shot.... hahahahah... If you like to be entertained, thrilled, to be on the edge of your seat with anticipation... then this is a very good watch for you.I give it a 7 out of 10....(Salute)",Null,3,8,23 December 2008
Twilight," A True Original Tale
","I came about seeing this Movie totally by accident. A friend of mine had just hooked up his 55' Big Screen TV, Suround Sound, and wanted to test it with a great movie --- he found Twilight. Now I'm not much on the movies of Vampires & Werewolves or Zombies, but this one was a very pleasant surprise. Original, captivating, and surprisingly had an intense aura throughout the entire film.I gave this movie a 6 due to the dimness and sometimes jumpy filming, but not due to the content of the film. It is a grade 'A' feature with very outstanding acting from ALL of the actors. I would not hesitate recommending this feature film to anyone. (Highly Recommended)^5's",6,0,4,1 December 2008
Gran Torino," A Movie Worth The Money - Finally!
","Clint Eastwood is a legend in his own time. From Rowdy Yates in Raw hide, to the spaghetti westerns of Italy to the major motion pictures of Hollywood and now he is responsible for producing and directing and starring in movies such as 'Million Dollar Baby', and 'Gran Tarino'.With supporting actors like Bee Vang (Thao Vang Lor) and Ahney Her (Sue Lor) who's acting was superb, together with a touching, yet strong conviction, and emotional story line -- he can't go wrong.Granted, this movie is not for someone wanting to see a gang movie with solid action and shoot-outs. This is basically a scenario that (Could) happen in real life, a drama with impact.If you do not watch this film, you will be depriving yourself of one of this years most touching and inspirational movies to come out of Hollywood. Finally, a movie worth the money.I would give this one a 10 for 10 but I don't give a 1 or a 10 so this rates 9 out of 10.",9,0,4,23 December 2008
Taken," Exceptional
","An excellent, edge of your seat, heart pounding ride leading you from teenage deception to the undeniable love of a parent, this action packed, thrill a minute movie will move you, challenge you, and entertain you.First I was told it was just another action movie with Liam Neeson. Well when you say Liam Neeson, its NOT just another action movie. It WILL have substance, intrigue and be well worth your time.There is very little you can say about this movie without touching on spoilers, so I will just say:Just breathtaking -- A must see!!!!!!!",9,3,8,30 July 2008
