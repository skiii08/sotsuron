The Avengers," The most overrated bad movie of all time
","This movie is retarded. Humanity must have seriously degraded if people consider this piece of crap the best of the best in cinema. I can't believe this movie is just two points away from the same rating for scarface. That movie was awesome, not this piece of crap. I think the movie order should go like this; #1 The Godfather, #2 Scarface, #3 Star Wars Episode VI Return Of The Jedi, #4 Alien, #5 Titanic. Those movies are legendary, but this movie? This movie is no where near legendary. I would rate this movie a zero but since i can't pick that i guess i'll go with one star. This movie has the most predictable plot ever, to sum it up it goes like this; bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, the end. The dialogue is some of the corniest crap in film history. Batman And Robin was corny and stupid, but at least it was tolerable with Arnold's witty one-liners. The scenes that were supposed to be funny made me gag and the scenes that were supposed to be serious made me burst out laughing at how stupid they were. Seriously, the stupidity never ends; from iron man fighting thor for absolutely no reason, to nick fury shooting a plane carrying an atomic bomb....with a bazooka. The plane is carrying an atomic bomb and your idea to stop it is to shoot it? Seriously?!!!???!? Don't watch this movie it's stupid and if your a huge avengers fan it will be an even bigger disappointment; if you want to watch a good marvel movie watch spider-man 2, that movie deserves an 8.3 rating, not this kid-friendly nonsense.",1,16,48,27 March 2013

","I just got back from the theater and well...it was bad....really, really, bad. I'm not going to give any spoilers because the plot was so weak that there is practically nothing to spoil...yeah, the movie was that bad. The movie lasts for about two hours and there are only three action scenes. The rest of the movie is just bad acting, corny speeches and pointless scenes; for example the sex scene was okay but what made it ridiculous was the music. The music was probably the only good thing about the movie, but sometimes it would do this random drum chorus that sounded retarded, like during the sex scene and the climax. The script written for the actors was awful, i know Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman did there best, but like The Avengers, good actors don't make a good movie, a good movie needs 1) Awesome plot 2) Awesome scripts for actors 3) Good music, and finally 4) Mind-blowing action/scenery. All of those things are important except maybe the last one. This movie has none of those things. There is a bunch of scenery but almost no action at all. I also noticed nothing new, meaning everything was copied from other movies like the matrix, Predator and even some video games like Portal. If this is the best Michael Arndt can come up with then i am sorry to say this but Star Wars is as good as dead. After watching this lame sci-fi flick i have absolutely no expectations for new Star Wars movies. I mean come on, if Phantom Menace was better than this, which it is by the way, then there is no way Disney's Star Wars films are going to top off the prequels. This movie is only good for one thing; to show the world what a terrible writer Michael Arndt is and why Disney should have nothing to do with Star Wars...period",1,25,53,26 April 2013
