United 93," The best movie I have ever watched
","Some may say 'too soon', but i have to disagree with them. This movie does nothing but honor these heroes who gave their life for our country and tells exactly how heartless and cruel these terrorist were that committed these incomprehensible acts against these innocent people and the many more they would have killed had these men and women not stood up against them. It doesn't play up the drama to add more adventure or excitement for the viewers and is told in more of a documentary way. It doesn't have anything politically motivated in it so no matter what your political views are you can watch this movie and leave with love for these people who sacrificed their life for all of us.",10,1,4,31 July 2006
