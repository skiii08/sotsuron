Miracle," Not as much a 'miracle' as it appears; good movie nonetheless
","We've all heard the story: a group of rag-tag college kids bands together, gets in the best shape of their lives, plays as a team while being coached by a genius, and sucker-punches a vastly superior Soviet team that had won dozens of games in a row and routed them 10-3 in an exhibition prior to the Olympics (no doubt Brooks wanted it that way so they'd be motivated for the real games and maybe lull the Soviets into a false sense of security).The movie is well done, but it ignores what really happened: a group of future NHL players took advantage of their youth to get themselves into superior condition to an aging Soviet team that was ripe for an upset, on American home ice, nonetheless. For example, Ken Morrow, who played for the NY Islanders' four Stanley Cup winning teams from 1980-1984, had been drafted by the Islanders in 1976 but played in college for four years. Mark Pavelich wound up with the Rangers, as did Dave Silk and several other players, including Mark Johnson. Oddly, Jim Craig had a terrible career in the NHL, where his weak play outside the crease was exploited to the point of finishing him. Still, this was a great performance by a great team that was captured in what was almost a great film (a great film would have spent more time deconstructing the hidden talent this team had). It should also be noted that Herb Brooks coached the NY Rangers in the early 1980s, and never came close to defeating the Islanders, so either he wasn't as much a factor as we thought, or the 1980 Islanders were superior to the Soviets.The movie begins with a 'retrospective' of America's string of humiliation in the 1970s: the oil embargo and gas lines, the hostage crisis, 'Russians in Afghanistan,' and the general 'malaise' that was prevalent the US at that time. It also portrays the desperate state of US Hockey on the international stage, as no one expected anything from the 1980 team, except maybe winning a few games in the early rounds and avoiding humiliation. Herb Brooks is hired to coach the team, and immediately becomes its dictator, refusing input from the people who hired him and saying simply, 'You hired me to do a job, and I'm trying to do it.' That was easily the best line of the movie.Brooks is shown to be a brutal taskmaster more typically associated with Soviet than American hockey. He believed that to beat the Russians, the Americans would have to train like them and even surpass them. Just as Bobby Fischer showed that motivated Americans can defeat the 'Russian system' in chess, Brooks applies a Fischer-like work ethic to mold his team into an international hockey force, having chosen his players based on what they could do on their best day rather than their average or worst, and then doing everything he could to get them to peak at the right time. He pulls off the mission, as we all know, but the real story is how he does it. To this extent, the movie is one of the best ever done in that it shows how to beat the best at their own game. A nice little foreshadowing occurs when Brooks tells Johnson that 'that coast-to-coast stuff won't work against the teams we'll be playing,' yet it wound up being what kept Team USA in the game.This was a story that had to be told, a movie that had to be made, and the job was done well enough to make this movie a must-see.",8,0,0,30 August 2005
Wayne's World," Time capsule material proves need for 'best scene' Oscar
","Ask most men within a decade of my age in either direction to list the 100 best movie scenes of all time, and the scene from 'Wayne's World' where they sing/lip sync Bohemian Rhapsody in the car will be on more lists than not. It might even make every list. Not designed for the 'critically acclaimed' snob set, Wayne's World, the film adaptation of the extremely popular Saturday Night Live skit by the same name, targets its audience perfectly and never even enters the water, let alone jumps any sharks. The movie is true to itself from start to finish.The bedrock of the film, as well as the skit, is the unbending friendship of Wayne and Garth. Most children have one best friend who stands out above all others, and there's no mistaking that Wayne (SNL alum Mike Myers) and Garth (SNL alum Dana Carvey) have that type of friendship. The best friends host a cable access show in Aurora, Illinois, also sharing the skit's title. Other SNL alums, such as Brian Doyle-Murray (Noah) and Chris Farley (a concert security guard), round out the cast.The plot centers around an opportunistic television producer named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe), who, with funding from an arcade owner, turns Wayne's World into a slickly produced national show, causing it to lose touch with its audience, and causing friction between Wayne and Garth, who feel they have sold out their fans and their roots. A love interest is tossed to Wayne in the form of Cassandra (Tia Carerre), in triangular form due to the attention paid to her by Kane as well as Wayne.The pop-culture cuisinart responsible for most of the SNL skits was working in overdrive in this film, and that's a good thing. Everything from product placements, to gratuitous sex, to lame plot devices were lampooned. Rob Lowe was excellent as the sleazeball junior television executive, while cameos abound from the rock world, including Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf. Though not publicized as much as the other quotables from the movie, my personal favorite scene was when Wayne and Garth were each laying on parked cars, and Garth starts whistling the closing theme from Star Trek.SNL-based movies have been hit-or-miss since their inception, but this was unquestionably a hit.",10,45,53,13 October 2006
Two for the Money," The lock of the year for the sports betting fan
","We all know the sales pitches: some guy with a 900 number tells you he's hitting 82 percent on the year, and you can have his picks for this weekend for one 'low' price (compared to what you win!). He'll even give you a free game to get you started, and if that game doesn't win, he'll call the guy he gave the other side to and sign him up instead.Two For The Money sanitized the sports **touting** industry (what this film is really about), and it glorified, by portraying as successful, what is at best a guy who had a winning year or two, something bound to happen when your phone banks have fifty guys.This film is based on a very true story, with the names and backstories only slightly changed. The 'quarterback' Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughy) is based on someone certainly never known much as one, but who may have played the game. Not that this matters, as your tout customers don't care about your life story, only if you can win for them, and Lang delivers through his Vegas-based 900 number.New York tout king Walter Abrams, played in deliciously over-the-top fashion by Al Pacino, brings the over-the-top nature of the industry to life, not only the touts who make misleading claims (13-2 the last 15 means nothing and they don't tell you about the 2-13), but also the customers who demand the moon of guaranteed riches for a small fee. Renee Russo (Toni) gives her usually lame performance, like a double-digit NFL favorite mailing in a last-minute field goal to win.As a 'public handicapper' (I do horses and I make no guarantees), I quickly found the film engaging, particularly its correct focus on how Lang handles the pressure of risking other people's money through his picks. Scam artist or not, any tout always wants his clients to win, because they will gladly pay him well and he'll know he's earned it. It's when the bad times come that the tout's world becomes a living hell, knowing he just sent his followers into the poorhouse, even though that's because they were risking too much to begin with.The other theme in the film is how Walter Abrams is always looking ahead to next Sunday as if he were just dropped out of the womb and nothing bad had ever happened to him. He knows that even the guys who curse him out will send him money again, and he will win again, sometimes, someday, hopefully, and at 1;00 every Sunday in the fall, the circus will start anew with him front and center, his business acumen saving him from his darker and more expensive urges. Sure, he's living on the edge, but he wouldn't have it any other way, because more than anything else, Walter Abrams was addicted to the thrills, while Brandon Lang was just looking for a job. The contrast is phenomenal and striking.",10,0,2,15 September 2007
Lords of Dogtown," Death of a Documentary and a pre-porn Nikki Reed
","That sums up the two things I took from this movie: 1. It ruined one of the best documentaries of all time (Dogtown and Z-Boys); and 2. Nikki Reed, now 18, could become the biggest porn star of all time if she chooses to go that route.Unfortunately, #1 can't be undone, and #2 probably never will be done. That leaves very few positives from a movie that would have been tolerable without the documentary, but anyone who saw the precursor to this film would have a difficult time appreciating the good points of the story, and there were actually a few.The real story of this film is how a group of brash, young skaters from Dogtown turned the world upside down by adapting surf moves to the pavement, giving birth to what would become extreme sports and the x-games. This is definitely a story worth telling, as it's not the only time a 'pod' has yielded several individuals (in this case, Peralta, Alva and company) who take over an industry. It's happened before (such as with the British invasion in music in the 1960s), and it's happened since (such as with rap from the Bronx in the 1970s, or grunge rock from Seattle in the early 1990s). Whenever a 'pod' explodes, it's noteworthy and historically relevant. The Z-boys were one such pod.That said, the movie absolutely, positively, sucked. Which one was Heath Ledger? Oh yeah, Skip, the shop guru. None of the actors really stand out, the skating scenes sucked (I did better tricks on my 'Hang Ten' skateboard as a kid than what I saw in the film), and Nikki Reed looking like she struck oil whenever she meets one of these badboys is about the only genuine performance, given the grown-up wild-child's penchant for sexual adventure. She definitely scorches the camera in this one, and according to IMDb.com, the 'thirteen' star is now a barely-legal eighteen, though she was seventeen when this came out and probably sixteen when it was made.If there's one story the film did tell, it's what it feels like to be normal among your friends and a total revolutionary to anyone watching you. Having experienced this somewhat myself (I was in a 'pod' that changed a different world not long ago), I can relate to the main characters in the film, guys who just did what they loved doing, who never really cared about doing anything other than what they loved to do, but who in the process became a social phenomenon of historical importance. It's not like these kids thought they were doing anything other than skating in some empty pools, feeding off the wealthy like the parasites they were, on the fringes of the law, but living a life far more interesting than money could ever buy.Memo to Nikki Reed: do porn. It's your calling.",10,1,8,14 August 2006
Spider-Man 2," A great story with an even greater movie
","Blockbuster summer movies always carry with them a 'harder they fall' risk. Fortunately, this movie avoids that trap, and is one of the most visually compelling action movies of all time. That it has a plot which could survive without the special effects only makes it that much more compelling.The movie begins a few years after the last one ends, with Peter Parker, ever-troubled super-hero, unsuccessfully attempts to juggle his studies, some throwaway jobs, and his duties as a superhero. Spidey may be a superhero, but he's also human (one major appeal of Spiderman in general is the scientific basis for how the heroes and villains got their powers), and never is this more apparent as in the beginning of the movie, when his life comes apart at the wheels. Something has to give, so Peter decides to sell Spidey's costume to J. Jonah Jameson (the Spidey-hating, uber-thrifty editor of the Bugle)for some walkaround money. The custome becomes a trophy for Jameson, who gloats over running Spidey out of NYC in his paper. J.K. Simmons turns in the best performance of the movie if one considers just how well he brought the one-dimensional Jonah to life.After Spidey (Toby MacGuire) quits, of course, a supervillain arrives on the scene to drag him out of retirement. 'Doc Ock,' as he is called, winds up with four metallic tentacles (arms) attached to his body that do his evil bidding after his experiment for 'perpetual fusion' (read: cheap electricity) goes wrong and begins sucking the world into its reactor (the way the sun would). With no more funding from Harry Osborne to get the 'Tridium' (what makes the reactor run), the Doc decides to do whatever it takes to continue his work: that means getting more Tridium from Harry, but to do this, Harry makes a deal that he will only trade it for Spiderman.Spiderman presents himself for the battle, but his powers have been on the fritz, and begin letting him down in some painful ways (such as in midair, when his webbing no longer works). Peter Parker (Spidey's alter ego) even consults a doctor and frames the problem as a dream, and is told that Spidey's problem is more likely stress and exhaustion. This is underscored by his powers still partially working, and it is established that Spidey just needs to find his groove again. With Doc Ock wreaking havoc, and with MJ (Kirsten Dunst) moving on with her life, and with his financial difficulties, this is not going to be easy.Peter tries to adjust to life as a normal civilian, but every time he witnesses a crime, he hears duty calling, and he can't break from the past. Compounding his difficulty is that while he was 'on break' from being Spidey, Peter misled MJ into thinking he had changed, which only furthers the rift between the two (MJ is set to marry Jonah's hunky astronaut son). Needless to say, we get a climax, a native's-eye view of New Yorkers (including one very ungrateful man on a runaway subway car who derides Peter's attempt to stop it), and some very touching scenes involving Aunt Mae, who shows that when called upon, even she can fight the bad guys effectively.This movie excels in the same way as the entire Spiderman series: Peter Parker is so much like most of us that we actually could see ourselves doing what he does, and he also shows that having Superpowers, while not entirely a curse, definitely do not solve one's life problems. In fact, the only time Parker is decisive and without doubt is when he is in costume, and the only uncertainty he feels about that is part of the larger issue of whether or not he is harming himself by saving the world. The moral dilemma is common among activists in that they routinely have to sacrifice personal gains for the greater good, leaving them with the feeling that when they were invited to life's party by God, they were handed a broom and told to clean up the mess created by everyone's fun.Normally it would be a negative to say that the actors portrayed their characters as if they were from the comics, but since this movie is based on the comics, that is yet another plus. Dunst is particularly adept at bringing MJ to life in this way: she really acts as if she were hurtled into this universe from the pages of a cartoon. One would have to have lived in NYC for a long time to appreciate the subtlety with which the city is brought to life. New Yorkers are portrayed in the movie as selfish and into themselves, but also able to rise to the occasion when required to, showing a level of humanity and compassion that can only be understood by natives. On the train, Peter loses his mask in the course of saving everyone, and it is clearly understood that despite the large size of the crowd who has now seen Spidey, that no one will ever breach his confidence. This is New York at its best. I also love the way the movie didn't rename New York, and instead embraced the city rather than alluding to it. Without this characteristic, the movie would have been far less entertaining. One minor part of the film served a double purpose, as it showcased a NYC street musician who happened to be playing the old Spidey theme from the TV cartoons on her violin.Not only is this movie a 'must see,' but it is a must-see even in a group of a dozen other 'must see' films. If there is anyone out there who doesn't like this movie, I'd be interested in hearing why. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would finish watching this movie and feel like the time and money spent were not worth it.",10,1,2,6 June 2005
Finding Nemo," A cut above....way above
","I saw Monsters, Inc. and thought it was a good film, but the animation and plot were a predictable technological evolution to the old Saturday morning cartoons. I couldn't bear Toy Story or A Bug's Life, so I'm definitely not a fan of the Pixar style, but this film transcends its genre and is one of the all-time classics, animated or not. All that is required for an incredible viewing experience is the suspension of a few minor disbeliefs: fish can't talk, and their eyes are on the sides of their heads (not their foreheads). That said, we have a nearly perfect film in that it couldn't have easily been improved upon.Before I continue, let me give credit to what makes this film perfect rather than merely great: ELLEN DEGENERIS. She should have gotten the Oscar for Best Actress with her portrayal of Dory, a character that could easily have been butchered by a weaker talent. Without her performance, this film is just Monsters, Inc. with better animation and a slightly better plot. Of the other actors, Albert Brooks is predictably competent as Marlin, while Willem DaFoe's jaded Gill is a treat for all ages. The remaining cast was decent, but interchangeable.As for the plot, it's simple: Marlin and Coral are proud parents of 400 eggs, all but one of whom (along with Coral) are killed in the opening sequence by a shark, which sets the tone of the movie in that we are repeatedly reminded that the Ocean is an underwater jungle. This is also a main strength of the movie in that the other fish in the ocean are portrayed as more than plot devices, and have lives (and goals) of their own, many of which involve putting Marlin (and Dory) in harm's way.The surviving egg, Nemo, is captured by a scuba diver and winds up in a fishtank in a dentist's office with a group of 'POW' fish who are always trying (and failing) to escape. The 'secret world of fish' angle does seem appropriated from Dr. Doolittle 2, but this can be forgiven as necessary for the plot. The story is a coming-of-age one not for Nemo, but for Marlin, whose quest for his lost son distracts him from his normal phobia of the ocean, sending him on an adventure which is inspirational as well as educational. I learned more about the ocean from watching this film than in all of my school years put together! Children under 12 should not watch this movie without an adult, as some of the scenes are downright scary, but this only adds to the realism of the film.",10,2,5,1 August 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," I used to laugh at this film before Katrina
","People forget that Hollywood DRAMATIZES things, and in this case, Hollywood sure didn't forget it, because what we have here is a dramatization of a predicted outcome of current events left unchecked.The political hot-button issue of global warming ensures that this movie will be attacked mercilessly for its technical inaccuracies, yet if we were to hold other films to the same standard, other classics like Star Trek (in which people are BEAMED around the galaxy; who were the guinea pigs?) and The Bad News Bears (a satire of overzealous little league parents in a litigious society) would never have gotten off the ground.The initial criticisms of this film are telling, especially in light of Katrina: a 'superstorm' hits an unprepared America, stranding large amounts of people to the point where even the rescue workers can't locate them, and they are left to fend for themselves in horrible conditions. It might not play out as it did in the movie, but not only is it not nice to fool with Mother Nature, it's not wise to underestimate history's greatest terrorist by far, who can kill millions in an instant.The film itself lends itself to jokes and drinking games. Dennis Quaid stars as Jake Hall, the world's foremost expert on global warming. The subplots center around his relationship with his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhall), an honors student caught in transit from New York City from a debate competition, but fortunately he has Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) to keep him company. Throw in an assortment of stereotypical New Yorkers (type A businessman, street-smart homeless man with dog, know-it-all cops, etc.), and we realize that this is the Big Storm because while the city may never sleep, it might just freeze if it doesn't drown first, thus grinding Manhattan to one of its rare halts. The cast is rounded out by the Washington Bureaucrats who are portrayed typically as well.The death scenes occasionally rival that of any horror movie, especially the Final Destination series, and the movie seems to draw on the theme that 'death' has a design, or is a part of mother nature's design to fix the planet in one fell atmospheric swoop. There is tremendous historical precedent for climate change, but as the scientists point out, such changes takes years or decades rather than weeks. Why this is supposed to comfort me is beyond me, because it almost seems like the quick-kill of this film is better for humanity than the slow torture currently predicted. Is it any easier to adjust to a long-term climate change that will just as surely sink us, possibly without us realizing when we have reached the point of no return? Intelligent folks will see this film as dumbed-down, but who says that is a bad thing when the typical 'dumb' American pays admission? That class of people needs overdramatization before it pays attention to an issue, and even finding the mistakes in the film would be a good exercise for youngsters who otherwise might not take much of an interest in science or global warming.I'll lose patience with films like this when I see other films held to the same standard. However, for as long as people are transported in the Star Trek films, or the Bad News Bears win their lawsuits so they can play out of their league, I'll forgive the scientific inaccuracies of which there are many here, and just enjoy the excellent cinematography and birds-eye view of nature putting humanity in its humble place.'The Century After Tomorrow' just wouldn't have had the same ring to it. The truths in this film which remain after you strip away the impossible and fictitious are most inconvenient and need to be addressed. This movie is as good a starting point as any.",8,0,1,11 May 2007
Blades of Glory," 'The Cutting Edge' as farcical dark comedy
","If you haven't seen The Cutting Edge (a great film and probably the best figure-skating film of all time), or are not a professional figure skater (or someone close to one), you'll miss a lot of subtle humor in this film. As it says in the trivia section, the 'Iron Lotus' trick in the film was based on the Pamchencko from The Cutting Edge, and is in fact the same trick. This parody doesn't stop there, however, as I felt like I was watching an alternate-universe version of The Cutting Edge, written by someone with a penchant for sick-comedy.What makes this parody work is that it parodies both the sport and its inspiration film equally. The bluerint for the two films is almost identical: prima-donna skater (John Heder as Jimmy/'Kate') suffers bad break at the same olympics as nuts-and-bolts skater (Will Farrell as Chazz Michael Michaels/'Doug'). Jimmy's failure causes his overbearing 'father' to disown him, but then, a partner is finally found for the pairs, while Jimmy's crazy coach (Craig T. Nelson as Coach/'Pamchenko') nurses along the love-hate relationship between the two protagonists against an evil pair of sport royalty (the von Waldenbergs/'Peckarovskis').As in The Cutting Edge, the skaters are tempted to sleep with the enemy, in this case 'Katie' von Waldenberg, the sister of the rival team. An evil plot is hatched (this time from the opponents rather than the judges) to keep the leads off the medal podium, and part of stopping the plot is Coach's infamous 'iron lotus' move, which in this movie had been tried once before, with much more predictable and hilarious results. A subtle beauty of this film is that you realize just how much this is based on The Cutting Edge only after you see the iron lotus.Whoever wrote this film either really loves or really hates figure skating, probably a bit of both, but also left no stone unturned int parodying a sport that needs to be parodied, and a film that was way better than the critics ever realized. I would love to have been in the room when D.b. Sweeney and Moira Kelly were watching this film. My guess is they wouldn't have stopped laughing once.What is perhaps most amazing to me is that while I activeily dislike almost every actor in this film, each of them stayed true to the material, allowed it to be the star, nad was bearable in their 'supporting' role. So was the film.",9,1,2,5 April 2008
Lost in Translation," A defining moment for the leads and their characters
","Most slice-of-life movies draw from lives few of us can really relate to. Sure, the protagonists will appear normal enough, have normal jobs, and live a normal life, but rarely do they behave in a truly 'normal' way that rises to what could be an actual slice from an actual life. Lost in Translation does this and more, presenting a snapshot of one of those defining moments we all have, an experience that marks our minds forever while simultaneously changing us. Not only does it do this for the lead characters, but also for the actors who play them.Bill Murray (Bob Harris) plays a caricature of himself: a middle-aged movie star well past his prime, but still a big enough draw to command $2 million for a whiskey advertisement in Japan. Many American movie stars accept endorsement deals abroad but not here to protect their reputations; Harris apparently fits into that class. Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte), plays a similar caricature of herself: a slightly snobbier, well-educated newlywed with a clear intellectual bent that is accentuated by her unique physicality, the type that causes men her age to overlook her while driving older men absolutely insane. Though the film appears written primarily for Murray, it turns out to be the vehicle that catapults Johansson from a merely famous dramatic actress into a historically important one. It will be decades before one can fully appreciate her legacy in this film. In this film, Johansson is what her peers like Gnatalie Portman and Emmy Rossum wish they were and will likely never be. To call her another Hepburn would tell only half the story, because Hepburn was untouchable and for the most part unapproachable; Johansson manages to retain a Hepburn-like class without the pretension, uniting both elitist and populist audiences. She IS that young woman every man in mid-life crisis dreams of crossing paths with.Unfortunately, Director Sofia Coppola made one critical mistake with this film, and that is adding an element of indirect golddigging to the plot by making Murray rich and famous. The older men in the audience will forgive this, and still put themselves in Murray's place, but the film would have worked even better if he was down on his luck and already owed the money he was to earn in Tokyo, leaving him to start over, without money or debt, after 'selling out.' The lack of exploration of these dual financial considerations leaves a gaping hole in the film that leaves us wondering, when there is no need, just how much money and fame it takes to connect on a 'spiritual' level with the ingénue. As enthralling as Charlotte finds Bob, it would have been more convincing if not cushioned by a bed of his money.That said, the plot is stellar, and the casting was perfect. Johansson possesses an intellectual maturity that inevitably leads to boredom with men her own age, including Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribsi), who conveniently ducks away for a photo shoot, foolishly leaving his tagalong wife unattended. Charlotte loves her husband because she is supposed to, but wonders what she is missing, a question Murray spends most of the film answering for her. Bob Harris's marriage runs only on inertia and memories now, but both forces are strong and he is not about to abandon such a history. While stuck in Tokyo, sparks erupt between Bob and Charlotte as the two fit together like lost pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Sex could occur at any time, yet does not occur for the very reasons it should occur: the characters, like the director, have far deeper and more fascinating explorations in store than the mere physical release of sexual tension.The most misused actress in the film was Anna Faris (Kelly), the narcissistic, tabloid-hungry movie starlet who serves primarily as Charlotte's antithesis. Coppola could have explored this character and given her depth, yet chose instead to treat her more like a sitcom sidekick. Faris could also have carried the lead role, even if it's obvious why she wasn't chosen. That was no excuse for leaving her out of almost all of the film, however.The subplots, most of which involve Murray playing the good sport in a foreign land, with tourists and TV hosts, provide good background for the more standardized main plot, which moves in a manner which is predictable yet still fascinating. With the extremely talented leads drawing heavily on their own life experience for their roles, it is not surprising that the result of their efforts was one of the all-time cinema classics, and the defining work for an actor in the sunset of his hall-of-fame prime, and an actress about to enter hers. The feeling was a bit similar to what baseball fans must have experienced in 1951 when Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle were in the outfield for the Yankees.Bill Murray should have gotten his Oscar for this film, but he also should have gotten it for Groundhog Day. The Charlotte-like snobs who comprise the academy couldn't seem to see past Murray's everyman persona and his earlier roles to realize he has evolved into a legitimate romantic male lead. Johansson will get her Oscar(s) in due time, but a case could have been made for her here as well. I would call this her best work, except that would insult her ability to eclipse it, which I'm sure she will, but no matter what she does after this film, this role will be what defines her historically.Any aspiring filmmaker should watch this film at least a dozen times.",9,1,2,25 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil Can't Act
","Films like this, and the people who star in them, should thank their lucky stars someone invented the term 'hater.' The word is a get-out-of-jail free card to anyone who wants to walk over others and not have their victory party interrupted by the noise of those they trampled upon. Like few other films could, this film exposes the hypocrisy not in the fashion industry, but Hollywood itself. It also proves, convincingly, that Meryl Streep is the most overrated actress in the history of the civilized world.Ask Anne Hathaway to do a nude scene, and she'd likely refuse. If she wouldn't, most actresses on her level would refuse. Ask her (or Streep) to play a role that sends the wrong political message about women (say a movie about how to sexually harass women in your office and not get caught), and she might get up on a soapbox and refuse it. After all, actors are such role models, and their films leave such an impression on their audiences. Just ask Geena Davis, who was thrilled to be playing the nation's first female president. Strong, independent women on film send a great message, and the actresses who play them love being the messenger.When you can call everyone you oppress a 'hater,' you can marginalize their statements as sour grapes. You can even call them a hater if they fail to be as happy and enthusiastic about your success as you are, even if yours came at the expense of theirs.That said, would Hathaway revel in the role of a young legal secretary praying she's pretty enough to be hired and dismissing the concerns of the older women she displaced? Is Streep proud that the 20-minute lunch she assigned her assistants violates NY state labor law? Does she like gender discrimination? I guess so, because we all know that actresses won't do things on film if they don't approve of the political message.Ever wonder why young Hollywood actresses are always smiling so much? Aside from needing to send a biological signal that they just might be ready to have sex (gets them ahead), they are happy because they get paid six or seven figures to play around with these 'important political messages.' While they are doing this, and while movies like this are being made, the stories that really need to be told -- the ones about the people left in the wake of narcissistic dimwits like the leads -- are not, because the 'devils' in Hollywood don't want that story told, and they don't hire those who can tell it. Instead, they hire the Emilys and Andies of the world, and in the course of mistreating them, destroy the careers of those who never get in their door because they aren't that slither of the population that is young, female, and attractive. Streep was nothing more than a glorified housemom in this film.Hathaway's 'struggling' young adult female in New York City is about as unrealistic character as exists. A fat girl who grows up in Manhattan without family money will find herself boxed out of the job market by Andie, while a space has been reserved for Andie all along, by the powerful men who want her socializing near them and working for them. To her credit, Hathaway is not one of those young women herself, in that she did not capitalize on gender bias at regular jobs to keep her in the big city long enough to sleep her way to the top. She's acted all her life and is also a Soprano, i.e., a real performing artist. Her performance may stink theatrically, but politically she's the cleanest of the film.Streep's character, Miranda Pristley, must have felt like she was in a kennel with all the scenery being chewed by Streep, whose into-the-wall performance smacked of litte more than her industry-induced narcissism that her 'loo droppings' don't stink. Streep has to be the most annoying actress on- and off-screen of this era. Her character in Defending Your Life is a caricature of the undeserved pedestal the public has placed her on throughout her fourteen Oscar nominations. Those who think Barney is the Devil have good reason, but they're wrong, because Streep is a lot closer than he'll ever be. She takes her paychecks and glory from an industry her characters lampoon. This is like when the media complains about political spending in shows sponsored by high-priced political advertising. Hypocritical.The film is simple enough: Fashion magazine, queen-bee boss (Streep) hires naive assistant (Hathaway), who barely escapes the sharks before becoming one, proves she can survive, and then wonders if she wants the fruits of her struggle. Stereotype the world and present racist, sexist backdrops (did Manhattan turn into South Africa?) without commentary, while pretending to make a meaningful political statement.Message to the people in this film: there are no wealthy victims in this world, and there are no wealthy activists. Lip service changes nothing, but putting injustice on film for 'realism' without showing its ugliness or sparking its eradication is nothing more than profiteering and enabling. But don't worry, anyone who points this out must be a 'hater.' Pristley is Streep's better half, because she's honest about what she is and what she does.",1,11,23,8 July 2007
Grease," Its only flaw is its fatal flaw
","Great story, good cast, timeless themes, good music, and just about everything one could want from a movie or a musical. So what's the problem? Answer: check the birthdates of the actors against when this movie was made.The cast was so far beyond high-school age when this movie was filmed, and it showed. Putting on high-school clothes and acting immature are not enough to wash away this terrible oversight. It's not like there aren't good actors of high-school age, and it's not like most movies don't cast young twentysomethings as high schoolers, but this movie went way too far.Stockard Channing as a sexy 17 year-old? She was THIRTY-THREE when this film was made, and she never was that sexy. Travolta was 23, Olivia Newton-John was 29, and Jeff Conaway was 27. There was plenty of good teen talent around at that age, but I suppose the musical requirements limited their search.The age problem ruins what was otherwise a great movie that should have been entitled: 'Grease: The Left-Back Years.'",1,13,36,6 June 2005
Armageddon," Misfits save the world...again
","It started with 'The Dirty Dozen' and continues to this day: a group of misfits, rejects, outcasts, lowlifes, and undesirables possess a unique skill set required to save humanity from destruction. The situation, as always, elevates the misfits over the mindless bureaucrats who reluctantly have to turn to them.Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller. He is called upon by NASA, in the persona of Billy Bob Thornton (Dan Truman), the red-tape cutter who assembles our heroes. Keith David (Lt. Gen. Kimsey) plays to type as a Colin Powell clone whose orders are to destroy the mission whenever possible, while William Fichtner is Col. Sharp, a bureaucrat at heart who still thinks when necessary. Stamper's crew includes the men from his oil company, an ensemble of Ben Affleck (A.J., his future son-in-law), Michael Clarke Duncan ('Papa Bear,' a jolly black Giant), Ken Hudson 'Quiznos Baby Bob' Campbell (Max, a grown up, dumbed down version of Bob), Owen Wilson (Oscar, the space-cadet geologist), Steve Buschemi ('Rockhound,' and the guy you know your daughter will talk to despite your warnings), and Will Patton (Chick). These men have worked together for years and are like family.The 'armageddon' project is based on current events, namely the realization that it's only a matter of time before earth is struck yet again, with most life forms not surviving. In the movie, there is 17 days to train the crew, fly them to the asteroid, and have them drill an 800 foot hole, into which a nuclear warhead is detonated, hopefully splitting the asteroid. Along the way, they pick up Peter Stormare (Lev), the Russian space station cosmonaut who gives the mission its international flavor, while reminding us that Russian astronauts are superior to American oil drillers.The cinematography is what makes the film work. The plot plays out very predictably, as most movies of this type do. You won't be surprised by what you see, but you will be amazed at the visuals and snicker more than occasionally, as the egalitarian message of the film is driven home.A good, not great, movie, but hardly one you need to avoid.",7,1,2,6 May 2007
Pearl Harbor," From Here To Stupidity
","First, the errata: Dorie Miller wouldn't have been flirting with Evelyn.Dorie Miller died on a ship a few years after the attack and received his medal posthumously. He did, however, fire the 50-cal and it is believed he shot down one or two planes. His captain also survived in real life.Oh yeah, people smoked. A lot. They also played poker.No nurses died in the attack.The Doolittle raid was tidied up for Hollywood.While factual, I still do not believe that Jon Voight could ever have sired Angelina Jolie, but give the man props for his creation. His acting? He said it best in the movie, after the attack: 'How bad?' It is true that America scrambled a few fighter jets and shot down a few Japanese planes. This may have been one of the reasons that the third wave was called off (Japan suffered 29 casualties).The plot? The first half is 'From Here To Eternity' while the second is Tora Tora Tora. The action scenes of the attack, which run a full twenty minutes, save the film. You really get a feel for what it was like to be bombed like that. Where the film almost, but not quite, perishes, is how it attempts to insert a chick-flick into a war movie. The result is what I imagine it would taste like to mix milk and orange juice, two things which are fine on their own but not pleasant when combined.The movie's other main strength was in its portrayal of the Japanese as an honorable nation that felt it had to conduct this war to preserve its place in the world. We have certainly done this ourselves, and the film also captured the sense of total victory experienced by the Japanese pilots, many of whom are now interviewed for documentaries on the war. One cannot help but respect the efficiency of the attack, including how the Japanese altered their torpedoes so they could navigate the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Without question, we got our tails kicked good, and from a military standpoint, it was one of the most lopsided battles of all time.The movie chose to end with the Doolittle raid, but it would have been smarter to give minor screen time to that attack, and more to the role it played in our winning the Battle of Midway, which was the true turning point of the war. That battle was won by mere seconds, as our bombers beat the refueling Japanese bombers to the attack by a whisker.The film is a good way to show a historical event to a young audience that can smooth out the inaccuracies in the history books or on the internet. The cast could have been stronger, but Affleck (Rafe), Hartnett (Danny), and Beckinsale (Evelyn) do not drop the ball while carrying the film. Jennifer Garner as the mousy Sandra was an interesting performance, especially in light of her future stardom. Dan Akroyd as the decoder was convincing as only he can be. It was good to see an SNL alum play his role well in such a big-budget feature.Watch it on cable if you're an adult, and keep the DVD around for the children for when they have a history bug. At 3:20, they'll be occupied all evening.",6,1,1,24 January 2006
Man on the Moon," Mr. Fred Blassie And The Breakfast Mess
","The title of 'Man on the Moon' was taken from REM's musical tribute to Andy Kaufman, a comedian/performance artist from the 1970s and 1980s who dotted the entertainment landscape of that era in many unforgettable ways.Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is brought to life by Carrey in a way no other actor could have accomplished, and it is clear from the film that Carrey himself, and his over-the-top performances, had been influenced by Andy. One got the impression from the film that Carrey reacted as we might expect a Bishop or a Cardinal to react when told he is to play the Pope. Carrey's reverence for Kaufman shines through in every aspect of an incredibly deep, Oscar-worthy performance.Carrey overshadows what is actually a very strong cast. Danny DeVito (George Shapiro) plays Andy's agent, and since those two actors worked together for years on Taxi, DeVito's personal history with Andy bolstered his ability to grasp the role. Shapiro is written as a man caught between a one-of-a-kind artist and the establishment attempting to profit from him by fitting him into their little box, a box Andy not only thought, but lived outside of.Courtney Love (Lynne Margulies) was well-suited for her role as Andy's wife, much as she was suited for People vs. Larry Flynt. Her energy and feistiness made her believable as the one woman who could handle the man no one else ever could. Paul Giamatti (Bob Zmuda) is Andy's best friend and co-conspirator, and has gone on to much bigger and better things after an excellent performance here. Appearances are made by most of the rest of the cast of Taxi (except for Tony Danza), while other figures in the movie have their real-life versions blending in with the crowd, such as George Shapiro as a club owner who fires Andy, Lynne Margulies as one of the mourners at the funeral. Jim Carrey's ex-wife also appears as the waitress in the recreation of 'My Breakfast With Blassie,' which also includes Jerry Lawler and Fred Blassie.I never obsessed over Andy's antics as they were occurring, but I was aware of them. His 'Mighty Mouse' theme performance on SNL's first show was a spoof of the 'musical guest' concept (and brilliant), while the wrestling incidents, though staged, fooled almost all of the major media, who had grown so weary of pranks from Andy that they just assumed that his announcement that he had cancer was just another trick, but the 'punchline' was sadly true, and Andy died much too young (35). It is true that Andy continued to bus tables in LA after working on Taxi, to keep his 'independence.' His reply to people who said he looked like Andy Kaufman was honest and brilliant: 'I get that all the time,' he would say.Of all of Andy's work, 'My Breakfast With Blassie' is the one which history will smile upon the most. Of all of Jim Carrey's work, this film is likely to enjoy the same fate. It's a shame that the Academy did not take a grown-up view of a mature comedian giving a mature performance that rivals anything done by any actor of that year, or even historically.The film captures Andy's brilliance, creativity, and refusal to change himself or his act for his audience, instead choosing to make us come to him and understand what he was saying, without any help or explanation from him.",10,0,0,16 May 2006
Seabiscuit," Why so many love the track
","When I was very young, a long time ago, I bought a book called 'Come On, Seabiscuit!' as a cheap, used paperback for a quarter. I was fascinated by the story then, and am just as fascinated by it now, as I am a lifelong horseplayer.The lure of the racetrack is the potential, at any time, for the poor to rise above the rich, through merit, either at the betting windows or the owner's box. This movie focuses on the not-so-uncommon tale of a horse from the wrong side of the breeding shed to become a champion against all odds. For a movie based on facts from several generations ago, this one was more or less accurate, with a few liberties taken for the screen.Seabiscuit, like his arch rival, War Admiral, was a grandson of the great Man O' War (the term 'upset' in sports was coined after Man O' War's only career loss, to Upset, in the 1920 Travers). That is where the similarities end, however, as 'the Admiral' was a majestic colt who was treated like royalty from the day he was born, while 'the Biscuit' was all but abandoned as a serious racing prospect. Mistreated, he developed a temper that would later be focused towards glory on the track once he fell into the hands of owner Charles S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) and trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper).As often happens when a horse hits a new barn, the new connections solved Seabiscuit's problems, and he did what I call 'presenting as a new animal' once under their care. Like any former claimer turned stakes horse, Seabiscuit had to prove himself at every turn, but neither he, his jockey, or his owner and trainer, ever gave up. Everyone, including the horse, had their flaws, but they also had a key ingredient to the success story that would become this movie. Seabiscuit really was purchased for a rock-bottom price ($2,000 or $2,500), and once he was given a chance to develop properly, (he had been entered in several claiming races at the age of twenty months), he rose to the greatest heights of the sport. Once there, however, War Admiral was waiting for him, and the public remained unconvinced, as the odds in their match race showed.The movie reminds us that most great things are accomplished by ordinary, even flawed, individuals, for we would never do anything great if we sat around waiting to become perfect before we tried. Even if our lives are in a shambles, the horses still have to be trained and ridden, and the bills still have to be paid. The star of the movie, the horse, just does what he does best and leaves it to his handlers to put it to use. All he demands in return is good food, a nice place to sleep, and some four-legged friends. To think that horses are not intelligent enough to figure out what is asked of them at the track is naive. Like all of nature's creatures, they are competitive, and they race even in the wild. Seabiscuit was a horse who enjoyed racing once he learned how to win, and who trusted his jockey implicitly once he found the right one.Some trivia about the movie: 1. The match race was scheduled for the 'first day in November, at Pimlico Race Course, when the track is fast and dry.' War Admiral's connections refused to run on a wet track. (When the movie was released, Pimlico held a reenactment of the race in a driving rainstorm).2. In the training sequence for the match race, Smith did not brush Seabiscuit's flank with a crop, but instead rode the horse himself and kicked him with spurs until the sound of the bell by itself caused Seabiscuit to jump into flight.3. Pollard had recovered from his injury two months prior to the Santa Anita Derby rather than a few weeks, but it was true that his leg was questionable and that he was very vulnerable to injury.4. The horses who portrayed Seabiscuit and War Admiral were California-based ex-claiming horses who were (IIRC) 11 and 6 years old. Neither horse would have run within a mile of the characters they played.5. Pollard had taught Seabiscuit to stop whenever he said 'Whoa,' but he could not tell Georgie Woolf (Gary Stevens) this before the match race, as it would have ruined Seabiscuit's chances in future races.This was an excellent story that was well-done as a movie. Stevens was excellent as Woolf, and appeared more like an actor playing a jockey than a jockey attempting to act.",10,0,1,24 August 2005
Back to the Future Part III," An Excellent Finishing Touch
","The first 'Back To The Future' film was an all-time classic that needs no introduction. Its quasi-scientific approach to fantasy (where time-travel is explained except where doing so makes the plot impossible) gives it just the right touch for a mainstream audience. The second and third parts of the trilogy were filmed simultaneously, so they need to be viewed as a whole, even if they were not released as one; this obviously hurt II's performance with the critics and at the box office.The strength of the series has always been as a buddy film: Marty and Doc have a close friendship that few of us ever get to experience. They completely trust and rely on each other, and they only argue without ever really fighting or even hinting at betrayal. They can count on each other in a way that most of us can't, and accept each other's individuality. It takes a lot of trust to take the risks that Marty and Doc take for each other.Each movie of the series has involved the same characters in different time settings, and that itself is fascinating. Biff Tannen is now Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, what one would expect a survivalist ancestor of the 1950s schoolyard bully or 1980s workplace bully to be. George and Lorraine McFly are now Seamus and Maggie McFly, a far more mature and industrious, and far less dysfunctional, couple that we would expect of first-generation immigrants of an era when there was too much work to be done for one to bumble around like George or become embittered like Lorraine. This 'Mr. Strickland' is not a school principal, but a Marshall, and he is neither intimidated nor fooled by Biff/Buford. Doc Brown is back as himself, setting up shop as a blacksmith and relying on his superior knowledge to see his way through that era.Even the humor is transplanted. Marty gets to 'learn' how to shoot on a practice range that looks like his favorite 'Outlaw' video game and dazzles the locals. The chase scene is transplanted, but skateboards don't move well on dirt, so he is lassoed. The space-time continuum is threatened yet again, this time by Doc's love interest, Clara (played by the well-cast Marty Steenburgen). Doc and Marty are again ridiculed when they share their visions of the future with the locals ('automobiles?'), and we once again find our heroes having to figure out a way to get 'back to the future.' No one can say that this film or either one before it jumps any sharks, that's for sure. The story was amazingly true to itself throughout all three films.",9,1,1,2 November 2005
Wimbledon," On Any Given Fortnight
","Wimbledon, for all its focus on one of the world's most storied competitions, is more of a coming-of-age tale than a pure sports movie. Male protagonist Peter Colt (Paul Bettany, in the performance of his career) feels like something is missing from his life, but he's not sure what it is. As he would say 'No, correct that, I know exactly what's missing.' He's 31 years old, now ranked #119 in the world, and while many remember his name from the tennis circuit, no one seems to remember that just a few short years ago he was #11 (their guesses were a few spots shy of his true peak). Colt, from a well-off family, has just accepted a job as a tennis director at a country club, a nice retirement from the sport which will begin after his completes Wimbledon, his final tournament.Adding to Peter's problems are his parents, who have grown estranged to the point where Dad sets up shop in a treehouse, and his brother, who cheerfully wagers against him in the first round as if he were counting on the outcome to pay his mortgage. No one is directly evil to Peter, but the evil is that no one dislikes him because he is about as nonthreatening a presence on and off the court as a man can be. He is more pitied than respected, at least by the seeded players who view him as filler, good practice for the final rounds, but merely a local 'wildcard' entrant who will make a graceful exit into retirement early on. He does manage to pick up a groupie in Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), the brash, childish American star player who is expected to make Wimbledon her first Grand Slam. Lizzie's dad (Sam Neill) is not thrilled with the distraction, so even having fun becomes as much a chore for Peter as winning the match. It is not that he does not belong at Wimbledon, but where he is thought to belong, that is the cruelty here. Though more accomplished than almost everyone who will ever play the game, Peter Colt is barely known to the tennis world, and invisible to the rest of the world.Colt approaches his first two matches at Wimbledon as if they were executioner's marches. His first match is against a prodigy who is expected to go far in his first grand slam, but as often happens, the journeyman takes him to school with solid play. The new job will now have to wait, as the French Open winner awaits in the second round, along with the obligatory bet-against from his brother and disbelief from the media and commentators (John McEnroe in a lively and very technically accurate performance, with Chris Evert as his sidekick). As was made obvious early in the film, it begins to become obvious to Colt that the greatness his mother told him that he had was for real, but also that he had never wanted to reach down deep enough to bring it out. Finally living in the present, Colt leaves nothing on the table and disposes of this challenge as well, leaving him to play his practice partner in the third round.The 'old' Peter Colt would have had a nice match against his equally nice training partner, but his desire to win (egged on by Bradbury) has gathered too much steam, and the partner is left sliced and diced, remarking after the match that Colt has a killer instinct never before seen. Meanwhile, Bradbury is winning her matches, but becoming increasingly distracted by what was supposed to be a boytoy becoming an important man in her life, and overshadowing her to the public, causing her father to go ballistic at the sight of him. He was right, of course, but sometimes other things in life are more important than tennis (for Bradbury), but sometimes, as for Colt, tennis has to take priority. Bradbury's day will come; it's now or never for Peter.We all could look back on our lives and know we could have accomplished more than we did, but we can also look back and be happy with what we've done. Professional tennis would not exist without the Peter Colts of the world, and this movie is a glaring tribute to the journeyman players who slave in profitable anonymity and who rule most corners of the tennis world beyond the tour. In Peter Colt's case, he gets one last chance to separate himself from the masses and leave a mark on history, and while he had no delusions about climbing back to the top, anything can happen in one match, especially when the match is on your home court, a short drive from your house, against a player who may be great, but who couldn't possibly have the life-and-death intensity that Colt brought to the finals, with a little plot-driven grudge-match background thrown in.As the final chapter unfolds, the movie takes a few swipes at sports-movie 'miracles' and other cheesy plot devices, keeping the action as true-to-life as possible. Cinderella may win, or she may be valiant in defeat, but in this movie, the result is a logical one, and not the product of dumb luck or revenge-inducing superhuman strength (an incident where a ballboy is struck flips the bird at that idea).All in all, a truly great film and an excellent example of what can be achieved in a true drama that doesn't rely on gratuitous sexuality or special effects to pacify a dumbed-down audience, but which rather treats the viewer as intelligent and able to appreciate a good story, without making it so complex that only a tennis pro could follow it.",10,4,5,11 May 2006
8 Mile," This one hit a bit close to home
","I grew up in New York City just as rap was evolving into the art form we see today. I remember the breakthrough as if it were yesterday: it was 1979, disco was dying out, rock had yet to come back, and music generally sucked. The #1 songs from Billboard that year -- 'My Sharona' from The Knack' topped the charts for several weeks, for God's sake -- were from hunger. Music needed a fresh new voice, and rap was just the ticket. 'Rapper's Delight' from the Sugarhill Gang actually cracked the Billboard Top 40 (it hit #37), and I still can sing all 15 minutes of the song, usually without error. That's the point: I'm WHITE. So were many of my private school and upper-east-side friends who also knew all the lyrics.We weren't 'eight miles' away from the other side of the tracks, but about four or five from the South Bronx, where rap was born. Debbi Harry's 'Rapture' was an homage to her obviously many trips on the #4 train to and from the Village (for example, the lyrics 'Flash is fast, Flash is cool' referred to Grandmaster Flash, while 'Fab Five Freddy' also got props in what is actually the first rap song to hit #1). Because of this, I can relate to what it's like to be a white rapper, even now. Eminem, the king of the white rappers, works in this film because he has the same 'street cred' that my peers and I sought by taking rap seriously when no one associated it with whites.The movie '8 Mile' tells the story of 'B. Rabbit,' a Detroit-based rapper with a crappy job, who lives in a trailer park with his mother, and who dreams of the day he can get his demo produced and get out of the slums. He's hard-working (unlike his peers) and also realistic (he talks of living 'down here' rather than 'up there'). Like many working stiffs, he defines himself not by his work, but his hobbies. He begins the film by losing a 'rap battle' (a freestyle rap competition), and suffers the humiliation of being 'not white, but white with a mic.' Racial tensions fly, along with the occasional bullets, but the main weapon of choice for these 'gangstas' are their lyrics, which they all know can lead to riches.The 'villain' of the film is 'Papa Doc,' the leader of the 'free world' rap group, and the reigning rap battle champion. Papa Doc has street cred, and Rabbit wants to take it from him for his 'crew.' Mekhi Pfeifer turns in his usually grating performance as 'Future,' and one has to wonder about his motivations (watch 'Scary Movie 3' for a humorous statement of the obvious from Anthony Anderson). Rabbit is troubled, conflicted, but his trials and tribulations are meshed together in a way that every artist can only hope for.One thing I've always liked about Eminem is that he's not a white rapper trying to be black, but that he puts a 'white' spin on rap, mocking his race's perception as more grammatically correct, less 'gangsta' and always the racial underdog. For example, his line 'notice that this man did not have his hands up' in the final battle would have been spoken differently (but not inferior in any way) by a black rapper. Somehow, he manages to do this without appearing racist, but rather a mere product of his upbringing.This movie's main objective is to show the world of hard-core rap to a mainstream audience, and I can't imagine anyone watching this film while paying attention and not understanding the culture, at least on a surface level, by the end.One other note: Brittany Murphy stunk, as usual.",9,1,1,15 September 2005
For Love of the Game," For Love Of The Cliché
","Kevin Costner brings the armchair sports fantasy to life yet again in this movie, only this time, unlike 'Tin Cup,' he plays a has-been rather than a never-was athlete. One gets the impression that Costner is exorcising his demons by repeatedly injecting himself into sports heroism roles that he certainly never played in real life. Despite this, the movie somehow manages to work brilliantly even when the entire cast (save for Vin Scully) did not.On the last day of the season, Billy Chapel was having a bad day: he had a fight with his girlfriend (Kelly Preston) the night before, leading to a breakup, he's on the verge of retirement, a shadow of his former self, and to top it off, he's a half-hour late to the ballpark, where he proceeds to have a midlife crisis. We get to experience this crisis juxtaposed over the perfect game Chapel begins tossing, as the action shifts back and forth from the game to the flashbacks of his great yet still somehow unfulfilling life. If Chapel were 18 and female, he would have been a good candidate for the show 'Starting Over.' In this film, however, he's stuck on the mound.As Chapel goes over the past five years of his life with Jane, and her daughter (played by the overrated Jena Malone -- an award nomination? get real!), and as we are tortured with Kelly Preston's impersonation of a leading lady, no one seems to notice just how well he's pitching until he asks late in the game 'Has anyone been on base?' The visuals are excellent, as we see him enter 'The Zone' by tuning everything out, and only announcer Vin Scully (who does not do east coast games in real life) seems to pick up on what is going on.We learn that Chapel has come back from a horrific hand injury that should have been his ticket into retirement, and that he's still got a few -- if only a few -- good pitches left in him, but we also learn that he is playing the role of spoiler, doing his job to make it as difficult as possible for the hated Yankees (replete with stereotypical Yankee fans that remind me of those I've seen at the games) to make the playoffs.The final few innings of the game are the heart of the plot: will he complete the 'perfecto?' Will Jane turn around and come home? Will his hand injury obstruct his destiny? The most compelling message of the film is that we often meet one destiny while on the path towards another. There are no great moral messages, just a man trying to leave one last mark on the game, hoping for a 'last hurrah' that rivals the three home runs (of six that year) which Babe Ruth hit on May 25, 1935, at the age of forty.Despite one of the worst casting jobs of all time, I still recommend this movie, which while clichéd, still manages a few original twists and makes for an entertaining respite.",9,1,2,14 August 2005
Major League," The Bad News Bears Meet The 1973 Mets
","In the last three games of the 1980 seasons, the Mets played the Pirates, and set a record for lowest home attendance for a three-game series, at slightly over 5,000 tickets. Three of those were mine. The Indians from this movie were about as bad, and the stadium about as empty.The plot: a stripper's husband dies on their honeymoon, and she wants to move the Cleveland Indians, whom she inherited, to Miami. To do this, she compiles the worst collection of players she can find while still appearing to try to win.Like the Bears, who were court-ordered because everyone had to get a chance to play, these Indians are 'owner ordered' because their mission was to lose games. Neither team would have existed otherwise.The 'Buttermaker' role in this film, Manger Lou Brown (a tire salesman), is played stereotypically well by James Gammon. 'Englebert' (catcher Jake Taylor) is played by Tom Berenger, with Rene Russo as his annoying ex-girlfriend that he inexplicably still wants. 'Amanda' in this movie is 'Wild Thing' (played by Charlie Sheen), the no-nonsense ex-con with the killer fastball. 'Kelly Leak' was divided in half, with the delinquent half incorporated into Sheen's character, and the slugging half to political exile Pedro Cerrano, a Cuban national who fled Castro's persecution over his practice of voodoo. Corbin Bernsen (now a very bald John Durant on General Hospital) is Roger Dorn, the prima donna third baseman who refuses to give even 50 percent for this farce of a team. Wesley Snipes is Willy Mays Hayes, a gate-crasher at Spring Training who literally runs his way onto the team.The season starts off predictably, but the owner (Margaret Whitton) is not pleased because the team isn't as bad (16-25) as she had hoped. When they reach .500 at 60-60, only nine games out of first, she goes ballistic and cuts the team's legs out from under them, forcing them to train with poor equipment and travel in an old chartered plane that put the fear of God into the team. When the Bear-I mean the Indians, find out why they were hired, they have that coming-of-age moment when they decide to rise up and 'win the whole thing.' Like the 1973 Mets, who came from 11.5 games back at the end of August to pass five teams and win the division, these Indians play hard, even Dorn gets into the act and plays like it's a contract year, and the movie climaxes on the final day of the season with the Indians and Yankees in a playoff for the title.The subplots are well-acted and the casting was superb, as the future careers of many actors in this film testifies to.",10,0,1,25 August 2005
Rocky," A Great (Philadelphia) Story
","Down-on-his-luck, aspiring actor Sylvester Stallone watched Chuck Wepner, a 'ham and egger,' go the distance with Muhammad Ali, going as far against him as many greats of that era. That 1974 fight inspired 'Rocky,' the story of a Philadelphia fringe boxer/wiseguy who isn't really good at either, scraping together a living collecting debts for Mr. Gasso (a loan shark), boxing for minimum wage, and the generosity of butcher friend Paulie, who wants in with Gasso.I saw this film twenty-three times on HBO in February 1978, when I first got HBO, but didn't really appreciate it until I had lived in Philadelphia for several years after moving from New York. The movie captures the spirit of Philadelphia, from its shiftless characters who barely have a niche in life, to the spirit of its citizens, who are like poodles that think they can 'go the distance' with a pitbull.Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a New Year's bout that is in danger of being cancelled when the challenger is injured during training. Faced with having to refund the tickets and eat the overhead for the fight, Creed decides to give a local, unknown fighter a shot at the title. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is chosen because of his nickname: 'The Italian Stallion.' Rocky is tough as nails, but lacks the boxing skills of Creed, and sets as his goal, to go the distance, to leave the ring proudly on his feet.Mickey (Burgess Meredith, ex-Penguin from the 'Batman' TV series) is a boxing gym owner and trainer who puts the 'old' in 'old school.' After kicking Rocky out of his locker for being a thug, he begs his way back into training Rocky for the fight. With only five weeks to train, he doesn't even try to teach Rocky how to box, but more how to beat the living crap out of Apollo. He teaches only the rudiments of boxing and how not to fear the heavyweight champion of the world. Mickey trains Rocky to win, making the most of his own chance of a lifetime.Creed does not take the fight seriously, training sporadically, figuring he'll put on a good show for the crowd before disposing of Rocky. His trainer is more concerned, especially when he catches film of Rocky's devastating left hand. Rocky, who gets $150,000 for the fight, trains mostly not to embarrass himself, but in doing so he does the one thing Creed does not, and that is preparing to deliver a peak effort. Rocky doesn't know what he has, but whatever he's got, none of it will be left on the table at the end of the fight.The fight begins with Creed using Rocky as a punching bag, until a minor slip-up allows Rocky to deck him to the canvas with an uppercut, sending the local fans wild. After a few rounds, when Creed has hit Rocky with everything he has but Rocky is still standing, Rocky begins to lose respect for creed, his street instincts kick in, and for the rest of the fight he has no fear of his opponent. Creed can box, but Rocky can break bones, and even the heavyweight champion is not immune to that type of destruction. Once Creed went down (something no other fighter had ever done), Rocky had already won, and he did not try to safely go the distance, but to do so as an equal. The result is one of the best fights in the history of cinema.The Best Picture Oscar was well deserved.",10,1,2,16 September 2005
Die Hard," Amazingly Human Action Film
","Fresh off Rambo and the Terminator's superhuman exploits, Bruce Willis gives us John McClane, an everyman cop from New York on vacation for the holidays and an office Christmas party date with his half-estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). Holly has taken a high-level corporate job with a Japanese conglomerate, and the movie hints at her having one foot in her marriage, and the other planting more and more firmly in the world around her. The only notables among the supporting cast are Paul Gleason (Dwayne T. Robinson, Deputy Police Chief) and William Atherton (Richard Thornburg, Channel 5 Reporter).The danger comes out of nowhere: a group of international criminals led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), and claiming to be terrorists, catches the company napping, taking over the building tower with ease on Christmas Eve, their sights set firmly on $600 million in bearer bonds that are neatly tucked away in their vault. The criminals had expected to just do their thing, get their money, and get out, but John decides to be a 'fly in the ointment' and put the hostages at risk as he takes the bad guys out one by one. Only Sgt. Al Powell of the LAPD (Reginald VelJohnson) believes John, and then only after he gets 'irrefutable' evidence of the criminals' existence landing on the hood of his car. From then on, Al, John, and Hans dominate the film from the three perspectives (good guys at the scene and with the hostages, and the bad guy). Holly is reduced to a supporting character but her presence is always in John's mind, restricting his ability to act since he can't harm her.What makes Die Hard the all-time classic it has rightfully become was the lack of extravagance and fantasy: there were no decades-old war grudges, no jungle action, no superhuman powers and only the occasional physics-defying stunts we are usually overloaded with. The characters in this film were regular people, with regular jobs and regular attitudes, confronted with an extraordinary situation, responding as most regular people would, by doing things which go beyond what they would 'regularly' consider. Each character's backstory is one that could easily be ours if we were born in their shoes, and we all know at least one or two people like someone from the film. These are the people we live with, work with, and interact with, and the film captured them perfectly. This realism makes it very easy for the audience to believe that it too could have been caught at that party and had to face the situation.Die Hard took the action genre in a new direction, adding a human touch and bit of reluctance to their invulnerability, while also showing them (as Spider Man would do so as well later on) as people who are much better at making others' personal lives work out than they are with their own.Even if you haven't seen Die Hard, you've seen its legacy in many other films since. The formula was a brilliant one, and this was its birth.",10,2,3,8 February 2006
Kingpin," Now I Know Why I Quit Bowling
","I say this in a good way: this film captures bowling's underbelly, where even the pro stars sometimes have to supplement their income the old-fashioned way: by taking it directly from obviously weaker bowlers who somehow manage to be convinced to risk their money. Just as poker games are often won with guns, bowling for money has hazards all its own, something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.Roy E. Munson (Woody Harrelson) is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called 'being Munsoned.' The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow, even THAT manages to be funny, which speaks to the quality of this film, a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray).Fast forward to 1996, and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a $1 million tournament in Reno, Nevada that can save his family farm, but Ishmael is conflicted (the deepest emotion of the film) because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home, and Vanessa Angel is extra-hot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.If you think this is a parody of bowling, the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes, in certain places, and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money.",10,42,54,16 August 2005
Bring It On," ONE Flaw And Her Name Is...
","GABRIELLE UNION! She was TWENTY-SEVEN when this film was released, and it showed. I suppose that since 'Grease' was not being redone at the time, there was an overage of pushing-thirty actors in need of a high school role, but they could have cast someone younger...and more talented. Union's self-righteousness reflected a maturity well beyond the years of her character, and while this is normally impressive, that is not the case when the actress is also 'well beyond' her character's years.Now for the good parts: the rest of the movie. Torrance Shipman is heiress apparent to the cheerleading equivalent of Duke's college basketball squad, the five-time national champions who contrast their bottom-feeding football team, that never wins a game, and only occasionally scores any points. Thanks to new arrival Missy (a gymnast, supposedly, but we never see her doing any gymnastics on stage except in the obviously spliced 'tryout' sequence), Torrance learns that the Toros have stolen their routines from East Compton (a random two-hour drive lands them serendipitously in the Clovers' gym during a routine they stole) , whose captain, 'Isis' (Union), has taken over her squad, apparently after being left back for 11 or so years (see age comments above).The title of the film reflects Isis's desire to beat the Toros at their best, so she tells Torrance to 'bring it.' From adversity, Torrance rises from ditzy cheerleader to soul-searching moral compass of her stereotypically vapid, upper-middle-class squad of white girls (with an Americanized Asian who is as 'white' as the rest of the squad). Since the defending national champions get an automatic berth to the next year's finals, the stage is set for the big finish, but the Clovers need money, and the Toros need new routines, all in a few weeks. Will they get there? (Duh).The cast from this film was 'loaded' with future A-listers Dushku (as the obviously bisexual Missy, who even gets jealous when her brother wants Torrance), Dunst (whom I can't stand but whom everyone else seems to love), Union (who recently starred in 'The Honeymooners'), and Jesse Bradford, who plays the cynical but good-natured Cliff Pantone (Missy's brother and Torrance's love interest). The choreographer 'Sparky' (Ian Roberts) who is hired to 'save' the school with a horrid and cloned routine that is later scrapped is great comic relief.The sexiest woman in the film, however, was Nicole Bilderback as Courtney (the Asian-American 'buffy' with lesbian overtones). Bodies like hers belong on the A-list, and bodies like Dunst's belong on the c-list. Another reason I was endeared to Courtney is that her character didn't keep up the facade that she might actually want a nice guy for a boyfriend, which is the cheapest way to get fans in Hollywood, and a good way for borderline sexy actresses to make the A-list when they don't belong there (see Sandra Bullock, who married a biker, as another example). That she was 25 when this film was released further underscores the comparisons to 'Grease,' however.All in all, a much better film with a much deeper message than many 'critically acclaimed' films. I actually would have voted it Best Picture had I been given a vote. The film really is that well-done and is a must-see. The way it pokes fun at cheerleading stereotypes was pointed, tasteful, and precise.",9,0,1,14 August 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A good, but not great, film
","This is not the best film of all time, and not even Tim Robbins's best performance of all time. That would go to 'Arington Road.' Tim's third best performance of all time? Anything else, as these are his only two good film.Morgan Freeman (ex-Easy Reader, The Electric Company) has turned in countless performances better than this one (Glory is an obvious one), and the rest of the cast of 'Shawshank' doesn't even stand out. I didn't even know Bill Sadler (who is in a lot of films) was in this film and couldn't even find the character he played.Let's get the plot out of the way: Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned for a murder he says he didn't commit. Redding (Freeman) is the wise old lifer who mentors and befriends Andy. The warden, for whom Andy works, is corrupt. The action results from this circumstance, but the focus is on the human and social dynamics of prison. The supporting cast was far too stereotypical, and the plot twists all very predictable. Nevertheless, the film was well-acted, well-shot, and fun to watch. It did not, however, move the earth.To rank this film above From Here To Eternity, put it on a par with Casablanca and Gone With The Wind, and to have it leaving other classics like Ben Hur, On The Waterfront, and even Rocky in the dust is a bit much.Shawshank's other main flaw is that it is a bit too political in its portrayal of corrupt conservatives in power.",8,0,0,16 November 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," Bloom County's Opus was far more impressive
","How dare this film soil the name of Opus, the great cartoon penguin from Bloom County, who is quoted to this day. That Opus lived his dream, knew who he was, and left his unique mark on life. Mr. Holland's 'Opus,' by comparison, only confirmed his invisibility and historical irrelevance. We are to think that Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is one of life's unsung heroes for changing the lives of young people through music, but he is merely unsung, a man of little achievement who does little more than feed our tax coffers while doing what those who cannot do, do: teach.Dreyfuss, who owes most of his carer to the overrated The Goodbye Girl (1977), tries, and fails yet again, to deliver an Oscar-worthy performance. Had he won for this performance, I would have lobbied stronger for making one actor a year give the award back.Here we get the story of a touring musician who settles into a teaching job for financial stability, and so he can compose music in his spare time, only to learn that teaching is fulfilling all its own. On the other hand, we don't see successful musicians or composers giving up their lives for teaching, so the entire premise is flawed. This guy is not a success, and is simply making the most out of failure, while the children he 'inspires' are making the most out of their indentured servitude in the education system. The supporting cast, which includes the equally overrated Olympia Dukakis as the principal, makes this one of the worst big-budget films of all time.Not only do I recommend not watching it, but also disowning anyone who ever decides to play it when you have no choice but to watch it (such as if you are stuck at a friend's house and can't jump out the window to avoid it). If you must watch this film, please set your sights higher than the loser of a lead character did, and don't ever convince yourself you are so happy with so little.",1,9,24,2 October 2007
Speed," The best picture of 1994
","The film has not a single flaw, and a minimum of physics-defying stunts necessary to make the action film work. The bus is diverted to a place where it can (temporarily) survive, and the few leaps of faith (and more yards than a human can leap) are minimalistic plot devices, nothing more. This film is about the people caught in a suspenseful, yet survivable, crisis. This firlm is a THRILLER that demolishes its peers from its own era and rivals that of any era, and even that quaint little British serial about some over-the-top secret agent spty guy.Keanu Reeves (Jack 'I put the SWAT in SWAT' Traven, LAPD SWAT) and Sandra Bullock (Annie Porter) could Just as easily have been Gable and Hepburn. Reeves is more cartoonish, but carries his 'supporting' role well. The clear star of the film is Sandra Bullock, the grouchy, half-awake commuter grunt thrust behind the wheel of a bus that is rigged to explode if it slows down below 50 mph. Hitchcock would have been proud of the suspense, and special effects worthy of evolving his cro-duster scene from that era.While a complete film in the true sense of the word, the story never strays from its title premise. The desperation attempts to survive could fail at any time, and the passengers not only know this, but half of them seem to expect it, though they try as they can to survive. This film brought us an insider's video of those scenes we usually only read about or watch on the news, and gave us an oddball supporting cast of stereotypical LA and tourist types that made us feel like we were on the bus right with them, wishing the crisis was over so we could get to wherever we were going, and do what we were doing, without being bothered by high-level criminals using us as a pawn, and could they please get us off this damn bus? What every action film tries to be, and rarely is. Die Hard on a bus.",10,1,2,25 April 2008
Casino," A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told
","As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a 'moneymaker' for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the 'wiseguy' culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the 'old school' types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",10,111,152,16 August 2005
The Pursuit of Happyness," Message to our children: First, DO NOT SNITCH
","I give the film 10 out of 10 stars because it drives home the don't-snitch message currently sweeping our ghettos in a way few films ever could. I can't think of a better actor than Will Smith to deliver this message either, because his existence is testimony to the fact that it's not who you know or what you know, but how you look. This film has everything: a male eye-candy actor delivering a powerful, phantom message to a receptive audience that loves those who tell it what it wants to hear.Charles Gardner is living proof that if you don't rock the boat, don't rat out those who break the law, and are an activist on issues that have no true opposition (who is in favor of poverty?), you'll be revered for taking a nonexistent stand, and rewarded for being a useful pawn of the powerful and corrupt. Watching this film, you'd think racism and sexual harassment were historical artifacts, and that the reason whistleblowers have little or nothing to fear is that there simply are no more whistles to blow because the world is now a happy place where everyone does the right thing.The fact is, had Gardner ever become a true whistleblower, ever compalined about the massive sexual harassment in the culture that made him rich, ever complained (as in filed suit over) racial disparity, or ever blown a whistle on any dishonest people in his industry, his success story never would have been told because it never would have happened, as his career would have stopped on a dime. It's not like he or anyone else who climbs the Wall Street ladder doesn't know this; after all, someone with mouths to feed can't go around getting themselves fired for doing the right thing or standing up to evil. Better to just play along, cash in by being silent, and then leave those who fight the system to starve so that eventually they'll shut up. There is nothing wrong with what Gardner did in bettering his life, but there was nothing right with it either. Right would have required far more. You didn't see Martin Luther King cashing in on government contracts instead of protest marching, but I guess in this day and age all problems are solved and there is nothing left to protest, so it's all good.As a white male who has confronted racists and sexual harassers in the workplace, and wound up blacklisted in retaliation by many of the same people that both Gardner and Smith call friends and do business with themselves, I cannot begin to explain the awful place God must have reserved for these two who dare to attach morality to their greed and career opportunism, as if them getting rich by rewarding don't-snitch behavior somehow meant that the world were suddenly a better place. I suppose when one is wealthy, they have to downplay injustice and their own cowardice in refusing to fight, because otherwise they might actually have to pitch in, offend the corrupt, and actually fight for something.Will Smith and Charles Gardner are nothing more than wealthy cowards, men whose mark on this world will not include any victories over our true evils, but rather a messge from them, through this movie, that your problems are your own doing, including any problems that may have been caused by you being too stupid to realize that in this society, to get ahead, you must not nnitch, for even if you are homeless and shirtless, and with far less skills than any fired whistleblower, Wall Street will hire you as long as it does not consider you a threat to rat them out.I can almost picture Will Smith arrogantly pontificating in Oprah's chair again like he once did when he toyed with the idea of becoming President one day, speaking of 'haters' and how 'negative' it is to point out things like this, yet to folks like Martin Luther King, the negative people were the ones who stood down in the face of injustice and stood on the sidelines because it was simply more profitable to do so.Like it or not, when it comes to standing up against racism, I am blacker than Gardner or Smith will ever be, but that is also why I am not richer. I am viewed as a traitor to my own race, which didn't surprise me, but that the race I 'betrayed' my own race to help didn't seem to want that help, did. It was then that I realized that Black is a state of mind, not a skin color.",10,0,1,24 August 2007
Back to the Future," One of the ten best films of the 20th century
","You could rank Back To The Future on an all-time list of best movies for its special effects, and its in-depth exploration of time-travel in what almost seems plausible. I'm sure the physics professors could find fault with a few things, but the 'pop physics' lesson we get to justify the plot is sufficient. This, however, would only make Back To The Future a great film. What makes it a REALLY GREAT film, however, is the 'buddy film' aspect, or the amazingly close friendship that Marty and Doc have. Their level of trust and reliance upon each other is phenomenal. We are lucky if we ever have a friend like that, and this is what makes the movie memorable.For those who just got here in a time machine, the plot has typical high-schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), whose father George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), rejected high-school suitor of Marty's mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). George is a Walter Mitty type who never stands up for himself, and this sickens Marty, who seeks refuge with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells and later Elizabeth Shue), and the crazy, independently wealthy scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd). School is no refuge for Marty, however, as the 'evil' principal Mr. Strickland thinks he is a 'no good slacker.' Marty tries out for the battle of the bands, and Huey Lewis passes amusing judgment on him.Doc invites Marty to film his time-travel experiment, by sending his dog, Einstein, a minute into the future. The time machine itself could have gotten a Best Supporting Actor Oscar itself, as it was a souped-up DeLorean (the brainchild of John DeLorean, who had recently been acquitted of cocaine trafficking that was ruled government entrapment of a vulnerable man about to lose his business). Doc had figured out that if he got the DeLorean to 88 mph while creating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity, the car would travel through time. He never made clear how he pinpointed the destinations, but there was a console in the car that needed only to be set.The time-travel experiment is a success, but Marty soon learns (as gunmen approach) that Doc had gotten the plutonium necessary to generate the time travel had been stolen from Libyan terrorists who were out for revenge. They 'kill' the Doc (who returns for II and III of this series, so draw your own conclusions), and Marty must escape their wrath in the DeLorean. To elude the Libyans, he floors the car, it hits 88 mph, and the next thing you know, Marty is back in 1955 and the movie 'begins.' Marty gets to see the 'romance' between his parents develop, and he gets to compare their actual behavior with how they say things were, with predictable consequences. Marty looks up the Doc, who quickly realizes he is genuine, and blends into Hill Valley society. Marty then alters the future inadvertently, and he must repair his wrinkle before the key moment in his parents' hooking up, and then he has to find his way 'back to the future,' something which will not be easy and which he will only have one chance to do.Marty needs Doc to accomplish his mission, but Doc also needs Marty, because otherwise he would be the proverbial 'tree falling in the forest' with no one there to hear him. The film develops the buddy plot to perfection, and handles the time travel humorously and in the true tradition of fantasy films, doing the best they can to be technically accurate, but staying focused on the human side of the story in a way that will leave audiences of all ages satisfied.No DVD collection is complete without this film.",10,1,2,4 April 2006
