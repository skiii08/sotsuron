Blade Runner 2049," Better than the original.
","This will be a short review.While the original Blade Runner created an interesting setting and touched on many different themes, it always fell short of being watch- able in my own opinion. However, Blade Runner 2049 is a welcome sequel which does not spend time trying to set up another movie for an extended franchise. The movie feels like a modern extension of the original but fits perfectly into the universe.The story was good, the visuals were great, the soundtrack was incredible.I would highly recommend seeing this movie. 10/10.",10,3,19,5 October 2017
Justice League," First movie I've ever walked out of. (Short Review)
","This movie has ONE good scene which would be a spoiler and so I cannot talk about it.The rest of the movie is complete trash, two directors clashing with each other which leaves a soulless husk of a film which tries to parody itself.As mentioned in the title I walked out of this film early because I hated it so much that I decided the conclusion wasn't worth my time.I'm never seeing another DC movie outside of their animated content.",1,8,17,18 November 2017
