The Benchwarmers," Simple humor - buy many laughs
","I went to this movie with pretty low expectations. I was very surprised how how funny it was. Lots of funny bits, classic lines, comedy bits.The audience I was in included lots of 9-14 boys and they laughed their heads off.There are plenty of fart jokes, nut shots, and potty humor. If you get past that it has a funny plot and a good message.* Wait for it on DVD * Rent it when you are in a funny mood * Young kid humor a plenty. * A good message about bullying and inclusion.* Plently of humor that will be over the heads of young kids.* And Rob Schneider playing the straight man",8,0,0,15 June 2006
