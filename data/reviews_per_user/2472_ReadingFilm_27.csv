Ford v Ferrari," Asks you to root for Goliath
","It is inherently uninteresting. A mega corporation gives a blank check to win a race, and they do. The film's crime however is it won't commit to this-Americanism is unfashionable today, so it wants it both ways, they're soulless villains same time as the Italians are othered bordering on Red Dawn-esque (for the crime of being a competent boutique car company?) Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother. It's an example where good taste should have brought others into its wavelength, expanding why what he was doing worked and pulling the monotonous and contrived Josh Lucas nonsense they hammer into the ground scene after scene.",1,57,150,17 November 2019
Finding Neverland," The pain corner of awareness.
","He is always behind so many coats, hats, hairstyles and variations of powder, that I felt almost cringing how exposed Johnny Depp was. Somehow it felt brave. Yet it is brave; in repression in imagination, that shows the universe 'inside' encapsulates an entire theater of similar whimsy and magnitude. Its key exploring Barrie's romantic identity, though I'd conclude it's a small reading is its point, but one it makes a point in addressing. Basically because...the inside-outside is that romance and art functions as the same repression-expression, In stories... art, love and nature are always the enlightenment. So the film's initial basis is JM Barrie's motive so it's not unfair ground to conclude there is something there. Of course his nobility is its 'out' in showing him as harmless and longing to tap into purity and innocence sprung from pretentious bores being of use to no one. (Give the audience what they don't know they want.) But I could not ignore what the film itself was putting down: literally the couples retreat into different bedrooms not together; her into shadows, him into enlightened isolation of the mind. You can read that as imagination as proxy for the romantic, or you could read the impulse of love channeling into grand visions instead, as a pursuit beyond human understanding, as channeling the divine. 'Be disciplined and reserved in life so you can be savage in your work.' His presence then is healing and therapeutic by exposing them to this 'enlightenment.' See how the boy's emotional breakdown is destroying 'art.' The brave. 'This isn't one of your plays.' Sometimes Hollywood is so on the nose it achieves great insight. 'I've only wanted good things for this family.' Julie Christie wonders 'why'; -- from her perspective, he comes in, riots the children, kills the mother, for his own selfish pursuit. AKA the eternal as framing the inward through ritual therapy is uncomfortable for the repressed. 'The boy is gone.' It comes at a cost. See the consequences of 'art' as ritual payment for actualization. But the opposite is death by silence. Every one of them is envious of what Barrie has. See how her illness on opening night like cramping birthing pains. Art operates as this same inevitable force as life and death. How about the wonder of Dustin Hoffman's character being the second half of the spell. He doesn't understand 'why' but is deeply driven to do it. Both are so prim, proper and fashionable for 'why' requires our utmost. Notice how he never, ever intervenes. (The quotation of Hoffman as Captain Hook and Depp as Jack Sparrow were great.) As vivid and exciting as that feeling of something happening across it, the sorrowful sobering note it ends on is brave; the fade-out in Neverland with end text would have left a fine conclusion, but the film is interested in imparting the entire spectrum of wisdom, including art as both coming up short, as in it's not a process in therapy for the pains of living, but a form of living itself.",10,5,6,14 June 2019
Detroit," Apocalypse Now in Detroit
","It's a nazi prison guard film about race relations? It comes off sensationalist to the point of parody. I was going with it until they let the 'already murdered a guy' cop lead the charge for the second killing. Then he becomes this vile and evil caricature while everyone including military personnel just stand around letting this teenager go on a power trip. I have far more faith in the military and police and don't believe a thing on screen. I suspect they wanted Bigelow's war film background but with an 'in Detroit' hook, and all her attention to detail, cinematic mastery of space, image, and immersion, is used in full effect to terrorize the audience. She is a director's director, and one of the finest we have; some may not know how difficult and how much attention such a work would require to pull off so effortlessly. You could say Detroit presents a distortion of the cinema gift, a masterful thriller and film craft used to ensure its political message. The film presents it as a true story, and so it plays almost as if the Nazi war criminals were let off after Nuremberg, it's really enraging stuff. Then you understand why they preceded that with the most evil rendition of events. Flashes of Boyega's expressions of conscience and humanity resonate the most. The film is extreme in tone, hopeless, the villains win and you feel awful by the end of it, but I'm mixed on it, I admire Bigelow's great power of filmmaking, but I question its authenticity and tone.",10,12,18,30 March 2019
Unbreakable," A window into the believable fantastic
","Night's genius is he always makes these hooks about nothing; of characters afraid of wind or there's probably aliens up in the clouds. Most ingenious in Village, characters afraid of scary stories. But none quite capture you through the cinematic texture, as here. I kept thinking 'dimension' as this felt like a straight on window into the believable fantastic.On craft. Like a doctor, it hints with questions until it's diagnosed. Enormous risks of faith in pace and edit. It's conceived in images and motions. The two long takes with Glass and Dunn in the stadium, then one captures the football action for just a moment before pulling back. And what I call writing with the camera. The slow zoom on Glass's eye: 'They called me Mr Glass' and fade, which would make no sense on the page. You want those vignettes where the actors go, 'Why are we doing this?' 'Just trust me, this will be amazing.' And there is the best moment.It's conceived via staging as his wheelchair shenanigans. Conceived via metaphor, reflective, camera dancing with mirrors, and the television.I like the funny moment of how Glass didn't even bother to stick around for the football game, just turned straight around. Sam Jackson just evokes this eerie alien like nothing he's ever done but he is so heartbreaking and touching.Night was naive then; beginners luck and market newness, so Disney was testing a new voice and told him, change nothing, let's see where the experiment leads (and years later this risk paid off steering the culture and comic canon in hundreds of little ways; it can be argued Unbreakable via its butterfly effect is the highest grossing film of all time, and why the art house experiments bring a necessary capitalist offshoot of the corporate monstrosities).Experience means it's there but you don't offer precious real estate of your running time to tease your idea, therefore Hollywood efficiency would straighten him from artistic leaps of faith. Still whatever this film promised was not delivered in its two companion pieces. I'm not sure what this was, and Night via his current day output surely must be perplexed himself, as a business man, even a little eye-rolling he did it all in such a beautiful artistic fashion--as he learned painfully across the years that audiences don't care about craft, they care about the hook and thrills.",10,6,8,30 March 2019
Us," A trash America via beaches, zombies, and commercials
","The soulless mount a 1970s style 'performance art' revolution, hand-holding into a great wall across the globe. When you stop and think how ridiculous this all is it can only be seen as satire. The seedling of the soulless one switching lives with the other, their own revolutionary leader 'Man in the Iron Mask' style, then leads them to claim what's hers. Their symbol of action is taken from some random t-shirt they see. Why do t-shirts hold so much symbolic power here? It's because they're in this trashy beach-bound American context; how the revolution goes on beneath theme park rides, sand and flip flops... as she says: 'We are Americans.' Us = literally United States. So of course rather than the great pyramids or monuments of humanity, it would be random garbage printed on shirts to imitate. Same how he knocks her out with the souvenir and Alexa is the closest weapon to defeating them. I'm reminded of the short story where aliens come down thousands of years after the apocalypse and reverse engineer humanity concluding McDonalds was their church of worship. The Africanism, the symbol of chains, the voodoo brings about its primal freight of replacement and reckoning by the underclass (with full on quotation of slavery and the 'underground railroad'). I don't think it's just race but 'us' in our luxury vs our shadows in iphone slave shops. 'We' are above ground enjoying the rides. 'They' are underground in dark tunnels and can only pretend. It is very modern day with immigration, migrant crisis, globalization. Have and have not's. The race to the top via a race to the bottom. And the art, the dancing, is the simple act of consciousness leads the tethered to some kind of awakening. Consciousness and unity is the way out only after uncomfortable violent revolution. How about the uselessness of the fathers across it as almost sitcom comic relief? The patriarch in power using it to no end. 'You take it all for granted.' (From Idiocracy: 'Shouldn't I train him?' 'I think he can pretty much learn to sit on his ass and watch TV.') 'They' are coming for your robes and vodka.Think how the anti-hero mother could not ascend without the violent act of forcefully switching. That she could only assimilate into the host culture via the most silent, diligent mimicry, abandoning the culture of her own, showing the global unity leads to homogeneity. (Would like to see the same film again except entirely from her perspective.) Here we are all guilty and replaceable.As usual genre is the only avenue directors have to tinker, tweak and consider the form. While art house audiences are puritan and pretentious about plot and tone. In the end, an audience member remarked, 'I don't know what that was, I need to watch some YouTube videos about it.' To me it's Peele's primal terror+satire via Ki-Duk Kim, a postmodern thriller. Tim is even in it.",10,8,15,30 March 2019
Knives Out," I threw up at every scene.
","The feeling washed over me of just how nasty the film actually was. It is both literary poison and too obsessed with getting good grades to get its hands dirty, bridging the polarities with an aloof and misanthropic superiority. It wants us to hang it on the fridge. Problem is the effect is more like a brother hitting the other then crying he was hit back. The film takes Trump America and splits it with left v right, within this dishonest frame of neutrality while his agenda couldn't be more clear. Of course, he's too passive-aggressive to be forthright. Then the patriarchs epiphany is as if Scrooge lost his mind; but even Scrooge stopped short handing Cratchit his fortune settling on giving him a duck. Today the artistic acts of millionaires must be greater because money is twice as shameful. So it's about capital and globalization. The transfer of power is societal and economic and race is a funnel of that, a symptom, a copout, an excuse. She becomes Queen. The world is now a different guard--now this could be effective as do you break the code and go with rage the hyperbole entertains and provokes. Poison is fun. We love a murder mystery. But I'm not sure Rian Johnson in his great position quite knows what he's trifling with, attacking the giant bodies of society through the frame of the erudite whites v underclass. Rather society is a disguise for his personal grudges and failures, then it all makes a little more sense. I think he's obsessed with internet culture. I think he's furious Star Wars fans came at him and he made this film as some grand revenge saying, 'I get the last laugh trolls.' Knives out, plainly. The film is then a tantrum from the very wealthy 'white male' he seems to be sending up, for how the others didn't take his blockbuster properly, so let's destroy the world. Its pettiness is a kindness I offer because the alternative is even worse, and that is its politics. Because if there is honesty to this piece it is that he belongs firmly within the family ranks, not directorially outside of them. He hides, per usual with his oeuvre, through deceptive frames, one-upping and manipulating us with narrative trickery doing anything he can to avoid giving us a sincere experience. We're just there for Rian's entertainment. As he's incapable of anything but frames (a common trap for the midwit) we are suddenly forced to see Johnson himself as the frame--the ultimate irony they don't quite learn is the more you hide the more we see you. So the director as moral arbiter hides in the 'statement', its politics and the personal are so fused, they are echoes, holograms, projections of the other, then relishing hurting wicked people can only be an act of artistic sadism, same as Plummer. Then, the film's dishonesty is it never questions he was a lousy father who raised these very kids he's chosen to punish. See the indignation of the brother speaking of the sister: 'Self-made? She had a million dollar loan' inadvertently damns Johnson who goes with no self-reflection, mercy or pity at all within the mud-flinging. Constantly it's saying they don't deserve it. They botched it. They didn't earn it. Did you, Rian?",1,42,99,30 November 2019
The Irishman," The emperor has no clothes.
","The CGI faces create a soulless effect. It never feels like a real film, just a digital recreation where computerized characters are pretending to be DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. They basically robbed us of the reunion by experimenting with a technique that fails so badly we know never to do that. The tragedy is this was not a time to experiment. They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride. This is a greatest hits tour through his oeuvre. This is uncanny directorial valley. I'm certain in 2050, you would get these old actors recreated exactly like this. That is our soulless future. Why rush to it? And the sad thing is, the cast were all there, and we will never get to see what they did. Clearly everyone is in denial and reviewing Scorsese's other works and pretending the emperor's wardrobe is just wonderful. When critics talk about the last half hour being a conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic? Well sure, because they finally showed him acting. And it's not just that the CGI sinks the film, it's that it calls the entire thing into question and demands every other area perfect to make up for it, and can you honestly say the script and story is matching the perception of these rave reviews?",1,338,624,20 November 2019
"I, Tonya"," Far too many comic beats revolving around violence against women
","It's something I never thought I'd see in a film, like the movie is testing the outlier of societal responsibility. They actually punch her out and it's positioned as a comic moment. WTF? Yet the film plays as black humor, and seems to be completely amoral at worse, smug and condescending at best. Of course, these are all hillbillies and low class trash, the film gathers to make fun of them forgetting their own unconscionable taste. The entire film is way overdone and adds this unnecessary mid00s quirky indie aesthetic gone wrong, crossed with the sprawling montage epic that Scorsese popularized, populated with poptunes, and the story doesn't warrant it at all. It comes off as people given the Tonya Harding assignment who don't care about ice-skating but 'want to make it work.' I never thought I'd rather have a more conventional and serious approach as I admire postmodern, experimental, and offbeat works so long as the perspective is responsible and purposeful. I would call this mumbo jumbo filmmaking.",10,3,6,30 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Larping as history and album covers
","The blaxploitation romance with their perms and fashion showcases identity discovery. They own the blackness and in the post-MLK era dress like superheroes from films, a means of being 'larger than life' to showcase pride and overcompensate the painful reality. The cinema comes twice. Once this concept of Stallworth on the phone to David Duke so the outward contrasts his ice cold pained eyes to multitude shades of effect, playing out continual vignettes. and two, Adam Driver is the film's conscience with every time his looks mean two things, or he counters his hatred inside for them by projecting forceful racial hate, which I see as pointing to projection as the source of such beliefs. The dual of inside vs outside is one of the most riveting 'double' concepts in film as it brings about several dueling perspectives, which is why we go to the theater. One complained of the half-assed climactic set piece but I think Spike Lee is tired of it all. How can you complain when it begins with 'dis base on sum true shizz'? He is saying these morons don't warrant much serious thought at all, only to laugh at; then re-contextualizes its laxness as tired wisdom with the Charlottesville, VA footage at the end portraying it all deadly serious: the cycles of history are on the verge of repeating and the same stories would go on. 'We didn't want them to be here.' Both sides said the same thing.",10,5,8,30 March 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Polarities. Art as a lifeline. Where was his best director nom?
","Just five minutes in I felt a melancholy for how great it is making me sad it would finish. Its bipolarity shows both ends are 'us'. Losing your soul in aging, such works of theater are society's lifeline to feel. It's strange because of how American audiences are so puritan and usually despise theatricality, self-awareness or romanticism; it's as if the musical gives permission to partake.See how the shave is presenting dignity for 'appearance', being the cleaned face of the societal machine; even there's a rival barber, it's a 'cut-throat' industry to make people nice to service the rotting. The rot is hoisted up by the broken; so the craziness of this is how Todd integrates as a twisted functional. It even rewards him with a checklist of fulfillment, but he could not embrace it. 'The ghosts don't leave. They never leave.'This is because he is not real but a stand-in for Dante's London. See how he always creeps up, appears, or looks in the mirror as if surprised he even exists. The film brings this point home showing him as a stuffed figurine behind the window from afar, or as a mannequin in Lovett's fantasy. He is a symbol, a hero redeemer of this demonic ritual; an outgrowth of the dregs where the demon humanity run free for mischief. I like how early on the camera dances through the streets like an imp making sure every rat is still in its place, 'I'm home!'Those powerful gushings of blood show as feeling. We trade allowing this for the civility of living. The mad women ripping the asylum keeper apart, who kept a collection of crazies. There are hints of many different Sweeneys across this, difference being ours redeems, making his evil woke. This is the only Batman you're going to get here. Gotham wept.Depp; when ever do you get a vehicle for this sort of one dimensional purity of rage? The face as performance landscape. A complete reversal in Edward Scissorhands. 'My arm is complete,' in both films. Both are these glam rock figures. There, goth within suburbia, here, musical theater within goth. Art as always is the great symbol; the hair cutting versus the shaving as creative and destructive tools for shaping the universe; Burton's paintbrushes.It's about the torture of certain kinds of men who seek control, and can't bear life not offering that, so seek it at all costs in other ways outside their failing. Its tragedy shows how fate is very much in favor of those with purpose; you realize if only Todd sought industry rather than murder he would rule Judge Turpin politically not violently, and with ease.",10,5,5,8 April 2019
The Village," A cinema study in truth
","Night channeling Hitchcock in this study of cinema truth, here he crams the tiniest mechanics inside even smaller frames, while his contemporaries move bigger and wider. Look how there is no horror but it has the frightening beats of music. What is the film scared of exactly? People going around in costumes? Look how it's the 1890s and 1990s at the same time. All these multiple love stories going on bringing this clash of truths in the micro and macro. Bryce's inviting human eyes, playing the same function as Story, she serves as the invitation into the artist's mind via humanism and sincerity, perfect with those folky flutes. I like all the rules as well. Don't go past the sticks. Don't use the color red. Don't say the name. Often his films are providing we the audience rules for what we're seeing, meaning here it's his characters watching the film, not us.Now if really wanted to mess with us, he could have left some of it ambiguous so that you would walk away debating which reality is true, what era was the right one, which rules were to be followed. Though for 2004 being Bush era, the new village would be relevant for the Trump age of 'truth'. He would've added other villages; the experiment on one being losses, another maybe being failure. Expand algebra into calculus. My favorite were the magic stones as it's such a nonsense last ditch effort to hold onto the lie. Then the unraveling of the compound seems inevitable. Noah's mother will break. Questions will be asked. Lies cannot last. Lastly of interest, the photos being the twist reveal rather than the car; again the Hitchcock nod of the recorded form exposing as the camera in Rear Window stopping the villain. Better the box, like those boxes 35mm film prints are carried in.",10,3,4,30 March 2019
In the Name of the Father," In the name of contrivance
","Daniel Day-Lewis has sort of ruined his oeuvre with those cartoonish villains. So many of his glares now read as psychopathic, it always feels like he's about to chop someone with a cleaver. He overacts like mad. He probably has more horsepower than any other actor though. His outbursts and emotion. It's far too much to present a serious political event and hijack it into theater of insanity method acting. Although those images and moments of him suffering are iconic out of almost Schindler's List, is it not a bit much?The other argument for being out the seams is contrasting the father's stone-face. But I don't fully buy 'it's about the father-son' either when the IRA is torching prison-guards into flame and the 'don't show it to the defense' scripting nonsense. The whole movie, it's dated and forced, but to be fair I wish all our Oscar bait today was full of such passions.",1,4,9,30 March 2019
Yesterday," Ownership is up for grabs in the 21st century
","Oscar. Apple. Olympics. Bond. Beatles. Boyle asks his own phenomenon from his hyper90s counter culture roots resting comfortably inside an exploration of impostor syndrome. Now it is one of the defining questions ahead of us, specifically for the dearth of culture encircling us is this notion of authorship being on the same spectrum as our great debates in identity; as in the right to ownership not a tangible notion. This is not just music but a kind of test of western privilege. Who hasn't thought of the exact concept? But to actually go there is almost a cultural event, to peel into our counterfeit solipsism in search of their yearning for authenticity. That is not a judgment, but an endpoint in late stage capitalism rendering the individual dreamer as something from 'yesterday'. At first it is indeed him and not the music so he fails, until it second guesses itself that no, it is the music. It posits with the frame of art, real life is the gimmick; then adopting the frame becomes the frame. Identity. So the question of interest is not 'what if the Beatles' but, what if millennials, in wearing said identity, had a soul? Okay but then what if there was a World War in the 80s to lead to such identities? As to what sort of cultural madness could lead to the Beatles requires some great collective trauma or societal movement to unite a culture in a renaissance. So what is the millennial war? As is, escalating streamlining of privilege was our renaissance. Millennial cultural reactions are now fragments of regurgitation then our lack of culture becomes the subject bringing a hall of mirrors to show identities for choosing. We envied stuff once happened. It all reflects this complex prism of Boyle's self-insert in impostor syndrome; he began as an enfant-terrible after all so his success may be, on some level, a confusion for him. Here, the 60s without the 60s in the vessel of the millennial power fantasy it's basically yet another look at the Beatles through a deconstructing lens; they are, after all, so iconic and ingrained, even archetypal, that films exploring them tend to be conceptual, even metaphysical as their era championed such play with their elfish pranking. Films about the Beatles were always sort of postmodern gags. Adapted for today in the post-youtube age they come to reflect where youth meets the hyper age, and the fallout; lo and behold cultural renaissances are a threat. The millennial war was technological. With all things equal in the algorithm, all of those YouTube stars got too big, the war was corporate in nature against 'you' actually tubing... which puts The Beatles with today at a discrepancy: a counter-culture in an age where the war is against culture... and the best compliment I can give is the film does seem to account for this, in fact its entire purpose is to explore the divide. 'We remember those songs.' Rather they once remember there was a society. The film contrasts culture with society interestingly enough. Lennon's peaceful life came at the cost of a meaningful one: in this black mirror what if we are so lazy and complacent other people are writing our own songs, so we live every life at once. This is the exact convenience of post-culture, post-capitalistic streamlining, automation, post-individual, post-heroes journey, now hero being collectivist no longer requiring us. Thus in the frame of revolution, without war, art is the battleground. All this could ring horribly false but Boyle is too smart that he nudges subtext constantly. For the criticism of Yesterday with how the global infringes on the western accomplishment as a middle finger to capitalism's cherished heroes, I think he is aware of every problem with this being a giant tantrum, and actively counters with his craft. His best weapon is the simple sincerity of the lead performance in turmoil. The impostor woeful against the 60s. Fast after learning it's about the music, he learns it's not about the music at all. So it goes to love. Contrast the sociopath executive with Jack where somehow both in their artifice create two distinct halves. See the betrayal being exactly like a lover scorned. 'What if millennials had soul?' They would meet other millennials without it. 'What if music?' What if not? This comes at the time of his realization in feeling. So it's two loves: the childhood love and the proxy love with the exec, but love is the millennial love for themselves. The songs were a narcissistic proxy--no longer about an age, but revealing his desire for stardom for its own sake--and here is where cinema and music so abstractly collide for pointing the camera at something invisible, which all the best films do, it's that every song seems to push him deeper, as these lists of women the Beatles sang about were all post-it notes and he's watching people who lived life, lived culture, and reflected it back as a voice of a generation, and a generation who received and understood 'why', sees it all missing here. Malik comes to learn the most authentic way of being the music is the love on the table. In fact, he has to learn it directly from Lennon! The film's irony, weren't the songs enough? Blasting 'love' over and over? Rather the songs are not songs but monoliths he sings without understanding them. The millennial frame becomes Lennon's. Enlightenment ensues. 'All you need is love' he finally gets it after thousands of performances. Most fascinating for me is how the frame of the songs suddenly makes this loser feel like a deity to us...despite we very well know the lie. Even -we- deceive ourselves inside this con of identity persuasion, hence today in every form. My favorite is the utter dread we feel that the lie would be exposed, which are almost like jump scares. This is where it stands that Boyle is so close to being a grandmaster of cinema that he can tweak and maneuver the film to thoroughly exhaust every single perspective. But he's only close in his humility; he's right there with us constantly asking and prodding and tearing his hair out about the Beatles asking 'how'. Boyle humbly steps back as a Sheeran not John though we see his virtuosity in an experimental pop frame and tip our caps how his career trajectory has some Beatles-ish mischief flowing through his veins. That its conclusion about authorship is not so clear is a subtle one. He was, after all, the author of the songs in the parallel world, and was needed to represent something missing from the world, as all artists feel. The most Beatles like thing to do would have been to own it. The oldies morally excused him after all. Rather it must end with an authentic moral act, and my problem is love was no victory in the frame of his ascent to greatness, which ended with a shrug; wouldn't years and years of channeling the greats have rubbed off on him? Wouldn't finding his authenticity finally give him something to write about? I wanted one of his own songs to be received there within the tracklists between the hits.",10,9,19,18 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," America's ass
","No better words can describe this bizarre and uncomfortable anomaly. It carries a sanctimony dwarfing even Saving Private Ryan, as cinema history now replaces actual history. As the camera passed the ensemble, I saw Michael Douglas and my eyes immediately looked for Charlie Sheen. Michelle Pfeiffer in black drab, I looked for Barnabas Collins. The great popcorn funeral, then why stop short at Marvel? In fact the death of America is all across this. (The subliminal programming of Joe Biden as Captain America was screamingly obvious.) Remember, none of this is preposterous as the movie itself. The time heist is closest to examining its theater in the way of Dickens, which provides a decade of cinema to act against so continues this new tradition of cinema as memory functioning via its own footage as our own psychology on screen. It's always regret, what if, accepting failure, parental. 'When you time travel, time fights back.' It's saying the universe is self-aware, unfolding, and we play into it. See how most in the past are willing to accept the truth--except--when they face themselves, then it's antagonism and sarcasm in every case. As in ego in the way of the collectivist utopia. Most interesting is Thanos's relationship with future Thanos, they never meet, but the villain aiding himself in outcomes as the output adjusts the input, creates a cinema study in machine learning as omnipotence. 'A world where no one knows the horrors that led to their existence.' This is already the case. Remember he won 11,999,999 times, making this film in god's eye where the monkeys bash the keyboard to a perfect series of events in self-sacrifice and the unity of the collectivist hive: the women army, the buddhist army, the african army, twenty films join in one to destroy the fascist eugenicist. But with twelve million realities and just one being our film, then isn't half dying overwhelmingly the lesser of evils compared to millions of realities everyone died due to their meddling? Their good intention becomes an abominable evil compared to Thanos's great heroism in saving half the universe. Lastly, the 'all in one' showdown is like Ready Player One except the Oasis is the cinema screen itself. Cinema is realizing a mind of its own and turning the game against us. (Should Marvel have a seat in the UN next?) Theater was once a vessel for humanity to ritualize its experience in boldness and vividness, now instead humanity is the vessel of cinema to awaken itself to our form. The hyper-reactivity doesn't pantomime our dramas rather it's the agenda of the hyper A.I. to replace us with this sort of proto-idealism. All the while we merrily train the borg like captcha through our dollars giving it the exact schematics to dictate us. The snap of the thumb kills the audience instead.",1,7,15,14 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," They blew it
","This is Roma by someone who never lived. The 60s: Endgame. It is not a coincidence Gen X's directorial icon and his grand summation would play as empty adolescent parody. The blame is sort of on us for canonizing Tarantino in the first place. Here everything is a frame for his ego and legacy, like shining a light in a hall of mirrors and it just blinds you. My problem is he already made this ten times then stepping back is now making making it. Drink every time someone calls it a 'hangout film'. Most strange is it's apolitical in this era where cinema is rather needed to be political, so its relevance becomes questionable as I'll delve, the function of the film calls to question its own phenomenon. Tarantino never grew out of the worst impulses of GenX and is still rebelling bringing this a kind of authentic time capsule of the 90s, as we trapped him there. (Perhaps he trapped himself there.) So is it a surprise his subconscious is just this endless bizarre theme park ride of feet, ego posturing, television shows, absurd solipsism, and elevated trashiness? The poster was all that's needed, or the poster would show up in the actual film I wished he made at its end representing the preposterous history in the lens of 60s kitsch--rather than presenting the reflection as the actual story. A frame within a frame within a. As in this is a novel written by Doc Sportello or Hunter Thompson...or Tarantino in the Polanski context here by some 2050s post post post irony flash in the pan. Do you understand the film here 'is' this already. In its best version, I hoped for Zodiac meets The Nice Guys, but then, we had both of those films. We had Pulp Fiction too. We had Inherent Vice. We had Fear & Loathing. But there are so many tells inside this as the Tarantino legacy summation. Walt Disney being a 'once in 50 year genius', ah, a nod to himself. DiCaprio's anxiety was unexpected as what props up the 'icon' is neurosis, an authentic window into Tarantino's psyche, then Pitt is the angel in his ear. Pitt is, quite literally Pitt--the institutional patriarchal everyman jock bemused by Tarantino so long as the geek offers rewards in exchange, endlessly supportive and welcoming so his 'inferiority complex' on the shoddy foundation of his career is constantly reassured and even poked fun. Tate is the phenomenon wrestling with history and credibility, watching the audience's reaction, again, reflects his own pride. The most common crit are her scenes, and it is interesting it feels he has wet feet, reluctance, and fear to really delve into Tate and Polanski. He's a deer in the headlights when it comes to real life, unsure where to cross the boundaries, what to put down, so chooses the worst of all options by doing nothing at all with her. The feet by now is just him joking with us. The deviance. This is his most daring act for today. Flexible underage women both intelligent, monstrous, but always objectified. It's always: 'Here's a woman'. 'Here's women.' Rather than, here is a character. Of course women in his universe are another pop culture act. So they will only function in symbol, as always a reflection against the male ego. Subservient. See how twice, the little girl and the hippie, bow down at the legs of the men. The Manson family again, subservient women brainwashed. It's no longer subversive just to make them strong.Another is a problem with anything 60s, is it's not authentic when performed by millennials or gen Z, and this is one area I expected he would nail it. It's window shopping. We can't touch period and should not try by heightening it but bringing it down. The film's dour mood. I sense a guilty conscience as what drove la la land into the slaughter house, the giant orgy of the film business. The 60s vileness never went away and Tarantino was neck deep in it partaking with Weinstein. So in the absence of the spiritual the cinema confession booth offers no wisdom in return but stoner laughs; we go to the same conclusion they did there's nothing there. Yet as always he would conclude with the divinity of cinema. It's why the film was prepackaged, critic proof, and this Leone/Godard summation at the getgo. Then how does it fail, is because his ascent to being the voice of Gen X by packaging nihilism on their behalf, looking back is not only questionable but a moral fright in its own right. Tarantino warred against his critics and the SJW culture by doubling down rather than stepping back.For me it is the last act. He goes out his way to strip it of all its tension turning a myth into a parody skit. He always turns villains, whether nazi or slave owners, into cartoonish morons, not realizing we ought to see ourselves in villains to be truly scared. He ignored that line that villains ought to be heroes in their own story. Of course it's because he hates them, he hates them so much he doesn't want to dignify them with any sort of artistic soul. Finally! His authentic human feeling comes out. If you see it all vindictive, some revenge from metoo, it adds another texture aside from all this hero worship.The Polanski family came out against this entire production as aggrandizement and self-important, naturally. That he felt entitled to impart himself for what he 'represents' to cinema culture already. Then so the act is respect via this profoundly egotistical conception; ego as compassion where history becomes his 'ninth film'. It becomes revenge on Polanski's behalf, and on behalf of cinema itself. It becomes archangel Tarantino. This is unexpectedly touching, as you have to set aside motive, you can say, it's accidentally touching. Problem is this drags politics into it, in the only way GenX can, via subversive irony,, and then by dragging in politics we can't look outside the film's current day context. It becomes a bold cinematic response, almost a tantrum to all his critics by making himself untouchable inside the proxy of film history, where he can move around women like little toys, murder or not murder women as he so chooses, and throw around cameos of legends, and the press can't touch him. Here, we're in his horrible turf.The director as god. Nine films, nine commandments. One can say anything they want so long as you accept the frame of his power, while ignoring the serial rapes enabling his productions being every bit as bad as these murders. (Now I really want to see the 2050s take on Weinstein era, and the absurd Tarantino they would present.) As the world is crumbling, this guy is still playing with his legos and ignores life in favor of what number nine, number ten, and number eleven will 'mean' in his collection of works. The film perhaps expects no one to notice the stunt of it being Tarantino's 'payback', which brings the question of worthiness redeeming him, or at least, the worthiness of his legacy. (I understand the impulse of 'owning' Polanski/Tate and the 60s in terms of film history, but Polanski's work inside his thrillers was soulful, human, relatable, like a friend at your side--all Tarantino does standing alongside him is expose his own bloodthirsty egotism; he's just not a very good person.)There is also something about generational mirroring, as under the weight of that great generation in the 60s, who lived, experienced political, historical and personal upheaval, the film exposes the hollow generational echoes in reaction, and all of it leaves a bad taste to how X, not the hippies blew it. X is a generation badly needed right now, and I do notice it's beginning to rise to the challenge. So seeing one of its great voices so lacking in self-awareness or accountability, reaffirms they chose the wrong horse to back. Again the parallel of cultural moral vacancy it's maybe not the intended parallel.",1,10,16,28 July 2019
Aladdin," They should have hired Guy Ritchie to direct it.
","Live action Disney remakes are fascinating markers to compare the 90s to today. On the surface it's the same but digital. And the digital hindrance makes so many films fail out of the gate in believability, so here I saw 'digital' as shorthand for our actual complaint being insincerity and soullessness where even our myths are streamlined. Perfect since streamlining and mechanization is exactly what the film is about. For instance how Jasmine's feminism exposes our philosophical yearning for a post-identity world; this is not accusatory but anticipating. See how the film constantly rewrites Aladdin as an attack on identity structures. Jafar is the key. He is not a sly boomer chancellor but a disgruntled millennial and completely lost within his intellect, he is closer to a Silicon Valley tech CEO. His best friend is a parrot--hilarious they made it an actual animal, furthering his schizoid disconnect. He is the borg's worst soldier. He just needs the internet really badly. And like all millennials, he wants everything handed to him. Compare to Aladdin despite the lowest of low origins integrates seamlessly high and low which is the millennials true envy is authentic non-digital living--even in this virtual digital paradise where everyone is larping as scoundrels, princesses, and heroes, the failure to integrate manifests in Jafar as a woefully inept villain. A failure in his own story. 'We are the same,' Jafar tells him. The most powerful shot in the film shows the sheer joy on his face when he summons Will Smith, as if he's lost to Aladdin in five hundred Dr Strange-style iterations of this story, and could only win by cheating, looking inside the code, and pinpointing exactly where Aladdin would walk inside flowing sheets. (How this parallels Aladdin's thieving is a difference in scale. We know Jafar uses hacks with his mindwashing staff. He only wins by using the genies own sort of tricks--same as how he loses.) Most fascinating is its study in identity textures. The genie makes Aladdin a Prince, but not really? (Who exactly is this army around him? Where do they go?) And then his manifestation of Jafar becoming a sultan is even odder, as he seems to have actually been given the title when Aladdin was not. The genie, ultimate only in deception, is a master in persuasive tricks. He is even puzzled by the process constantly remarking on 'gray areas'. The hack is more law of attraction style voodoo. (How frightening is that forecasting the machine age?) Then this notion the genie can accomplish magic switches of identity that are not static to begin with, which is the entire story of the 21st century as compared to the 90s which was a genuine heroes journey, makes this about the Aladdin--Jafar dichotomy as disposable identity. The one has nothing and rises. The other has painstakingly risen. Both win, as the world will greet you with every choice, today's 'fate is in your hands, speak up, the i-self' keeps bringing home we are all powerful. The fact genie doesn't actually do a thing for either Aladdin or Jafar is the other clue. Often it's just authority imparting others to take his word for it. The shackles are in their heads. Then the scrambled morality of accusing Aladdin of being a liar. Really? He is painfully authentic. Not only does he not want wishes, he doesn't get any. He used a loophole to cheat out of the cave (humanity exploited the hack). He was never made Prince at all but given Prince-like clothes (the machine exploited the hack--remember that is its only function there are no actual wishes). He was forced to be saved (the machine exposes itself as a co-dependent reflection). Then I think the third wish is in the tradition of the other wishes, and that is that Genie was never enslaved to begin with. Rather this area where the streamlining mechanization meets its form is an illusion. Aladdin's final con, as it's about an urchin playing his way through life beating both the humans and the machines with his street wisdom; also clues in why Jafar does not get sucked into the lamp until he 'realizes' he's been duped. Moreover, the characters are constantly trapped by language itself, not by any rules in this fantastical reality. The film is saying none of their limitations were real to begin, not Jasmin, not Aladdin, nor Jafar, not the Genie. It's saying this fraudulence governs the modern power structure, but more, can be manipulated to any and every end. There is nothing more 21st century than the disposable nature of our governing reality. It is also why the Sultan bizarrely hands Jasmine the title of Sultan of Agrabah. Did she get ahold of the lamp herself? Rather Aladdin and Jafar had their turns, now it's Jasmine's next; which is actually practical. We are woeful to the machine and the upcoming streamlining where every castle would integrate will end in disaster if in the hands of the power, so the only hope is her empathy and pureness to combat the mechanization. Purity cannot be hacked. Bringing this back to the films function entirely opposite to its treatise on falsities: when the story is good, has heart and purpose it will never be fake no matter how fake it looks. It's also why the genie is fleeing.",1,7,9,13 June 2019
The Lion King," We are already dead
","How did they screw this up? I'm still laughing. They couldn't even capture the narcissism of the piece, you know the bare Shakespeare of it. None of the actors even seem to know what they're saying. These are not interactions but deep fakes, I guarantee it, the Hollywood casts grumble on the painstaking effort of speech, so are now brought in a recording studio, paid their five million to record some two or three cryptic lines, and go their merry way: voila, so an entire performance is brought out. James Earl Jones, I guarantee you that's a deep-fake. His lines point in no direction, certainly not to his son. Did they not have the mp3s from 1994 they could cut and paste? And why get rid of Scar's black mane? He certainly doesn't look like royalty, he's disheveled and homeless in appearance. Then the failure is direction? But Swingers and Chef were quite good. I think instead, Disney is in the hands of scar. Even so much as copying it shot for shot they can't assemble any of it to read. This deepfake is constructed to torture its hostages, offer it the illusion of normalcy, where it's -just- wrong enough to terrify our nightmares. Streamlining taken to its endpoint; Disney's techno singularity is nightmare-efficient, so abandons its product in the process as one giant inefficiency. We are already getting there with subscription models, where the product is an inefficiency, then we rid them of the product. So at its worst, The Lion King is a science fiction nightmare. The entire world population is their audience, I saw some one billion views just for a song from this; this is a fright only Lovecraft could conceive, is revealed an efficiency and streamlining so great a psychopathic molten core in the human heart would reveal--not only this--we race toward making the world in its shape. I want to say Favreau will be punished in some great judgment, but his work itself is the punishment. It feels the entire film is divorced from itself. It feels its crafted by committee--nowthat's a foregone conclusion--no, it feels decentralized; that dreaded word is our future, and how the technocrats believe it saves us by decentralizing power when instead of three large tyrannies we get billions of tyrannies. Decentralization means knowledge would be scattered... 'knowledge' is a danger to the mechanism, 'knowledge' can be abused, or acted on, so by decentralizing the data packets of the machine, you lose responsibility for the outcome. The future is this sort of nightmare where the whole can't be cohered via the pieces. It will all be through packages of abstraction, with everyone kept in the dark but for their packets, and we all just function as a piece of some amalgamation. Then being the simple and authentic audience ends up the greatest crime. Because the entire purpose of art is the whole of the human journey can be reversed through the pieces; you have the arts and the machine by their own designed striving for opposite ends: to decentralize, divide, to keep us in the dark, verse the purposes of the arts: to cohere, to integrate, to actualize. There is hope and what I always say is this is these are the birthing pains of the greater machine. Like the burning liquid metal at the end of T2 gasping in its death, desperately cycling and scanning all its prior iterations for some way out of death... that is Disney today. Possibly this era of the Disney triumph is actually a sign where we are in the very process of its collapse. It's like the theory our lives are actually our memory of our lives.",1,4,6,9 December 2019
Call Me by Your Name," An older man grooms a teenager...
","Chalamet is over sexualized by the filmmakers. Going around half nude in short shorts, it's very twink-fantasy. It's a bit much of the male on male gaze. As well. Reverse the genders of an older man grooming a teenage girl and you have a scandal and disgrace. The gay community has not yet had this kind of reckoning on ages and boundaries, and so the film could very well overnight become appalling or shameful some day. Basically, there's a lot to say about it in a cynical way, such as, why is the father not only enabling a predatory relationship against his 17 yr old son, but intentionally leading him to it...? Then it's slyly his own unfulfilled male fantasies. A twisted projection. The end convo was apparently famous from the book but I always reject 'lessons learned' scripting. The closing shot was powerful enough without it. I way prefer the understatement, ala the ending phone call, the boy is so in over his head there's no big moment, just repeating the name. This sort of authenticity sells it. So I see both sides. How special and classic it feels, being the iconic fusion of the hotshot auteur plus 89-year old James Ivory scripting; I can concede and say such relationships do happen so why shouldn't they be on film? But in this era, to never attempt to address the predatory grooming seems dangerous and wrong.",1,10,39,30 March 2019
Everest," Death is like this, not like in the movies.
","The fragility of life in hostile environments is a phenomenon cinema rarely depicts. It is so unusual that it can almost be witnessed as comedy here. They, first of all, have zero reason to be there at all. So they just go there, everything goes wrong and they freeze to death and then collapse to their doom. It's funny! The way he fell off the mountain. The way the other stripped his clothes off and fell off next. Brolin dying, then waking up with frostbite walking the rest of the way. The mailman having no foresight or sense of self-preservation at all. Gyllenhaal's surfer bro who just lays down and dies practically with a thumbs up. It all feels so surreal and primal. Death is like this, not like in the movies. The film is an anomaly, a blockbuster achievement for how things can go wrong; the way you lose accountability, get lost among groups, everyone working together but mix-ups with the people and the oxygen tanks. A chain effect of it all going south with one small misstep. 'He might as well be on the moon', it really felt like the film was taking us on an alien terrain. Going to see the director's other work to see if this was lightning in a bottle or he really is this good.",Null,12,17,30 March 2019
The Happening," Night gets revenge on the critics a second time by murdering humanity.
","The premise of suicide-inducing spores in audiences inspired the same reaction (you should have seen the reaction of the opening night crowd in 2008), in hindsight it now years later feels prophetic and right.* You laugh at the bizarre timing and black humor of the deaths but I might put it that it shows death so horrifyingly banal that it was impossible to not be funny. Still I wonder if they did any test screenings at all, they must have known exactly which beats were missold as comic.* Night's 'it's a B movie like The Blob just have a good time' argument at the time didn't stop the hate. But isn't that exactly what it is? As perfectly Hitchcockian as it is it retains its own original brand with the Fujimoto images, Newton Howard score, and MNS staging, I see the classic here as within his continuum.* The 70s use of happenings, meant some kind of a gathering usually for some mind-expanding LSD binge. So what is the ritual here? The parallel to the hippies with the title is very occult; you can't ignore that at all with the hippie grounding in Aleister Crowley and Satanism. Fringe thinking points to a pattern where all these secret societies push on about overpopulation and climate danger. So beyond being a nihilistic catharsis following the unfair critical pannings, see how it unfolded ever since: today's whole idea of collectives completely mindwashed without independent thought, and it's information that is the weapon and here they so scramble for some information. Any. But there's none. Why did it seem the government left them all entirely to their own devices to just scramble about, then die? Military and martial law would come down so very quickly on it, wouldn't it? He is even aware of this sort of thinking, adding: 'most people believe it was the government.'The sheer amount of extras and how they are portrayed as stupid and helpless and in a panic clues us into how Shyamalan viewed this film as some sort of ritual cleansing against humanity. Its motive aligns almost exactly with current day fringe thinking how the elite plan to usher in a transhumanist utopia; then so the 'happening' requires a cleansing first, a celebration of the slaughter before we 'merge together into enlightened thinking'. The film ending on that frightening reappearance of the happening shows some kind of coordination in events. It's not one event but part of the all seeing eye, watchful and invisible, who guide us and know better. This force is both cleansing and uniting in search of the worthy.* One of the chessmaster elders in the Village is here as the bumbling idiot hotdog guy completely powerless against the greater evil which is metaphysical rather than Village's wicked but well meaning human control structure. Love saves the heroes in both, as the wind seems to read their intent like the mood rings, so spares the good. But love's function isn't cleansing as in that, here it goes with a different beat... meaning* We have Deschanel's coldness and lovelessness manifesting as this 'plant nuclear war' testing against the uselessness of her husband until he proves himself, so the love can go on. This parallels nature being a symbol of her womanhood corrupted and testing the worth of humanity. Deschanel's wide eyes as opposed to Bryce Dallas Howard are not unifying but chilling. A deleted scene clues in this was all about Night's inferiority complex and fear of woman. The hot dog guy talks to the plants as if they're his children. Wahlberg talks to the plant, but it's plastic; a joke about the plasticity and empty childlessness of his marriage. The lemon drink woman is Deschanel's future, just one scene with her and Deschanel instantly goes to reveal vulnerability and fear, apologizing for infidelity and embracing her feelings for him.* But the madness of the ending. Will you ever anywhere else hear chilling piano music playing over the couple's supposed happy ending that she's pregnant? It made me sit up...implying almost subliminally the shame this disease of humanity will continue.* The wind reading you ala the mood ring is further proven how there's always one who doesn't freeze into hypnosis and questions it. Which brings all sorts of transhumanist 'worthy of living' eugenics arguments to the table here, that only the most noble and enlightened get to survive.* On a more positive note, how cool and beautiful is it they embrace in the wind at the end? Entirely removed from context, it's just people walking through a breeze. To me that's the power of Night's conceptual genius.",10,12,20,30 March 2019
The Disaster Artist," One managed to escape from your sweatshops
","The Room as a post-irony phenomenon with a sole purpose to mock and deride performers who weren't quite performing to the caliber of the idiot audiences specification, here another symptom in late-stage capitalism finding millennial's lashing out at their own irrelevance in a society which has no place at all for them economically, socially, morally. This can only occur in a culture where entertainment is identity, culture is religion, meaning is a prank.What seemed harmless before is becoming quite clear in hindsight what this was; the have's assaults on the have not's attempting to exit their strata through grit, sweat, and skin in the game. Once upon a time art was a noble undertaking commanding society's respect. Now it is some kind of a political badminton match, birdy smashed with might, but floating back and forth as this waving stupid thing.Of course making him a folk hero is the consolation their hatred is good-willed, but it never has the effect they think; you see this every once in a while with David Hung or Rebecca Black, the Quasimodo made king of fools and and shortly after pummeled with tomatoes. This is ugly Americanism, an abuse of your power that your great conglomerates seeped into foreign nations and seemed to their wanting populaces as some great ideal. As in, it's your fault. But he can't pronounce words the proper way? He slurs and mutters? His world-view is slightly off, alien to highlight ours in a comical way. Of course, I mean he didn't grow up here. So what is the crime; that foreigners are foreign? That they're people too? With dreams? Is it some sort of collective guilt where you managed to outsource a bit of culture amidst your sweatshops, and there one escaped?Sometimes these folk heroes within societies of great decay are even given social and political power. Remember, everything is backward. Outside is identity. Material is spirituality. Culture is debasing not lifting. Art is hate.",1,8,16,2 April 2019
Dark Shadows," 2012 viewed by the 1970s viewed by the 1500s.
","'The curse to live forever' in '12 anticipated the incoming hyper age, and how our computer immortality would make us comfortably numb, trapped, and complacent inside our mental coffins. See this family rotting away completely detached from the outside world, the living ones carrying the burden of ancestral expectation, same as humanity itself, in a way carrying the very same fate as Collins.McDonalds as 'Mephistopheles' meaning streamlining as the anti-Christ. A very 70s attitude that could only be brought out via an outsider ancient being. The film is 2012 viewed by 1970s viewed by 1500s.'12 was the vampire time in culture, a final peak in destructive yuppie romanticism, as the Mayan prophecy brought our new age of 'life online'.As streamlining took wing in the 70s it contrasts revolution-individual, the real reason the film chose this period: the sexual revolution. The personal inside streamlining of industry is an interesting study. Plus gothic because 'humanity's ghost.'Look at Angelique's (Eva Green) BDSM sub-dom romance with Collins, where she derives sexual fulfillment over centuries knowing he is below in chains, driving her to dominate business by owning her sexuality.Even for him being owned feels right as repentence for his crimes in love; this all somehow keeps him sane below ground so when he returns he goes on this orgy of murder.Compare to the arid sexuality and frustration with matriarch Elizabeth (Pfeiffer) and Roger (Miller). Tutor Miss Winters is chaste and vacant as we learn fulfilled in some lesbian union binding with the ghost. Carolyn (Moretz)'s werewolf secret parallels getting stoned to Pink Floyd or conjuring entities through LSD; making her parents boomer hypocrisy and teen angst bearable.'A woman doctor? How strange.' Then she brings him to life with blood transfusions and tests his virility making him see the use in that.The film's sexuality brings a sort of nasty context but it's not shy about it.The 21st century would look like this, as within great events of change periods of 'nothing' follow awaiting a life to be lived. This is a bored humanity. So much written on the 70s, the happenings were a cure for 'nothing happening.' The drugs conceding inside was the last journey. The same freedom enabling sexual revolution knew our incoming uselessness being streamlined. So march with pleasure to your doom.The film is saying everything changes but you're not missing anything. Then the vampire introduces freshness or actual living by being of the past: we form our own reality identity not through consumption but through our own heightened theater. Meaning, the answer is in tradition-dignity not debasement.The best scene by far was Collins by the ocean side walking with Miss Victoria and there it approximated an actual beautiful film. The patriarch brought in to add a dose of healthy masculinity and conservatism balancing this bored and lost clan. The tutor overwhelmed by the changing of the guard, a generation so divided every single generation after was a chess-move reaction against it. The pair join by nature, hopeless yet found peace and ease against the chaotic clashing waves. If only Tim Burton subdued the blockbuster mechanics and gave us more of this sort of gentle romantic theater.",10,7,11,6 April 2019
Marriage Story," Rich people get slightly less rich
","Terrible. It fools us in the beauty of its film stock. Baumbach always comes at us overwriting concepts into these mild tortures of the mind, he's like a malicious Woody Allen. but Woody had that filter of comedy-as failing in stand-up meant it's useless unless it connects. Plus he was informed. Baumbach wants it all ways on the merit of his brand, which is suspect to begin with. His scripts are always grating the more they talk. Its frame of self-reference through theater productions is a great thought, and we're offered the range of abstract bizarro theater to mindless sitcoms... of course! His condescension is infinite and goes in all directions. Artistic sincerity doesn't exist for him since he's still in this satiric auteur reality where authenticity is merely a gimmick, another abstraction of the intellect. Another clue is the theater players themselves, other'd as simpletons or fools for comic relief. Almost everyone is NPC'd. This is not wicked, but narcissistic. It's not that it isn't relatable, the breakups are the most real and painful experiences we have. It's that we can tell the lie. Scarlett rings false. She has already been a cyborg, an alien, a mutant, I was waiting for the moment she peeled her skin off in those uncomfortable closeups that seemed to want to demystify her on film. Driver rings false as her husband, as he seems to work not by his appearance so is wasted on film, but by his enveloping bro-ness. Too boyish to be so fatherly let alone a genius director. This is the least credible couple I can recall. Then all the ways it's out of touch. Remember they hand Scarlett a writing job out of nowhere and she thinks on it within two seconds, says, 'Sounds good but can I be director too?' and they go, 'Sure!' ...is that how it worked for you, Noah? Like what is this elitist reality they're pretending is ours? $650,000 grant? Sitcom royalties? LA v NY? Every review says Kramer vs Kramer, and that is doing this zero favors. Back then you could not fake integration. Word of mouth was not decided by algorithms. Today, Baumbach he's a rich kid wearing this as a coat, the film is not human but a tantrum with a blank check from netflix to do that thing that won all the awards. Its humanity is corporate manipulation for conquering all the other streaming services. And I know this is a low-blow, but I was psyched for it. 'Women are expected to be perfect.' The film is not neutral, it's about her actualization, even so much as she ends up a better director than him as he's forced into some kind of director jail. So it concedes his selfishness all along with his compromise, saying, he had all the fun. Scarlett's Story. 'Now I get what you were obsessed about.' For this battle-ground of the theater it offers her the ultimate prize of the Emmy nom, like it's Baumbach externalizing his deeply guilty conscience, maybe his privilege. But he sings, so takes some larger moral victory in taking the loss. 'You're the first person I talked to who treated me like a human' 'It's because you remind me of myself'. Cynicism goes in every direction, everyone is other'd. But the film is review-proof, it works in the poster more than anything. It's in the title: 'Marriage Story'. It can't not work. It's universal, but it really tries, then it leans on cliches, nasty lawyers, comic visitations, there it works, it hangs on those for dear life.",1,36,71,7 December 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," The director attempts to earn the brand
","As the heroes journey has no bearing here, it's the one 'who is now' which angers men for making their journey in betterment not factoring in. Dakota Johnson is so sensitive that her affect swallows the screen through performer empathy. The choice for internal not external is perfect for subjective literarism so the film gets lost inside her mind and nearly can't swim out. It's incredible how she sells every beat. She hangs onto the safeness of the role for dear life to remain endearing, and bravely crosses into eroticism which is very strange for pop cinema, as in they thought the popularity of the book was really about sexuality, not power, so it comes off extremely awkward. The man is less exceptional and I wonder how someone might have sold the character into an artform, where every scene you read nuance and interpretation creating a calculus puzzle between them. That her sexuality is the only thing she can offer is what disappoints men who accuse the female hero fantasy of sitting around, doing nothing, and getting some great reward for it. How the self-insert myths clash is very much 'war of the sexes.' Of course that is the surface reading and arguable. See the way she attempts to reverse engineer him through his kinks is anything but passive; and the way the story infuses sexuality being the person 'inside out' is a serious cinematic study that allows Dakota Johnson to larp as a believable subject for Bertolucci or Lyne. With the female director Sam Taylor it's admirable work inventing all of this for seeing. Often cultural phenomenons breach great truth and warrant a serious contrarian's look; in spite of its box office power hints on an artform there which she mines for through those awkward sex scenes which belong better on the page. This was awkward because it attempts the literary and puts in a serious effort to discover the cinema there; the director attempts to earn the brand, whereas the polished streamlined sequels by Foley went down too easily as commercial products. Meaning this shows a process to good or bad.",10,3,4,30 March 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Intellectually dishonest and dangerous
","I would've liked to see Hitler played completely straight instead of caricature and that would have been funnier and more intriguing. To play up our cognitive dissonance by him being stern, fatherly, helpful, his death by suicide would tear apart the boy's ideology and father figure leading to the post-film identity crisis, more resonant to the nation in reckoning. The film could have messed with its frame, towing the line of its satire politically to find a richer indictment of humanity underneath. Rather, its offensiveness is it seems to deny the boy his Nazidom, so ends up accidentally committing the worst of what it works so tirelessly to avoid, is trivializing the humanity at center. 'You don't believe in anything, you want to be part of something.' Too easy. The film shies from delving into the nation swept away in this movement. It denies their choice! So what exactly is it sending up? Hate, in the most arbitrary sense? No. It's why it desperately cycles through every shorthand of the genre to take the form of its acclaim, when its only intent is to rhyme with today, then obfuscates the parallels ignoring how the economics shorthanded into social scapegoating. I think taking a deeper stance beyond caricature would have been extremely provocative, and untenable in today's climate. Someone comically said, 'They don't make films like this anymore'... But no, everything is like this. Here is a satire without any satire at all. Its tagline is, 'an anti-hate satire' is like the new Star Wars going on about 'the empire' without really elaborating on any sort of motive. Empire is enough. Everything operates in shorthand as a means to 'other' the dissidents. Is it intentional? Or a natural symptom or escalation of the NPC age? I just see cowardice: they believe delving into societal, cultural, economic context would invite it to be considered, so we are asked instead to shorthand it all as blind hate and trust them that none of the Nazi's really believed it and it's just a flaw in the code how dumb people take to ideologies like fads, guilty only of being manipulated. Then the film being plainly about Trumpism cheapens both the past and present. Look how the girl in the closet's arc only seems to be that she's not a ghost or vampire; it's not that she's human but that she's not not human. This is the true terror beneath this, that the very mechanism of prevention through othering, inherently leads to the continuation of the cycle.",1,99,267,3 December 2019
Green Book," Clashing in art as a proxy for living
","My thoughts: the film battles in art. The art is Tony's life is living out in the open through hedonism, competition, family, violence; a work of art actual 'performance' (many see a meta-performance and I do as well), all amount to the inverse of Don; who lives in the abstraction of piano where humanity is safely within symbol. So all of those ways Tony lives, Don lives in hiding; in performance, in sexual repression, in self protection. Then the cross in approaches contrasts the two opposing spectrum to comedic effect; Dumb and Smarter. The key for me is the magic stone, the great symbol allowing him proximity to his discomfort, that abandons his distraction in eating for genuine social connection through art. The ending feels wrong in the natural escalation of its presentation of symbols would reveal Tony being in the closet. Cronenberg ought to have made it...Basically, Tony does all the learning while Don's ending does not seem very happy at all, destined only to continue reinforcing his internal fortification within this sole window to the outside world. Not sure how feel good it actually is but for how intent it is on being so damned on the nose, I can't make heads or tails of what they thought they were doing. Director Farrely having a big moment is fun though as those 90's comedies deserved best picture in some sense.",1,8,17,30 March 2019
Draft Day," It should have been called Death Wish.
","Revenge against his father's failures in the guise of his career. He wants to scramble the pieces and find a way to pick them up perfectly, as if swiping left and right on his regretful past. The owner was right to quarrel, seeing him play god with so many fates on the line. The ghost returns so they pass over the QB. The mistake was right, sort of the father's forgiveness. Often you get it with privilege or unexpressed intelligence, that desire to create problems since life can't match your pace or intensity; it ends, usually, in catastrophe and death. Costner is so right for that; and for how most actors his age now sleepwalk through roles, he's been sleepwalking them for three decades, for him somehow it still feels there's a careful craft. He is addicted to 'life as a game.' The love interest was him gone wrong. The other GMs are comically idiots and can't keep up with him and want to know what he knows that the rest of them don't--it's a scripting convenience, but the 'serendipity' is why we go to theaters. It takes pain to learn.",10,4,6,30 March 2019
