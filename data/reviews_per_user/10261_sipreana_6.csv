E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Adorable!!!
","I must have seen it three times now, if not more.... I JUST LOVE IT!!! I'm not going to elaborate on the gaps in the story line, I can fill them in myself. Or the significance of the symbolics, I couldn't care less. And I'm not about to question E.T.'s intelligence.... I just sit myself down and enjoy the heroic deeds of a few children, the funny (drunk) E.T. with his beautiful big blue eyes and the magic atmosphere altogether. I cry my heart out when it starts to go wrong (even after the third time)... I'm thrilled when E.T. is on his way home, knowing that he'll always be Elliot's guardian angel.",10,2,4,28 December 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A lovely lightfooted story
","A lovely humorous interpretation of how 'Romeo and Juliette' could have been created, the torment of an inspired poet and how to survive as such in that particular era. I liked the pun on well known phrases. Just imagine that Juliette would have been called Ethel! My husband kept wondering how they got the beautiful, long, blond hairdo of Viola under the short, brown wig of Thomas Kent.",7,0,1,31 October 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Sorrow
","Despite my dislike of horror: one can't ignore a movie with Gary Oldman. This film however has little to do with horror. Of course it has all the characteristics of it: violence, blood, gloom, anxious suspense etcetera. But what especially got to me was the grief, the irreversibility of choices made and the inevitability of the outcome.",9,1,2,28 May 1999
The Truman Show," High expectation
",Although having had higher expectation as a result of the media-exposure it's a good movie. Except for The Mask the first movie in which I can appreciate Jim Carrey. Ed Harris shines as the dictatorial director(with a paternal twist in the end?). The special effects where very appealing and added strongly to the humorous scenes.,7,0,0,13 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," This is what war is when you're fighting in it!
","I sat down for on a rainy Sunday afternoon for some easy-to-follow-hero-stuff. Apparently I hadn't paid attention while making a choice at the videostore and got caught by something completely different. This movie shows how I always thought war would be like when you're actually fighting in it. It shows the constant fear whether you'll live through the next moment. The disorientation of being in an hostile environment. The atypical behavior (or is it precisely typical) you develop in that environment. The doubt of what you are doing is right of wrong. Being almost delivered up to the mercy of higher ranking officers with ambitions, who will gladly give up your life to reach their goal. All this is brought to you by the random thoughts of the individual soldier. The casting adds to the feeling of alienation: big names that are almost anonymous in the crowd of 'war-meat' and live and die just as the rest. In essence it's about the risk of loosing you're humanity. And what's the purpose of it all? As Sean Penn states at one point: 'It's all about property', which - to my opinion - is basically true.",8,0,0,13 December 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Romantic vampires
","Although I thoroughly dislike horror, I'm always drawn to the supernatural. Especially when they look like the threesome Cruise/Pitt/Banderas. The way the movie was made you almost expect to encounter a vampire on your next walk through the park, but in this case please let it be Louis (Pitt). The vampire as a predator but before all as the victim, given shape in a sensual setting. I liked it!",8,1,2,28 May 1999
