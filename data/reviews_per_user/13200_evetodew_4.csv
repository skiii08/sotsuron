The New World," Perfect by all means
","I've long been waiting for this movie, expecting it to be full of action, highly dynamic and typically British. I've imagined some sort of an ancient atmosphere, not very civilized and cursing Englishmen. And now that I finally saw it I must say that actually my expectations were not met. And yet, I must say that the movie couldn't be better! The music is calm and yet powerful. It's ideally suited to the whole film. What also stunned me was the way things were showed. By things I mean everything - nature, trees, grass, small things; things we might consider unimportant. Many are bore to the foreground. The acting was to a very high level and was a pleasure to see these actors on the screen. When the film finished I remained in my chair. But actually I wasn't thinking of anything, I was feeling. I had a warm feeling in me, I didn't even wanted to analyse it. It was enough it was there. I think this film has become one of my favourite films.",10,3,7,1 May 2006
Split," I really loved this movie
","I usually don't watch trailers for movies, because I want to be surprised by what I will actually see. And I am glad I didn't read anything about the movie, or watched trailers or read reviews. So, my opinion is purely mine.I have to say that the movie totally got me by surprise. I was expecting something shallow and interesting, but instead, the story is much more complicated and deep, and could be seen again (which I plan to do with my husband). I think what touched me the most was the ending, when the Beast spoke to the girl in the prison cell, before he left her untouched.That moment really touched me because of my own difficult past, and I can relate to both characters. At times, when you think you are too broken, you need a bit of comfort that you are not a complete castaway from society, because certain things happened in your past, which were not in your control.I believe there will be people to relate to the characters just like I did, and will understand what I mean.A really powerful movie, at least for me! I am glad I watched it!",10,13,21,22 October 2017
The Fountain," Moving, enchanting
","When I first saw the trailer I said to myself 'This one is going to sweep me off my feet.' and now, a couple of months ago I watched it, and definitely felt in love, instantly, with this movie! Actually it totally caught my attention, I felt for every single character in the story -- I felt Tom's desperation to save his wife, and I felt Izzy's utter belief in eternal life through death. Actually through my eyes I saw the story quite philosophical. There is this belief that life and death go hand in hand, even if it sounds absurd. And this movie represents in a modern and yet ancient way that belief.In the end, this title left me quite entranced. I totally admire Aronofsky!! Along with his 'Requiem for a dream', The fountain is my next favourite title. I will never forget the FEELING it left me with! I think that the most important! The feeling...",10,2,4,7 July 2007
Annihilation," Illogical choices, PMS behavior, Anti-climactic finale
","What I didnt like the most, and what constantly irritated me was the complete lack of intelligence and logic of the main characters. Also, the typical female PMS histeria just added to the completely irrational choices.Most of all, the ending was insanely anti-climactic and illogical. Basically, the end is a mess, but pretends to be just open to interpretation. The problem is, there's so little given to us (only questions) that we can't even interpret anything short of just fantasising.Visually it's a pretty movie, also the CGI was good especially in the more disturbing scenes. Also, the plot had so much potential, but unfortunately mostly lost.",5,4,8,27 December 2018
