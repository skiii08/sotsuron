Source Code," Jake Gyllenhaal is not a leading actor yet
","I would have given this film a higher rating ...except for the acting of Jake Gyllenhaal.Mr. Gyllenhaal is an exasperating actor to view on film. On one hand, he always overactsâ€“those blue eyes widen, his mouth slightly opens and the camera pans in for a close-up of Jake Gyllenhaal reacting to something. On the other hand, however, he possesses an intensity that is almost (but not quite) there that keeps me hoping all the time that he will make that leap from moderately-good technician to good actor--a leap which he hasn't managed to make yet.I've seen him in quite a few movies now, and I am of the opinion that he doesn't allow himself to be free when he acts. This often comes from fear of self-discovery. We all wish he would let go because there is a lot to yet discover underneath that bland exterior.",8,0,1,2 October 2011
Hustle & Flow," Terrance Howard's performance spectacular/script sinks in the creek
","Terrence Howard's performance wrenched this script from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Other members of the cast tried hard and shone well--but the script was so leaden that it was difficult for them to do as well as they should have (DJ Qualls, Taryn Manning, Taraji Henson were among those who were wonderful but who were pulled down by the script).For me, this movie was a collection of wonderful instruments (the actors) who were desperately striving to do better than the trivial tune they were given to play. With this cast and a script that was not the cliqued, run-of-the mill job that this was, this film easily would have been a 9/10 instead of a 6/7. What a loss!",7,0,1,22 September 2007
