United 93," we needed this
","This film is a must-see. It is one of the most important films since Schindler's list. It's not about polish, stars, or fiction. It's about one of the most real moments in the history of the western world. It's very moving and very important. It was well handled in real time and obviously uses primarily hard evidence and the records from that day. It was particularly interesting to see the scenes from the FAA and NORAD. The movie was that moving, I went out and made a donation to the United 93 monument. These people are heros. They are heros not just for the United States of America but also for the rest of us in the free world. We should never forget what they did. If you see one more movie, please make it this one.",10,0,2,23 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," OK, sorta 'Indiana Jones'/'The Game' mixture. But shoddy history.
","Cast, director, genre, and polish save the film from absolutely awful. It's still worth seeing if you want a mediocre mix of Indiana Jones type stuff with 'the game.' The theory behind it is primarily bunk, with major historical errors re council of Nicea, some unnecessary overly general slugging of Christianity's view of women, and some great embellishments re Opus Dei and other groups and past events. Good choices for cast. Of course, the main reason this film will do well is because of the cast. The other booster group will be pretty much anybody who wants a movie to slave any pre-existing prejudices they have concerning organized religion, people of faith, or the church in general. Go see the film, but if you're interested in it for the theory, make sure you read some reputable academic history on this stuff first.",4,0,2,23 May 2006
