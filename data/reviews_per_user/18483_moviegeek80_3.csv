Hereditary," Why all the hype?
","I'm honestly not sure where all the hype came from surrounding this movie. I have been an avid horror fan for over 30 years now and seen most every horror movie out there, so I am a bit 'desensitized' to what finds its way to the silver screen these days, and that being said, this movie falls short for me. The film's pacing was slow to begin, with a more 'hurry up and let's get to the good stuff' kind of vibe with the first hour being something similar to sitting in a doctor's office waiting, so don't be in a hurry when watching this film. Secondly, the acting was on point fro the exception of a couple scenes involving the son and his whining; seemed a bit fake to me. Thirdly, I am a stickler for lighting; it was very well done masking just what needed to be masked and nothing else giving the scenery and backdrops an eerie feel of course. The movie does have a couple 'PG-13 horror, cheap jump scares', which for me ruin a good horror film. Gore was present and very well done with use of both CGI and practical effects. Overall the film was OK. As the credits rolled, I turned to my wife (who is terrified by horror films and rarely watches them for that reason) and said 'honey, what did you think?', she replied 'was that it?....it really wasn't that scary.' So, there you have it. Don't take the kids as there is full nudity of the likes that's similar to what you may find in Game of Thrones, and the obvious medium-level gore, but I think my wife's response was spot-on....'was that it?' Go see it for yourself and be the judge. If you are a huge horror fan, you make like it, but I don't think it has any rewatchability.",5,0,1,18 June 2018
Green Room," Not that good....
","I began the desire to watch this film after reading the stellar reviews regarding it as 'brutal', 'graphic', and 'real'. Let me just tell you right now from someone who was numbed by the violence in Nekromantic, and the Guinea Pig series, this movie is just as lame as many new-age horror/thriller films Hollywood is spitting out these days. Now, with that being said...the film does have a good story that is believable at best. There are a few quick scenes of slight gore as a direct result of individual violence; merely enough to wet a gore- hound's appetite and nothing else. I felt the movie lacked in gore with the direction in which it headed and also felt it needed a boost in the character department. The character's did exemplify normal everyday behaviors (reactions) to their stimuli, but fell short with realism for me. The ending was good, but nothing I didn't see coming, so no real twist. I do give props to originality of the story line and the art department for all the damn green coloration....the movie is called 'Green Room' for Christ's sake...I get it already.",3,3,8,17 August 2016
It Chapter Two," Coulrophobia at its best!
","Better than the first chapter with its more visceral story-telling and frightening sequences, this entry into the 'written by Stephen King' genre, is well received. I have seen most every horror film out there, and one thing I can't stand are cheap-ass jump scares as when they are overdone, it takes away from the film...well this film has jump scares, but so well timed it leaves you thinking you know exactly when it will strike, but it doesn't. The CGI is mind blowing! Yes, you read that correctly horror fiends. There are scenes that had me squinting away from the screen as the 2 hour 45 minute run time played on, making we wonder, 'is this going to end?', but it doesn't. It just kept delivering one fright behind another. The lighting was a tad better than the first film I think with good use of shadows.",8,6,9,10 September 2019
