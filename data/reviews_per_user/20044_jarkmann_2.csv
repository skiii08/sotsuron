The Avengers," Must See!
","I saw the non 3D movie and it's was the BEST movie thus far for 2012! Story Line, Action, Teamwork, Ego, Fear and Humor. This movie surprised me!!I went with a friend to the 10:30am showing and it was packed, not a seat in the house. ONE RECOMMENDATION - Do NOT watch any of the trailers, be Surprised in the movie. I didn't watch any spoilers and I thought the movie was Excellent!All the Actors & Actresses did an incredible job!Most Certainly I will see it again, maybe this time I will go see the 3D version.",10,2,6,5 May 2012

*Spoiler Alert* IMO when most everyone fades to dust, the good guys lose and evil wins and the movie gets a good rating, there is something to be said about the level of humanity in our current world. How can it be a good movie when evil wins, most of the good are destroyed and everyone leaving the theater is in shock? When I left the movie, everyone was quite. It was like leaving a funeral and then people go online to give it a good rating? Uh?",1,40,108,1 May 2018
