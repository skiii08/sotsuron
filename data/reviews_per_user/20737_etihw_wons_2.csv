Skyfall," I really, honestly wish I liked this movie.
","I am a HUGE James Bond fan. There hasn't been a single Bond movie that I haven't liked, from Dr. No straight through to Quantum of Solace. All of them have had their place, even if they weren't my favorite of the franchise. Daniel Craig has become my favorite Bond of all of them. He brings real energy, dimension and heart to the role. I loved Casino Royale (I actually think it's my favorite of all the movies), and I really liked Quantum Of Solace. I was really, really looking forward to Skyfall, but wound up being sorely disappointed. So many plot holes, unexplained outrageous happenings, cheesy moments, *witty* banter lines that wound up flat-lining and a reversal in evolution for the Bond character, that I wound up leaving the theater feeling extremely disgruntled. There were a few things I did like about the movie, including Ralph Fiennes' character, and how he was brought in. I liked learning about Bond's past a little bit, and I loved the Astin Martin.I'm glad the movie is doing well, and I'm glad that many people seem to be liking it. But for me, it seriously missed the mark. Something ran amok, and I am sincerely hoping that the next one is better.",4,40,79,11 November 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Just As Good As The First One
","Okay, so I know there are a lot of haters out there for this movie. I also know that the critics trashed it.But I don't listen to critics. And I don't pay any attention to the haters either. So here's my review.Like I said in the subject, Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is just as good as the first one. So if you liked the first Transformers movie, you'll like the second. If you didn't like the first one, well then you probably won't like the second one. It's that simple.It's just a great feel good movie. No, there's nothing overly profound about it, but who cares? Some movies are made to be FUN, and entertaining. This certainly was fun and entertaining. The writing is amazing as far as incredibly funny lines go. The effects are top-notch, the acting is great (how can you fault Shia LaBeouf's acting??? I don't get that one), the music is great, the directing is great, and the plot is pretty darn good too. It's just a great movie. You leave the theater feeling zinged and happy, and that's what entertainment is all about.So I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. In fact, I saw it twice during its 5-day opening period. I loved it. Actually, I thought that the sequel might have just managed to go a little bit above the original. It would be a touch call though, to decide which one was better. But Revenge Of The Fallen is at least as good as the first one.",10,1,5,29 June 2009
