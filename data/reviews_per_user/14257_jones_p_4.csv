Hereditary," Formulaic
","Anyone familiar with Toni Colllette will know what a great actor she is - and she remains one in this movie. However she cannot save a staid formulaic story, banal even. Those who rave about this film are seeing something that just isn't there - maybe because they love the darkness of it. It is dark. But that's all it has. If you have even a slightly above average ability to grasp plot lines, nothing in this story will surprise you in my humble opinion. There is one surprising/shocking scene early on, but that's it. The ending, as has been commented on by others, is awful.",1,0,2,14 March 2019
Yesterday," Great music, laughs and tears
","Sometimes trailers show you all the best bits and so the actual film adds little and disappoints. Not here. The film lives up to expectations and in fact so much more. Very very poigniant towards the end, laughs throughout, and some tears. A great tribute to the song writing of Lennon McCartney and Harrison. Excellent.",10,23,46,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," If youre not a specific avengers fan, this movie is boring
","I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans.",2,71,116,2 May 2019
Joker," I'm not a dc/marvel fan, but this is BRILLIANT
","Intelligent, tragic, realistic (in a it-could-feasibly-happen way), superb music, and beautifully acted with great cinematography. Just great.",10,2,3,8 October 2019
