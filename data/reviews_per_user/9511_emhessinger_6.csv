The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It's true, there isn't much action, but still a good movie
","If you have already read the books you will enjoy it much more. True, there isn't a lot of action, no final battle scene, that's because it's a part one, trust me there is much more to come. We see more into the character's emotions and backstory (mainly Finnick) 'It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.'said Finnick. There isn't a lot of action, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. My favorite is still Catching Fire (the second one) and I have seen Mockingjay part 2. I would not consider it a 'failure' or a 'disappointment to its predecessors' but if you haven't read the books and you love action, it won't be your favorite. I would like to say though that even if you don't like part one, you should stick with it until the end because TRUST ME there is much better stuff on the way",7,1,4,3 April 2016
The Book Thief," A wonderful story about friendship and love
","The book was MUCH MUCH MUCH better, but it was better in a way that cannot be recreated on the screen (i don't know if that makes any sense to you) There are no drawn-out action fighting scenes, just ordinary people in an extraordinary point i history.The book remains my favorite book, and I highly recommend it, but the movie is probably only in the top 10 or 5. Told from the point of death, it's a beautiful story of love during the holocaust and WWII. I don't want to give anything away here, no spoilers! but I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU READ THE BOOK FIRST. It really is a book that will change your life",8,0,0,3 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Went above and beyond even my (high) expectations
","As a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, I can't tell you how exited I was for this movie to come out. For over a year I had a countdown app to keep of how many days were left until the 18th. But, after having read cursed child and being disappointed with how she continued the series, I was cautious about how she would illustrate the past. But Fantastic Beasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could have ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years for the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still love it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to see this movie asap.",9,42,84,20 November 2016
Alice in Wonderland," A beautiful remake of a classic fairy tale - Visually stunning
","This movie is thoroughly enjoyable for families and anyone with an appreciation for visual affects. You truly are transported from the dull, pastel-colored ordinary world, to a dark world full of magic and curiosity. Be warned that this is not the happy and whimsical animation of 1951, it's much darker, and in my opinion, better. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were downright fabulous, though that's far from unexpected. I had never head of Mia but I approve of her performance. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is as enthralled by visuals as I am. It truly is just beautiful, even if you could care less about the plot.",7,0,0,6 August 2016
La La Land," I think I was flying
","Ineffable; (a.) too great or extreme to be expressed or described with wordsI think that movies are an art. And the point of art is to move you, to make you feel something, to make you feel alive. La La Land did this incomparably. It's whimsical, colorful, big, bright, and BEAUTIFUL. I felt as though I had floated straight out of my seat to spin among the stars with them. It's something like... laughing in sunlight, walking while dizzy, looking at the stars, violently purple sunsets, the coolness of tears on your skin, laughing out loud, the sinking feeling after waking up from an amazing dream, driving fast, dancing without a care in the world, spinning in circles until you're laughing on the floor with the world spinning, hugging someone as tight as you can, and the heat of the sun on your skin all wrapped into one ineffable movie.",10,3,9,26 February 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," No words for it other than BEAUTIFUL
","This has been my favorite movie for over three years now and I cannot even begin to describe how much I love it. It's hilarious and heartbreaking wrapped into one. It's the literally translation of bittersweet and it has been a comfort to me on many lonely nights. It's about forgiveness, forgiving others and mostly forgiving yourself. It's about letting go of the past and leading a life not dictated by what haunts you. It's about the magic of storytelling, and to me, what Disney is all about.'That's what we storytellers do, we instill hope again and again.' As someone who has idolized Walt Disney and been a huge fan of the history of Walt since seventh grade, I know that there are some fibs here and there, trust me. It's true that it shouldn't be used as a source of research, but let me be very clear when I say that SOME REALLY QUITE HARMLESS LIES DO NOT MAKE THE MOVIE DISHONEST OR BAD. IGNORE ALL THE REVIEWS SAYING THAT SINCE IT IS NOT 100% ACCURATE IT IS BAD. please do yourself a favor and watch this movie, I don't know how else to put it.",9,1,1,6 August 2016
