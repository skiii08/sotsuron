Walk the Line," Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix
","Joaquin phoenix is one of the most underrated actors of all time. His performances almost always outshine the films he's in. This film offers amazing performances by all the cast, including one of Reese Witherspoon's best yet. But for me it's Joaquin's sometimes subtle, sometimes explosive performance of the man in black that makes this film. One thing that is clear about Joaquin now is that he takes risks. He goes above and beyond to bring authenticity to his characters. He doesn't fall into the typical Hollywood trap just for the fame. That is definitely what made Johnny Cash stand out as a performer. His rebellious nature to maintain credibility in his music. Joaquin brought this legend to life with his colorful performance. In my opinion, the Oscar belonged to Joaquin that year. Definitely one of the best actors of our time!",8,0,0,22 May 2012
Taxi Driver," Possibly the best character bio of all time
","The film was released when the darkness of our culture began creeping into the theater. Movies were more raw, authentic and made a huge impact on audiences. Many of them made strong cultural and political statements. More young filmmakers were stepping out of traditional techniques and adding their own unique, artistic vision of style. Among these was Martin Scorsese, who has now become one of the most powerful directors of all time. And his successful career took off in 1976 with the release of a masterpiece... Taxi Driver.This is a near perfect film, held together by intriguing story, brilliant direction, and perfect acting. Shot almost like a documentary, the film is entirely in the main characters perspective. With Paul Schrader's structure, every line has a meaning, every shot has a purpose, all adding to the story. The almost dreamlike sequences make you question whether or not what you are seeing is really happening. This film will make you realize the impact the vision of a great director can have on a film. Robert De Niro gives one of the most realistic, most haunting performances in film history. The character of Travis Bickle was portrayed with such subtle authenticity. He fully inherited the character, mentally and physically altering himself for the role. He didn't have to act... he was Travis Bickle. He adds so much to the character that makes this movie unforgettable. His famous quirky monologues add a touch of humor to the film, but are also quite disturbing and effective. There's a reason Robert De Niro is dubbed as one of the greatest actors of all time, and his performance in Taxi Driver is that reason.This film may not be for everyone. Many viewers may find it hard to relate to the character of Travis Bickle. He is the ultimate antihero. But if you like like well made, character driven films, this is a classic that is just as strong today, if not stronger, than it was when it was released in 1976. I highly recommend this film.",10,1,2,23 May 2012
The Exorcist," One of the most disturbing films of all time
","There are those who say this film had no effect on them. That it was immensely overrated. It is obvious that there has been a lot of hype surrounding it since its release almost 40 years ago. It has been called the 'scariest movie of all time'. Do you know why? Because it is.I had my doubts before I saw it. I was prepared for the film to be far less impressive than everyone claimed. Then I watched it. I was completely stunned by it. The film is actually appalling. The buildup is slow and effective. Then the film hits hard and continues to shock you until the end. It is so merciless, going above and beyond anything you thought was possible. The fact that all of this is happening to a 12 year old girl is disturbing, to say the least. I still can't believe the filmmakers got away with it. I don't see how anyone thinks this film isn't disturbing. Everything seems so real. The special affects are unparalleled even today. The imagery is uncanny. It is visually terrifying, yet it leaves a lot to the imagination as well. The performance from all the cast is extraordinary, especially by Ellen Burstyn as the mother, and of course Linda Blair. Jason Miller is also incredible as the young priest losing his faith. The feel of authenticity makes this film even more frightening. I have never seen a film more terrifying than this. The Exorcist is unforgettable and still earns its title as the scariest movie of all time.",8,1,2,23 May 2012
Call Me by Your Name," A Raw Depiction of Romance
","This gorgeous film will cut anyone who sees it to the core. It was carefully crafted with the softest of brushstrokes from director Luca Guadagnino. The striking visuals and setting are seamlessly presented to the audience and go hand in hand with the love story we are witnessing. The story, and the way it plays out, is hauntingly effective. This feat is achieved with such an intimate, soft tone that feels painfully real. The production takes a step back and allows the story and the characters to just be, and the end result is overwhelmingly moving. The performances by everyone, but of course by the two leads, are entirely credible with their naturalistic delivery of dialogue and internal emotional resonance. This movie is beautiful in the most natural way, depicting a bittersweet romance in a manner rarely seen in film today. It is pure beauty and will go down among the most effective and memorable romances in film history.",9,9,17,25 December 2017
The Dark Knight," One of the greatest films
","This is not a superhero movie. This is an iconic masterpiece disguised as a superhero movie. You can tell the filmmakers cared about the film, not for the sake of money, but for the film itself. It is brilliantly made, and so captivating in every aspect. The visual style is phenomenal, more watchable than most big budget films. But it's the enthralling story and incredible acting that truly makes this film legendary. So much authenticity has been seen in the best films in history. The legendary dark knight is not portrayed as a hero, but almost as an antihero. This film is dark, and takes risks that were actually rather shocking. Not really for kids in my opinion, but a film for moviegoers in general. The acting is uncanny. Christian Bale makes the perfect Batman, and he has transformed him into an iconic character. He is one of the best, most powerful actors and is one of my personal favorites. Michael Cain was phenomenal, as well as Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman is a legendary actor and is great as Commissioner Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great actress, and adds some fire to her role as Rachel. Heath Ledger was shocking. Legendary Jack Nicholson played the Joker almost 20 years earlier, but Heath Ledger gave a more authentic, interesting, and memorable performance, surpassing Nicholson... that is unheard of! His portrayal of The Joker was haunting. He well deserved the Oscar, and his performance will go down as one of the greatest in film history. This film is a must see, and will forever be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time.",9,0,2,17 July 2012
There Will Be Blood," powerful and memorable
","This film will go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. The story of an over ambitious oil man is told so effectively by the talented mind of director Paul Thomas Anderson. He draws us in with his eccentric style and holds our attention until the very end. The movie is brilliantly made, and quite unlike anything I have ever seen. The cinematography is stunning; the sights, sounds, and the epic scope of this movie are breathtaking. The acting in this film is on a whole other level than almost any other film in my opinion. All the cast give amazing performances. But Daniel Day Lewis... there are no words to describe him. He completely disappears in this role. His mere presence in the film is unsettling. But his intense performance works because of its subtly. He doesn't have to forwardly express his hatred and anger often for you to believe him. He inhabits these traits so perfectly you can just sense it. This is no doubt one of the best performances of all time. And personally one of my favorites. This is an instant classic. I strongly recommend it.",10,2,5,19 September 2012
Joker," Unapologetic Comic Book Horror Masterpiece
","There is a surprisingly high number of critics calling this movie empty and meaningless. I believe they are having a difficult time differentiating between the film being void of substance and their own feelings of emptiness. Joker indeed left a pit in my stomach. The kind you get when you witness something traumatizing. And this film is traumatic in the best way.The intricate camera work is almost too close for comfort. But man, is this a beautiful looking movie. The colors are rich... the reds of the streetlights, the blue haze of the city.... creates an atmosphere that puts the viewer right into this world. The wide shots of Gotham are absolutely stunning, even as it's showing us the dirty, grimy nastiness of it.The story Todd and the filmmakers came up with works pretty well. They borrow bits and pieces of material from the comics, but they created new beats for the story that helps it stand on its own. Not to spoil anything, but the way they introduce the lore of our characters heroic counterpart is quite affective. At first I thought it was far reaching, but by the end it comes together and makes for quite an engaging story. As for the motivations of the Joker, there is a complicated tight rope to balance. But it is understandable here. We can understand Arthur is spiraling and we can sympathize with his internal (and external) struggle. But the film is not asking you to root for or forgive him for his actions. We know he's a villain.The violence... it's there. But not in quantity. Most other superhero films or action films have more fighting, violence, and more of
A body count. HOWEVER, the violence is brutal and visceral. This is what I believe is bothering people. As it should. It depicts violence in a horrifying realistic way.So Joaquin Phoenix... I don't know what to really say here. He is an artist. A mad one. I respect this actor so much, and I am in complete awe of him. This man sold this. I believed it. Everything from the physical to the internal. His movements were slightly unnatural, inhuman. Behind his eyes was a pain that we recognize is there, but there is no way we can fathom the gravity behind it. his moments of emotional outbursts are so sporadic and unpredictable.... and he isn't TRYING to have them.... I could tell he was surpassed that and was trying to hold it back. That is completely amazing to me. He isnt acting he is showing us this character, like a piece of art. No one, NO ONE can deny that this performance is extraordinary. It's one that will be remembered in the future as one of the best in history. It transcends a normal performance. It's visceral, it's terrifying, it's an experience to watch. Joaquin Phoenix is an actor in the true sense. He is, in my opinion, one of the best... in history.This is a difficult film, it's not lighthearted at all. It's a shame if you miss this though, as it's a work of art. I would recommend it as a great film, but be cautious of the blunt nasty darkness of it. It is truly a horrific masterpiece.",9,1,1,4 October 2019
Arrival," Science Fiction Masterpiece!
","Science Fiction started out as a thought provoking genre that explored mystery and possibility. Films were made to raise questions about the unknown... The audience was introduced to groundbreaking ideas. Over time, technology developed, and film-makers took advantage of that. We began to see fantastic looking, big-budget pictures that, while being a marvel to look at, lacked the intrigue and mystery that used to be so rich in Sci-fi. Sci-fi, for the most part, became dependent on flashy imagery as opposed to master story telling. Some films rose above this trend, and recently we have been given some great Sci-fi films. However, Arrival surpasses these and goes down as one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time. We are given a simple premise that we have seen in movies before. Alien space crafts land on earth and strike fear among the human race. As the film progresses, the story unravels slowly... and transitions into mind-bending, unconventional territory. It goes in a completely new direction that is eye-opening and moving. There are important themes and ideas exposed to us that grab our interest and do not let go. The story is beautifully complex, and challenges its audience to think. Visually, this film is breathtaking. The direction by Denise Vilineuve takes viewers to a new level of experiencing a film. Gorgeous cinematography and camera-work that is sometimes intimate, sometimes grand, and often unconventional, adding an experience that is both hauntingly surreal and authentic. The visual effects are almost perfectly executed, blending into the films dark, raw style. The script, equipped with realistic dialogue and deep character development, makes this film stand out. The characters interact with subtle authenticity that feels natural. However, the strongest point of the film is Amy Adams. She embodies a character that is so vulnerable yet convincingly strong-willed. Her performance is all about subtle realism. She has perfected the art of living through a character as opposed to forcing the character out. The film rests on her and she carries it beautifully. All the other actors give convincing performances as well, delivering their dialogue and interacting with each other in such a natural way. Arrival is a rare gem. It transcends beyond what an audience is used to experiencing. It is a film that cares about what it tells its viewers. It is a film with a purpose. Along with the classic and groundbreaking films of Kubric, Spielburg, Scott, and Lucas, Arrival is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.",9,7,17,11 November 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," Disturbing and powerful
","Jonathan Demme's masterpiece stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. It is distinguished in every aspect. The direction, the writing, the acting... all superb. It captivates, disturbs, and fascinates the viewer. This is a film that plays on the senses; on fear, on imagination, and on emotions.The director's visual style paints a dark, bleak, yet colorful world that depicts the ugly side of humanity. The story itself is phenomenal. It is intriguing, unsettling, and is told so effectively. The cast is its strongest point. They are what make this film unforgettable. Anthony Hopkins is a powerhouse in this film, dominating the role of Hannibal Lecter, with his leering stare and his creepy demeanor.Yet there's a charm and wit that draws you in. You forget that he's a psychopathic killer. Jodie Foster is incredible. She gives her character so much depth. She disappears in her role with her subtle mixture of strength and vulnerability. Ted Levine deserves more recognition for his role as serial killer Buffalo Bill. He is so disturbing and appalling in this film. He gives a chilling performance. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie.I highly recommend this classic if you've never seen it. It hasn't aged at all, in my opinion. The failed attempts at cinema today make this film even stronger today than it was in 1991. It is truly a masterpiece.",9,1,1,26 July 2012
