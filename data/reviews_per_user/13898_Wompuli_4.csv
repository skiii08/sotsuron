Your Name.," So beautiful!
","This movie was so beautiful and emotional. The plot may seem typical but it was for me, unpredictable. This is a story of boy and girl who switches body and live each others lives in different city and there are funny happenings during this.Shred some tears and watched this at least three times. Beautiful music and lovely voice actors!Trully recommend to watch the original first before seeing the Hollywood version:)",10,1,4,31 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Awesome Epic Emotional Grande
","After watching all the previous movies related to this one, I was excited to see this one. The crazy ending of Infinity War left me moody and waiting for answers.Endgame is funny, sad and major! I laughed so much watching this and shred some tears. If you have seen previous movies you can totally get all the jokes and winks toward us Marvel fans :)Worth to watch at least three times! I seriously can not get over this movie!",10,7,11,28 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Amazing Funny Worthy
","This movie includes funny moments, major loss and crossovers that gives goosebumps.There are a lot of characters in this movie but all of them has a true meaning in this movie. The past Marvel movies (Guardians of the Galaxy, Black panther etc.) has lead to this point.I have watched this movie more than three times and every time it still gets me. Good music, good actors, memorable scenes.",10,1,2,28 May 2019
Coco," Beautiful and emotional story
","I watched this only because of high ratings in IMDB and i am not disappointed. I cried and laughed. This movie left me a good feeling, like almost every Pixar movies does.
The music was not that memorable, but the plot is interesting and and of course the drawings, colour and imagination is beautiful.Prepare some tissue while watching this :)",9,1,1,12 June 2019
