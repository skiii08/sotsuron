The Blair Witch Project," yikes!
","I'm glad I had a good idea what this movie would be like when I went to see it; I think it would have been too much for me had I gone in 'cold.'  After eagerly anticipating this movie all summer, I can honestly say the only thing I was disappointed in was the one idiot in the whole theater (who happened to be behind me) who felt it necessary to continue saying how stupid the movie was throughout the entire thing.  I notice he stayed for the whole movie, however.  No one left, and no one moved or said anything throughout the whole last half of the movie.  It was the quietest theater I've ever been in.  This is the only movie I've been to where I felt more scared an hour after I left the theater than I did while watching it.  If you're expecting 'Scream,' don't even go--you will hate it.  If you like having the hair on the back of your neck stand up while you're watching a blank screen, you want to catch this one.  I have a feeling it would be scarier on video, at home, alone, in the dark.  I expect better things from Hollywood now that I've seen what these guys could do with a fraction of Hollywood's resources.",10,1,2,30 July 1999
