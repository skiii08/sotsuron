The King's Speech," 'The N-N-N-azis are C-C-Coming!'
","This film had me in its pocket for the first half hour or so. It depicts 1930s London in a grimly authentic way and Helena Bonham Carter is a rather fetching Queen Mother. Firth holds the screen and the two kids - one of them from Outnumbered, the other looking like a young Lily Allen - are charming. I enjoyed the relationship between the excellent Geoffrey Rush and Firth, even if it's a reversal of My Fair Lady, the commoner advising the posho on speech.Then Michael Gambdon's King George V is wheeled out to deliver the most awful leaden-footed exposition, all about how Germany is in enthral to the Nazis and how Bertie's feckless brother is involved with this Wallis woman. Oh, it's going to be one of those films is it, I thought, and I was right. Though Firth and Rush continue to be very good, every so often there's this cack-handed exposition, a character popping up to deliver a Ladybird book version of history, to remind us why it's important that the second in line gets his elocution right. It's not really too accurate as this takes place in the mid-1930s, when Hitler really wasn't seen as that much of a threat, especially by the Royal family. Certainly Baldwin, the Prime Minister, had no particular opinion on him as yet, so they're truncating events big time. Okay, Churchill is wheeled out to say the same thing, (Timothy Spall in a role that could be out of Comic Strip) but Churchill was seen as a dog barking at the moon back then.Exposition is like a hairpiece, if you notice it it's not doing its job right.We're artlessly spoonfed information as to why Wallis Simpson is A Bad Person, just mean to accept it like some gullible courtier. With a line thrown in for American audiences: 'It's not that she's American...' It's all too broadly written.Otherwise just as Rush was too old to be Peter Sellers in his biopic, Firth is surely way too old to be the Bertie and looks a lot older than Guy Pearce, who is meant to be his older brother. Anthony Andrews pops up as Baldwin and is unreconisable from his Bridehead days. Actually there's the sense that this script has been on the backburner for so long, Andrews might have been considered for the role of King Edward 20 years ago, and Pride and Prejudice's Jennifer Ehle, who is Logie's wife in this, would have made a decent fist of Wallis Simpson's bony carnality. And Firth would have been the right age.By this time I was recasting the film in my mind, and came up with Brit comic David Mitchell as Bertie (the same voice as Firth) and his Peep Show compadre Robert Webb as the rakish, carefree Edward, that would have worked rather well. The whole thing at times had the feel of Churchill: The Movie.",6,7,14,21 January 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Lost me from 'hello'
","Not much to see here. It opens with Cruise strapped to a chair for info, about to watch his generic wife be shot dead, and reacting like he's Joel trying to bargain over the phone with Guido the killer pimp in Risky Business. It's like, why would I want to suspend my disbelief over Cruise's shaky acting so I can believe some poor woman is about to get offed? 15 mins in I was ready to switch off. I don't believe in the Tom Cruise persona any more, it worked for the 1980s and 90s but those days are long gone and he's doing the same thing, it rings a bit hollow. He doesn't seem to have a real relationship much with anyone in this, save the Ving Rhames guy from before. They're all just actors brought in.It picks up a bit with two good set pieces in succession including a bridge out Florida scene , but it's all so horribly generic. They try to make it like '24' but it doesn't quite work, it reminded me of that ho hum Sean Connery film Entrapment where they go off to foreign climes to try some heist you don't honestly believe in though it looks quite nice.I'd like to see Cruise expand his range, play a neurotic husband being cheated on, or a pompous professorial nervy type. He just can't do that earnest, young buck schtick any more and still be interesting.",4,1,2,9 September 2008
The Expendables 2," Pro-Celebrity Golf for the Modern Age
","Some of us of a certain age may remember the days of pro-celebrity golf, where past-it stars would invite members of the public to pay to see them knock a few golf balls around paired with actual golf pros; Bob Hope with Seve Ballesteros, Sean Connery with Gary Player, that sort of thing, Bruce Forsythe, Ronnie Corbett, a kind of Stella Street scenario.The Expendables 2 is a bit like that, you get to see Sly and Arnie back again, but young guns like Jason Stratham lend a bit of credibility in the action stakes. Also this film reminded me of Sinatra's Ocean's 11, with really was rather turgid for the most part, lots of tired banter and the sense it's made to give them all something to do.It has a bravaura opening scene, and it's easy to overlook that some of the background shots seem painted in. It's let down by the awful, clunky banter, delivered with no sense of timing or expertise. Is it meant to be bad? Is it ironic? Who knows. It maybe comes from Sly's enablers and hangers-on laughing at his jokes for the last two decades, making him think he's funny, a bit like McCartney making Give My Regards to Broad Street all those years ago, imagining his day to day life is really interesting.But this does seem interesting, it works on different parts of your brain. It's for folk who think the Lethal Weapon films were too Ivy League, too clever, too witty, too Waspish maybe. Maybe that kind of wit and cerebral activity creates a kind of mental malaise, who knows. It reminds me of the Tea Party kind of thinking, if you can call it thinking. Reject the rational, reject discernment, it only makes your head hurt. Or maybe this is like WWF, and I'm missing the point, in that with those wrestling bouts, it's actually meant to be fixed, it's not for real. It's a real different mindset - but this film is for those who rated Tango & Cash over Riggs and Murtagh.",6,0,2,1 September 2012
Skyfall," Only in a Bond film
","These have been patriotic times for the UK. The Diamond Jubilee. The Olympic Games. I went along with it, you'd have to be a curmudgeon not to. Or Morrissey.But Heaven Knows, the new film Skyfall has me getting how our miserable pop star feels. I just can't buy into it. The applause given to this series' longevity seems a bit, well, Trigger's Broom. If you recall the gormless road sweeper from Only Fools and Horses, 'Thirty years I've used this broom! I've changed its head three times, and its handle four times...' Which means, of course, that it's hardly the same broom, is it? To me, these films don't stir the same feelings they did when I was a kid. Why should they, just because they feature a character with the same name in it? The first two Jason Bournes, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill Volume 1 - these get me going the way the old Bond films used to.The phrase 'Only in a Bond film' once referred to the quirky, the classy, the bizarre, traits that lifted the series above other films.But now the phrase means something very different.Only in a Bond film would the 'hero' leave a fellow agent to his death to obey orders from his superior, and it's like we're meant to admire him! Craig's Bond disobeys his boss whenever it takes his fancy, but not in this case. We have a name for a bloke like this in England - jobsworth. Maybe that could be the name of the next Bond film, sung by Adele: Jobsworth! / Get the T-shirt / From the foyer / That'll be another 15 pounds please... Okay, we soon forget this as we're in a chase and there's some good banter going on, but only in a Bond film do I find it just a bit hard to hear the dialogue, as it's been since Die Another Day, it's just a bit muffled. Is to put the audience on the edge of its seat? Only in a Bond film does the hero slam into another car so it goes crashing into a bunch of 'natives', oh it's okay, he's British and they're not, who cares? Contrast later when you see just how polite and solicitous he is with Brit commuters on the Tube.Only in a Bond film will the hero smash the bike he's riding into bridge hoping to somehow get thrown onto the train, rather than just pulling up to the bridge like you or I would.Only in a Bond film will the lead actor move like a crab and no one really cares - it's cool! If you ever watched Octopussy and thought what the film needed was General Orlov in a fight on the speeding train in West Berlin, you're in luck, cos that's just how Craig looks in this scene.Only in a Bond film would we get all this tripe about what a wonderful song Adele has come up with. It's not a good tune really, you wouldn't look at it twice if it weren't a Bond song. It's lushly produced, just as the film looks good, and some are fooled by window dressing.Just as Sam Mendes' The Road to Perdition looked great, had ambition but just didn't move along, so it is here. These directors shouldn't be let near a Bond film. As with Marc Forster, who did the last one, I sense a slumming it vibe, as if to say, well, if this doesn't make sense who cares - it's only a Bond film.This is the Craig and Dench show. Both their characters are talked down - with total justification! They both seem to be idiots. Craig is said to be old and past it - only two films back they were trying to make out he was the young kid on the block! He's only been on two missions, or only two we've seen. This is one way the film tries to tap in to Bond's iconography at the expense of him as a real person.I think the nadir is when he cockily says he can save the trapped girl in Shanghai. Righty-ho! Sneaks on her ship, easily done. Walks naked into her shower before saying hello. He thinks he can just show up on his own to meet the villain. It starts to feel like The Man with the Golden Gun at this point, in terms of general believability.CGI buildings on the island, like The Expendables 2.When the helicopters show up to rescue Bond there's this daft jubilant bit of brass! Like, hey ho, he's safe! No matter the girl he went out to save is, er, dead! Only in a Bond film would the actress get so much publicity for screen time that amounts to what, about 10 minutes? The problem here is a subtext. The writer seems to be saying, hey, M is Bond's Mummy substitute! By taking her back to his own family home, her death allows him to grieve for the first time his parents' death. Seen in that way it's sort of clever, it's only as a straight narrative it's drivel.Of course, the fans have plenty of reasons to explain away these plot holes (and there are too many to list); though you feel like you're arguing with the Tea Party. Or they say just go with it, there have been plot holes in plenty of Bond films. Well, up to a point, but those movies were fun comedy thrillers. Craig's Bond pitches itself as grim, realistic. I don't want to fess up to being a Bond fan when it means applauding the kind of rubbish we've been fed for the last decade or more. They say patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, it's also the last refuge of the rubbish filmmaker.",3,16,33,27 November 2012
The Hangover," Not quite Ferris Bueller...
","Okay, it's about a stag night that goes wrong, four thirtysomething lads are heading out to the city of sin, Las Vegas - when they awake the next morning things have gone badly wrong but they can't remember any of it and have to retrace their steps.I enjoyed it enough but it didn't quite hit the spot, somehow I felt Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, 40 Years Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) would have made it work better. It has the flavour of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but we don't quite get time to know the characters and the humour is a bit broad, a bit obvious in that it's designed to evoke the audience sympathies. Ooh, one of their friends is a bit weird with a horrid beard and lets his pants hang down of his backside! He's not allowed to be near schools it seems! What a character! Yawn. None of the actors are really comic actors. I didn't quite warm to them. Towards the end of the film it loses touch with any semblance of reality, unlike 'kids'' movies like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller, where you had your heart in your mouth towards the finale.What it did have in common with Apatow's films is the vein of misogyny he gets accused of; all of the women are shrews bar the happy hooker in Vegas played inevitably by Heather Graham.Great soundtrack, Vegas looks terrific but not a hugely endearing film.",6,3,7,21 July 2009
Midnight in Paris," Should have shown the script to Hemingway
","I picked this DVD up in a backstreet, but when I got it home Paris Hilton was nowhere to be seen! Swindlers, I tell you! Okay, okay, this is Woody Allen's latest and again, another 'return to form'. My sister said it was delightful, but she had no expectations. Any UK guy might recall a BBC comedy called Goodnight Sweetheart from the 1980s in which a young man steps into a pub and finds himself back in the 1940s, where he meets and falls in love with a belle from back then, committing a kind of time-travellers adultery. This has a similar theme only it's an American Owen Wilson (who looks not wholly unlike Nicholas Lyndhurst) who gets in a Rolls and finds himself back in Paris in the 1920s, his ideal time.It's a decent premise. I didn't take to the film however. It has lovely opening shots of Paris, but the cinematography is very plain and grainy and Woody's style is very point and shoot throughout. Don't expect much depth here. Wilson falls into the trap of just imitating Woody, like most his leading men do, and it's a distraction. Actually, I thought Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory would have been excellent in the role, as he has real comic chops and I'm not sure Wilson does really.Michael Sheen (Blair) turns up as a pompous bore, the sort you see in Allen's films sometimes, and gets plaudits for being wholly unlike his Blair persona. Initially you find yourself thinking that talk of him being a Bond villain is really not wide of the mark at all. Until, that is, you realise that he's doing another of his impersonations - it's a young Anthony Hopkins. Again, Sheen is not bad, but doesn't really nail the humour of the situation, though it gets indulgent audience titters.The scenes where our hero finds himself in 1920s Paris lack authenticity and is all too broadly drawn for my taste, with Hemingway seeming a real bore and the whole thing might as well be set in a 1920s themed speakeasy bar in Shoreditch. All these literary legends of the time take to Wilson, though he seems to bring nothing to the party at all, has nothing of interest to say to them. And you never get much sense of why he might feel disillusionment for the time: wouldn't a neurotic like Allen realise that they never washed their hands after using the john back then? What about the casual racism of the time? The smoke, the dirt in the air? It's all rather superficially done. As Hemingway says at one point, it doesn't matter what the story is, so long as it's told well, and I don't think this was told very well.Carla Brunei puts in a good cameo, she's actually quite good.",6,3,6,10 October 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Should Have Walked Away...
","It's third time unlucky, yet again. First Spider-man 3, then Shrek 3, Pirates: End of the World. And now this. It's not as bad as Ocean's Twelve (but then, what could be?) and Vegas has never looked better. Great cinematography, especially as the plane lands at the airport, with all the hotel resorts visible from the runway.But it's an awful grind nonetheless. When the two decent gags you've already seen in the trailer, you know you're in trouble. The McGuffin (plot premise) is quite dodgy. With the first, you know it's a) the money and b) Ocean getting Tess (Julia Roberts) back that's the motivator. Like most heist films, much of the fun is the getting together of the gang. It's hard to mess that up, whether it's The Dirty Dozen or The Wild Geese etc.With Ocean's Twelve, well, er, they had to get the money back for the guy they robbed. Not so thrilling. Spoils the 'happy ever after' finale of the first one.Here the Elliot Gould character, Reubens, is stiffed by new casino kingpin Al Pacino and has a heart attack. So the rest of the gang decide to take Pacino down to cheer Reubens up. Sounds better than it reads. You think, how could Reubens be so naive as to trust this shark, anyway? He's hung out with crooks, after all. It's all a dodgy premise that you don't believe, nor the whole Mission Impossible routine they go into right away. It's like watching The Krypton Factor and none of that cool David Holmes music can alter that. It's just boring.Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles, though that may be no bad thing. They're not even referenced by the leads, though. You don't really believe this gang would risk heading for the slammer for decades, estranged from their loved ones, just to generate a pep talk for their ill chum.Any humour is sort of understated twee and self-regarding. Or just naff. Eddie Izzard shows up again, but oddly he can't really carry a role off like this. He's not larger than life, his voice is too light, he can't measure up to Clooney or Pitt.There's an awful lot of talk and exposition (which is what the Izzard character is brought in to do, it seems) from start to finish but I couldn't catch a lot of it. I mean, really, you just have to strain a bit to hear the dialogue all the way through. It's off-putting, and it seems to be a trend with modern blockbusters. You almost suspect it's deliberate, to put the audience on tenterhooks.We're meant to believe the gang can just buy off any minion in Willy Bank's supercasino just like that, bribing them to do stuff whenever it's convenient.There are one or two flickers on interest during the final heist... and that's it. The finale is a rip-off from the first one, substituting fireworks for the beauty of the Bellagio fountains, and a nondescript Sinatra song for Debussy's lovely Clare da Lune.The film looks good, and if you're heading to Vegas for the first time, check it out on DVD. But don't spend money going to see it. It's a real grind. Even one hour in I was waiting for it to be over, and thinking, wow, there's another HOUR to go...Diminishing returns here: after the first big win, we've ploughed money into the box office and got less back for it.",4,28,130,30 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Steven Spielberg once said...
","Steven Spielberg once said that he rued the day when it would be more practical to design huge sets with a computer, rather than going to the trouble of building them. This film shows he had a point.Think of your favourite scenes in a James Bond film: Blofield's mock volcano in You Only Live Twice, his alpine lair in On Her Majesty's Secret Service or perhaps Hugo Drax's space station in Moonraker. Now imagine if all of Ken Adam's set pieces had never actually been built, but done with CGI, as with Attack of the Clones. It would lose something, wouldn't it?With actual set designs your enjoyment is on two levels. There's a sense of admiration at the real-life feat of having designed and constructed it. I'm not saying that CGI design isn't skilful, but it doesn't impart the same kind of enjoyment somehow - and, of course, it doesn't always convince. The same goes with stunts. 007's ski jump in the pre-credits of one Bond film is an audacious idea, made more enjoyable by the fact that we know a stuntman actually performed it. You could fake it now with CGI, but again, something would be lost.That said, George Lucas could have a trick up his sleeve here. As noted, the effects in Attack of the Clones are far more advanced than those of Star Wars: Episode IV, which had a more beat-up look. But what if Episode III contains a scene of apocolyptic destruction, plunging the universe into the Dark Ages? That would account for the 'backward' look of Episode IV. And the drift of events in Episode III foreshadows this - the overpopulation, the hi-tech prevalence, the sense of impending destruction, the fall of the Roman Empire and all that...Just a thought.",Null,0,0,30 May 2002
Wanted," 'Come with me if you want to live'
","Hopelessly derivative generic action flick based on a comic book. It's either that or a computer game these days.It's about pod worker Wesley Gibson, played by James McAvoy of Atonement and Last King of Scotland fame this time putting on an American accent. He hates his job, his life, his co-workers etc, then out of the blue this lush assassin (Angelina Jolie) is hauling him off into a different destiny. So far, so The Matrix, but then there's the 'Come with me if you want to live' action scene where they're being chased by a nasty assassin and she's protecting him. It also reminded me of Weird Science, as the nerd is mooning over her, too.It's all a bit like Hit-man, the difference being the story arc. In Hit-man, the assassin is a cool deadly type who learns real feelings thanks to a girl he picks up, in Wanted it's a loser who learns to be a cool deadly type thanks to being picked up by a girl, it's reversed. I do prefer Wanted because the two leads are more charismatic and it has two outstanding action scenes.That said, while I like McAvoy as an actor on principle, I'm not sure he can really carry a film like this. I didn't care for his US accent, so far it's all a bit like Ewan McGregor when he tried to break into the States. He lacks the air of mystery or paradox. Really they may as well have cast an American actor. Jolie is terrific, I must admit she's a real celluloid turn on and you don't get many of those these days.Although it picks up towards the end, this is a real dumb flick . I think it needed a European director to tap into its moral ambiguity. I mean, someone tells you to be an assassin and you just go with it? Also, this nerd is meant to be trained up but it seems to take place within a few weeks rather than a year... It has lots of visual tricks to distract from the fact that most of it is nicked from other films.",5,13,36,26 June 2008
Collateral," Never Really Convinces
","It's a dazzling looking film, but Michael Mann's Collateral brings out the nitpicker in me. So many times it doesn't ring true that early on I felt alienated from it all.The premise is intriguing  Cruise's hit-man 'buys' Jamie Foxx's LA cabbie for the night, roping him into his killing spree. Echoes of the Colin Farrell vehicle Phone Booth, as the victim can't get out of his situation and just has to sweat it out.For it to work, however, you need to squirm with a sense of Foxx's shame, humiliation and awkwardness as the charismatic hit-man takes control. You should get a horrible feeling in your loins, the shame of feeling your maleness under threat, a stab of impotence. The thriller Breakdown with Jeff Bridges did this well.But not here. Cruise just doesn't engender that emotion. He doesn't bring that mystery, it's like watching Leo DiCaprio on one of his prestige projects with Scorsese. You're too aware he's trying to be credible. In fairness, I can't think of the right Hollywood actor for this role. Maybe Richard Gere  he has the grey hair for starters, and his best known role involves buying someone for an entire night (Pretty Woman). This could be the dark side of that character, and Gere's done city alienation in American Gigolo. As it stands, Pierce Brosnan could have put in a better turn than Cruise in this role (not necessarily a cheap jibe  check out Pierce in The Matador, later this year, where he's said to excel as a hit-man).Cruise's character is too garrulous  why is he chatting away to Foxx from the start? No hit-man would do that, unless you're talking Pulp Fiction. It would only work if the hit-man is basically a bit mad, unstable or unpredictable, or sadistically enjoys taunting his captive. But you don't never really sense that.MILD SPOILER: And why does Foxx make a run for it with Cruise's case when they visit his ailing mom in hospital? Surely that's when the nervous cabbie would be on his bestest behaviour, with a hit-man in the same room? It would make sense if Foxx had basically flipped out or was having some sort of breakdown due to the pressure. Otherwise, it's hardly a rational thing to do...This could have been a Strangers On A Train type film, and what a shame that Cruise wasn't allowed to have a slightly campy, homoerotic strand to his character  it would give his bonding with Foxx a different dimension. When they resort to the rock soundtrack near the end, it's just an OC type flick to flog the soundtrack. It's a long way from Heat.",5,2,3,21 July 2005
Quantum of Solace," Another Die Another Day
","I suppose if I were looking for omens, the opening shot of QoS should have warned me - a sweeping overwater shot of Lake Como, not dissimilar to the start of Connery's much- maligned comeback picture Never Say Never Again and very much a visual cliché. But that's to tell a lie; the shot is wonderful and ominous and the way it cuts to a real bone-cruncher of a car chase that out Bonds Bourne all the way is excellent, I loved the glimpses you got of the town as it descends into a quarry, then steering past the cranes reminiscent of the car chase in Dr No, and watching one car smash sideways of the cliff, superb. You'll need to sit further back if you want to enjoy it though, due to the frantic editing and close-ups, too fast for the eye to register.It's after the credits the rot sets in with some WTF moments... I won't do spoilers, but within 20 minutes I'd seen enough oddities and incongruities, including a Bourne-style foot chase which was okay but including some odd 'let's paste it in later' CGI. Now the look of QoS is superb, the cinematography is lush and as lovely as that of Roger Moore's Moonraker nearly 30 years ago. However, it does have some bad similarities with Moonraker that are no good for Craig's Bond. 007 (though he never seems to be called that in the film) just seems to swan off to foreign climes on the flimsiest pretext all by himself; there's never any sense he has any back up from MI6; there don't seem to be any other 00 agents at all. It's a very egocentric film in that sense, and that may be the point, but Craig's Bond is much of a superhero as Moore, only substituting brawn for gadgets to get out of every situation.At times, it reminded me of a mid-70s Pink Panther film, the way the plot moves from one scene to another. Oh! He's bumped into a lady by accident, who mistakes him for another.Insipid Bond villain with a henchmen like Gareth out of The Office, dull, grumpy Bond girl, and M popping up every other scene ('It's Dame Judi - we have to make use of her!').An excellent scene at the opera in Austria is a highlight, and very Hitchcockian.But soon Quantum of Solace put me in mind of Never Say Never Again and Die Another Day, two that just don't feel like Bond movies to me. There's a plane sequence that really is a CGI fest right out of Pierce Brosnan's last film and totally out of keeping with the new down-to- earth Bond that Craig is meant to exemplify.There's also a tragic death scene impaired by some truly vulgar and obvious product placement. Yes, Bond wears Omega. We get it!I had reservations about director Marc Forster but really, his hiring is like getting Sebastian Faulk in for Devil May Care. Yes, he sets up every shot expertly and it looks lovely. But there's no experience of the genre and it shows. I began to realise that despite the change of personnel, it's the writers and producers who sink it every time for me. I can't say I was too disappointed with the film this time, I've been here so often before, as with Die Another Day.Craig? He looks more like Fleming's Bond here. Yet even CR fans will admit that the best part of that film: the bankrupt Le Chiffre at cards thing, gaining the 00, the relationship with Vesper and her death, are all Fleming. Had that not been in the novel, the producers would never have had the nerve/imagination to do all that stuff for their reboot. Take those elements out and you get a series of action scenes in Madagascar, Miami Airport and Venice. Which is sort of QoS to a tee.It's amazing how I can tune into Spooks every week, and it's great stuff that I can nitpick slightly I admit, but generally I get along with. The villains are great, you hate them, you root for the heroes who sometimes cross the line morally but never talk about torture in such a commonplace way as MI6 do here, plus some great touches; 'Being happy isn't about getting what you want, it's about appreciating what you've got' last week. But the producers of Bond are bereft of any nouse at all. What is this film? A tribute to past Bond movies, to the franchise, a merchandising opportunity, a chance to be patriotic? A marketing exercise? Sorry to be a downer, I really thought I would chalk this up as the best action film of the year even if not my thing as a Bond flick - better than TDK, easily Indy IV and possibly Iron Man. For me, Jack White and Alicia Keys should have called their song Another Die Another Day.",3,5,10,4 November 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Bores  Again
","There's nothing too terrible here, but its hardly the reinvention we were expecting. When it comes to dark comic-book capers, Sin City seems to have left Batman Begins at the starting blocks. While SC is way too radical for some, BB isn't so different from Tim Burton's Batman, just minus the frills and Jack's mugging villainy.This is, of course, a prequel, but if this is what we get in finding out a hero's origins, let's hope the next Bond film Casino Royale steers clear of all this. A comic hero's back story is crucial in explaining Spider-Man or Superman. For many non fans, it's the only really interesting part. Here, the back story never really stands up. So the guy has a bat phobia. Big deal.For the first section of the film, you're just waiting for the action to start. But Bruce Wayne has to face his demons. This involves a trip to the icy tundra and a Fortress of Solitude moment, then lots of training to be a warrior assassin, which we've seen loads of times in The Matrix, Kill Bil Vol 2 and The Empire Strikes Back.The time scale is confusing - there's a flashback to when Bruce is a kid, then a forward flashback to his early 20s. Michael Caine, who plays trusty butler Alfred, looks all of 70 when Master Bruce is only a kid, and looks the same age (with some grey) when Bruce is adult. Wouldn't Alfred look like Caine did 25 years earlier, in his Hannah And Her Sisters phase?And when he's in his floppy-haired 20s, Christian Bale looks all of 30something and so does Katie Holmes (who hails from the Charlotte from Sex And The City school of acting). Both actually seem younger when the story flashes forwards a good few years later - not a big gripe, but it is distracting.Batman Begins takes a while to get going, but while its aim is to show how Wayne 'gets those wonderful toys', it really can't convincingly explain it. Just him and an ageing butler putting together the whole shooting match, even with Morgan Freeman as an insider ordering equipment, just doesn't cut it. C'mon.And Bond fans will know the drag of a director who just can't set up a one-liner. Doesn't matter that they're not too bad jokes, mostly from Alfred of course, some directors can do it, some can't. Nolan can't.Despite some nice touches, Batman Begins really is a bit of a bore as more and more characters are introduced and end up shoe-horned into the film. There's just too much going on here for the film to breathe, too many villains who emerge  but none given the space to be a really juicy nemesis. And the Batmobile chase along the rooftops is so absurd, it could be from the Joel Schumacher era. Christian Bale is not bad at all, but doesn't quite have star charisma and nor do any of the other leads, except Caine of course. Shame.",5,17,129,6 June 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Three or four episodes of Hustle pasted together
","This movie is a bit like the UK series Hustle, only with a big budget, international locations and quite a few episodes and climaxes strung together. I didn't really gel with the characters, they seemed out of my league in a way that other action heroes don't, and I didn't quite believe in what they were up to either.It's the Cruise brand, it's like an empty battery that gets recharged with new characters around him. I prefer this team to the last unmemorable lot, but for all that you just think, well, there'll be another lot next time. The opener in a Serbian gaol seems to be Cruise auditioning for the Jack Rancher role, all bulked up and knocking out prisoners and guards and so on - convincingly it must be said. Simon Pegg is the boffin but a lot of the humour seems a bit inappropriate because the director doesn't know how to set up the expectation of humour, if feels a bit lame. Also, you can't help thinking that the team are chosen to not be taller than Cruise, at which they succeed.To be fair, it is exciting and my palms were sweaty, yet it was also a hollow experience, not moving really.The cinematography isn't too great or lovely to look at, and the Imax experience I can't really get the hang of, the screen goes deep when there's some big vista but it seems a bit tacky to me, plus it destroys the suspension of disbelief. Cruise doesn't have many layers as an actor and the crucial thing is you don't really quite believe any of it and I'm not sure you're supposed to but it's all mighty earnest. At times it's as if this is a Scientology movie: here is another seemingly insurmountable challenge that our hero can surely master before moving on to the next level of enlightenment.",6,1,3,22 January 2012
Django Unchained," Last 20 minutes is a 5
","It's always a joy for me to see a new Tarantino on screen, it's the dialogue stupid. But it's also the direction, there's a sense of ease and familiarity, a feeling that he's going to take you on an exhilarating trip.So it is here, and I'd happily see this movie again, but there are problems along the way. I can't quite believe that Waltz could get himself into so many scrapes and talk his way out of it, it belongs in a more outrageous, funnier film. In a way, I think Quentin is too influenced by those slightly silly 1970s films where anything goes, and it doesn't really fit here. He is mixing his genres, though when it turns slapstick with the Ku Klux Klan, well, that could be out of Blazing Saddles. I don't mind, it's funny enough, but it's a thin line.I'm not sure Foxx as Django is quite charismatic enough, so Waltz is carrying the movie a lot, a bit of a problem. DiCaprio puts in the best acting performance I've seen as the plantation owner, but he doesn't quite have the stature or prescence to pull off what would have been a plum role for Larry Hagman or Orson Welles in their younger days.The final 20 minutes goes off the rails and becomes pure fantasy, much like the ending of Inglorious... It's like Tarantino can't follow through, or maybe it's deliberate, as if to say, yeah, this what we'd like to happen, but I won't kid you that it ever actually did.",7,0,3,27 March 2013
The Dark Knight," War of Terror allegory
","It appears that The Dark Knight, like Casino Royale, is one of those films that fanboys go overboard for. It's okay. I enjoyed it, but it does seem like we're going over the same old ground. Here's the Joker again, played early on in the game as usual. Will any of the later villains be as entertaining? Probably not.Hedger is good but there's no glee or joy in his villainy. Still, you get many different interpretations of Hamlet I guess.The allegory for the war on terror seems hamfisted and is the spin to make this Batman movie a bit different to the usual, to stop it going through the motions. I'm not sure if having Hong Kong in the film helps - shouldn't Gotham be a self-enclosed city, in a parallel universe? It's like Batman referring to Ted Bundy in Batman Returns  should he know about that?I find Nolan to be a charmless director, though he has good intentions. The visual flair imperative for a comic book adaptation isn't there and The Dark Knight, while enjoyable, is too heavygoing for my tastes.Then again, if you want to replicate the experience of buying your weekly comic from the newsagents, comic book heroes are better as weekly episodes on the telly. An update of Batman in a long-running series like The Wire would allow one to get involved in the various relationships between Wayne, his babe (Waynetta?) and Harvey Dent. As it is, even with a long running time, it gets a bit shoehorned in. Nolan would be better with a serial.",6,5,13,18 August 2008
Friends with Benefits," Slender premise
","The main angle here, as with No Strings Attached, is that of the booty call - sex available on request from a 'friend' who you fancy but don't wish to date. Problem is, it's a slender premise for a comedy in this case, because the two leads hang out together, chat, as well as have sex. So really, from the viewers' perspective, it's just your average romantic comedy. There's never any clash of tension, such as one of the leads bringing back a new beau and receiving an inappropriate or untimely 'booty call', or either of them facing disapproval from a friend or relative over their cynical arrangement. In many ways, this is like When Harry Met Sally, only condensed into two months rather than 20 years or so, and the sex out the way from the start. Even then not as funny, because here the two leads pretty much agree on stuff from the get go.Otherwise, this does take off and becomes more likable as it goes on, but the two leads aren't too great to watch with their kit off and none of it seems too sexy or even kookily sexy to me. It has to be padded out with other themed stuff - the LA/New York divide and their respective parents. It becomes quite watchable and passes the time, but it's never that sexy or that romantic.",6,0,1,26 September 2011
Taken," Ooh baby baby it's a (cough) racist world
","Don't get taken in by Taken. Sure, it's 7.9 on IMDb and with Liam Neeson in it you may figure it's going to be a cut above. You'd be wrong. It's the kind of film Mel Gibson would turn his nose up at.For a start, it's very broadly written. Neeson plays a dad estranged from his ex-wife - Famke Janssen, who played a wonderful femme fetale in GoldenEye all those years ago, and is now content to play a Desperate Housewives-style mom.. The dialogue is all, 'I really missed you Dad!' 'I missed you too pumpkin!' Rubbish exposition: Neeson meets his old mates, they reminisce about how they went to Beirut on a mission, how he cried off with no warning to attend his daughter's birthday. Clumsily signposting his past life as an action hero, along with his dedication to his daughter. Though one also might also think, this guy is pretty unreliable, he might be a bit soft in the head to desert his mates.And it's that which kept me watching, the thought there might be a subtext going on here, that Neeson might be a bit simple. Later, Neeson and his mates are security for a rock princess; Neeson asks her for career advice for his daughter JUST AS SHE'S ABOUT TO SWEEP ONTO STAGE! Media types never like to dish out free advice to wannabe competitors at the best of times. What kind of response is he likely to get? He seems a bit retarded, likewise his paranoid fears about his daughter going to Paris. But no, we're meant to admire him.It gets worse, and you begin to suspect it's a metaphor for US foreign policy. I can only imagine those giving this a high rating are Americans loving the double whammy of the French and the Arabs getting a kicking. And incidentally, you really don't get to see much of Paris either, if you were looking to rent it for that reason.",2,10,20,24 February 2010
Wedding Crashers," Utter Dreck
","I suppose it's a sign of age, but 15mins into this I started thinking how much better it would have been with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in the Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson roles. That would have been a funny film. Or, in modern day terms, maybe the guys from Friends, Chandler and Joey, or Ross as the more neurotic one. Ironically, Wedding Crashers would then simply have been branded as 'not as funny as Friends'. And it isn't.Vaughn and Wilson are simply too old for this skit. It's creepy. They're past 35 easy, and not a young 35. Vaughn is quite heavy, which ages him, Wilson has crows' feet around his eyes. In a bad light they could pass for 50. Yet they're seducing young, vulnerable gals at weddings. This sleazy behaviour is only forgivable if a) They're a lot younger, and it's irrepressible folly of youth set to encounter a learning curve. b) They're really good looking, so the gals implicitly get more out of it - it works as a fantasy thing for them. c) They're marked out as bad guys from the start, and you know they're riding for a fall, and kind of look forward to it gleefully.Instead, they're like weird guys in an office you catch doing something wrong, and you think, hmmm, I don't want to hang around these two.Mild spoilers. It seems wrong to warn of spoilers when the writers seem so keen on spoiling the film themselves. Naturally there's no logic in the comedy, others have pointed this out. Jane Seymour is a nympho, but then suddenly isn't and that isn't referenced again. The senator's daughter is a shy, mad virgin, but then she turns out to be a nympho too. Vince Vaughn thinks she's mad, but then unaccountably thinks he has 'feelings' for her. The gratuitous sex works well, especially near the beginning, but it sits oddly with the tone of the film, it brings home how these creeps just use and abuse girls, and we're meant to approve. A Curtis Lemmon film would have suggested it, and it wouldn't be raunchy, and you'd get the idea, but you could skirt around their reprehensible behaviour.Ultimately the two leads just don't have the charm and the film really gets worse as it goes on. The final scenes involving funeral crashing are in horrible taste, and not in a good way.The whole film is like sitting through an awful best man's speech where he thinks he's being funny but it's just tacky and cringey.",3,13,27,26 July 2005
WALL·E," Heavy Metal
","Stunning visuals aside, I have to admit to not liking the character Wall-E the robot. Or his love interest; I might as well log on to a porn site to watch a dustbin humping a dalek for all the pleasure it might give me. Wall-E seemed too desperate the whole time, like a stray cat you might feed but then kind of wish he'd go away. The newer white robot seemed a stupid cow, like a bossy sort showing up at the office one day and ordering people about. Naturally Wall-E falls in love, and when she laughs it's like one of the Flinstones wives, all tee-hee shaking shoulders.I got bored watching them go about their business and found the 2001 Space Odyssey reference a bit of an annoying rip-off rather than a homage. I found it all a real grind, still it's mainly two characters and if you don't like 'em, that's gonna be that. I can't convey how unhappy and depressing I found this film, though I'll admit the idea is charming enough.",3,5,18,3 August 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Ageing Bruce gets a blue rinse
","This latest Die Hard instalment is shot through with a blue filter, perhaps to hide the formulaic nature of it.I'm being unfair, I mostly found this a gripping action flick. I enjoyed the banter between Bruce and the young actor, but I miss Bruce being a lone guy up against it. This is more a buddy thriller. Then again, even in the first film he had the black cop on the walkie talkie outside.Credibility went out the window as soon as Bruce chose to jump out of a speeding car onto concrete to fling it into a helicopter. Reality would see his brains smashed across the road. It's similar to a scene in Casino Royale when Craig flings himself off a baggage handler onto a runway. I know these guys are bulked up but still...Sadly the intrigue of the movie fell away. The villain's McGuffin (plot premise) I couldn't quite fathom. He aimed to show the weakness of the US systems, but how much money was he trying to nick? Any at all, or was that a bluff? At times I almost sympathised with him. He wasn't out to blow up Congress, that was just a 'what if' scenario. And when he doesn't off McClane's daughter immediately, we can see this is a fun/silly action film.Much in the manner, in fact, of True Lies. Except, we can't have the fundamentalists as villains in a film like this, after all, they did take out the Twin Towers and are consequently no fun any more. Wait for Michael Mann's new film if you want a take on that.Fun stuff, but I'd mostly forgotten it by the time I was home. It's no Jason Bourne.",7,0,1,21 August 2007
The Great Gatsby," You're an Absolute Beginner...
","So imagine it's 1967 if you'd missed out on all the hoo-ha over Bond, but you read Ian Fleming's Casino Royale and found you quite enjoyed it... and what's this? There's a big screen version of Casino Royale hitting the cinemas, with David Niven, Orson Welles and Ursula Andress. Better check it out, right? Well this version of Great Gatsby is as close to F Scott Fitzgerald's novel in tone as that psychedelic romp starring Niven, Welles, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen was to Fleming's dour Cold War novel. Or, if you prefer, as close as the mid-1980s Absolute Beginners musical was to the classic novel about Soho coffee houses of the 1950s.Which is not to say this film jettison's the novel's plot, not at all, if anything it's too faithful. Scenes are shoehorned in because they were in the novel, but for no real reason. When Nick and Jordan meet the old buffer in Gatsby's library, well in the book it means something, but in the film it serves no real purpose I can see.As with the other two movies I've mentioned, the songs help save it and it does have its moments. The melancholy scenes work better than all the frenzied upbeat stuff, but this film is really about taking a dayglo spray paint to an ornate statue. You know the director has failed when you have Tobey Maguire just talking the whole frickin' time, explaining what people are thinking and doing and their motivations. Don't tell, show, is one lesson Fitzgerald would have been taught when he tried out as a screenwriter in the 1930s. It doesn't help that narrator should be made stronger, not weaker, otherwise what is he doing there? When he's a first person narrative in a book, his raison d'etre is solid, but in a film the lead actor (arguably I know) should have something more to do, otherwise why not just have the director tell the story? I give this 5 out of 10 because the 3D visuals are out of this world and make this a real experience, albeit not always an enjoyable one, but it IS different, probably the same way that the 67 Casino Royale was in its day. It's mad. But the director misses the poetry and poignancy, the subtlety of the book, and probably isn't even aiming for that anyhow.",5,4,7,9 June 2013
