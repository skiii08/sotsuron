Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One word: GREAT!!
","Ok, well, how do I respond to the critic's against the movie. Let us begin by stating what some said was a bad idea. Many thought and believe that Jar Jar Binks was annoying and just useless for the movie. Ok, well for one, he may be annoying, but so what, he is a character, he is an innovation in computer animation, and simply is funny. Many I know liked him. Jar Jar is a part of the movie and makes it work. Take him out of the movie and then most of the movie will be cut. Once you get to know him he is fine. After a few viewings you begin to understand him more.Ok, what else, Darth Maul may have been a small part but totally worth it. He was excellent and very good at his skill. Ray Park is a genius and was a great choice for the part. His character and stunts were simply amazing and wonderful to watch.Next, the movie itself was simply astounding and the FX were unbelievable. The robots and ships just looked great.As for the actors and characters, I felt they were great. Liam was good as Qui-Gonn and for those who felt he was just useless and you couldn't care about his character, well he added some effective scenes and characters. Ewan was a good choice, as was Natalie, and Jake as Anakin, who  I felt were very well suited for their parts. Ian was just wonderful as Sidious and Palpatine, who, in my opinion is the same person, but that is me. I also liked Watto and Sebulba too. All the others did a fine job too.And of course lets not forget the wonderful score by John Williams. What else can I say but to say it's JOHN WILLIAMS. I can't put words to how good he is. Just to say again, JOHN WILLIAMS is the best. No one else could do this.Anyway overall the whole movie especially the battle scene and the Darth Maul fight scene were great.Hope you enjoy the movie. Can't wait for part 2.",10,2,9,4 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Next Chapter is an action packed Battle (some spoilers)
","Ok well, Episode 2 Attack of the Clones. Ok the title is not the best, but hey its also a movie. Ok for anyone who didn't like it, well think of this, ONE its a movie thats the basic thing. Star Wars is Star Wars, its not perfect but its fun and its all fantasy. Ok, AOTC, ok well, # 1 Natalie looks so much better. :-) The film begins sorta slow, but picks up as Anakin becomes badder or eviler. Anakin is sorta ok, like Mark Hamill was in Ep 4, but gets better and you begin to like him. I am sure most will agree that Yoda just kicked some ass. What a puppet huh!! Ok so lets see, the movie had some major battle scenes as well as fight scenes that were wild and very complex. This will tell you never to mess with Mace Windu and Yoda. In some ways too many characters that are all new, but thats not really bad, but they only appear in a movie or 2 now. Dooku and Mace only exist in these films. But thats ok. I kinda miss Darth Maul. For the most part, despite critics and some fans, I did like it, some may think its not as good, but its a different and Effects are just so much better. Im sure if he could redo the originals they would be way better. But Ep 2 is full of action, battles, and fighting. Ships are really cool. As for the whole Jango and the Genosis sorta confused me a bit, but it looked cool very high tech. Kinda taps into reality it seems.",Null,0,0,8 October 2002
