United 93," Inspired to defend or not, is the 'Right Time'
","I have two boys, the oldest inspiring to join the Naval Academy in 2 years and becoming a fighter pilot and the youngest, a policeman. The oldest has been professing and planning for the last 3 years a career in the Navy. Why his attitude was so determined is because I work for the Navy. Why do I mention this? Wednesday, 4/26, my oldest said to me,'Dad, with foreigners trying to change our national anthem, illegal immigrants protesting, people being selfish and self center. Why should I defend this country.' With careful thought, 'You are the one that will make the personal sacrifice. You planned a career but there is a sacrifice which can be your life. This is your life, your decision.' That's when I decided, the boys and I needed to see 'United 93'.We were riveted, the three of us. The crowd was quiet. The movie relayed the experience of heavy frustration, desperation and the adrenaline of survival. Then the 'knock the wind out of you' conclusion. We were all quiet, you could hear the sobbing behind us in the theater.As we left quietly, I lightly grabbed my oldest by the shoulders from behind and the same to my youngest as we walked up the aisle in the semi dark. I realized, that decision to 'defend and protect' they will make, may mean a sacrifice I will have to quietly deal with.On the drive and at home for the next hour, we talked a little how we felt about United 93. But, I know the 'jury is out' with my oldest. Only time will tell but it was the 'Right Time'.Stand tall for the heroes in United 93, the heroes of 9/11, and heroes now and the future. The American heroes always rise within and never fall.",10,2,6,29 April 2006
