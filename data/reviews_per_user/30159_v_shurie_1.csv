Hereditary," Next level horror
","This movie is next level. Brilliant actors, all taking their roles to amazing heights. Brilliant directing by Ari. If you're looking for jumps and scare tactics through music or some zombie coming out of the shadows, look elsewhere. This takes what feels like a perfectly normal family, doing and emotionally responding to perfectly normal events, and sets everything on fire through realism.",10,1,4,11 August 2019
