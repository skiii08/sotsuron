Deja Vu," Unexpectedly Mindbending
","This movie literally started off with a bang and did not let up. The pace of the movie was quick and Tony Scott does not waste a second of this film. Denzel carries the movie but the supporting players were more than sufficient.The movie starts with the bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. ATF agent Carlin is called in and meets up with special team from the FBI that helps with the investigation. The movie takes a mind-bending twist that takes the movie from somewhat of a crime drama to the realm of sci-fi.Granted any plot that has time-travel in it has can have some plot holes, this movie does give a satisfying conclusion despite having a plot that is in left field.I'll pretty much watch anything with Denzel and Tony Scott.Great movie!!!!",9,2,3,15 July 2009
Batman Begins," Best Reboot Ever
","The last two Batman's left a bad taste in my mouth. I was pleased to know that Christopher Nolan was taking over. I knew he would steer the movie to a more darker tone. He did not disappoint.I was impressed with cast, especially Christian Bale. He is Bruce Wayne and he did well as Batman. You couldn't cast someone better than him. He's going to be around Hollywood for a while after he stops playing Batman. I was also pleased with most of the other cast members especially Gary Oldman. He just slips into a role with ease.It is nice to see a big budget movie that does not use much in the way of CGI. The people who choreographed the actions scenes did a great job.One problem I did have with the movie was Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Her performance was very bland and underwhelming.Overall a great movie.",10,0,1,17 July 2009
The Dark Knight," Great movie
","I have to admit, I was disappointed the first time I saw TDK. But I did enjoy it immensely the second time.The movie's themes were very rich. It dealt with how things get worse before they get better, how far someone is willing to go to stop evil, the cost of fight it, chaos versus peace, and of course, white versus dark.I thought most of the actors did a great job. Christian Bale just oozes Bruce Wayne. I don't think you'll find a quality actor that fits that part. I wish there were more scenes with Bruce and Alfred. The actors seem to have a good chemistry together. I know Heath Ledger got most of the acclaim (deservedly so) but I thought that Aaron Eckhart was the best actor in the movie. He showed great range. I loved his character. Gary Oldman is a chameleon. He just slips into whatever role he has effortlessly.Another plus for the movie was the minimal use of CGI. I don't have anything against them, but I can really appreciate a movie that uses more stunt work than CGI.Two things did disappoint me. I didn't really care for Maggie Gyllenhaal in the movie. I just found Rachel to be very bland.The second thing that disappointed me was the Two-Face. I would have liked to have him in more of the movie or for the sequel.Overall, a great movie. I thinks it was ashame that Chris Nolan was not nominated for Best Director. He did a PHENOMENAL job with this film. I hope he at least has a hand in the next one.",10,1,5,15 July 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Very Good, but check your brain at the door
","Overall, I thought this movie was on par with the last one. There were quite a few things I enjoyed about the movie. Even though I could do without some parts, I thought that the movie was well paced. The fight scenes were spectacular. The robots' movements were fluid and there were lots of explosions. The best fight was with Optimus, Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor. It was well choreographed. I did enjoy seeing the new Transformers such as Soundwave, Arcee, and Sideswipe. I wish all three would have been in the movie more.I could have done without the twins. I understand that they were there for the younger audiences but they annoyed me quite a bit until they fought Devastator. I love Sam's parents in the first movie but I think his mom was a bit over the top. The reasons for her actions when they were at school were a bit over the top. Also, there were some holes in the plot.I would recommend this movie almost any moviegoer, but check your brain at the door.",8,2,6,10 July 2009
