Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A stupid title, apparently equals a good movie.
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE. HOWEVER THERE IS A REVAL TO A SMALL TWIST (ALTHOUGH I DON'T CONSIDER IT A SPOILER). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!I was searching on OnDemand for some horror movies, and stumbled across this hilariously named movie. I invited some friends over the laugh at it, but one of them said they saw it before, and it was a good flick. And, boy, it sure was. With amazing action, and pretty good special effects, it was just amazing. With pretty good special effects, and a whole bunch of gore, it was (still) just amazing. I like how they kept some rules of regular vampires (like one undead cannot kill another) and added there own special touch to it( like silver being there weakness). Another thing I liked was how it sort-of stayed true to the original life of Abraham. But maybe that's just my nerd/geek side showing. A complaint though is that the brief sex scene (although it is hilarious) is kind of unnecessary. Than you for reading, and if you do end up watching this movie, (witch you should) enjoy it!",8,1,2,6 January 2019
