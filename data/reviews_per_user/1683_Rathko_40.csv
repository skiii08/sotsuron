The New World," Art
","A quite-literally breathtaking 120 minute montage of sights and sounds evoking the first British contact with North America. The narrative is minimal, even inconsequential, as perhaps it should be in a story that is predominantly about the human need to communicate even when language is a barrier rather than a vehicle to understanding. The performances are universally outstanding, the cinematography and editing award worthy, and the use of 'Das Rheingold' the most inspired use of Wagner ever in a movie. 'The New World' is a genuinely poetic, lyrical, visually stunning and heartbreaking movie. About as flawless as cinema gets. For those still unsure of my feelings, I loved this movie.",10,209,335,23 January 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," As Many Misses as Hits
","For all the talk of 'Borat' being something new and dangerous, it's really just the latest addition to a long British tradition of bigot-comedy. I don't know if it started with 'Till Death Us Do Part' in the 1960s, but Warren Mitchell's Alf Garnett is one of the earliest examples of middle-class white liberals presenting working-class bigots as objects of comic derision. 'Rising Damp' continued the tradition well in to the 1970s. When done well, such comedies revealed racism and anti-Semitism to be the truly ridiculous things that they are, and during a time of rampant institutionalized racism in Britain, such comedies were genuinely daring. Of course, when done badly, they crossed the line, and became racist themselves. Sitcoms like 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' and 'Duty Free' made little attempt to critique their protagonist's bigotry; inviting their audiences, instead, to laugh at a parade of racial stereotypes.'Borat' falls somewhere in the middle of these two traditions. Alf Garnett was funny and offensive and ultimately revealed to be the sad and lonely bigot that he was. He was a brilliant comic creation because he was real. Borat, by comparison, is like something out of a fairy tale. He is pure fantasy. While we are clearly expected to laugh at the character's bigotry, he is so extreme and outrageous in his beliefs that all connection with reality is lost, which calls into question his ability to make us question contemporary racial attitudes when he himself is so far removed from them. But more often than not, we are invited to laugh not at Borat's bigotry, but at the reactions such bigotry provoke. So what exactly are we supposed to be laughing at  an ignorant man from a developing post-Soviet country or the American trying to treat him with some degree of respect? The overwhelming number of Americans that Borat encounters behave with an almost unbelievable degree of restraint and show a genuine desire to accommodate Borat and his wildly offensive manners. Rather than come away from 'Borat' thinking Americans are all crazy, I was immensely impressed with their desire to appear open, accepting and non-judgmental. As for the often talked about scenes with the gun and car salesman, and the shock that many critics displayed at their apparent accepting of Borat's bigotry, all I can say is that these critics have never worked retail. If salesmen, whether in a car lot, a gun store, a bookshop, or a restaurant, refused to serve every customer that was weird and offensive, they'd never make a sale! You nod, you smile, you make the sale and get the nut out of the store. I saw no evidence of racism and anti-Semitism, just a desire to be professional while working. In fact the only two genuinely offensive people that Borat encounters are a half-crazy nutjob that seems to manage a rodeo, and a bunch of drunken frat boys. Discovering that these people are bigots is hardly a surprise, so what's the point? Let's forget whether or not Baron Cohen is attempting to say anything about contemporary attitudes to race, religion and class. Is the movie funny? Well yes it is, in parts. Personally, I just don't find relatively decent people being made to feel uncomfortable all that funny. It's one thing when Ali G does it to cynical and self-serving politicians, but when it's aimed at regular people, especially when they're going out of their way to be nice, it just doesn't amuse me. When Borat descends into pure surreal fantasy, however, it is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud at the 'Running of the Jew' and the scene in the B&B, both of which, not coincidentally, focus on the idiocy of anti-Semitism rather than the cheap exploitation of a casual passerby. Such scenes, even though they are completely reminiscent of stuff that Monty Python was doing thirty years ago, reveal a genuine creative talent that is sorely lacking in much of the film.Borat, and the fantasy Kazakhstan that he calls home, is a brilliant comic creation and endlessly fascinating. I could have happily watched an entire movie about Borat in his home country, and my favorite parts of the movie and the DVD are those instances when we are able to do just that  the low-fi title credits, the 'South Park'-style Kazak National Anthem, the bizarre 'Baywatch' clone. But such scenes are few and far between, skipped over in favor of the ritual humiliation of innocent civilians - a pastime that I've just never found all that funny.",5,1,2,2 April 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Instantly Forgettable Piece of Fluff
","I saw 'MI:3' on Saturday night. On Sunday morning I had to ask my wife what movie we'd seen. Maybe I'm getting old and the grey cells are fading fast. Or maybe 'MI:3' simply has all the nutritional value of a drive-thru Big Mac.J.J. Abrams can do the whole government conspiracy/black-ops thing in his sleep. He created 'Alias' after all, which is really just a modern day Mission Impossible anyway, with the same globe trotting story lines, double agents and cunning disguises that Peter Graves used to contend with. He also created 'Lost', which simply transplants the complexities of cold-war political chicanery to a tropical island. J.J. Abrams is the reigning King of the super-spy genre.So it comes as no surprise that 'MI:3' is a deft mix of all the very best genre clichés culled from John Le Carre, James Bond, and, of course, the original TV series. Personally, however, I got the distinct impression that I'd seen it all before. The fact that the cause of all this drama, the preposterously named 'Rabbit's Foot', is never explained, is a frustrating example of a modern Hitchcockian 'mcguffin' if ever there was one. Most of the characters are poorly written, possessing motivation that stretches even the thread-thin plausibility of the genre, with Billy Crudupp in particular, being unable to explain why he's doing what he's doing.I suppose I'm asking too much to expect any degree of logic in a movie such as this. But when I see government agents blowing up a bridge packed with civilian witnesses I can't help but role my eyes in disbelief. Are we really expected to believe that those people aren't filming the whole thing on their cell-phones and sending the pictures to CNN before the last helicopter has disappeared over the horizon? The fluff is, without a doubt, crafted with great expertise. Everything looks beautiful, the CGI is top-notch, and a certain level of suspense is maintained. It's enjoyable and the two hours fly by effortlessly. But in all honesty, it's as light as air and instantly forgettable.",6,0,0,26 June 2006
Marie Antoinette," Incompetent and Xenophobic Travesty of a Movie
","Coppola's signature style  minimalist character development, superficial musings on life without any plot or drama  is here revealed for what it truly is; the clumsy attempts of a scion of Hollywood royalty to disguise her obvious lack of any discernible talent. 'Virgin Suicides', the impossibly over-rated 'Lost in Translation', and now 'Marie Antoinette', provide audiences with a damning trilogy of the very worst of film industry nepotism. Can any of us truly believe for a moment longer than this fiasco of a movie would ever have been made were it not for father Francis' power, or that his presence as Executive Producer, alongside her brother Roman's as Second Unit Director, and cousin Schwartzman's non-performance as Louis XVI, doesn't mark it out as the nepotistic family affair that it truly is?'Marie Antoinette' is a monumentally bad movie. There is no real plot, no narrative worthy of the term, no story beyond a few events casually strung together. There is no drama, no tension, no motivation given to any character. The entire movie consists of vacuous individuals wandering around beautiful and uninhabited locations doing absolutely nothing. Just as 'Lost in Translation' was little more than a tedious montage of Coppola's Tokyo vacation videos, so 'Marie Antoinette' amounts to little more than footage of friends playing dress up in old buildings. And to make matters worse, they play dress up in inaccurate clothing in buildings that would not be built for another 100 years!Devoid of any historical or political content, we see none of the political machinations of Antoinette and the various aristocratic power players in court. We see nothing of Louis's agonized indecision over the steady forward march of democratic reform. We see nothing of the chaotic bustling city that was the Palace of Versailles, the troop maneuvers or constant petitioning that foreshadowed the march of the Parisian fishwives. We see, and feel, nothing of the woman Marie Antoinette or her plight. Just as Coppola invites us in 'Lost in Translation' to laugh at the Japanese and Japanese culture, at the funny accent and oh-so-amusing cultural idiosyncrasies, here she invites us (repeatedly) to laugh at the hilarious sight of men wearing make-up and wigs. Her complete disregard of history goes way beyond a filmmakers desire to update a compelling story and reveals a deep-seated contempt for history, tradition, and foreign cultures.But such contempt can hardly come as a surprise when Coppola's movies are invariably auto-biographical. They tell the stories of bored little rich girls who desperately want to be taken seriously while ordering room service and buying new shoes. I sincerely hope that every critic that has heaped praise on this talentless fraud of a writer/director, and everyone who voted for her Oscar win, is suitably ashamed, for this Empress has finally been revealed to truly have no clothes.",2,8,15,23 October 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Review from a Comedy Snob
","By way of explanation of this review, I should say that I've never been that in to comedies. My wife makes me laugh, my friends make me laugh, even a book can make me laugh, but for some reason the number of movies that make me laugh are very few and far between. 'Shaun of the Dead', for all the hype as being one of the funniest films in years, was amusing throughout, and on several occasions did, in fact, make me laugh, which from this reviewer, is very high praise indeed.The story is pretty simple, with Pegg's Shaun leading a who's who of British sitcom actors through zombie infested city streets to hole-up, Romero-style, in a local pub. The zombies are never very scary, and there's never really much of a sense of real peril. The script contains genuine warmth and affection and Pegg and Frost are great, possessing comedic chemistry and timing, but judging from the out-takes, you wish that they would allow themselves the indulgence of diverting from the script, as their improvisational skills are often far funnier than the finished dialogue.A last act disemboweling is the movie's only real nod to the visceral and messy violence of the genre, as can be judged from its 15-rating in Britain. I feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that England is able to finally produce popular movies without pandering to an American audience, but the lavish praise that has been heaped on this movie seems a little over-the-top. But what can I say? I've just never been that in to comedies.",7,1,3,4 September 2007
Hostel," Eye Gouging as Political Statement
","After the shockingly inept 'Cabin Fever' nobody could have been as stunned as I was to find that 'Hostel' is actually a very good movie.Firstly, Roth manages to bring a surprising sense of authenticity to the story. Anybody who has spent anytime backpacking around Europe will recognize the seemingly insane risk-taking, the unlikely friendships, the co-ed dorm rooms, the intensity of short-lived friendships, and the very real sense of poverty, resentment and depression lying just under the surface of quaint, picture postcard villages in post-Communist Eastern Europe. By hiring local actors, and choosing to film on location, rather than on the generic Euro-backlot at Universal studios, Roth is able to give the whole film an unusual degree of realism that lifts the film above its generic genre foundations.Secondly, Roth purposefully avoids the usual, vaguely racist, cliché of portraying every American as attractive, funny, and likable, and every European as either mildly inbred or wildly pompous. In 'Hostel', the American backpackers are depicted as the arrogant and patronizing teenagers that so many of them are. When Paxton complains that Slovakian television should carry English subtitles so visiting Americans can understand it, we are invited not to laugh along with him, but to shake our heads at his stupidity. It's rare, and refreshing, for a mainstream teen-orientated horror flick to be so derogatory against its own audience.Thirdly, Roth's screenplay isn't afraid to take its time. In an age when horror films are expected to start piling up the corpses well before the end of the first reel, it seems almost revolutionary to see a script harking back to the genre's 1970's heyday. Characters are actually introduced and developed, and the plot slowly and believably evolves at a refreshingly leisurely pace. Even the climax has an old-school simplicity about it; logical and satisfying, without feeling the need for some tired twist ending.Performances are universally sound, but Jan Vlasak is brilliant as the deeply disturbed businessman traveling half a continent to secretly give expression to his sociopathic fantasies. He gives us a fascinating character, generating a subtlety and depth that deserved more screen time.'Hostel' is an excellent horror movie; one of the best of recent years. In grounding his story in a believable post-Communist landscape, in which the 'villains' are simply pursuing the Capitalist dream of making money at any cost, Roth manages to make a political statement whilst cutting off toes with boltcutters. And that's no small feat.",9,2,4,17 January 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Heartless Adaptation
","A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God (hell), or the Nazi regime, the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential, none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored, we are not told who she is, where she came from, how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly, the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained, we are simply expected to accept it without question, which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum, with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and one-dimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek, is the complete lack of humor.The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles, with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings, with Henley bringing the wide-eyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires, and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.The CGI is competent, but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around, but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth, or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth, epic range, creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly, it has none of the humor, camaraderie, charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with, it will be very popular, and a sequel is very probable, but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul, the complete cycle seems unlikely.",6,49,88,12 December 2005
Constantine," No Style, Even Less Substance
","1) Take one inexpensive (and inexperienced) music video director. 2) Use the money saved to buy a pretty wooden floorboard. 3) Add the literary giants who brought you The Glimmer Man and Suburban Commando. 4) Liberally scatter a handful of schlock horror/action producers from Warner Brothers. 5) Throw them all in a self-congratulatory pot with $140 million dollars and leave to stew.The resulting mess is Constantine; a movie whose plot holes, bland performances, insipid production design, third-rate CGI and mind-numbing tedium would take more time to describe than the actual movie took to endure. I saw this the same weekend I rented Hunting Humans, a no-budget Canadian homemade horror movie shot in various back yards with the worst post-production dubbing I've seen since John Waters' Pink Flamingoes. The reason I mention this is because Constantine makes Hunting Humans look like vintage Hitchcock.At all costs, don't allow yourself to be consumed by the candy-like allure of the expertly tailored trailers. I refused to buy four underage kids tickets at the box office and can sleep soundly knowing that I saved two hours of their life. This is tripe of the highest order and fails to warrant even the tentative support of renting it from Blockbuster. If you find a pirate copy being sold from a suitcase at your local, neighbourhood Greyhound station, by all means buy a copy, but please, PLEASE, don't encourage these talentless cretins with legitimate business.2 out of 10",2,5,22,22 February 2005
Spider-Man 3," Very Disappointing
","'Spiderman' was clearly conceived from the beginning as a story about Peter, Mary Jane and Harry. Whether you want to see it as a love triangle, or a retelling of ancient mythologies concerning revenge, betrayal and the ghosts of father figures, these three characters were introduced in the first movie's opening scenes, and it their dynamic that has driven the narrative ever sinceuntil now.While 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as it should have been and fails to satisfy for the simple reason that Sam Raimi forgot what these movies were about. For the first movie, Raimi had the writing talents of David Koepp, one of the most successful screenwriters around. For the sequel, Pulitzer Prize winning Michael Chabon contributed to a screenplay written by the Oscar-winning Alvin Sargent. For the third installment, Raimi makes the all too common mistake of developing delusions of grandeur and feeling that he can take over the writing duties himself. Though Sargent is credited as a co-writer, it's clear from the mess of a screenplay that his input was limited. Raimi's screenplay forgets everything that the two previous movies stood for and were clearly moving towards, and abandon all dramatic consistency and cohesive storytelling in favor of redundant characters supplying equally redundant CGI set-pieces.'Spiderman 3' feels as though it was made by different people with a different vision. The emotional drama between Peter and Mary Jane, so carefully built over the last few years, becomes illogical soap opera theatrics. Harry becomes a leering painter of Impressionist masterpieces. Peter starts crying all the time and develops a 'Saturday Night Fever' obsession. Sandman is completely redundant, receiving no character development and vanishing as inexplicably as he arrived. Similarly, Eddie Brock serves absolutely no purpose in the movie other than to become Venom in the final scenes. Very little of New York or its citizens are involved in the story, which is claustrophobically self contained  there are barely two scenes in the newsroom and the citizens of New York rarely seem to be in real peril.Again, it needs saying that 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad film, but it does nothing to close out the trilogy or provide anything close to satisfying emotional or dramatic closure, the fault for which can only be laid, unfortunately, on Sam Raimi.",6,5,7,7 May 2007
Crash," Curiously Over-Hyped Melodrama
","There are some movies that are 'actor's movies'. They feature characters racked with such anger/guilt/resentment/self-loathing that every sentence of dialogue allows the actor to have a field day with every trick they ever learnt in The Actor's Studio. Filled with such impassioned emoting, these movies convey an initial impression of depth and powerful emotion. It's only on reflection that the viewer realizes that behind the tear-jerking, over-dramatic theatrics are characters and a storyline with all the depth of a birdbath after a spring rain. 'Crash' is one such movie.The performances are universally outstanding, but the quality of acting is wasted on such poorly developed characters. The denizens of 'Crash' are, with few exceptions, preposterous caricatures, wearing their exaggerated prejudices on their sleeves and fueled by borderline-sociopath bouts of irrational anger. None are particularly likable or sympathetic. These cliché characters wander through a story propelled by increasingly contrived and unbelievable coincidence. After you've predicted the third plot 'twist' fifteen minutes before it arrives, the whole thing becomes quite dull and tedious.Paul Haggis was a successful TV writer for 20 years; the mind that brought us 'Walker: Texas Ranger' and 'Due South'. Then, with 'Million Dollar Baby', he entered the Oscar-winning Big Time, as if from nowhere. But for all his awards and success, there is little evidence of a talent that goes much beyond the tear-jerking emotionally-manipulation he honed during re-writes of 'Thirtysomething' back in the eighties. This stuff may be thought-provoking to the average High School student, but as a grown adult, it resembles little more than a 21st century version of the domestic melodramas of the 1950's.",4,5,10,15 May 2006
The Aviator," Falling Short of Greatness...Again
","Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio-haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. We're never told how his experiences change him, and without change there's no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of it's parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesn't seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests 'all gloss and no substance', and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great.",8,683,946,21 December 2004
28 Weeks Later," Best Horror Movie of the Year...(so far)
","I've never been that big a fan of the original '28 Days Later'. It was a brilliant premise, excellently directed by Danny Boyle, and really injected something fresh and genuinely terrifying into the zombie genre (I know they're not really zombies, but the Infected populate the zombie genre). But the second half was awful, with a distinctly uncomfortable performance from Chris Eccleston. Megan Burns, as the teenage Hannah, was such an unbelievable bad actor that she managed to make almost every scene in which she appeared unwatchable. I've seen more realism and conviction in a primary school nativity play. It's sad that one performance should ruin an entire movie, but so spectacularly bad was young Burns that '28 Days Later' was consumed by the fire of her incompetence.And so here we have a sequel, lazily titled '28 Weeks Later', coming from the MTV-Horror studio of Fox Atomic and created by a bunch of virtual first timers. Expectations are very low indeed. It's even more shocking, therefore, to discover that the movie is not only far superior to the first, but the best and most satisfying horror film since 'The Descent'.The opening act, set in an isolated farmhouse, is an incredibly tense and visceral set piece of frenetic camera work and almost strobe-like editing that perfectly captures the feral ferocity of the Infected. The hand-held digital camera-work and over-saturated photography are beautiful; the performances are all solid; the special effects virtually flawless.There are some really deep plot holes, the more unkind viewer may call them cavernous  it's really quite unbelievable that two children would be able to simply sneak out of a military quarantine in broad daylight, or that a building janitor would have security access to the deepest levels of biomedical containment, or that the French would not bother to guard the Channel Tunnel. But such inconsistencies failed to really bother me, so swept up was I in the dreamlike vision of an abandoned and depopulated London. To see something so familiar become so alien never ceases to fascinate, and I was more than happy to overlook a plot hole for the chance to see just one more sweeping shot of deserted terraced streets and garbage collecting in newsagents' doorways.The Infected themselves are one of the most remarkable creations in the history of horror movies. They don't grow large teeth and claws or really transform in to anything supernatural or monstrous. They're still very much human, and recognizable so, and their mindless ferocity is all the more terrifying because of it  a raw and primal expression of the Freudian Id that is far scarier than any CGI monster. As such, the Infected are perhaps the purest horror-move expression of evil yet created. This franchise really could run for a very long time, and if they manage to maintain the creative quality of this one (with a little more attention to those plot holes) then I for one will be buying my ticket on opening day.",9,2,5,21 May 2007
The Thing," Classic Carpenter
","Aaah...The Thing.To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy MTV videos.Now I'm going to go Netflix 'The Howling'.",9,1,2,17 November 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A Superior Remake
","Yes, you heard me, a SUPERIOR remake. The original movie, despite being a Friday Night video classic throughout the eighties, really wasn't a particularly good film. It always seemed like a cheap remake of 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in the desert, but without the atmosphere, the suspense, or the scares. The remade 'The Hills Have Eyes' manages to be surprisingly faithful to the original in story, while improving on it on almost every level. The characters are more believable, the performances more professional, the narrative is tighter, the suspense more masterfully built. The crazies here actually seem crazy, rather than the lumbering cavemen morons of the original, and the production design, especially when we arrive at the 1950's test village, is excellent.That's not to say that it's a great movie. It's entertaining and enjoyable, but what you see is what you get and there's nothing beneath the surface that could ever warrant a second viewing. It's nice to see that the recent re-emergence of hard-R horror is restoring a little quality control to a genre that has been descending headlong into creative Armageddon the last few years. These movies, from the 'Texas Chain Saw' remake to 'Hostel' aren't BAD, but they have yet to produce a bona fide classic either. Not sucking is no longer an acceptable objective. Now we want to see something that is actually good.",7,0,0,3 April 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Formulaic, But Very Funny.
","For some reason, these kind of low-budget, indie comedies always remind me of Australian cinema. I had a similar feeling about 'Transamerica'. Maybe it's the suburban location shooting, or the broad slapstick comedy, or the idiosyncratic tackiness of the characters, or the dysfunctional family dynamic being played for laughs, or the feel-good 'heart of gold' ending, but all these films seem to be built around a comedy template established by 'Muriel's Wedding' over ten years ago. The presence of Toni Collette only reinforces the impression. It's not a bad thing, just something I'm reminded of every time I see the latest Sundance indie comedy.'Little Miss Sunshine' doesn't really offer anything new to the 'Muriel' template, but it is funny, often laugh-out-loud funny, which is no small feat. Beneath the often downright crude belly laughs is a social commentary of sorts reflecting on America's obsession with turning every aspect of life into a competition that by its very nature will have more losers than winners. It is this insight, and the genuine warmth and humanity with which it is delivered, that manages to make the sight of a seven year old girl doing a sleazy Superfreaky striptease hilarious, rather than disturbing.There have been several more powerful contenders for award recognition this year, but 'Little Miss Sunshine' represents the kind of feel-good, warm-hearted ensemble piece that the Academy often responds to, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if a few of those involved are reading their acceptance speeches in a few weeks time.",7,4,9,8 January 2007
Disturbia," Great Movie - Lousy Last Act
","Far more compelling than is to be reasonably expected of such teen-friendly PG13 thrillers. Of course, it lacks the wit and finesse of the original 'Rear Window', but in all honesty, 'Disturbia' really isn't trying to be a remake; it just steals the basic premise. The leads are all excellent  David Morse does his quietly chilling thing and LaBeouf really surprises with a far more complex performance than we've come to expect from such genre fodder. Sarah Roehmer is clearly the weakest link, struggling to bring any level of depth or realism to her character.The screenplay by Christopher Landon is packed with inexplicable and gaping plot holes  why is Kale's mother, a realtor, never at home at night? Where did all the party goers vanish to? Why did the police never check the VIN number on the neighbor's car? But such holes rarely get in the way of Caruso's expert handling of the mounting tension. As is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'Vacancy'?), a solid and suspenseful film morphs into a lazy and generic slasher movie in the final act.For those with an interest in such things, special note should be made of Tom Southwell, who spent the better part of twenty years as an illustrator on such movies as 'Blade Runner', 'Goonies', and 'Mission: Impossible', and here creates a beautifully detailed Craftsman home that acts as the primary location of the much of the action.",7,0,0,5 October 2007
Jarhead," The Cost of Fetishing Vietnam
","On the surface, there is little to distinguish 'Jarhead' from a dozen other war movies. You see the same first act with the same bullying drill sergeant, the same fatal 'live round exercise', the same punishments in rain soaked and muddy yards. The characters are similarly cliché. We meet the weak bespectacled kid who we worry isn't going to make it, the psychopath who collects body parts, the career military-man who loves (and lives) to fight, the intellectual, the rebel, the cynic. The rules established by 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Platoon' are all clearly in place, laced with the cynical boredom of anti-establishment movies from 'Mash' to 'Buffalo Soldiers'.However, Jarhead is one of those rare movies that improves on reflection.The reason that Mendes so willfully embraces so many clichés is to support his claim that all wars, like all war movies, despite the superficial differences of time and setting, are essentially the same. The use of cliché, therefore, is not so much evidence of lazy writing, but a considered strategy for dramatizing the essential sameness of wars, battles and soldiers. Swofford gives voice to this idea in the movie's final moments, 'Every war is different, and every war is the sameI am every marine, and every marine is me'.The imagery of Vietnam, despite being 30 years old, IS the imagery of modern warfare. Jarhead is not the first movie to explore the legacy of Vietnam. But more importantly, it addresses the powerful mythologizing and fetishizing of that war, the way it has been reduced to little more than the pop-culture iconography of bedroom posters, music videos, T-shirts and magazine covers. In the mind of every man born since 1970, filed under masculinity, is an image of an unshaven marine in jungle fatigues, with a cigarette clenched in his teeth and an automatic weapon across his lap. The young men in Jarhead embrace the Fetish of Vietnam, reciting whole passages of dialogue from Apocalypse Now and singing along to the music. When helicopters fly overhead playing The Doors at full volume, Swofford looks up in despair and shouts, 'That's Vietnam music! Can't we have our own?' Upon returning to the US, receiving a heroes' welcome despite having done nothing but sit in the desert for 6 months, the young marines are greeted by a Vietnam veteran. But they have nothing in common. There is no recognition, no identification, no camaraderie, no shared experience. They shift uncomfortably in their seats, refuse to make eye-contact; looking visibly embarrassed by this ugly reminder that their Vietnam myth is just that  a myth. The scene is one of the most powerful in the movie, as much for what it says about modern America's treatment of Vietnam veterans as much as Gulf War veterans.Performances are universally outstanding, with Gyllenhall proving once again that he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. Mendes, cinematographer Roger Deakins, and ILM, create a visually stunning, and often surreal, environment. Several scenes are breathtaking and are fine examples of how the successful collaboration of filmmakers and digital artists can attain a level of real artistry.Jarhead, while at times lacking focus and direction (much like the war it represents), is a brilliant and fascinating addition to an often clichéd genre. I don't know whether the movie's themes are explored with the same depth in the book, but it should not be so surprising that such insight into a very American condition should come from an English director. The British have long dealt with the repercussions of fading power and a dying empire, and it often takes a foreigner to shed new light on an issue so close to home. Whether the Academy will welcome such insight awaits to be seen.",9,0,0,21 November 2005
Batman Begins," A Class Act
","'Batman Begins' successfully reinvents and reinvigorates the Batman franchise. Nolan and Goyer's screenplay is intelligently written and tightly structured. Bruce Wayne's relationship with his parents is beautifully crafted in just a few brief scenes, and it's a credit to all involved that a very real sense of grief and despair is conjured from events that take mere seconds of screen time. While in the second half, the story collapses into a certain amount of generic superhero villainy, overall, 'Batman Begins' is a solid and engaging narrative.The entire cast does a sterling job. The likes of Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and Morgan Freeman bring an effective restraint and dignity to the proceedings. Any one of them can make gold of the most hackneyed dialogue and create richly textured characters from the scantest source material. Despite reservations, Bale is by far the best actor to have taken on the roll of Bruce Wayne, able to convey Wayne's tortured soul and his unerring sense of justice without ever seeming petty or dour. His relationship with Alfred contains genuine warmth and affection from the outset and belies a real chemistry between the two actors. Though Cillian Murphy hams it up a little at times, the only real disappointment is Katie Holmes. Admittedly, she is given little to work with in the script, but her more talented costars are able to make more with less. She seems quite out of her depth and the character of Rachel Dawes is never more than one-dimensional.While the makers seem to have taken Spiderman as their cue, wrapping the superhero story as a subplot around an infinitely more interesting and complex story of an individual's personal growth, the film never appears to be derivative. This is due, in no small part, to the production design. Gotham is stripped of the vaguely kitsch and Gothic trappings of previous incarnations. The bleak urban sprawl, particularly the squalor of the Narrows, almost becomes a character in its own right, and provides a unique backdrop.All in all, a class act. An exceptional cast of actors make gold of a script that, whilst not great, is far above the usual standards of the genre. A sequel is assured and much anticipated.",9,1,2,27 June 2005
2012," The End of the World is Nigh!
","As a child, my favorite parts of the Bible were those chapters that dealt with large-scale catastrophe – the Deluge, the plagues delivered upon Egypt, Moses commanding the Red Sea to crash down on the pursuing Egyptian army, Sampson tearing down the Philistine Temple. I've never really grown out of it. I love to see cities destroyed. I call it Apocalypse Porn. '2012' is the greatest example yet.So, the sun expels an unusually large number of neutrinos which somehow, against all the laws of God and nature, are converted into microwaves that boil the Earth's molten mantle to a level where the crust and tectonic plates start blowing apart. Well, so much for the 'science'. Over the next two hours, a Super Volcano rises up in Wyoming, Los Angeles disintegrates into a very big hole, the American Midwest ends up around the South Pole, tsunamis breach the Himalayas, and the President of the United States survives a toppling Washington Monument only to be taken out by the supercarrier USS John F Kennedy crashing down from the crest of a tidal wave. Yes, you heard me right - the Capitol is flattened by a massive ship carried from Philadelphia on a giant wave. Amongst the chaos, there's the usual story of a divorced father trying to prove his worth to his estranged children through increasingly insane acts of courage/stupidity, blah, blah, blah... There's an odd political subtext at work extolling the virtues of democracy at all costs. Oliver Platt, as Carl Anheuser (Karl Rove/Anheuser Busch/George Bush – get it), is the nearest thing the movie has to a villain, and his scheming persona is expressed through a desire to save only the greatest minds in the world. The 'good' and 'noble' characters, exhibiting a dangerous level of naivety, wish to open salvation to every mouth-breathing cretin in the nation through a national lottery. Personally, when it comes to the continuation of human civilization, I think a Nobel Prize-winning physicist kind of beats out Bubba from Georgia on the priority list, but maybe I'm as amoral as poor Carl Anheuser. The sight of a caricatured fat Russian leading the rebellion against a capitalist meritocracy like the Bolshevik hoards running at the Odessa Steps adds just one more layer of weirdness to the movie's political viewpoint. The story, as it should be, is the bare minimum required to get us from one spectacular set piece of biblical destruction to the next. The world has never before been consumed so lovingly and in such detail, and the results are magnificent. Personally, I loved the movie as Apocalypse Porn at its finest. I'm willing to concede that those who do not share my fetish and require character development and basic logic will, however, be far from satisfied.",8,0,7,17 November 2009
The Mist," One of the Best King Adaptations
","I read 'The Mist' when I was 12 years old and it begat a lifelong love of the horror genre. It was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch Darabont's movie adaptation, thoroughly expecting it to be completely butchered. I was pleasantly surprised.The movie is never as scary as the novella, and the suspense never quite reaches the excruciating heights of King's original story. Darabont fails to play up the unbearable tension (and razor-wire webs) of the spider infested pharmacy which I still vividly remember from the story even after 20 years. There's a nice pseudo-documentary feel to the shaky steadi-cam photography, replete with tight zooms and jump cuts. The creature design is top-notch, though let down by flawed CGI work  especially in the initial loading bay attack. Toby Jones stands out as the most unlikely of heroes, and Marcia Gay Harden makes an excellent bog-eyed sociopath  channeling the Queen of Deranged Christian Fundamentalists, Piper Laurie, in De Palma's 'Carrie'.But though faithful to the original story and written and directed with some artistry, there's something about the film that falls flat. It lacks the sheer sense of dread of 'The Shining' or the tension of 'Misery'. It's not horrifying or suspenseful enough to become a classic of the genre and for all the time that is spent trying to develop characters through long dialogue sequences, it doesn't add up to the kind of intimate dramatic character portraits that we find in 'The Exorcist'. 'The Mist' lies somewhere in the middle  not quite scary enough. Not quite dramatic enough.As for the new ending  I didn't mind it so much. It smacks a little too much of the ever-popular gimmicky twist revelation that has become a staple of the horror genre, but I give credit to Darabont and Dimension Films for allowing such a downbeat finale to make it to the final cut.'The Mist' is one of the best King adaptations to date, combining a quality ensemble cast, quirky scenarios, and occasionally startling visuals to make for a good, though flawed, horror movie.",7,2,6,26 November 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," Another Masterpiece from the Golden Age of American Cinema
","During the late sixties and into the seventies, the bank heist seems to have become a metaphor for the counter culture rebellion. Bank robbers were no longer the villains, but the heroes, fighting against the capitalist establishment like an urban Robin Hood. Dog Day Afternoon is part of that tradition.Al Pacino is, as ever, brilliant. He is able to bring charisma, charm and vulnerability to the character of Sonny Wortzik in nothing more than a way of walking, or the way he holds a phone. Troubled, insecure, confused, Sonny makes for a lousy bank robber. And yet, when he steps from the relative safety of the bank building and into the street, before a hundred waiting armed police, he changes completely. He becomes a strong, proud, prowling voice of the working class, goading the police, riling the gathered crowd. In referencing the prison massacre at Attica in 1971, he becomes a voice for the urban poor, and it is a powerful and raging voice that contains the potential for victory and success, even when you know it is doomed.An incredibly powerful work, very much of its time, and all the better for it. The 1970's was a decade when major studios hired actors for their talent, not their looks or teen appeal. When major studios hired writers proud to take on sensitive political and social issues. When major studios financially backed and strongly promoted movies that mattered and said something. Dog Day Afternoon is the product of that system and as such, could never be made today.",10,55,66,20 June 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Definite 'Love-It-Or-Loathe-It' Territory
","There are those moments in the film so excruciatingly embarrassing that you quite literally squirm in your seat in discomfort.  Similarly, there are sequences that make the hairs stand up on your arms, your skin turn to gooseflesh, and transport you so far from the cinema that you can forget about all the gibbering, squawking 13 year olds behind you.  Jam-packed with a dozen kinds of digital jiggery-pokery and some of the most incredible and overblown set design this side of Bollywood, the movie is like a 2hr MTV clip designed by Pierre et Gilles (and that's no bad thing).  Okay, so there's very little story, nothing in the way of character arcs or subplot and midpoint climaxes, but there IS lots of colour, dancing and jaw dropping spectacle.  Kidman and McGregor give excellent performances given the context, she a modern day Gilda (but where's the piano?), he all grinning naivety (with an excellent voice).  The music is brilliantly mixed, at times several songs blending together into an indefinable, yet oddly familiar whole.  Highlights, for me -- the duel/exchange of love song lyrics mutating into Bowie's 'Heroes' atop a gilded elephant, and the excellent tango/Roxanne sequence.  Definitely a love it or loathe it film. Indifference unlikely.",8,0,0,22 September 2001
Meet Joe Black," From The Director Who Brought You Gigli
","An acquaintance recently insisted that I watch Meet Joe Black, his favorite movie and one that he was sure would change my life. I remembered it as being a critically reviled movie that prompted one of two responses  it's so bad it's good, or it's so bad it'sjust bad. Meet Joe Black is quite possibly one of the worst movies that I've ever had to endure. The script, or the mess that resulted from reassembling the shredded remains of a dozen rewrites, was so bad as to be funny. On several occasions, my wife and I laughed out loud at the mock sincerity and vapid attempts at 'meaning' and 'depth'. The entire thing sounds like the laughable doom laden poetry of a maudlin teenager. The actors, left with nothing of any substance to work with, and operating under a director who clearly has intellectual aspirations far above his capabilities, struggle to create characters that amount to anything more than shameless pouting and vacant stares into the middle distance. Buried beneath the portentous dialogue, the awkward performances, the dull production design and wildly inconsistent storyline, there IS a kernel of a decent story. Had we been able to focus on Joe Black and follow his own emotional journey as he weaves between the variously dysfunctional members of the Parrish family, playing with the irony of death healing these people's wounds, something of value may have resulted, but alas, it's not to be. Even my wife, a hardcore fan of every romance put to screen, found the whole thing to swing wildly from embarrassment to tedium.The blame for this entire mess can only be laid at the feet of Martin Brest, a director of very little evident talent who created a reasonably enjoyable buddy cop movie 20 years ago and has been riding on the wake of it's success ever since. He should stop deluding himself, his actors and audiences, that he is capable of subtlety or intelligence. Hopefully, Gigli will be the death of him.As for a rating, let's give it a 3 out of 10, out of respect for capable actors put in an impossible situation.",3,2,4,15 December 2004
Children of Men," A Breathtaking Dystopian Vision
","'Children of Men' is an outstanding movie that rewards multiple viewing thorough the incredibly detailed and multilayered world that Cuaron et al seem to so effortlessly conjure. Their world is the most authentic creation of a dystopian future ever put to film, living and breathing with a terrifying realism and believability. The cool hued, monochromatic and grainy cinematography combined with the hand held camera-work and dizzying, one-shot scenes only enhance the documentary feel of the film. The story is simple, and the performances solid, but ultimately all exist to service the powerful emotional punch of seeing images of torture and repression  familiar to us from archival photographs of Nazi concentration caps, Soviet gulags, Turkish prisons, Japanese POW camps, and Abu Ghraib  transposed on to the streets of London and Bexhill. Of course, we should appreciate such horrors without theatrics and CGI parlor tricks, but the visceral empathy that such images conjure is as fascinating as it is horrifying, and drives home the horrors of dictatorship, guerrilla warfare, insurgency and terrorism.Though all the performances are excellent, Michael Caine really stands out in a revelatory performance that steals the movie. His character stands as a moral rock at the center of the film and a lesser actor could easily have missed the character's potential. Caine deserved at least award nomination. Oana Pellier is brilliant as the gypsy Marichka.The conservative criticism of the movie is baffling and reveals more about the oddly paranoid and defense whining of the right than about the movie itself.Though set within the context of a Western dictatorship, 'Children of Men' clearly marks out the Fishes as the real enemy  treacherous and violent. They are not suit-wearing yuppies of the capitalist system, or church-going suburban paragons of Red State heroism. Instead, the Fishes, the bad guys, are dreadlock wearing, Buddhist chanting, commune living hippies. They're not only liberals, they're caricatures of liberals. The whole movie plays as a critique of terrorism and brutal dictatorships. By showing in graphic detail the effects of political tyranny and terrorism, the movie asks, wouldn't YOU want to be saved from this life? And in doing so, asks us to understand the moral validation for war in Iraq. But of course, the conservative right has never really been that interested in multiple readings and subtle shifts of perspectives. They'd rather just cry foul every time their increasingly fragile and delicate sensibilities are offended.'Children of Men' is an incredible movie  genuinely thought provoking and powerful  that deserves as large an audience as possible and a far superior DVD!",10,3,6,3 May 2007
Saw II," Back-to-Basics
","Nasty, sadistic, and thoroughly entertaining piece of trash carried out with genuine skill and bravado. The return of the original cinematographer and editor bring a degree of consistency to the look of the movie, and the young Bousman manages to hold the whole thing together, keeping both the story and the direction tight and focused, admirably avoiding those annoying WTF moments that plague low-budget horror movies.As in the first 'Saw', the acting is not the film's strong point, with Wahlburg in particular really struggling to bring any degree of depth or variety to the character of a confused, angry and conflicted father. Similarly, Franky G's knuckle-dragging macho-bullshit routine, while starting out true to character, soon becomes tedious and repetitive. The rest of the cast are merely adequate, but Bell is a standout; bringing a surprising level of menace and credibility to a serial killer that could easily become laughable.There is an oddly compelling and original idea at the heart of these films, namely that they are serial killer/slasher film in which the killer never actually encounters his victims. Each death is the victim's choice, the result of either not following the rules, or simply not wanting to live badly enough. Despite the unrelenting violence, and hard-R content, they contain just enough intelligence and moral questioning to keep them interesting and thought-provoking. As such, both movies are far above any original horror movies in recent years, and unless destroyed by cynical studio chiefs, has the potential to become a long running, successful, and highly lucrative franchise.",8,0,1,31 October 2005
Blood Diamond," Genre - Political Action Adventure
","This is a resubmitted review of a Test Screening edit, not the final movie. The original review was removed by IMDb for unknown reasons and has been edited. For the particularly sensitive, this review may contain SPOILERS! 'Blood Diamond' is the relatively simple story of an amoral diamond smuggler, Archer, helping a Liberian fisherman, Soloman, to find the giant pink diamond that he hid out in the bush while working in the diamond mines. Solomon agrees to act as Archer's guide in exchange for assistance in locating his family in some far flung refugee camp, and his son, kidnapped and brainwashed by Liberia's rebel forces.If all this sounds rather dour and depressing, and far too political and preachy a movie to actually be entertaining, you couldn't be more wrong. In essence, 'Blood Diamond' is an old fashioned adventure movie that harks back to the days on 'King Solomon's Mines' or 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. It's all wrapped up in contemporary events in West Africa and introduces the largely unavoidable politics only if and when they lend depth and motivation to a character, but it's still just an adventure story. An r-rated, messy and violent adventure story that shines a spotlight on a hidden region of the world, but an adventure story none-the-less.Zwick, who I've never rated particularly highly as a director, injects the whole thing with genuine excitement and adrenaline. There are several action setpieces that are truly spectacular, and he manages to keep the focus tightly on the action and adventure while resisting the temptation to turn the whole thing in to a PBS documentary on the horrors of West African child soldiers.Special note has to go the three leads. Di Caprio, following the excellent 'The Departed' delivers what could possibly be an even better performance. Not only does he manage to pull off the South African accent without a hitch, but he even manages to speak in pidgin English at one point without generating embarrassed snickers from the audience  no mean feat. He carries the role with a confidence that is unlikely to go unnoticed at award time. Hounsou brings the same impassioned intensity to his role that he's been summoning since 'Amistad', providing an emotional core to a movie populated by tired cynics. Connelly, who looks better than ever here, is, however, wasted. She delivers a great performance that subtly conveys the vulture nature of even the most well-meaning reporter, but her character is, quite bizarrely, required to leave the movie just when things get interesting. She and Di Caprio have such obvious chemistry that it's a mystery why the producers felt the need to split them up so soon after meeting.Dan Weil's production design is outstanding and clearly award-worthy. He pretty much does what he did for 'Syriana'; that is, create an environment that seems so authentic that you can all but smell the garbage in the streets.There are a couple of low points. The music, by James Newton Howard, is obvious, clichéd, overtly manipulative, and drew attention to itself at all the wrong moments. I was interested to see in his bio that he was responsible for the 'King Kong' soundtrack, which was one of the most irritating and repetitive in recent years.The last 10 minutes, in which a bizarre and completely incongruous happy ending is tacked on to the movie, is terrible. It falls back on every feel-good cliché of the genre (note the ending of last year's 'The Constant Gardener') while betraying everything the movie has attempted to establish over the previous two hours. The story has a very clear and obvious ending, and it takes place on an African mountainside, not at a London press-conference. I'm hoping that Warner has the courage to de-Disneyfy the ending before release, as it greatly reduces the impact and credibility of the film.'Blood Diamond' is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen all year - a solid story, compellingly told, with actors delivering great performances. Should Warner decide to deepen the relationship between DiCaprio and Connelly and ditch the lousy ending, it would earn a full 10 out of 10. Whatsmore, it also prompted me to go out to the library and check out several books about the socio-political history of West Africa. I'm sure I won't be the only one, and that is where the true success of the movie lies.",9,13,24,4 December 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," Classic
","'This is Spinal Tap' still holds up as the best mockumentary ever made for the simple reason that it is so believable. All involve manage to push every situation to its limits without making the fatal step into ridiculous slap-stick or obvious parody. The ignorant, self-delusional, preening, mock-sincerity of celebrities, heard in a thousand interviews over the years, is perfectly captured. What makes these characters all the more tragic is that they remain forever clueless as to just how dumb and talentless they really are.The performances from the leads are incredible, with each actor completely inhabiting his character, bringing a depth and honesty that is genuinely award-worthy. The dialogue, much of it improvised, is pure gold, with more quotable lines per minute than just about any other film in history. And of course the music, a pitch-perfect recreation of the very best of strutting cock-rock, is unforgettable.Simply a brilliant movie, and one of the best comedies ever made.",10,1,6,6 February 2006
Grindhouse," Thoroughly Entertaining, Even When it Fails
","'Planet Terror' takes the splatter genre as its primary inspiration. I wanted to see Rodriguez channeling Lucio Fulci, and instead he channeled Romero and Carpenter. For all its CGI dirt and scratches, however fun they may be, the movie never feels like real Grindhouse. It's just too big, with the kind of elaborately designed sets and massive explosions that real Grindhouse movies could only have dreamt about. The whole thing comes over as a parody, as though the genre is being played for laughs; a little too ironic and knowing.'Death Proof' brings together the speedracing genre and the feminist revenge genre, two unlikely bedfellows that ultimately prove to be incredibly compatible. 'Death Proof' is, in itself, split in to two smaller stories, each starting out slowly and building to incredible set pieces. Stuntman Mike (a stand out performance from Kurt Russell), connects the two halves and really holds the whole thing together. The fact that both his character and the scenario are played straight makes it far more frightening that 'Planet Terror's pantomime horror. Mid-way through we see a truly spectacular and jaw-dropping head on collision that beggars belief. And the latter half of the movie features one of the best car chases ever committed to celluloid leading to a roll-reversal finale that had the audience cheering.For me, 'Death Proof' was the more satisfying experience. I'm a huge fan of low-budget gut-munching zombie flicks, but Rodriguez just failed to deliver. He seems to have swapped out all the shocking, watch-between-the-fingers violence, and replaced it with in-jokes and comic asides. Some might like that. I didn't. Tarantino, however, combines two classic Grindhouse genres in to something fresh and thoroughly modern.The only three minutes of the entire double bill that feels like it really came out of 1973, though, is Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' trailer. It's sick and ugly, with dark and grungy photography and appalling editing, and really captures the no-holds-barred nihilistic ugliness that personified so much real Grindhouse.On a final note, the music throughout is excellent. Whether it's the Carpenteresque minimalist synth score or the sleazy faux-jazz, it's authentic, funny and sounds great.",7,5,13,7 April 2007
The Descent," An Excellent Off-beat Horror Movie
","The IMDb reviews seem to be pretty polarized. Viewers either love it or loathe it. At times, it's as though we're all watching completely different films. I, for one, fall into the former category and am proud to say that 'The Descent' is, for me at least, one of the best horror films of recent years.Purposefully harking back to the horror heyday of the 1970s, 'The Descent' takes its leisurely time introducing the premise  six adventurous women get trapped in an unmapped cave system. Refreshingly, there is no obligatory prologue showing us how a previous expedition was massacred. No campfire tales of local legends of mysterious creatures in the woods. In fact, there are none of the expected clues and hints and darting shadows to forewarn us that there is something else down there in the caves with them. When the creatures do appear, they are a brilliant creation of good old-fashioned make-up effects and all the more effective because of it. Though the second half of the film inevitably becomes an 'Alien'-style chaotic pursuit through dark corridors, it's carried off with such skill and relentless pacing that it never falls into tedium. Production design, cinematography, and editing are all first rate. So-called plot holes that other reviewers have pointed out are actually well explained, and the complaints reveal more of the viewer's lack of attention than any problems with what is, in fact, a fairly solid script.If there is a gripe, it's with the character development. While the characters are given far richer and more rounded lives than the usual horror staples, they are poorly developed none-the-less. Little distinguishes the six women other than accent and hair color, and it's a shame that more thought was not put into creating six unique and individual characters. 'Alien', which 'The Descent' so clearly resembles, created diverse and dynamic characters in the first five minutes, and such care pays off ten-fold in our emotional investment during the ensuing action.'The Descent' is a far more professional film than 'Dog Soldiers', and provides a rare degree of originality, solid scares, genuine suspense and gore. A quality movie all round.",9,2,5,14 August 2006
War of the Worlds," Apocalypse Porn That Fails To Satisfy
","War of the Worlds, the only summer movie to have received anything close to the usual level of hype and attention, satisfies tradition by failing to deliver on almost all counts. Conceptual artists, software engineers, production designers, code writers and CGI modelers are once again doing the job of the director, writer and actors. The Academy should retire its Oscars for anything but technical achievement for a while.War of the Worlds has the benefit of some of the best technicians in the industry. The CGI is flawless; the exploding streets, flying debris and panicked hoards all created with utmost realism. The production design, from Ray's cluttered townhouse to Ogilvy's ruined basement, is original and surprising with a fine attention to details, and the sound design is Oscar worthy. The tripods are the real stars of the show. They are beautiful creations - sinuous, domineering and malevolent - and in a better movie would become iconic images. There are several scenes in which the tripods appear over a hilltop, backlit by moonlight, that take the breath away.The technical aspects of the movie could not be bettered, and the Academy Awards will, in these categories, be a battle between War of the Worlds and Revenge of the Sith. The 'above the line' talent, however, as is so often the case, does not deserve such quality work.From Jurassic Park to Mission Impossible to Spiderman, Koepp has proved his ability to write a tautly structured screenplay, successfully finding a satisfying balance between action and character. War of the Worlds has the feeling of a filler project, something thrown together in a few spare weekends. The plot consists of nothing more than having characters running from aliens until they die. Note 'until they die', for the characters do nothing to bring about their demise. The lack of even rudimentary character development makes many actions confusing and unbelievable, Ray's son sudden disappearance half way through the movie to join the army being only the most obvious. The climax, if it can be called such leaves the viewer feeling deflated. The audience I saw it with audibly groaned and filed from the cinema asking a unanimous, 'Was that it?' The lack of ANY tension, suspense, dramatic development, surprise or real character study is unforgivable. And don't blame the book. Books are changed all the time for the sake of film narrative, why make an exception now, when a change is so badly needed.Spielberg, who can direct this stuff in his sleep, does what you would expect of him, but is happy to do no more, though we are thankfully spared the usual Spielbergian mawkish sentimentality. The performances are routine and generic, but lack anything approaching even the shallow depth of action characterization.As an example of Apocalypse Porn, the movie works very well. Everything is blown up and incinerated with gleeful abandon, and the screaming crowds and violent mobs will satisfy any fan of the genre. The technical team should be well paid and awarded, but overall, the movie is a dud and another example of the recent trend for style over substance. Spielberg, Koepp and Cruise are all capable of far better. Let's hope they deliver soon.",4,3,5,5 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Absolutely Mezmerizing
","The movie opens with an almost Wagnerian prelude of discordant chords and leitmotifs, of flickering candlelight and abstract images, that climax in Daniel Plainview's birth from the ground, fully grown and covered in oil, the blood of the earth. Like some kind of primal being from ancient mythology, he has no childhood, no family, no background. He exists for oil and the power, not the wealth, that it can give him. He is matched against an equally ambitious and ruthless individual in the form of Eli Sunday who, like Plainview, has no real interest in wealth, but in power. As Plainview exploits the blood of the earth in his quest to manipulate those around him, so Eli exploits the blood of Christ.And so we have an American Epic that is reminiscent of John Steinbeck and Sinclair Lewis in its depiction of the nation's formative years and the battle between the excesses of capitalism and religion and the weakness and frailty of Man in the face of temptation. Loneliness, desperation, love, betrayal, greed, pride, and a ruthless and unquenchable thirst for power are all explored in a dozen degrees of subtlety. It's played with the full-bloodied brio of archetypes with a sweeping grandeur of image and theme that used to be common fifty years ago but is almost extinct in modern cinema.Overblown, fascinating, beautiful in its period detail, 'There Will Be Blood', is a richly rewarding intellectual and aesthetic experience that deserves much award recognition.",10,9,18,22 January 2008
The Iron Giant," Animation the Old-Fashioned Way
","'The Iron Giant' is a very loose adaptation of Ted Hughes' 1968 children's classic 'The Iron Man'. Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too naÃ¯ve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed.",7,1,3,23 July 2007
Munich," An Outstanding Thriller
","'Munich' is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only 'Munich' is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of 'Munich' are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller, is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography  'Munich' is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with 'Munich', created perhaps the first truly adult movie of his career. We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With 'Munich', he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi.'Munich' is an intelligent and gripping thriller that is a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so. An outstanding achievement.",9,348,514,10 January 2006
Casino," One of the Greatest Films of the 1990s
","1996 was a strong Oscar year  Nixon, Dead Man Walking, Braveheart, The Usual Suspects, Sense and Sensibility, Se7en  but Casino was bizarrely, and shamefully, snubbed that year, with Sharon Stone receiving the movie's only nomination.Told almost exclusively through narration, the film follows the fortunes of Jimmy Conway, an essentially decent man who runs a casino for the mob, and how his loyalty to psycho made-man Nicky Santoro and love of upscale hustler Ginger McKenna leads him down a path of doomed tragedy.Everything about this movie displays a host of talent playing at their peak. All the leads are magnificent; the writing sharp and funny; the direction confident and spellbinding in its aesthetic sensibility; the editing tight and witty; and the soundtrack, providing CONSTANT background atmosphere, is perfect. The whole thing looks beautiful, with a dazzling array of incredible interiors and costumes that perfectly capture the era, the story, and the characters inhabiting it.Epic in scale, as all Scorsese tends to be, the movie plays out like a Greek tragedy, with every character on a trajectory that only leads down into spectacular, violent, drug addled oblivion. Fascinating, riveting, inventive, gaudy, and funny  a success on every level and one of the greatest films of the 90s.NOTE: The head-in-vice scene is painful. I can watch all manner of exploitation/cannibal/grindhouse fare over dinner, but I still can't watch the head-in-vice scene.",10,2,5,30 November 2006
300," Pulp-Mythology at its Finest
","A brilliant, old-fashioned sword-and-sandal epic that in unashamedly embracing its graphic novel origins, seems to evoke the spirit of Steve Reeves' spaghetti-mythology of the 1950s and '60s. Of course, the production values are far superior to anything Pietro Francisci et al were every able to conjure, and there's considerably more blood and guts flying, but in essence, and despite the blanket use of CGI and a multi-million dollar ad campaign, '300' successfully evokes a kind of Saturday matinée innocence that is refreshing.Everything is painted with a very broad brush that relishes in high-camp and scenery-chewing theatrics. The good guys, led by Butler's Leonidas, are all images of stoic pride and honor; the bad guys, in the form of Xerxes and Theron, are all devilishly cruel and inhuman monsters. There's no moral ambiguity. No subtlety. Just a thrilling, testosterone fueled, popcorn action movie, the likes of which we really haven't seen since Ray Harryhausen put down his modeling tools.An excellent movie that manages to rise above the accusation of style-over-substance by being built upon the foundation of a solidly structured narrative and, through Zack Snyder, a clear and singular artistic vision that is backed up with genuine talent. All the performances manage to strike a very difficult balance  being suitably over-the-top while retaining enough humanity to never really descend in to tedious caricature. My only gripe about the entire movie is that editor William Hoy seems out of his depth at times, particularly in the battles, seemingly unable to wrangle things in to coherent scenes. But it is a minor flaw in what is a genuinely fun and exhilarating movie that, given the sheer number of instantly iconic images, is sure to become something of a minor-classic.",9,4,10,12 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Perfectly mediocre
","In a long year of bland movies, lackluster marketing and a series of summer duds, expectations are pretty low for The Fantastic Four. Though it's not as bad as it could have been, it's nowhere near as good as it should have been.The writing is pretty run of the mill stuff. While the script avoids the cringing embarrassment of Daredevil, neither the plot nor the characterization stands out as anything beyond average. There seems to have been a struggle between Michael Francis' desire for emotion and realism, and Mark Frost's popular sense of how to get a story moving. Writing by committee rarely works and the two's strengths cancel each other out. The result is a story that lacks any surprise or tension, populated by characters with no depth or motivation.A good director and great actors can sometimes save a mediocre script, but here we have neither. Tim Story seems way out of his depth dealing with a movie of this scale. Where there should be no-holds-barred, jaw-dropping spectacle, we have action scenes that play like a rerun of The Dukes of Hazard. Many scenes simply run on too long, the characters are left standing around wondering what to do next, and the whole movie has an oddly sedate pacing to it. The actors struggle to bring life to such lazily written, one-dimensional characters. Nobody is expecting King Lear in a comic-book movie, but a little depth of character and believable motivation goes a long way to make us care about what is going on. Michael Chiklis brings a humanity to The Thing that steals every scene in which he appears, but he has the advantage of having a clearly identifiable 'disability' to milk for emotional effect.The CGI seems decidedly third rate, as though the project was given to the trainees to do between the priority assignments. It's rare to see something as simple as a ship floating in space look so unrealistic, and the more complex effects, particularly with Reed Richards' stretching, were terrible. Johnny Storm's motion capture was amateurish, close-ups of his face while engulfed in flame being particularly bad. The Thing never looked like anything but latex, and in many scenes you could actually see the rubber creasing at the joints. Its design gave no sense of real solidity and never for a moment do you believe that he is made of stone.Overall, from the script to the performances to the visual effects, Fantastic Four reeks of a low-priority project put into the hands of individuals who aren't quite ready for the responsibility. Maybe we've finally come to the point where $100 million just isn't enough to successfully pull off this kind of movie any more.",5,3,6,11 July 2005
Gladiator," Six Years Later and Still the Best
","'Gladiator' was the movie that proved that sword-and-sandal epics were still economically viable, leading the way for 'Troy', 'Alexander', and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. It remains the best of the bunch, a near miracle considering that half of it was written well into production and one of the leads (Oliver Reed) died half way through filming.The screenplay displays none of the usual problems usually associated with multiple writers and battling egos. It is structurally sound, admirably balancing action with drama, and the characters are all well rounded, complex and believable. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best director's around when it comes to 'action with a heart', and his vision of 2nd century Roman Europe is beautifully extended by flawless CGI that achieves exactly what it should while never drawing attention to itself. Arthur Max and Janty Yates, regular Scott collaborators, do an excellent job of bringing a warts-and-all grittiness and realism to the movie. Though the designs aren't that authentic (Imperial interiors were rarely all-black!), they play a large part in ridding the genre of the traditional toga-party kitsch.The leads are excellent. It's to be expected that Richard Harris and Derek Jacobi can do this stuff in their sleep, and Djimon Hounsou has been playing the same role of proud and stoic nobility, albeit very well, ever since 'Amistad'. But Joaquin Pheonix, in his first real adult role, somehow manages to make a sympathetic character out of what amounts to a murdering, incestuous sociopath, and with all due respect to Benecio del Toro, the Oscar that year should have belonged to Pheonix. Russell Crowe, for all his off-screen nonsense, is able to consistently deliver such natural performances that he completely inhabits his characters and was fully deserving of his Oscar win.'Gladiator' is an excellent movie  a textbook example of how these kinds of movies SHOULD be done. It's a shame that the subsequent sword-and-sandal movies haven't come close to the quality of this movie. 'Gladiator' remains the benchmark and it will be a long time before it is surpassed.",10,1,1,20 December 2006
All the President's Men," Heroic Journalists? Those were the days...
","After the flawed but fascinating 'Parallax View', Alan J. Pakula learns from his mistakes, and delivers a more logical and satisfying story in 'All the Presidents Men'. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. Another bravado turn from cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a world of intensely glaring lights and ominously inky shadows. Subtle and realistic performances from the entire cast create a believable pressroom atmosphere of rivalry, idealism and integrity.The story has been the prototype for every conspiracy thriller since, establishing all the motifs that would eventually be exhausted by 'The X-Files' and become cliché. The narrative flows smoothly, and Goldman does an excellent job of reigning in a potentially incomprehensible plot line, a feat that won him a much-deserved Oscar. The story does, however, slow down in spots, becoming repetitious, and could have benefited from a little judicious pruning.An excellent movie, that not only sheds light on a historic episode without the usual glossy spin, but highlights the pitiful condition of modern journalism, a fall from grace that in time will prove to far more terrifying and long reaching than anything perpetrated by Nixon and his cronies.",8,4,7,11 March 2005
Atonement," Suprsingly Unmoved
","The first half of the movie, set in the oppressive heat and isolation of an English country estate, is perfect. The over-elaborate wallpapers, the richly carved woodwork, the overgrown garden grottoes and the still ponds create an atmosphere of ripe foreboding.The second half of the movie, however, set five years later is extremely disappointing after such a powerhouse opening. I, for one, was waiting for the big twist, the surprise, the payoff, that every reviewer had been talking about. It never came. The first half is tightly and elaborately plotted. The second has no plot at all: Robbie and Cecilia meet for tea; Robbie wanders around northern France; Cecilia does nothing at all; and Briony washes bedpans. There's no real sense of passion or longing between the separated lovers, and if we are to believe that Briony has volunteered for such menial work as a kind of self-inflicted punishment, she bares her lot so stoically that we never get a sense that she is suffering in any way, whether physically or emotionally. The constant announcements of 'three weeks later', or 'six weeks earlier', unnecessarily complicating the timeline of events, has the viewer questioning the veracity of the hidden meta-'storyteller' long before the supposedly surprising last act.The fact is that none of the plot turns, those that the Washington Post describes as 'reverberate in a series of excruciating twists', come as any real surprise. The viewer knows that the moment Robbie neatly folds up his dirty little note to Cecilia that he'll mistakenly pick up the wrong one, just as we know that when he passes it into the hands of Briony she'll not resist the temptation to read it. We know that Briony, given her state of mind, will accuse Robbie, just as we know the identity of the real culprit, who has been leering at every underage girl in the vicinity for the last half hour. While being able to predict every turn of events may build a certain degree of fateful dread, it does not constitute 'excruciating twists'.Jacqueline Durran, who created the grittily authentic costumes for 'Vera Drake', does an equally stellar job here. With Sarah Greenwood (production design) and Seamus McGarvey (cinematography), the three of them effortlessly recreate the world these characters life in, able to bring something fresh and original to settings that have been recreated a thousand times in movies over the years. The entire production is of the highest quality and the performances are universally excellent. But for me at least, the narrative was predictable and the story lacking in real passion or tragedy.",7,1,5,21 December 2007
V for Vendetta," Awful!
","Terrible, terrible, terrible film. A plot that betrays an amateurish understanding of narrative, with zero suspense, populated by uncharismatic, barely audible characters spouting some of the most inane dialogue ever put into the mouths of actors, all against a dull background of generic production design. The films ultimate sin, however, is being so boring that I was studying the design of the theatre light fixtures for most of the second half.If you're going to present the destruction of a fascist dictatorship, you have to show us why that dictatorship is so bad. People sitting around watching TV, and politicians talking to giant screens is hardly an Orwellian vision of a nightmare society.Not every action, whatever its size or significance, needs to be accompanied by a five-minute monologue. We are not idiots. We get it with a silent look. We get it with a single word. Stop preaching.Oh, I really can't be bothered - A truly dull and worthless film that should be avoided at all costs.",1,8,21,23 March 2006
