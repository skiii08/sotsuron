Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can (M), now showing at The Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu, is destined to become one of the big movies of 2003 as the chemistry is perfect both on and off-screen.
","It has a big name director, in the shape of Steven Spielberg, as well as an all star cast, in the form of Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, and it has wonderful music from one of the movie industry's foremost composers, John Williams. Catch Me If You Can is the amazingly bizarre true story of a real life cat and mouse game between DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr and Hanks as FBI agent Carl Hanratty. Abagnale comes to US Government attention after posing as an airline pilot to cash a series of forged cheques. Running with the money, he boards a series of planes in uniform to get a free ride, cashing millions and travelling more than two million miles for free. All this before he can turn 18. DiCaprio, who is approaching 30, is stretched to his acting limits as he plays a young character impersonating older characters including a doctor and a lawyer . He also plays the character at various stages of his life. A memorable scene is when Abagnale, posing as a Mr Fleming, has a tailor copy a suit he had seen on Sean Connery in a James Bond movie. He drove away from the scene to the 007 theme. Ian Fleming, of course, wrote the James Bond books. Hanks, who is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, is superb as the disgruntled FBI agent who is always one step behind his quarry. Hanratty is irked by Abagnale's baiting, which is hilarious, and Hanks plays a complex character who often refuses to show his humanity  until he catches up with Abagnale. There's also a weighty performance from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Snr, DiCaprio's character's father, whose portrayal is complemented by that of Nathalie Baye, who plays his mother Paula. Almost everything about this film is right. From the opening credits, reminiscent of the classic TV shows of the 1960s, to the authentic wardrobe and John Williams' wonderful score. The only thing wrong with the film are the moral choices that Abagnale makes when pretending to be something that he is not. Catch Me If You Can is all about taking responsibility for your actions. When Abagnale is caught he must serve time. But it is not the end of his life but rather the beginning.",Null,0,1,29 May 2003
The Ring," You could be forgiven for expecting to see Hobbits when viewing The Ring (R16) but the film contains nothing so wholesome.
","In director Gore Verbinski's horror/thriller flick a young journalist called Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is forced to investigate a mysterious video cassette which is believed to have caused the death of her niece. Helping her solve the mystery of the ring, which appears on the short video, is her former partner Noah (Martin Henderson) who also happens to be a video expert. To top it all off their son, Aidan (David Dorfman), is receiving strange messages from beyond the grave. Nothing is as expected in this unusual film  a remake of the 1998 film Ringu. Watts performance as Keller is entirely believable, with the audience wondering what fate may befall her following her viewing of the video, although her skills as a journalist leave a lot to be desired  I may have missed it but I didn't even see her carrying a notebook. Henderson, too, delivers a good performance eventually having the audience eating out of his hand. Dorfman's turn as Aidan is nothing but spooky. The film mixes horror, as it opens with the death of the ill fated teen, before turning into a thriller, with the search for the origin of the tape, including elements of the mystery genre too, as to how and why the child is receiving such messages. There's a stab or two at moral responsibility, when the true parentage of the child is revealed, but otherwise the film is fairly dark with plenty of sinister overtones. Not recommended for the feint of heart. The Ring is now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre.",Null,0,0,29 May 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Two professionals learn the importance of honesty in any relationship in the romantic comedy How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.
","Advertising executive Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey) unknowingly bites off more than he can chew when he enters a relationship with journalist Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) who has her own secret. Barry has entered a bet with his boss that he can charm any woman into falling in love with him for ten days, while Anderson is doing her best to demonstrate all the things women should not do when dating for an article for her women's magazine. Realistic the Donald Petrie-directed film is not, but there's plenty to giggle at throughout  some of it predictable and some of it surprising. McCounaughey is all too charming in his role as Barry, having his patience tested at every stage of the relationship, while Hudson demonstrates a surprisingly diverse range with her switch from wholesome city slicker to psychotic girlfriend from hell. Carrying an M certificate, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days contains semi-adult themes and includes a small amount of sexual innuendo. An entertaining romantic comedy with a predictable climax. How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is one for the girls, although that doesn't mean that boys won't enjoy it too. Just remember to be honest with one another afterwards!",Null,0,0,10 June 2003
The Bourne Identity," With a plethora of action movies pouring out of the world's studios The Bourne Identity (M) had to pack a different punch to make it a success.
","The Robert Ludlum-directed film, now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, is just different enough to heighten the entertainment level. For a starter the main character wakes up aboard a French fishing vessel with bullet holes in his back completely unaware of who he is and why anybody would want to shoot him. As the story unfolds the man, played convincingly by Matt Damon, discovers he has almost inbuilt skills in the martial arts and is hounded by the American CIA who have ordered their operatives to kill him. As he makes his way across Europe he hooks up with Marie Kreutz, a Gypsy girl played with by a frantic Franka Potente who helps him discover his own identity. All this unfolds in between a number of innovative chase scenes that occur in some of Europe's most beautiful cities from Switzerland to Paris. The Bourne Identity is a film about choices as the man, who discovers he is Jason Bourne, has to decide whether he wants to continue following the path his life has taken him on or do something different. It makes the Bond movies look like several walks in the park. Real edge of the seat stuff.",Null,0,1,20 November 2002
Lilo & Stitch," What would have happened if ET had been a belligerent life-form rather than a friendly one? That's the question Chris Sanders must have asked when he wrote the latest animated Disney movie Lilo and Stitch.
","The film, directed by Sanders who also provides the destructive alien Stitch's voice, is a very touching animated comedy which turns Steven Speilberg's original ET movie on its head. The plot revolves around little Lilo, a five-year-old  Hawaiian orphan, voiced by Daveigh Chase who unknowingly rescues an alien experiment from the dog pound thinking that she has rescued a dog. Her sister and guardian, Nani (Tia Carrere) is none-too-pleased due to his destructive tendencies, but is soon distracted by young surfie David Kawena (Jason Scott Lee). Unbeknown to Lilo the creature she names Stitch is actually experiment number 626 and has been designed to destroy all that he comes into contact with. Because of this Stitch is banished to  an asteroid for the rest of his life but escapes to a blue-green world known as earth. To help with this he has extra thick skin and has been given strength way beyond his means To make the story of family and friendship more alluring Stitch's creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba voiced by David Ogden  Stiers, and the one-eyed Agent Peakley (Kevin McDonald) have a different idea. They are despatched by the Galactic Federation of Planets to capture Stitch and bring him home without interfering with the native humans. As the story unfolds Stitch learns what it is to be part of a family, albeit a very dysfunctional one, and feels like he belongs for the first time in his short life. As well as being loosely based on ET, in basic concept only, there are tips of the hat to the Star Trek television series as well as the Star Wars movies. The most obvious is when Stitch, imitating Jedi Master Yoda in Attack of the Clones, catches a laser blast in his hands, forms it into a ball and tosses it back at his attacker. Unlike most Disney films Lilo and Stitch has little music, save for the occasional clip of Elvis Presley which helps punctuate Lilo's obsession with the singer. Like Stuart Little 2,  Lilo and Stitch is packed full of family values and emphasises the importance of friendship. Hilariously touching.",Null,11,14,21 October 2002
Blue Crush," When I saw the shorts for Blue Crush (M) I thought it looked nothing more than an excuse to get a few girls into bikinis.
","But the film, which begins its run at the Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu today, turned out to be far more than that. Set on the Hawaiin coast Blue Crush, directed by John Stockwell, tells the story of Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) a dedicated surfer who falls for Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) a professional American football player in the days leading up to a huge surfing competition. But her flatmates Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) have different ideas as they play surrogate mother to Anne Marie's younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem). There's plenty of action, with huge crashing waves, as Anne Marie abandons her training to teach Matt to surf. But is it just a holiday romance? Will she be too distracted to make the competition? Ultimately the film is about overcoming your fears. Anne Marie fears a major surfing accident and is cautious beyond measure when it comes to riding the waves. Later, she develops a fear that Mat might just be using her for a holiday romance. Blue Crush is the ultimate surfie movie and bound to be a huge hit in New Zealand this summer.",Null,0,0,1 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The world's most famous pint-sized wizard is back and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is darker and more disturbing than its predecessor.
","The film, now showing at the Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu, carries a PG certificate and rightfully so as the story features the petrification of countless characters and writing on the wall in blood! These scenes occur following an encounter with the beast let loose from the dreaded Chamber of Secrets. The whole plot revolves around the fact that the millennium-old chamber has been opened in an attempt to rid Hogwarts School of Witchcraft from mud bloods - those students whose ancestry includes non-witches. It's up to the main cast, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), to conduct the investigation into who has let the creature out, breaking all the school rules in the process. Witchcraft is practiced aplenty throughout the film and there are all sorts of nasty consequences, including a scene where a spell backfires consigning Weasley to eat slugs. The chemistry between the trio, directed by Chris Columbus, is believable but all three have visibly grown since last year's film. All three are much taller and the voices of both 13 year-old Radcliffe and 14 year-old Grint are beginning to break. There's even a hint of stubble on Radcliffe's face during one shot and a subtle hint of romance between Weasley and Granger, played by a 12 year-old. The larger cast read like a who's who of the British film industry with the likes of Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh doing a turn as the Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, Maggie Smith as colleague Minerva McGonagall, the late Richard Harris as head teacher Albus Dumbledore, traditional heavy Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Scots favourite Robbie Coltrane as  Rubeus Hagrid, former Monty Python star John Cleese as the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly-Headless Nick, and Educating Rita star Julie Walters as Molly Weasley. No doubt Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will be a hit with fans of the JK Rowlings books.",Null,0,0,9 December 2002
X2: X-Men United," X-Men sequel X2 tells the story of a group of mutants who see it as their duty to act as the guardians of humanity.
","At the head of the X-Men, as they are called, is Professor Charles Xavier, played by none other than Patrick Stewart, who has played Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation since 1987. Going up against him, and his band of unusual superheroes, is supervillain Erik Lehnserr AKA Magneto, played Sir Ian McKellen, known to many New Zealanders as Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. For a science fiction flick the film relies little on science, although there are some referenced to evolution, and has plenty of morals - even Christian ones. The most obvious morals come from Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, the German mutant otherwise known as Nightcrawler who prays when he's in a scrape and is constantly talking about his faith in Jesus - refreshing for a film that could so easily have relied on technobabble. At times the film, now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, was difficult to follow with the plot leaping all over the place - perhaps a result of not having seen the first film. The cast, including New Zealander Anna Paquin as Rogue, delivered a sterling performance and made me want to hire the original from the video store. I'm particularly intrigued by Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) back story. If you love comic book adaptations then you're bound to love X2.",Null,1,2,29 May 2003
