Minority Report," Minority Report-science fiction complexity thrives
","'Minority Report' is a film that I have always recognized from its title, yet never had the urge to watch it. After seeing it, I can easily say that I regret stalling my watching experience for 'Minority Report' for so long. An indulgent treat from start to finish, renown directory Steven Spielberg managed to concoct a memorable science fiction work that also achieved so many aspects of film that are typically difficult to master with ease. With an incredibly talented cast that is a pervasive positive mainly by the outstanding chemistry between Tom Cruise and Collin Farrel, to the vast and interesting lineup of locations that all have their own, unique significances to the story, to Spielberg's astonishing proficiency to subvert expectations, 'Minority Report' truly does craft a prosperous adventure for any audience member effortlessly. For these reasons, 'Minority Report' is deserving of a 10/10 score and an overall A+ grade.",10,0,0,28 June 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Spike Lee Excellence
","'Da 5 Bloods' is a movie that has recently come out on Netflix and it is one of, if not, my favorite film of the year. Spike Lee crushed it with his most recent directed project; his choice of stylization, his handling of the story and characters, his implementation of his chosen message - all are used with spectacular results, and I couldn't envision a better way to execute these aspects. Acting is impeccable in this film, especially from Delroy Lindo; every character depicted feels like their own, distinct person, and could have carried the movie on their own. With an amazing latter finale, the first half hour is a bit heavy on exposition; however, that could be excused given that it makes the audience more attached with the main four characters who are portrayed as Black Vietnam War veterans who have been rejected by society. Ultimately for these reasons, I give this movie a 9/10 and an A- grade.",9,5,10,16 June 2020
