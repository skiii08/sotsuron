Black Swan," Towers Above Its Genre, That Awful Psychedelic Genre
","Don't choose this movie, as I did, because you are hot for little Natalie Portman, and know she will be in ballet tights.Maybe chose it for the echoing themes, in the Cabaret style, played out in the protagonist, and in the show her character performs, and in the movie itself. That's always what they used to call a 'head trip'.Of course she plays a ballerina cast to play both the good white swan and the evil black swan. The director kept scolding her for never letting go and releasing her dark side. Meanwhile, there is an over controlling former ballerina mother, and a former mentor, now just fired, and a younger, more confident rival. And the director seemed like a sexual predator, and that his penis was the key to stardom.It could have been terrific suspense, but instead, it was impossible to tell who was crazy, and what was real. There were horrifying scenes of her self mutilation, but some of the wounds that we saw inflicted weren't there, and some that we didn't see, were. The mentor was pretty surely hospitalized. But various stabbings of the mentor and rival and some hand smashings of the mother may or may not have happened.It was psychedelic, I realized the next day. Christ I haven't seen a psychedelic movie since they flowered in the late 60's and gradually faded out in the 70's. And glad of it. I hate them. But this film was riveting and intense, so it towered above that genre.And I got more true horror from what Natalie did to her cuticle than from various beheadings and disembowelling scenes in other films.Natalie was more than willing to show her body scrawny and ugly, and her face ugly and distorted in intense passions. She is, as we know, a very good actress. Unless it was very good special effects, she also became a very plausible ballet dancer, at least to my ignorant eye.Another ballerina, aging, did the swan flapping move, and the camera lingered on how the muscles and wrinkles worked in her strong but scrawny back. The impression it gave went through fascinating, into gross, but then back out again into more fascinating and even impressive. Good for the director!So, it's unique, creative, intense, powerful, moving, fascinating, with multiple layers of symbolism and themes. It towers above its genre. But I hate that genre and don't know what the hell happened!",8,1,2,4 August 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," So much acting! So what.
","It has been on our list forever, a costume drama like PS likes, with actresses that I like (Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johannsen) with feminist and historical themes that PS likes.
It was, of course, about Henry VIII's quest for a son and how it hurt women and men, and the terrible pain from weird gender rules and untrammeled ambition.
Natalie and Scarlet acted their asses off and presented a reality that was horrible, hopefully a high level mark of human awfulness in history.
I interrupted it to make popcorn.
At the end, PS rated it 'Didn't like' and I exclaimed that it was just her thing, like Pride and Prejudice. She said it was nothing like! I said what, they are both about how awful it was for women and how the manners and mores were horrid. With costumes! And female-centric!
Of course I didn't like it either.
She exclaimed that I really don't know her at all.
The next day, I said I recognize that P&P uses wit, and excepting the one cad, everybody is trying in their own flawed way to do their best. Unlike TOBG, which had utterly no wit and was just people at their most dreadful. (Except Mary, their mother, and the matron Queen, Katherine of Aragorn (Aragon?)).
PS seemed glad, and said 'Yeah but now we know Scarlet Johannsen can act.' I sneered 'Her mother must be so proud.' and she laughed and seemed to get exactly what I meant, the complex mix that we are proud as parents, but nobody else really cares, or many even resent it, and now in their shoes, we don't really care either, it didn't do anything for us, and a movie intended to convey only that, is just an elaborate and pointless brag.",5,0,1,28 April 2019
Trouble with the Curve," Innovative Genius!? Nah.
","You will know that Squint Eastwood plays a cranky old baseball scout. His friend, played by John Goodman, knows that evil (computer loving!) schemers on the team are trying to get rid of Squint, so persuades Squint's successful lawyer daughter to go help, despite her bad relationship with Dad. They encounter a charming young man that Squint had scouted. Oh, and it turns out there is a mysterious past incident in the father-daughter relationship.So manipulative! So predictable! Still, the young woman was attractive and the young man was charming. John Goodman was now only fat and ugly, not grotesquely obese, but still charming and warm. Squint, surprisingly, was the weak link. He seemed to be doing a lot of ACTING as a cranky old man. But he already is a cranky old man, so it put him over the top. Luckily, we were watching at home, and since it was so obvious, and not very serious to us, though ever-so-serious to the characters, it became sort of participatory, where we would boo and mock and cheer. So we got some fun out of it.Now here's the thing. The movie revolved around the love of baseball that united all of our heroes. So, maybe Squint wasn't making a bad tearâ€“jerker, far below his usual subtlety and skill, maybe he was using a movie to create a baseball-watching-like experience!? That would be pretty awesome. It would heighten and reflect the fictional themes past the fourth wall! Nah.",6,0,2,13 April 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Stupid. BUT...!
","Hell, I've seen worse movies than that and watched them a second time.It had some charms. Granted, there were some stupid bits, but it was flying by so fast I could hardly tell. I liked the wisecracks, found the romance touching, loved the special effects for Electro. Electro's motivation was, I admit, stupid. And I'm not seeing the 'bitten by a radioactive eel' thing. The 3D worked. I finally just forgot about it while it, probably, increased the impact. The way they portrayed the action was effective and creative. The slo- mo and magnifications were mixed in smoothly. The immense time at Gwen's grave-site was corny and childish and stupid. But it is, after all, a Marvel comic, built on melodrama wrought up so large it becomes physical. And the acting/writing choice of making him perky and quippy first time back in the field was stupid. He was weird about giving his blood. And Osborne was inexplicably urgent about a disease that apparently wouldn't kill him till he was what, in his fifties? The rhino suit was cool looking, and I loved the glimpses of suits for Vulture and Dr. Octopus.I think they should give up on their rule about living in a world of ordinary physics. They don't seem to be able to stick to it anyway. This world should have rare but real magic, like in the Marvel comics. That might work better for Rhino than a suit with inexhaustible ammo and an inexplicable horn. Besides, why armour up a man so big, when a tank already works great?Electro is pretty tough to justify. We want to personify electricity, so it has to be science-y. I like the new version where he can exist as an invisible field, and pass through wires. So, I'm thinking maybe some science-y blather about figuring out how to store information in electrons for computing, and how they can program it to manipulate the electrons' positions. That kind of breaks the science, so pass over that quickly. So then some desperate scientist stores his own mind in electricity, but it goes horribly awry, driving him insane. He could have some sort of sad quest to re-build his own body. Still, that might be too much power. He could, after all, just lay back and manipulate the energy in a person's brain a little bit to kill them instantly and quietly. Why lob around big blasts?To be honest, as a story, it is a 6, but the budget, direction, and rarity, raise it up.",8,10,28,17 May 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Boring but so Glossy!
","I had seen it before, and in all honesty, I was a bit bored this time. It all revolved around a skinny young woman. Yes, she has pleasing curves on her face, but quit jerking me with that stupid chain on my brain! There were virtually no clever twists, though lots of predictably pulling off fake faces.In MI1, Tom (Ethan Hunt) had to out-think his IMF boss. Here, he has to out-action his IMF peer, the mean one, whose body so closely matches his own, that their boss chose the villain to pretend to be Ethan.I try to suspend my disbelief, but how is it that a carrier of a deadly weaponized virus isn't contagious at all, until exactly 20 hours, which is also when the anti-virus won't work any longer. Are those supposed to be causally connected? What do they think viruses are?This is the John Woo version, and there is a lot of action, very fancy, both martial arts and vehicular, but I know it is only dancing, and ludicrous dancing at that, no relation to actual fight moves that might save my life. I also know that it will go on till they run out of imagination or budget and then resolve whatever way they want. OMG, I think I am bored with action movies.I have to give it the 8 stars just because they spent so much, I love the franchise, and well, it looked great.",8,0,1,25 October 2015
Friends with Benefits," Denies Itself
","How did this thing get rated under 7 on IMDb, when it clearly deserves a ... 7?Mila Kunis was a pretty good actress and good to look at. It tried to flout the conventions of the romantic movie, and even got Jason Segal to act in a fake movie they kept watching. There was more skin, and more sex up front. There was much more sweet kindness in the first Act. But it was pretty much a romantic movie with the first and second Acts switched. They start out sexy and friendly, but then become contentious in the second Act. She still had to deal with her issues and he still had to confess his love in a big public display, and love was still the only thing that mattered. They also tried faster talking than usual but my wife and I could hardly follow it.I'll bet some romCom fans trashed it for the betrayal. It was like some cheerleader than claims to hate 'those vain girls'. That would grind the other cheerleaders.Justin Timberlake was OK, but dragged it down a little. Damn that guy, he does OK at all sorts of things that pay him millions.",7,0,0,9 February 2015
Jack Reacher," Turn off the sound. The rest is fine.
","The dialogue is gawd-awful. Really, really bad. But Werner Herzog, a famed documentarian, makes a surprising and very effective appearance.And the direction is top notch, with vivid, good looking, impact-full, communicative shots. The plot isn't even bad. Usually the same guy writes the plot and the dialogue so they fail or triumph in tandem. Not this time, maybe the screenwriter did one, and the novel's author did the other.Traditionally, I grudgingly like Tom Cruise's performance. This time, he went for a characterization of the hero as a guy who takes himself far too seriously. Otherwise, the acting all around is OK.",6,0,2,19 April 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Smart, Fun, Exciting, Moving, Creative, Funny, what do you want?
","Excellent! It was an Alien Invasion but with a Groundhog Day premise, and a subtly handled love interest. Cruise was very good. The effects were great, the action was great. Granted, the premise was impossible. Where would the memories be kept? But given the premise, it develops smartly from that. In fact, the cleverness of the solutions, and the cleverness of the presentation, deliver lots of those delightful ah-ha moments.Like Groundhog Day, it isn't easy presenting a moving one-day romance. But they come through again!I guess I'm a sucker for that premise. Groundhog Day is in my top 5, this is probably in my top 20, Memento, in a related vein, would be in my top 100.In the last 20 minutes, I kept thinking, 'Don't let them screw the ending!' They pushed the envelope a bit. It was tough to swallow, but I got it down and felt satisfied.",9,0,2,16 July 2014
