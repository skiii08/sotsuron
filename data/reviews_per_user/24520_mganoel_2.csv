War Dogs," A True Gem
","First off: True story = WinBut wasn't just any true story movie. This story is insane. Like the part when they're driving to Iraq? That was epic. In fact, the whole movie was awesome. Guns and money? Uh ya awesome.Hill nails it. He does the fat/cocaine/F-you-Im rich image so well it's a bit concerning since, only because I like him as an actor. Checks all the boxes in terms of a good movie, and you walk away learning some pretty interesting stuff.Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...",10,0,2,11 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Meh. Nothing new...
","Pros: Boyega and Isaac were refreshing, bringing in much needed humour to a high impact, yet predictable action movie.Cons:1) Bringing back this movie is like bringing back the VW beetle. The VW was revolutionary in 1930 - technology was way ahead of its time. When they re-introduced it in the late 90s, it was just another car. The Force Awakens is just another action movie. Watching any Star Wars episode in the 70s would have been amazing. However, it's 2015 (almost 2016). And the visual effects are, well, nothing new.... It was like watching the most recent bond film - very predictable...2) Hostage scenes: Both of them were very annoying. Question: In movie scenes when the subject is held against their will and asked for the goods, why do they decide to become honest with the bad guys? Why does Poe tell them exactly where the map is when he can lie about it being on another planet and buy himself and the resistance some time? This always pisses me off in movies and they did it twice in this movie! Sure it's dishonest, but we're talking about saving the Galaxy here folks!!! 3) The new Vader. I was hoping it was Javier Bardem when I first heard his voice. When unmasked was a total weenie.4) Jedi moments lacking substance. Long pauses and nothing happens. You think there will be some cool jedi magic or wisdom, but no, just another long... awkward... pause.. and nothing.",4,13,19,23 December 2015
