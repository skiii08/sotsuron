Walk the Line," Cute story, could be better, but pretty okay
","I liked the movie, not exactly the kind that I would find praiseworthy, however it was interesting enough to keep me watching. I liked the elements of romance and struggle constantly intertwining and showing the truth of life. The plot of the story was about trying to overcome the power of drugs, and to get with the people he needed in his life. I loved this time period because of the event when Bob Dylan went electric. It pointed out the fact that it was hard to compete with the old stuff, but showed Johnny's success.",6,0,2,24 January 2019
Miracle," Good family fun
","A great movie showing rivalry between the two superpowers of the world, how we faced each other in many ways, but mainly in this, hockey. Great movie and telling of the past.",8,0,0,25 April 2019
42," Loved it, wonderful telling of a historical event
","They really portrayed it well, and it felt like a real movie too. It didn't feel too boring, I could feel truly for the characters and wanted to help. I personally dislike baseball, but still I have always loved Jackie Robinson and his story, and this only made me like it more.",10,1,2,13 February 2019
Remember the Titans," A favorite
","Shows the struggle that they had in the past, but with the protagonists pushing past it. It has wonderful moments filled with emotion, it gives you all you need from a good movie.",10,0,1,24 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Feel good movie, progression
","Loved it, it showed the struggles NASA faced back in the day and how they slowly desegregated because they were fighting for the future together. All the problems that they faced were shown so openly and you can feel all of the suffering of our past.",9,0,4,15 March 2019
Hidden Figures," A movie that makes you get the feels
","Segregation, science, life and death, the movie has many different things that are all put together, and it really makes you feel all the emotions. It shows the step in America that was not only before the step on the moon, but even more important. The act of Americans coming together, despite race, to solve problems, to unite. That is why this movie makes you get, as I put it, 'The feels'.",9,0,4,15 March 2019
Selma," Good movie for the feels
","Watching this portrayal of the past with Martin Luther King trying to help people with their rights is amazing. You can sympathize with the characters as it shows the brutality and discrimination of our past. Great movie, helps us see why we all try to help one another in this great wide world and not try to bring people down because of who they are.",10,0,3,1 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Historically accurite, but not too entertaining
","I thought that the movie was well made, showing plenty of what was going on. It was good in the sense of telling the story, but i didn't feel like it was truly the possible end of human civilization, which it truly was. I did like however, that they had shown the facts like us having missiles in Turkey, and making sure it wouldn't go public. I imagine that people more into history than I would enjoy this film, but it isn't my favorite.",6,0,1,13 February 2019
Back to the Future," Cute
","Really good story, funny and teaches you about the differences between the 80´s and 50´s. Great casting, the characters were portrayed perfectly. It´s a wonderful and exciting story where time shows us what our past was like.",8,0,1,30 January 2019
