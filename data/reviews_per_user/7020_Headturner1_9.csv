Blade Runner 2049," not basing off the orriginal
",I don't even remember if I saw the original. But it seems as tho most the bad reviews are from people comparing it the the original. I thought it pretty good. The acting was good loved Luv. Thought everyone's acting good except 'gasp' Harrison Ford. Jared leto does a good job of playing creepy characters. Yes there were flaws in the script but I thought it was better than 80% of things released now a days. I also loved Joy. Seems most the men only liked it for the women. maybe buy a fashion magazine and quit whining. I believe this is worth the watch and Ryan gossling was also good. If you just go in with a open mind and not compare the two I think you'll enjoy it.,7,1,3,10 August 2018
Hereditary," What the heck?
",I came here to maybe see if anyone could decipher such ridiculousness. I'm sorry but Tony Collette was so annoying. I was laughing for most of the film. it could have been good have their have been a decent script for them to go off. I mean the part where Charlie's beheaded. No blood. They way they act? The scene where she acts like a psychopath trying to summon Charlie and the son. My god! what was that? I was laughing most of the movie. What a shame for such good actors. I love gabriel. And the ending. This reminded me of Mother! A torture to sit thru.,4,3,8,19 June 2018
The Irishman," totally agree with spin 97 comment
","Omg. Where to begin. As I was watching I kept messaging my sister whom watched it the night before... ' Why didn't they just get younger actors', etc. Deneiro looks like he's always mad and bloated and can barely move. Pacino( my favorite actor of all time) goes in an out of a bad Chicago accent. Poor Pesci came out of retirement for this. Haha. The soundtrack wasn't up to the standards of other Scorsese films, their really wasn't a story. I was looking forward to this for like a year. I wanted to see all the old mobster actors in one more film. Tho now I need to go watch Goodfellas, Carlitos way, Casino. I had higher hopes. I think they should of just gotten younger actors to play the young scenes but that isn't really what ruined it, it was many many things a Scorsese film should of had...",5,1,13,30 November 2019
"I, Tonya"," Omg
",I can't believe people are commenting on how they feel bad/ ashamed for what they thought about Tonya. I lived and breathed skating and knew all about her and the ' incident' It's like saying a serial killer is ok to do what he did because nature vs. nurture . She got her karma swiftly when her shoe lace wouldn't work or broke as she said I watched it live. Ok.. On to the movie. I think Allison Janney was the standout. Margot was good but she kind over did Tonya as some bad ass. Tonya was a meek little girl baby in front of the press. Her accent was way off ( and I know she's from OZ so is my mother) but se had her sounding from Min or Wisconsin or something. The movie was alright. Some compare it to Goodfellows. No. It was decent but I feel a bit campy or something. Cant put my finger n it.,7,0,5,8 April 2019
Molly's Game," great film
","I wanted to start my review for the people saying her skiing career was embellished or a lie. She ranked third in North America in 98. So anyways. I'm glad I finally watched. Somehow I'd skip by it as I thought it wouldn't be my kind of movie. How wrong was I. I love movies showing women of power in a mans world, Heddi Fleiss, Molly bloom. Were not very different in the fact the guys came to gamble, play poker but kept returning for the beautiful women and the excitement of something they couldn't conquer. I was reading reviews on another film Jessica was in ( I've never seen her in anything) saying she's a horrible actor. I have to disagree. She isn't an over the top actor but a very fine one indeed. I thought all the performances were great. Isra was excellent. The narrating, in the beginning did kind of get in the way of immersing yourself in a scene completely and was a bit confusing. But I enjoyed it and it became less of an issue as the movie progresses. Yes people it's a true story but a movie. Could tearing it apart for not being exactly like the real story. It's as close enough a movie can get. So over all I' really glad I watched it. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",9,1,2,6 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," My take
","That Quentin had a bet ' I could write the worst film ever and people will still call it a masterpiece ' and he's be correct. This was awful. All the scenes filming, the narration. just everything, The manson family scenes could have been good. I loved Pulp, Ingorious, Django, jackie brown( leaving things out because I wrote a whole review and it said it would e rejected for profanity ok) So I refuse to gve this anymore of my time. He needs to come out with another film so us intelligent filmies don't remember him for this trite! Edit to add.. Good films aren't available so soon on bootleg sites and such. My friend said he watched it 2 days ago on some free app.",1,25,53,28 July 2019
A Clockwork Orange," greatest of all time?
","I remember years ago there was a list of the 100 most disturbing films I watched as many as I could and wondered who the heck comes up with these lists?!? anyways I didn't know this was on the list of 200 best films. I'm completely and utterly convinced ( more so reading these novel long reviews) it's because the consensus does and as everyone rights about society, you are the cliche that is that and the need to feel superior in intelligence to the masses. I do not follow the norm. It's one ad only positive is it doesn't look like it was filmed in the 70's. I always thought 90's. You can put lipstick on a pig but what does it remain? I had to forward thru most of it and stopped and watched now and again. I doubt I missed anything tho. Where to start? Yes, this is about violence but it wasn't disturbing, didn't make a point. why? They wore makeup and the worst suits and hats I've ever seen. it wasn't realistic and get that but it was just stupid a unch f stupid gratuitous scenes over and over. I watched it because I like surreal freaky unusual films. This just tries to be one. I've only seen one other Kubrick film' eyes wide shut' and that wasn't much better. I do want to see 2001 space oddesy and maybe I'll change my mind about him. tho I've watched many supposed 'brilliant ' directors films that are highly rated and been disappointed but I don't simply follow the masses and like something to be with the in crowd and feel I'm superior to others...",2,0,6,9 July 2019
The Shape of Water," Oscar?
","I usually don't watch films that receive oscars ( like indie films better) watched the trailer and ( don't like love stories either but like fantasy type movies) looked ok so I gave it a go. I honestly think it came of as comedic and would have worked better as that. Like others the story was boring and silly and so much fluff was added because it lacked a story. The creature looked bad for a decently shot film. I mean were'd she think it a good idea to have sex with it? Might it kill her, who knows what was lurking but when she derobes and goes in there wth?!? I don't think it's a 1 rating tho I'm in the same vein as the others problems with the film but it wasn't the worst movie I've seen and I watch tons of films. It was an ok film with lots of stupidity going on but not horrible.Don't know what else to say.",4,7,12,20 August 2019
The Nice Guys," Not good
","This was recommended on a forum 'for movies like Guy Ritchie'. Not. This wasn't funny just cliche silly predictable stuff. I think Russel and Ryan weren't the perfect choices for this. The little girl( don't know the actresses name) stole the movie. She was great and had great comedic timing crow and gossling not so much. The story was generic and predictable and it wasn't entertaining imo. Was it the worst film I've ever seen? No, but definitely not an 8 -9 movie. People 8-9 movies are the likes of classics like Goodfellas, Officer and a gentlemen etc ! I wish people didn't skew the ratings.",3,3,6,11 September 2019
