Blade Runner 2049," Perhaps Too Many Re-Writes as the film Wanders
","There is lot to like about this film IF you are a fan of the original film. If not, there may be a few places where you might be checking the clock on your phone. This film has been handled with care every step of the process, recruiting Roger Deakins being the most important. The direction is fine, the production design is apropos, the music works well, the characters are OK. But nothing really yells masterpiece other than the cinematography. Fittingly so, our protagonist Ryan Gosling slowly explores many interesting sets. Warning - many spoilers ahead. Gosling works well as a new Blade Runner that is also a replicant. He accepts that his memories are implants and dutifully goes about his life. His partner is a hologram, who shares some self-aware moments, perhaps feeling like a variation of the film 'Her'. Exploring this hologram's desires at times felt like a side-trip that kept us away from the main story. It is a foregone conclusion that this film exists primarily to answer questions from the first film. Knowing this, the script at times teases the audience that we will get to that destination, but then steer us into another rewrite. What may have been originally a hint at other goings on, feels fleshed out into many subplots. Our antagonist, the heir apparent to Tyrell, suffers from being overshadowed by other supporting characters and their own storylines. This includes a female Terminator of sorts. She enforces the other replicants, and a few humans too. Buried in these many storylines is Deckard, and the film waits until the third act to even acknowledge his existence in this sequel. In the fourth act, we see a CGI young Rachel. Quite appropriate as the plastic look of an animated human face gives her an unreal quality. I found the extra screen time to Gosling's holo-girlfriend as an idea that sounds more impressive on paper than in reality. She synchronises her movements to a prostitute, so that they can physically interact. It's an effect that wanted to be poetic, but I found it to be only mildly interesting. Again, somewhat familiar territory covered in 'Her'. The storytellers also wanted to be poetic, only to duplicate similar Harrison Ford storylines in recent years. Old Indy runs into his son. Old Han Solo confronts his misbehaving son. Now Old Deckard has to come to terms with his offspring. It leaves the answer to who that offspring may be until the end of the film. It probably was yet another rewrite that changed who that person is. I walked out of the theatre feeling OK about the experience. Maybe I need another showing to get a proper perspective on how effective the characters are in getting me to care about them. But in the meantime, another revelation came upon me as I was watching a film I worshiped pretty much since it was released. I saw the original film when it came out in 1982, and went to a revival theatre to see it anytime it was playing. Including the more recent 'Final Cut' showing in the mid 2000s (and at a special showing yesterday). It occurred to me that the sequel's production design didn't really have to update their vision of the future, because the original production design was such a heavy influence on style into our actual future. Our actual world pretty much resembles what the Blade Runner's world looks like. I noticed that leaving the theatre and driving home past a police car with a string of lights with different colours. Previous to the original film, police cars had the standard two cherries on top (think Blues Brothers). Now it is commonplace to see a spread of lights along the top. Then there are the self-driving cars, something that current technology has caught up with. When Gosling strolls through a gothic-like industrial structure, we are reminded that the original Blade Runner invented this dark look, 'Tech Noir'. Fusing new technology into old buildings is something that is commonplace in every hip warehouse district from San Francisco to all other parts of the country. Then there are the mesmerising cityscapes that now exist for real in China and Arab countries. We are living in the world defined in the first film, and the new film need only toss in a drone or such to stay caught up. The music and sound design from the first film also became a timeless keepsake, preserved and revered over the decades since the film came out. I was not so immersed in the auditory universe of the sequel. No new themes stood out, although the instrumentation was faithful to the original by Vangelis. I could tell the late addition of Hans Zimmer was a desire to add some 'punch' to the soundtrack. This happens by way of loud tribal drumming that we heard a bit of in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Again, another viewing (and listening) session is needed to get a deeper impression of the effectiveness of the sound. As much as I am a nut about the technical and social impact of the original film, it is hard for me to feel the same about this one. On the other hand I am always glad to revisit the Blade Runner universe if it is handled with care.",6,2,3,30 August 2018
First Man," Great Filmmaking but not Oscar-worthy
","I've always thought there needed to be a sequel to 'The Right Stuff'. That movie followed the Mercury program, the first step to getting to the moon. It was an exciting and fun 'you are there' inside look into events that occurred and the people involved. Finally we have a movie that picks up with the Gemini and Apollo programs and gives us a first hand glimpse of what it was like going to the moon. However, while 'The Right Stuff' was an ensemble narrative, focusing on the bigger picture, 'First Man' is a very personal look at Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. While the other film spent time showing a lot of details of the space program, that time instead is spent showing Armstrong with his family. The movie's real narrative is about how Armstrong hid his personal demons from other people. If this was a fictional character, there would probably be a scene where all those upsets that he kept inside come out in some dramatic way. But this film, the only apparent consequence is that his wife demands he opens up.Gosling seems to be a natural for introverted characters and works well. But there was one thing from the outset that prevented me from really enjoying this movie. Shaky Cam. I remember the time when 'Bourne Supremacy' came out. It was a time where filming trends had turned to shaky cam to give the impression that it was more like a documentary and feel more authentic. The down-side is there are people out there like me that are sensitive to motion sickness, and the exaggerated shaking seen on the large screen easily induces nausea. Within the first couple minutes where I realised nearly the entire film was going to be shaky, I had to move farther back from the screen. Even then, with the majority of the framing being extreme close-ups, I had to look away a few times to keep my stomach under control. I was extremely disappointed they chose to film using this overrated and outdated style of cinematography. Latest trends have the majority of a film like this being shot Handheld, but without deliberately bouncing the camera all over the place. Handheld camera operators are capable of shooting very smooth shots, and capture the action without calling attention to itself. There was an interesting technical flaw that I was able to catch while watching this film on the large screen (not real Imax, but the Minimax featured at the AMC theater near me). I could see dirt and hairs in some shots. Real film not digital! It was a nice reminder of how dirt on films was accepted like it was in the 70s. On the other hand, I wonder if the camera assistant was checking the gate properly. One other nitpick is the lack of factual accuracy when it comes to what happened in the NASA space program. There are times that Neil seems to be the subject of attention (as if he's the one in charge) to the expense of the other fellow astronauts. At times it felt a little frustrating that the film would not show major events outside of Armstrong's perspective. As for all those scenes with the family, Claire Foy does a fine job as his wife. There are moments of family time that seem derivative of 'The Tree of Life'. I usually groan when films go over 2 hours, however the subject matter for First Man is so deep, it could easily run 3 hours to cover the many major aspects of the space program. One thing that stands out is the use of sound design. There are moments during the launch or flight that a loud cacophony of sounds scream out of the speakers. Some of these sounds are intentionally meant to be scary haunted house type of sounds. Including the sounds of screams, moans, and eery wind howls blended into the mix. Again, in the name of factual accuracy, were there really such spooky sounds happening? On the other hand, those sound effects do a great job of adding tension during the test flight scenes, which are very exhilarating. In the end the whole is equal to the sum of it's parts. Not greater or lesser. It definitely wants to get Oscar attention, but I doubt it will be a front runner. It achieves what it sets out to do, and tries to explain Neil Armstrong's psyche as he went through the space program. In real life, Armstrong never revealed his thoughts and reaction to being the first human to take the first step toward reaching the stars. This film probably feels required to give us some private insight of what Armstrong was thinking while on the moon, but it is probably not accurate.",6,4,9,14 October 2018
Black Swan," Hard to Recommend - Hard Not To.
","What can I say, I had a negative experience watching this story and couldn't wait for it to end. The critical mass has established that this film is a masterpiece. It would be fruitless for me to argue otherwise. The acting, especially Barbara Hershey, is believable. The editing is brisk. The direction is done well. It is the story, not even the subsequent screenplay, that feels uneven. The character arc is more a straight line than an arc.The confusion the main character is going through leaves no grounding for the audience from the beginning to the end. This constant uncertainty and frustrating tension just made the story an unpleasant experience. Portman is shown constantly throwing up and crying. There was no escape for her or the audience throughout the 1 hour and 40 minutes of the world of professional ballet. Again, the movie features very little actual ballet, which could also disappoint cultural moviegoers who expect some artistic gratification. I actually found the scenes of repetitive practice realistic in comparison to my own life, spending years practicing piano. There was some insight to the behind the scenes world of professional ballet, but that also felt to be not enough to fill an entire screenplay.I started to really lose it in the third act, where instead of watching a character study, I felt like I switched the channel and was watching a David Cronenberg film. Natalie Portman is literally turning into a black swan like Jeff Goldblum was literally turning into 'The Fly'. Then this drama about depression and living in stress tries to become a thriller or horror film, setting up your classic horror shocks with loud sound effects and creepy faces in shadows. Again, my complaint was - what I am as an audience member supposed to feel? The only moment of growth I felt, other than the obvious finale, is when Portman finally stands up to her overbearing mother, and even then we still can find sympathy for the Mother's devotion. Barbara Hershey was perfectly cast as the former ballerina mother with her own sordid past. Darren Aronofsky found the right balance of mania versus reality in the film's presentation, and kept me guessing to the end. However, in the end it saddened me to have such a depressing experience watching a well made film.",6,1,3,7 February 2012
Men in Black 3," 'It's Gotta Have Heart'
","This phrase is a cliché refrain a producer says when someone is pitching a screenplay. All those explosions and special effects mean nothing if we don't care about the main characters. Another issue, a very skeptical moviegoer is not interested in yet another space alien invasion movie unless it has something new to offer. One thing most people agree is that MIB3 should not look like the previous sequels. Reminiscent of another dormant franchise - Indiana Jones - were Agent J & K going to put their suits back on and fight another monster? It kind of starts that way, introducing a fairly engaging villain, but then surprises the summer movie-going audience by turning all touchy-feely. Will Smith, having honed his chops on the sitcom stage, is excellent with body language and cutesy reactions. So pleasantly enough we are taken down a different path, a path that still delivers the actions and effects. But thankfully de-emphasises all those side monster characters. The filmmakers were smart enough (especially the editor) to not fill it full of monster gags at the main MIB terminal like previous films. Not once do you feel 'Been there, done that'. Instead we meet one new fresh alien that has the ability to predict the future. This character almost feels like 'Rain Man' and practically steals the show. So kudos to the filmmakers for steering their way into a script 'with heart'. This includes an engaging Emma Thompson as the next head of MIB, who oddly only appears briefly in this film.But Tommy Lee Jones should start thinking about retirement. Frankly it was hard to look at his aged face, and felt that even if agent K was a real career man he would've retired by now (wait didn't he?). My enthusiasm before going to see this movie was lukewarm, who was asking for another MIB sequel? And where the heck has Will Smith been anyway? The primary motivation was to see Josh Brolin, who worked with Jones in 'No Country For Old Men'. Brolin personifies Jones with lethal accuracy. Little did I know that the filmmakers had us the audience in mind and kept the story clicking along, while stopping along the way to have some pie. Good dialogue (rare), good villain, so is the third act any good? Turns out this film has the opposite problem that most weak stories have, it has a strong 3rd act, while starting with a relatively weak 1st act. One thing I am sick and tired of is a tentpole film that feels obligated to go into extra innings, and go over-the-top with the final action setpiece, where a series of objectives need to be accomplished in order to get to 'The End' and we can all go home. MIB3, a comedy of sorts, follows the golden rule of comedy movies - keep the running time around 90 minutes. Any comedy that runs closer to 2 hours loses it's punch. MIB3 runs around 100 minutes, sparing us the obligatory drawn out finale action set piece. Although there is a prescribed resolution at the Apollo launch, it focuses on the character arcs, and provides a heart tug at the end in an unexpected way. Something that no tentpole film has done in a long time.With that successful examination of characters, this can be accepted as a worthy entry in the MIB franchise, and puts to shame other older franchises that have recently been dusted off. Let's hope that MIB franchise retires with dignity as well.",6,3,7,26 May 2012
Alien 3," Looks Cool but Ruins the Franchise
","Aliens, the first sequel to the excellent 'Alien' is considered to be one of the best action films ever made, and certainly one of James Cameron's best films. It made the cover of 'Time' magazine. It would be hard to top that film with the next sequel. I always imagined the storyline for the Alien franchise would have the creatures slowly getting toward Earth. Once that happens, then quoting Ripley in 'Aliens' - 'You can kiss all this goodbye'. Perhaps the next sequel the aliens infect a space station orbiting Earth, with the last moments of the film revealing the creature has finally found it's way to the Mother planet. In fact, about 30 years later, a film called 'Life' does a good job of following that storyline.But back in the 1980s, it was decided to not even try to follow the storyline where 'Aliens' left off. With scary scenes happening one after the other, the audience by the end of 'Aliens' felt exhausted but relieved that the protagonists were safely on their way home. We the audience invested our time and emotions into the survival of Ripley, Newt, and Hicks. For Alien 3, all that investment is thrown away. For this sequel, the filmmakers were searching for something unconventional in location, culture, and atmosphere, a prison planet was chosen. Rewrites undoubtedly were needed to justify having only 25 men residing on a entire planet that is a prison. Perhaps one version of the script had the planet as the home of a monastery, populated by monks all with shaved heads. Perhaps an idea was that some heavy industry was going on, to justify the large factory sets.Eventually what was decided to go on the screen pleased no one. Not the director, not the film company, and certainly not audiences. One could see the potential for another good scary alien movie, but instead see it become a jumbled mess. When I saw the movie the week it opened in the theater, I was keeping my hopes up despite the dismal reviews. But it was the trashing of the ending of 'Aliens' that immediately turned me off with this film. Ripley is the sole survivor now, and the alien has gotten loose on the prison planet. The film looks unique with the industrial sets and gothic lighting. The supporting cast is a little too much, with many of the inmates showing their crazy side, as is required if your are criminal. The alien for the first time can be seen in other forms other than the humanoid version seen in the first two films. Ripley is no fun to watch here after her character survives one hell in the last film, only to land in another hell in this one. An extended autopsy scene of Newt left me further depressed. Gore effects look fine. I wouldn't I say I felt scared all that much. One unique aspect to this story is that when it is discovered the alien is killing the crew, it isn't all about evacuating. Instead we get the bad guy from corporate to the save the day. This was an auspicious debut on the big screen for director David Fincher. He bathes everything in a greenish hue, something he still does for his later films.After giving the special edition a try many years later, there still is just no momentum to the plot. I still only consider the first two Alien films as 'authentic', and the other attempts (not counting the new prequels) as Fox trying to cash in on a franchise.",5,1,3,31 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Norton has difficulty emoting in cartoon movie.
","This movie feels more like a reboot, such as 'Batman Begins', but it is missing the 'Alfred', or Morgan Freeman's character, an ally. Here Bruce Banner is alone, with virtually no one to reveal his inner psyche to (at least for the first half of the movie). Poor William Hurt can't seem to find the soul of his character, and doesn't make a great villain either. I understand that 70 minutes of the film was removed, and I can only assume that the soul of these characters were lost in the editing room. As for the monster itself, that never felt like Bruce Banner. During the opening credits, we see the whole lab episode to show how Banner became Hulk. A great innovation during this sequence was 'Hulk Vision', and eery POV shot that gave you an idea how it felt to be the Hulk. Sadly, this vehicle is never used again in the movie. There might need to be a change in the Hulk universe, where perhaps Hulk can speak a bit more, which works well when Tim Roth undergoes his transformation. Frankly, it's still too unbelievable that a man turns big and green, and back again when working it as a feature film. It still feels cartoonish.So a delicate balance is needed, between the accepted reality these characters live in this movie, and the bizarre creatures that require a leap of imagination. Ed Norton, an Oscar calibre actor, invested a lot into internalising this character, so he is understandably upset that nuances were removed. As for the action set pieces, they are fun to watch, and the cinematography surpasses almost any other comic book movie, even better than '300'. What the studios wanted with this reboot is not a lot of luggage, not another Ang Lee, and for that they get my approval (you can read about my ongoing rant about 2+ hour movies in my other reviews). I would have settled for perhaps 10 more minutes of Bruce's psyche, what helped make 'Batman Begins' so good.The problem with William Hurt; perhaps it was the moustache, or his non-military sounding voice, or the ambivalence of being both the bad guy and the father of the Bruce's romantic interest. He did not possess the tenacity to be feared and despised. Sam Elliot fit the bill very well in the last movie (and the moustache was even real). Tim Roth ends up being the only interesting character of the bunch, and his screen time is limited. This is a muddled effort to reboot the franchise, but I am happy that Ang Lee's disaster has been overlooked. I'm confident that a sequel will be made, and perhaps Ed Norton can show more psyche, and maybe someone more fierce can replace William Hurt (perhaps a friend of Tony Stark).",6,3,7,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," MI3 seen on Digital Projection  Movie: Good, Image: Bad
","Having read all the re-tooling that went into this franchise, the outcome could not have been more perfect, too bad the digital projection screening I saw diminished it. The digital showing times were listed separately (Kerasotes  Coon Rapids MN). Intrigued, I checked it out. The intensity and tight direction make it the best film of the three. The most welcome aspect is that this film isn't all about Tom Tom Tom. There finally is an ensemble that resembles the original TV show that help to perpetrate the missions. Although still not based in the real world, you at least feel more tension and suspense and could go 'sure, they might be able to do that'. Except, that is, until the final reel. Then it's back to over-the-top action. But by then, you're hooked. The previews definitely did not do this film justice and could help explain the lackluster box office (Katie, Scientology, and Couches aside, Cruise does a great job being the hyper-hero). The digital projection was DLP, and it looked and felt like I was watching a big screen TV. Here were the problems.1.The light guns were not properly aligned. This was obvious when there was white text on the screen. The top of the letters had a red outline, and the bottom of letters had a blue outline. 2.Gradation of dark areas of the screen were very shallow. Example, the dark hair of Tom had no detail, no subtle highlights reflecting from nearby light sources. The hair was just a black blob with no definition. I went to a second showing of the film presented in traditional 35mm. The film image of the same shot of Tom's hair had much more detail and definition.3.Colours were not true. The lips on actors were a purple-ish pink instead of pink-ish red. As for resolution, the digital image seemed about the same, but the projected image from video looks obviously different than film.If a local theatre advertises that a film is being shown as digital projection, avoid it if at all possible. Video projection in theatres should be welcomed to screen features that were shot on video. This opens up the field to 1000s of more lower budget independent films that can be as good or better than Hollywood flicks. But if it's film, see the film.Movie: 7 out of 10. Digital image: 4 out of 10",7,0,0,11 May 2006
Captain Phillips," Ugh! Great Film but Two Hour Rule!
","I don't really care what kind of justification a director gives to clock a singular subject of a movie such as this over two hours. In fact, this is the first film Greengrass has released over that magic threshold. Why do I make such a big stink about this? Because we the audience have a natural clock, there is a limit to our patience when telling a story. Here Capt. Phillips goes 10 minutes over, and it is very easy to see where those trims could be made. Especially in the third act. Again, I don't care if it accurately, minute by minute, recounts what happened. Time condensation is still being done, and although I never read the source material, I would seriously believe some events and time were condensed for the sake of pacing. On the positive side, I would give serious consideration for an Academy Award for Editing. The tension feels real throughout. You have to give credit, between the shaky cam documentary feel to the sharp cutting, that the pacing never lets up. It is just there are obvious points of repetition, especially when the cast is confined to the claustrophobic lifeboat capsule. The many hours actually spent in the craft is more than abundantly portrayed with the redundant arguments and monotonous shots of Tom Hanks just sitting there.The story up to that point is well presented with little chaff. Hanks has the problem of selling his character to an audience that may remember him as Captain Miller from 'Saving Private Ryan'. In other words, how well can we buy that this guy doesn't have any military experience, no combat time? There is not much Hanks can do other than to wear those more frightened emotions in situations of confrontation and not let his legacy strain credibility.Minor Spoiler ahead.In fact, it takes other members of the crew to grab one of the bad guys and show the toughness that one might expect out of our lead.Minor Spoiler finished.By the time he is the lone hostage away from the crew in the lifeboat capsule, the screenplay has done a good job at showing the true heroism of the captain, who is trying to keep the crew out of harm's way by sacrificing his own safety. With so much riding on Hanks and how much he can disappear into the character, the movie's success and award nominations speak for themselves. Some controversy has arisen over whether Hanks should have been nominated for an Academy Award. The problem comes from the fact that the filmmakers chose to portray the actions of Captain Phillips with a great deal of accuracy, meaning it doesn't include any breakout performance.Minor spoiler aheadHowever, the end scene after Hanks is rescued is a very human moment that connects very well as he tries to overcome the shock.Minor Spoiler finished.Greengrass as a filmmaker continues to impress with the energy and realism he injects. It is with reluctancy that I no longer will see one of his films in the theatre because of my problems watching his shaky camera style. But I will still watch them eagerly on DVD. I actually think this style of cinematography is appropriate for this recreation of real events. But I challenge Greengrass to take on a subject where maybe just once he sees what happens when he puts the camera on a tripod.",6,0,1,12 February 2014
Skyfall," A Good Blend of Bond, Bourne, & Batman
","This film looks like it took four years to make. Give the franchise a rest and let the story brew for a while, and in this case add some depth, and you've rebooted the franchise successfully. There was a hint of what the future of Bond would be like with the Daniel Craig incarnation. My original impression of Craig in 'Casino Rolyale' was that he came off more like a goon, a lowbrow hit-man, than a suave jet-setting playboy. More intellectual in discourse, more real world consequences. There were missteps in what new Bond would be like in tone. How much 'Bourne', which is shaky cam chase scenes in exotic cities, and how much tradition, which is the 'shaken not stirred' kabuki. In 'Casino Royale' a distinction had to be made. Either Bond was a wise-cracking super spy, or a malleable thoughtful government agent who can't just act like a machine. Perhaps they tried to be both, but found the gravitas too heavy (CR - the bond girl is crying in the shower, Skyfall - the bond girl is an exotic dancer in the shower.) On the other hand, if the bad guy is too over-the-top, you get into goofy territory. So it took a couple tries, but this well contemplated new approach finds Bond as a damaged human being, while capable of putting on the superhero cape. This is 'Batman Begins' for the Bond franchise. Complete with dark and moody sets and lighting. MI6, for example, is now headquartered in it's own bat cave. Bond has a chance to revisit his childhood, his own tragic backstory of losing his parents as a child and left with a big mansion, such as Batman.All this serious 'Bourne meets Dark Knight' is a good way to mix up the now cliché scenes that are supposed to be obligatory, but in the 50th year, certainly needs a change of guard.So spoilers coming up.M is replaced, Q is now a well cast younger man who is a hacker, and a new Moneypenny....Spoilers finished.This re-energising the franchise helps Craig the most, where he is allowed to go unshaven, and be more like a real guy instead of a superhuman (at least for a little while). The bad guy this time is probably one of the best in the franchise, again because there is depth to his character. His reasons for causing mayhem are well grounded, and Javier Bardem injects some of the most disturbing quirks. The action is a little light this time around, but the motivation behind the action scenes are setup and executed very well. The 'Bourne' style sequences are far better than 'Bourne Legacy', and are easy to follow. It is Bond's childhood home that we spend a good deal of time in the third act, learning about many things, and meet Albert Finney's character. The inevitable showdown gets drawn out, clocking in at 2 hours and 23 minutes, and isn't quite as spectacular as the filmmakers think it is. They still seem obligated to fulfill one of the trademark clichés (blowing things up real good). The music I found to be mostly as punchy as the 'Bourne' soundtracks, hitting the right spots when necessary. As observed by other critics, there is a great uptick in the cinematography, as this is one of the best looking Bond films in memory. The direction is also crisp, making it easy for Stuart Baird to piece together a slick paced thriller.I declare the re-imagining to be a success, and the movie acts very well as an origin reboot film, and successfully blending Bond, Bourne, and Batman.",7,2,9,15 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Dumb Michael Bay Moments Undermine Gravitas
","One thing the original Ironman established before anything was gravitas, putting our characters in a real world situation. With the attack on a convoy in Afghanistan, Tony Stark was fallible and susceptible to the lethal weapons like everyone else. Proving resourceful, he creates machines from odd parts while imprisoned. For the 3rd outing, there is some of this return to gravitas as Stark is stranded without his suit in the 2nd act. However, now with every other superhero franchise jumping in on the act, it feels like a lot of repetition. You get the the same back-to-basics like 'Skyfall'. You get the same setup of 'you can only save your girlfriend or the Mayor/President not both' like 'The Dark Knight'.What won the audience over was Robert Downey Jr.'s smart aleck approach to Tony Stark, which is befitting of him. I guess it made sense on paper to bring in the king of wisecracks Shane Black, but there were moments of serious peril or sadness that were undermined by an inappropriate joke. This movie suffers from a Jekyll/Hyde almost as if directed by two different people. Particularly the story as a whole, matched with well choreographed action scenes, deliver a larger than life spectacle we've come to expect from summer blockbusters. But then there are those dumb moments where anybody who has sat through a Michael Bay film will recognise. The characters will stop the momentum of the movie to stand around and do very bad banter. Particularly grating are scenes between Stark and a Kid who can't stop nagging him. Happy the driver (now security guard) suffers from the same rubbery mouth. Nothing is accomplished while he repeats something stupid, because, you know, repeating something stupid makes it funny.'Show your badge' 'Where's my Tuna Sandwich' 'Iron Patriot sounds cool'. Black does a great job setting up a situation where you feel Stark's vulnerability without his suit, but then destroys it with a bad one-liner that takes you out of the moment. Worse, the attempt at throwing as many yuck yuck lines out there as possible diminishes the moments when a good zinger can have a stronger effect. Ultimately, you would rather have those zingers in there, and celebrate the gems while trying to ignore the groaners. But then comes a serious mistake:Spoilers Ahead The sobering and violent setup of the Mandarin villain, killing and maiming people with terrorist acts, is then played for yucks as a plot twist. I think it is in poor taste. Reflecting on the serious tone of the deaths and suffering by hamming it up as a drunken English bloke channeling 'Arthur' is almost an insult to the audience. We've invested our emotions into these scenes, and now are asked to lighten the mood as we confront the bad guy - it doesn't work.Spoilers Finished Downey made Stark witty but also smart. It certainly takes a talented hand to keep that balance, and I frankly had little trust in Shane Black in handling it correctly. I mean, the guy wrote 'The Last Boy Scout'. He even became a parody of himself with 'Last Action Hero'. In the end, I applaud the character arcs that carried our main characters through the trilogy, so ultimately I forgive the pettiness of the humour. It's hard to keep things new and interesting in this day and age, and the clever variations on the GPS guided flying suit parts are utilised to great entertainment value. I enjoyed Gwyeneth Paltrow's growth as a character, and Guy Pearce was capable of being creepy. I feel the success of this sequel relies mostly with Downey Jr., he is allowed to deliver too many wisecracks, but can get away with it after carefully honing his character's personality throughout the years.",6,0,1,9 October 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Bluster Action Film of Personal Tragedy
","Peter Berg of 'Battleship' fame tries to get personal by focusing more on crewmember Mark Wahlberg, and his wife, than on the bigger picture that was the Deepwater disaster. I half expected Wahlberg to shift into his eastern accent from 'The Perfect Storm'. Of course, Wahlberg's character is everybody's buddy on the ship ('say hello to your Ma for me'). We spend 20 minutes with Wahlberg and his wife for the big goodbye scene before he heads off to the oil rig. Although he is only off the coast, not on the other side of the world, and is constantly live streaming his wife. Berg only slightly gets a pedestrian feel here, certainly better than director Michael Bay did with Wahlberg in Transformers 4 (2 hours and 45 minutes of my life I will never get back). The photography is straight action material (compare to the documentary feel with 'Captain Phillips'). Unfortunately, so is the dialogue. Much of it sounds like the corny dialogue from a dumb action movie.Leave it to John Malkovich to personify a character better than anyone else. He was genuinely creepy as a mid-level corporate shill. Kurt Russell is the responsible member of the crew that stands up to the corporate moneymen. I'm sure most of these characters said similar things in similar situations, but it stills sounds cliché; 'The safety of my crew comes first' (or something like that).If you judge this film as a disaster film, and are ready to be treated to nonstop action and explosions for the entire second half of the movie, you will be well satisfied. The effects work is very well done, and the nonstop explosions create serious tension as the crew tries to first reattain control then try to escape. I mention 'Captain Phillips' in comparison to this movie, because that film also tried to bring to the screen a real life event. But comparing the editing, the choice of music, the casting and acting, and the documentary feel of the cinematography, Deepwater Horizon feels staged in places. Expectations were for this film to attract big action moviegoers, and the first weekend box office showed soft results when I wrote this review. It seems that it is either too soon, too personal, or lifelike to find the 'Diehard' audience. I felt it held well as an action piece with a decent budget, but maybe I should judge it for the Oscar audience, which in that case forget about it.",6,1,3,2 October 2016
Dawn of the Dead," Rent the Original
","I am a fan of the original 'Dawn of the Dead'.  I was in high school at the time and it was the first movie that really scared the bejesus out of me.  The extreme gore, and the heartpounding opening sequence where a group of people escape within inches of their lives.  This movie feels like it would've been better with another rewrite. It's too scattered to feel that sense of danger.  Only the 3 main characters thankfully have a bit of depth.  When the rest of the troop bites it over the the course of the movie,  it's little more than scorekeeping for the audience.  At least the film tried to explore a couple different angles from the first. But it feels like the first film had a bigger budget.  There are stretched out moments with no action, even our friends the zombies don't appear for long periods of time.  I liked some of the morality play,  and Jake Weber does a solid job as the voice of reason. 
I just didn't get the heebie jeebies like I thought I would.  '28 Days Later' got some good attention,  because you could sense the fear.  A tighter script with more action would have drawn you in more.  Nevertheless,  the success of this one will draw out a sequel. Maybe there will be better ideas and a better budget next time.5 out of 10.",5,0,0,26 March 2004
World War Z," If you are Making a Horror Movie, Don't Play it Safe
","When a movie is based on a book, a review can get caught up in comparing the book to the film. In this case, I listened to a good portion of the audio book. I could recognize, as with the majority of books, that it is not appropriate to compare two different forms of entertainment. A book can expand in situations that a movie has no time for. What a good screenplay can do, is flesh out some of the better characters, and inject them into the storyline somehow that works with the overall arc of the movie. This is true as our protagonist meets characters in South Korea and Israel. But the overall arc of the movie was not satisfying. The movie stayed too conventional, setting up the family, and making the film about getting safely back to the family. Important as this is, the detective work in tracing the source of a virus and solving the epidemic should also be given great weight in the story. Such is not the case in this film. It is, however, a successful achievement in how the story allows chaos to help dictate the direction. When things don't go as planned, then you prevent the audience from predicting the outcome, something we are starving for. The final summary of this review is like so many other blockbusters recently. <ul><li>Has the potential for being better, if better care was taken in putting the story together </li></ul><ul><li>The action scenes are great, but that alone does not make for a satisfying movie </li></ul><ul><li>Some plot holes we can live with, but giant plot holes make us feel cheated.</li></ul>The most noticeable problem with this film, one big enough for me to not recommend this film, is the PG-13 instead of R rating for a horror movie. Worse, it seems obvious the movie could have been edited a lot scarier, but pulled it's punches at the moment of the big shock. Playing it too safe at every scary moment goes against the very point of the genre. With the moment of thrill being sanitised, you no longer have any expectation of being subjected to a scary film, and now just sit there as we miss all the good action off camera. Which takes us to the infamous third act. A great deal of publicity has been released about the reshoot of the third act, and the new ending feels tossed together at the last minute. At this point I was yawning and felt no scary thrills from our group of harmless zombies. There was a lot of laughter in the theatre throughout the supposed nail biting climax. And the homogenised storyline all but assured the telegraphed ending. So you have the conventional close to the film, but no. Sequel bait dictates that the story is not over, that all the efforts we have endured could be meaningless. This was an unsatisfying non-closure, and was ready for the credits to roll and head to the exit. I recommend waiting for the DVD, enjoy the action setpieces, and lament at the much scarier film it could have been.",5,19,42,22 June 2013
Passengers," Bland Non-Adventure
","There were numerous viewings of trailers and TV spots for this movie that made itself out as a mystery, what is the cause of a passenger's hibernation to hatch early? Having no trust as what ridiculous Hollywood-style ending would make me groan, I voted down seeing it in the theatre. After seeing the rental DVD, I think the trailers and spots were deceptive as to what the movie was about. However, I may have been just dreaming up my own reaction to some flawed sci-fi films like 'Sunshine', expecting the third act to be some extra-terrestrial mumbo jumbo, or like 'Sunshine' some strange concoction of ghosts and monsters. Well, it is all just a romance flick with two hot Hollywood stars and a decent sized CGI budget. Somewhere a cross between 'Solaris' and 'Wall-E', the first act also has a strange semblance to Jack Nicholson going crazy in 'The Shining', complete with an obliging bartender. Chris Pratt thankfully acts like a normal person who is stranded on this isolated spaceship in the middle of nowhere. The film kept my attention as it dazzled with nice space scenery and cool spaceship design. Once Jennifer Lawrence is brought into the mix, it is a little dull, as we watch them become romantic, in order to fulfill the target genre requirements. But it is all too mechanical, with zero chemistry between them. I was rooting for the talkative bartender to have some evil turn, but alas, he was stuck behind the bar. So no, this is not a thriller. I barely remember after the film was over that Laurence Fishburne makes a brief appearance. One might wonder if he was just a hallucination. There are, thankfully, brief moments of tension. But they are not allowed to become to frightening because, you know, romance. Which is too bad sinceMany spoilers ahead.The ship temporarily loses gravity while Lawrence is in a swimming pool. To her horror, she is unable to gain any traction to escape the large bubble of water and is trapped inside. This could have been a much more heart pounding scene that risked the life of Lawrence, but resolves itself rather tamely. And there is another tense scene.Pratt, trying to go back into hibernation, crawls inside the capsule, which seals him up. He soon realises that it isn't working, but now is trapped inside the capsule. Pratt begins to struggle to escape, with the tough machine staying shut. Pratt starts to struggle to breathe, and, oh he's OK folks. The same goes for the big reveal about the cause of Pratt's hibernation machine malfunctioning. It really is nothing beyond the opening sequence in which the spaceship encounters a large barrage of asteroids, damaging the self- diagnostics.And here again, the idea of a ghost in the machine, the gremlins that turn up with malfunctioning zoombas or whatever. These malfunctions could turn some of the artificial intelligence into rogues and lethal to our unwitting passengers.Ah, so much blockbuster material left off the storyboards because Romance. Except, suitably, when Lawrence finds out she was woken on purpose by Pratt. All romance is now broken off. With only a hint of redemption as Pratt performs a selfless deed. This film showed some mild science fiction elements. But with the potential for some weird space psychosis that could have worked it's way into the characters, instead all malfunctions are mild and infrequent. And Pratt ends up being too inert to create any tearjerker scenes at the end. So no thrills, a few chills, bland romance cut short, and a boring bartender. Thumbs down.",4,0,1,4 May 2017
The Hunger Games," Better than the Trite material deserves.
","Let's admit it, this franchise got the green light based upon the teenage vampire movie craze. It is soooo convenient that the ages of our teenage warriors are exactly the same age range (12-18) as the target demographic for said teenage vampire fans. The setup on paper sounds pretty contrived: a set of males & females from 12 regions must fight to the death. As an older adult, I have skipped all those Twilight films, and never would find myself interested in this film. So why am I recommending it? Because the filmmakers were able make the story transcend the genre. This is not an easy task, and my guess it must have taken many rewrites to find themes and subtlety for a subject matter that belongs as a TV show on the CW network. Let's begin with the actual action scenes where you witness the brutal hunting down and killing of fellow human beings. You won't really find them in this film. In fact, the focus on weapons and people's skill using them is also a very minor feature in this film. Instead, the majority of the journey our protagonists go on is about relationships. Relationships with sister, Mother, boyfriend, state, country, mentors, sponsors, and rulers. We even get to learn about the relationship between the TV show producer and the country's dictator. Then there is the theme about how the oppressed are reduced to TV show idols, and are forced to perform to the whimsy of the viewing masses. The movie 'The Truman Show' went this direction and mostly failed in it's attempt to humanise it. Somehow, 'The Hunger Games' pulls it off. The wealthy class were deliberately cast with people with strange faces, and painted up like clowns to make them more like monsters than human.How does this film create believability? For one, the filmmakers completely immersed themselves in this alter-reality. Nothing is painted in broad strokes. Scenes of a poor community come to life through nice human moments, and keep the momentum going while making the best of exposition. Scenes requiring exposition in movies are very hard to make interesting. Again, credit goes to the screenwriters for approaching exposition in a creative way. Sometimes talking about the effect of an important plot point, leaving audiences briefly curious, then circling back and explaining why that effect happens. And how come this movie is 2 1/2 hours and doesn't contain much action? Because the filmmakers wisely avoided a cliché third act by avoiding predictability and keeping expectations fresh for the audience.My only real complaint is that the film did not need to be 2 1/2 hours, even though I bet many character subplots were cut out of the final version to make this running time. The second act drags somewhat while our competitors go through the rituals leading up to the actual game. This is the period where the players train and are evaluated, but once again little of this is actually shown. Instead we spend even more time on, yes, relationships. One of the greatest achievements in this film is the editing. Through the power of editing, a great deal of story is told in a short period of time. A friendship between two characters is established with some body language, instead of clunky dialogue. The music avoids bombastic action beats and instead evokes a folky 'human' tone, something right in the comfort zone for composer James Newton Howard. The special effects are a minor part of the movie and don't really stand out when briefly seen.",6,8,20,23 March 2012
Argo," True Events provide Thrills but is too Manipulative
","The film starts with the title card 'Based on a True Story'. Yes, you can base a film on a true story and then fictionalize parts of it. But it is another thing to add way too many obvious tension-building fabrications to suggest that their escape was inches away from doom. Aside from these implausibilities within the manipulative plot, this movie jumps with energy by wise dialogue and quick pacing. Many things are done with assured direction that is easy to see why it was nominated for many Academy Awards. There is sharp exchanges between government entities. Using the 'E.R.' template, all these conversations take place in motion while the characters are en route to somebody's office or some other place. This type of staging is effective in propelling this risky drama in the backdrop of the hate-fueled protests in Iran in the late 1970s. I also enjoyed the tension-filled early technology, when a phone was still leashed to a wall inside a room. But these spoilers had me groaningI wonder if the potential hostages had to really parade themselves through a busy marketplace as part of their disguise. I really wish it was true that the CIA pulled the plug by deliberately removing the flight reservations (why??), and leave a CIA operative stuck in Iran empty-handed. I really wish it was true that the housekeeper of the Canadian embassy was interrogated as the Americans were heading to the airport. Or that one of the dozens of students piecing together shredded photos recognised one of the Americans as they were boarding the airplane. Or that police vehicles were chasing down the 747 as it was lifting off. .End SpoilersI really wish it was true that this winner of Best Picture earned it's stripes by the authenticity of this caper, based on a true story. But of course the intricate details of the event will not be available to the public to verify. I think Ben Affleck has a great sense of pace and intelligence, but I was feeling a little too manipulated in order milk the tension to the level of disbelief.",6,5,6,22 March 2013
Public Enemies," Documentary-style audio diminishes storytelling
","Michael Mann deliberately embraced the HD video camera as a way to shoot in a more documentary style, especially at night. He did that with success in 'Collateral' (see my review). He evidently tried to up the realism by not only shooting with inferior video (trails from lights), but also inferior audio. I first thought I was being fooled when I first screened the movie. I thought it might be the theatre's sound system. I went to another screening (video projection) which unquestionably had the intended audio mix. My guess is that Mann wanted to mimic what a location sound mixer (which is one of my professions) would do. In this case, you would hear a line delivered very quietly. Then you hear the volume deliberately turned up much louder, as if the sound mixer was compensating for quiet talking. Along with that, the ambient audio is almost nonexistent in some cases. Once again, mimicking the poor sound you get in a low budget documentary, due to the clip-on microphones attached to the actors having a small pickup range. What he apparently wanted to accomplish was the sense we were watching 'Cops' or something like reality TV. He chose to degrade the quality of the image to cue the audience into believing this was first person footage, like someone in the gang was walking around with a handycam.But it's not a documentary. And the all too perfect production design and all too good-looking cast never take us out of movieland. Then there are the deliberate face close-ups, using the fine grain on the video to emphasise the pores in people's skin. Once again, attempting to feel real, and in this case it does not detract from the story. Seeing the weathered skin on the characters faces helps illustrate the rough texture of their lives. But in pushing the envelope in degrading the video and audio, Mann sacrifices the level of audience involvement, because the trance is broken when they notice something wrong with the audio. Same with the video, when the camera swishes around, creating obvious video trails, you start thinking about the craft instead of the characters. My main complaint is that those who do not recognise the use of bad sound as a directing decision, they will conclude that either the sound mixer did a bad or rush job, or that the theatre itself has a bad sound system.As for the acting and story, Mann put together a detail filled depiction of the 1930's, as seen through the eyes of our main characters. Depp doesn't quite come off as human, only coming close when he admits that he never learned how to dance. His subsequent love interest never has any sparks. There should have been a scene with them being human, such as going bowling or something. Some of the dialogue also feels canned. Even if this is supposed to be a subdued script, the lines delivered sometimes sound cliché. I also applaud directors taking chances, but I think there is a thing as too much, such as too much shakycam (thankfully not in this case). This film has too much of an amateur look and sound for an audience to pay $9 for. I still give this film a thumbs up, especially for the terrific period work and cinematography.",6,0,1,8 July 2009
Finding Nemo," 3D Version Worth Catching
","This review is specifically for the 3D re-release. There are two things that I observed, one was that the strength of story and surprise is about double the effort compared to recent Pixar releases. 'Brave's' story felt relatively simplistic, 'Cars 2' offered no depth. 'Toy Story 3', while having depth, was still basically a rehash of TS2. 'Finding Nemo' exceeds expectations every few minutes. Once the story seems set, a new wrinkle is thrown in. I had not watched the movie in a while, and I forgot how fast-paced and action-packed the story is. There are many more moments of genuine humour compared to recent Pixar releases. Second was the quality of the 3D. Most reviews I heard was that the 3D wasn't all that special. I disagree. There are many moments, albeit brief, where you are tracking along with the fish through an underwaterfall, or animals flying toward the camera, or settings that surround you with 3D depth. The animation is still probably Pixar's best. The vivid recreation of a coral reef is vibrant with colour. The swilling motion of everything from the current, the refraction of the sun through the water, even the aquarium is lovingly depicting with exotic objects. Seeing the film on the big screen also gives you the benefit of feeling the sense of size when a large shark or whale dominates the screen. Now, not surprisingly, Pixar is making 'Finding Nemo 2'. As much as I applaud this film, Pixar has a better chance to impress with something original instead of churning out sequels. Hopefully they will stuff it full of good story and surprise elements for a change.",7,0,1,21 September 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Irwin Allen Revisited
","Irwin Allen was the king of disaster movies.  But they always lacked. `Poseidon Adventure', `Earthquake', and `Towering Inferno' have similar story arcs, with most of the excitement happening in the first half.  The rest of the film trudges along as all the characters have to go through their hang-ups as they try to survive.  Roland Emmerich  does a good job at duplicating this story arc,  but that does not mean it could be better. This film should NOT be compared to ID4,  because that was an enemy that was to be vanquished in the end.  Here,  the enemy is nature.  There's really no way to kill it or stop it from doing what it wants to do.  The scope of this film tries to be global,  but it shows the budget limitations by keeping images of other locations very tight. When Tokyo gets pummeled with hail, we see only a couple of store fronts on a street.  Scotland is represented by a couple lab rooms that could be anywhere.  England's demise is nowhere to be seen on screen,  other than a few CGI helicopters encountering the weather.  My main appeal for this film goes back to the movie `Twister'.  That movie, despite a horrible script,  still provided great thrills and was a big hit. This is the first major movie since then to feature tornado effects.  With the advances in CGI,  I always thought another tornado film (and not a sequel to `Twister')  could be truly scary.  The scenes in this film of tornados in LA are by far the best.  It's also pretty quick.  Nevertheless, the images are photo-real.  Emmerich does not try to scare us too hard throughout the film.  I felt a chill once in a while,  because Nature is a force that can't be stopped.  The scenes of imminent doom do give you a thrill.  A complaint that I would echo is that New York has been destroyed a few too many times on film. Emmerich has personally demolished that city twice already before this film.  Why not Chicago?  How about Seattle?  It would be nice to see something new.  Massive tidal waves sinking New York? `Deep Impact' already did it.  Then comes the second half of the movie in which New York is buried in snow.  Well,  snow isn't that exciting.  We see no less than three shots of the Statue of Liberty snowbound.  Maybe a cool shot the first time.  The second and third time it's already `been there, done that'.  The last half of the film basically is stuck in the New York library.  The building becomes the `Poseidon' in that respect. 
I will not go much into all the actors and their characters.  They all do a competent job,  and decent humour is tossed in appropriately.  You never become too attached to any of the characters,  and your eyes will roll a few times for lines like the cynical boss telling the lone scientist `You have 48 hours'.  There is no point in finding any logic as to why Dennis Quaid struggles to walk from Washington to New York to rejoin with his son. (Minor Spoiler) The third act of the film has a loose narrative thread,  and it seems that preposterous looking CGI wolves were thrown in as a surprise' element to liven the 3rd act.  It fails.  Indeed,  even with the swelling music and such,  it takes the ending credits to cue the audience that the film is over.  All in all,  I would recommend this film.  I think it could've used a rewrite.  But the all the elements add up enough to make worth the trip.I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,2 June 2004
Spider-Man 3," The difference between a great 2 hour movie and an overlong 2 hour and 20 minute movie:
","1. Absolute nonsense detour of musical numbers. Sam Raimi, if you desire to do musical numbers, go make another movie musical, but please, spare us action movie audiences these groaners. 2. Convoluted Sand Man who was real Uncle's killer, who had to kill Peter's Uncle to save his daughter....whah? The backstory, which is repeated a few times throughout the movie because it just makes no sense at all. What did the Sandman guy have to do with robbing the wrestling club owner? And how does creating general mayhem as Sandman monster help save his daughter? 3. Recycled Green Goblin backstory, with the same rivalry over MJ. Been there, done that. At least two reels worth of this movie was just story on autopilot. What barely saves this film is the the rest of parts that keep you watching. The action sequences, even though they get repetitious as they whirl around in the air, nevertheless are a roller coaster ride on the big screen. As usual, Raimi injects the right amount of small film humour to keep the characters somewhat grounded. The action set pieces have a few new things to offer, but even so seem routine these days (watch how disinterested bystanders are during some chase scenes). If a couple subplots were removed, this movie could have been as good as #2. There are enough elements, such as the Photographer/Venom character, that breath some life into this sequel. I found the look of the film to be on par with previous efforts, with a suitable score bringing us through the highs and lows. I was warned by the reviews that there is a little too much tearjerking going on in this movie, and it's true that when you hit those emotional beats too many times, they lose impact. One thing that does not make sense is the ridiculous price tag of $250 - 300 million to make this film. An open checkbook causes excess. Raimi comes from the B-movie horror genre that has creative ways to make less look like more. That creative economy also helped to make tight scripts and fun movies, not just showpieces. I wouldn't say this movie fails in this respect, but it has fallen symptom the the 3rd sequel curse; been there done that forces over the top. But then it feels like jumping the shark, and turns either into a farce or dull tedium.",6,5,10,7 May 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Spy Thriller 'Jazz'
","Jazz music comes from musicians 'playing around the notes'. In other words, instead of playing the root notes on the downbeat, they deliberately omit the obvious melody, and fill in the spaces with embellishments that suggest the primary structure. For the educated ear, the way the musician artfully colours between the lines is the source of entertainment. As a moviegoer, I don't mind being presented a puzzle, where you have to think a bit at how the movie is playing around the more conventional spy thriller notes. Strangely, this well heeled story may have become more of a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces missing purely because of the running time. Reportedly the running time was much longer in the original cut, so these holes in the story may have been cut out of necessity.I am writing this review after watching it a second time, and can say that all the motives and activities are accounted for. I have to commend screenwriters as well as the editor for patching together a complex but intricately told tale. Part of the fun is being aware of the ride you are being taken on. For instance, George Smiley, our main character, is seen a great deal of time without every actually speaking. And when he does speak, it is very calculated, since he doesn't know quite who to trust. There is a subtext about secret sexual relationships, where Smiley's wife appears in a couple scenes but you never see her face. The main group of suspects are a who's who of familiar faces from some of the best films in the last decade. The supporting cast delivers poignant exposition and avoids stereotype dialogue. I could easily see how someone may not like the longer gaps in explanation as to why a certain character appears to be dead and suddenly is alive in an unexpected way. But a similar type of mystery surrounds each of the main characters, and is eventually played out as part of the larger payoff, who is the traitor in the British intelligence service? The greatest appreciation one can have is the ability of the filmmakers to tell a story this complex using visual cues as much as possible. Key moments in the story are told with spare conversation, allowing the audience to mentally piece together what is implied. The stone faced hero played by Gary Oldman, is akin the quiet hero, such as the tight lipped vigilante gunslinger, who carefully carries out justice.",7,3,4,5 May 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," A rollicking 3D Adventure that bests Avatar
","A great leap in 3D animation started with Robert Zemekis' 'Polar Express'. Meanwhile, James Cameron was bringing natural camera-work back to animation. All the trials and tribulations to get textures and movement through the last decade or so has culminated in Tintin. Spielberg has nearly reinvented 3D animation by finding camera movements that help energise the movie, not just a gimmick shot. Like Avatar, your eyes are unsure whether you are seeing something as photo-real or pure animation. Textures of the ground, skin, rusty walls, and so on have an incredible detail to them. Spielberg seems especially keen on the use of reflections in glass as part of his new bag of toys. There is nonstop movement from perspectives and transitions that are no different than a painter who makes optical illusions within his work.I say Spielberg, along with Peter Jackson, have reinvented the genre, because the use of editing along with the camera choreography provides the benefits of editing in normal comics, where each panel acts as an edit. Each shot is essentially a work of art. In fact in this genre, it is less effective to try the action scene done all in one shot. It starts to feel too much like a video game. But what about story? George Lucas made similar advances with the new Star Wars Trilogy, but the story dragged. I am not familiar with the books the movie is based on. But you get a great idea of the tone as the young boy and his dog dodge bullets and find themselves in harm's way, albeit knowing that they can outsmart or basically allow the folly of the bad guys to do themselves in. So yes there is story. The adventures have a great deal of flair to them. One particular scene on a ship involves sneaking into the crews' barracks. The entire room is alive as the motion of the waves rocks the boat, causing the bodies and objects to slide back and forth with slapstick pratfalls that resembled an old Looney Tunes cartoon.The extent of the boy's adventures is no doubt geared for young adults, there is no love interest. But it doesn't matter, when the momentum of the story and epic production cast a spell on the audience, you become a kid again yourself. One may actually experience that 'Indiana Jones Magic', where you find yourself grinning as you watch the director spin a narrative that is as fun as a Disneyland ride. Part of that magic comes from the John Williams score (which borrows heavily on Indiana Jones). It ceases to amaze me how the man can still churn out intelligent music for so many decades. I didn't care for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, although I liked some of the over-the-top action sequences that had a cartoon like quality. In Tintin, it IS a cartoon, and the action sequences go even more over-the-top. The only complaint you may find is that there is almost too much action. By the end of the third act, your stomach may start to get queasy as you spin around and around as the action unfolds.I give this a 7 out of 10 only because it is entirely possible that the sequel could be even better than this.",7,0,2,22 December 2011
The Polar Express," 3D Imax version is an incredible experience
","I deliberately avoided the conventional screen version of this film and paid the extra bucks to see it at the Imax in 3D. I'm sure you've read this before, but this is indeed the most fantastic eye-popping 3D movie made to date. Zemekis makes sure every shot has something heading straight for you. But even beyond that, it is almost freaky as you look into a mouth of a character's (very) large close-up on the Imax screen, and you sense the distance from the lips to the throat.Zemekis must've wanted a make a fantasy movie to be remembered, and it is easy understand the huge budget needed to bring it to life. I'm sure no other movie he has made (including 'Roger Rabbit') comes close to the complexity of this project. This film was made for the 3D experience, and it reminds me of the first time I saw 'Wizard of OZ', a spectacle of imagery that I have never seen before.Now, the story and characters are very tame, and there is nothing horrible about their adventures. I was more flipped out looking at these giant 3D heads on the super-size screen. The 'Hero girl' has a weird drawn face that doesn't quite look right. The eyeballs are more human like, which is why they look graphed on to non-human like animated faces. All the story subplots are designed to deluge the audience in further 3D effects. The elves all look like miniature Vladimer Putins, very freaky.As an adult, I would not say this film is enchanting, but I was laughing out loud with glee as I would a ride at Univeral Studios Theme Park. There are too many jaw-dropping images to recount, but it is suffice to say this a breakthrough film on par with 'Final Fantasy'. See this film only in Imax 3D, or you may be disappointed.I give it a 8 out of 10 (for the Imax 3D version only)",8,2,4,7 January 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Clash of Real World vs. Comic Book Action
","I was a fan of the first Captain America primarily because the director chose to evoke the pulp comic version of WWII (like Indiana Jones and the director's own Rocketeer). This film decides to steer into political intrigue territory, a genre I happen to be a fan of. To make that evident, Robert Redford is cast to represent the political characters he played in the past (3 Days of the Condor, All The President's Men, The Candidate, and later in Spy Game). The action centres in Washington D.C., with S.H.I.E.L.D. turning into just another bureaucracy.Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers, a man who seems lost in time and place. He is a superhero, but can't settle in an era that he didn't grow up in. The hole in our main character becomes a problem in the screenplay. At one point he is asked what he makes him happy, the answer is 'I don't know'. If the audience can't a get a sympathetic grip on this somewhat two dimensional character, will we care if he gets in harm's way? The main problem lies in how Captain America is so broadly drawn. Like Klark Kent, he has an unobscured view of right and wrong, and the only motivation needed is what is good for our country. So it is necessary to depend on the supporting characters to fill that hole. One could fault the actor Chris Evans, who unfortunately did not help his career being in the mid-2000s Fantastic Four. In that short lived franchise, he played an annoying show-off, again somewhat two dimensional. Does that mean Evans lacks depth in his acting? Since I liked that boy scout mentality in the first Captain America, I find it appropriate he retains that naivety as he tries to discover who is corrupting SHIELD's intentions. Scarlett Johanssan is the female lead, providing the kind of sexy and tough role that Angelina Jolie used to dominate. She has become well established as Black Widow, and doesn't need much character exposition. She is given plenty of opportunities to fight bad guys. Samuel Jackson has the most to gain from any of his appearances in previous Marvel films. His background gets a boost by making him a protégé of Robert Redford, and anchoring the character of Nick Fury in a more gritty real world situation compared to a more fictional comic book history.The balance between action and tension building drama can seem a little talky, especially as the true villain is explained in the third act. This can be a welcoming moment of character development, especially if Steve Rogers can find happiness. But his relationship status still remains unresolved (as plot bait for subsequent sequels). I found that the big twist about the main villain to be a little lame, but my understanding is that the comic book universe prescribes it. I thought it helped to bring back some of the more appealing elements from the first film, so it has good potential.I am still a fan of Captain America as much as perhaps Ironman. His bright-eyed view of justice is appealing and does a lot of inventive moves with his shield that he carries as a projectile, amongst other things. All the action scenes are up to snuff in high caliber destruction and high volume firepower. I was less intrigued by the bureaucracy, but the screenplay smartly injects action just when the dialogue needs a spark (at one point borrowing from 'Mission:Impossible'). Once I returned to the theatre to watch it a second time, the comic book elements seem to clash with a real world approach. The character of Falcon, for instance, has a backstory from Afghanistan, and attends PTSD meetings. But it is hard to keep that kind of grip on real world when in the next scene we are back to the James Bond gadgets and superhero flying vehicles. Trying to please both worlds and kind of getting away with it is better than not trying to build intrigue and leaving us with empty characters destroying lots of stuff.Compared to the similar price tag given to the most recent Marvel release, Thor 2, the film feels big and sure of itself, keeping the momentum going after the big-bang explosion of the Avengers. I still prefer the first film for it's style and nostalgia, but the Russo brothers find their own tone and keep the momentum chugging along past the two hour mark. There is a big story to tell, and I didn't feel like there was any wasted screen time. I guess the best compliment to how well this Marvel machine is humming is the sense of excitement of what the next installment will provide.",6,0,2,11 April 2014
Life of Pi," A Fantasy the may become a Classic
","The word was this book was unfilmable. After finally watching this movie, having not read the book, I can certainly see why. Most of the cast members are animals, who must look and for the most part act like animals. Although you can train some animals, to get them to act on cue is not easy. While watching this movie the pacing was impeccable, meaning the actions of the animals were not reasonable for actual live animals. There are scenes where a human and 2 animals are interacting on a boat. There is no hesitation, the animals appear to hit their marks perfectly, and the three characters create drama nonetheless.To accomplish this feat, you cannot possibly work with live animals. That meant the animals I was watching on the screen I know were CGI. But save for a couple places, perhaps mostly with the hyena, the effects were undetectable. I have never seen any existing animals (dinosaurs and fictional Avatar beasts not included) rendered by CGI that looked real. I think of the digital wolves in 'The Day After Tomorrow', or the beings in 'I am Legend'. Then I realised that Ang Lee went through great efforts many years ago for 'Hulk' to get more natural movements from the CGI models. Even though that film was a flop, his expertise in working with these effects benefited the making of 'Life of Pi'. With so much at stake at these effects being believable, I am utterly amazed that this film was greenlit. It is such an achievement, there is no doubt that it deserved Academy Awards for effects, cinematography, and direction. The look throughout the film (except for a couple shots near the end) when the tale is being told, has a vivid other-world look to it. Most notable are the effects with water. Although the splashes and waves come off as real (which is probably one of the most difficult effects to produce), the photogenic quality of animals water was surreal in the clarity. And the variety of animals - whales, sharks, flying fish, along with the magnificent looking tiger, were impressive.Aside from the technical achievement, the story is a fresh entry in the big budget film world. With no stars, and offbeat story of a boy whose father owns a zoo, plays as a series of anecdotes. Only after we are on a ship with the boy and the animals, does the main story of being stranded on a lifeboat play it's way through. Another aspect to the story, perhaps thought unfilmable for the sake of extended interest, were the many days that pass on the lifeboat adrift at sea.Ang Lee solved this by making the look and feel of every scene seem magical. Such as the boy learning to fish. The camera travels underwater, overhead, and everywhere else. There never is a dull shot. There were some obvious 3D motivated shots, and I believe the film could have benefited from a 3D showing, although I did not see it in the theatre.This is Ang Lee's best film, and I predict that this film will be considered a classic in the years to come.",7,0,1,30 July 2013
Lost in Translation," An American in Japan
","It took me awhile to get around to watching this Academy winning film. It certainly was not because of director Sophia Coppola or lead Bill Murray. But judging from what I had read about the movie, it seemed to be rather depressing, especially so for me. In 1989, I went to visit my girlfriend in Japan for three weeks. Americans there are gaijin, foreigners. Non- Asian foreigners stick out especially because you are tall and white, and have hair other colours than dark brown. A Japanese child will stop and point at you like you are a clown. If you walk into a shop, everyone will look at you. In this movie, being a symbol of the West as seen in movies and on television works to your advantage. Big celebrities, who don't want to appear selling out in the U.S.A., will appear in liquor ads and other products in Japan for millions of dollars. When I was there, I saw billboards and ads with Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke. Bill Murray plays an action movie star, but really plays himself to a degree. He doesn't speak Japanese, and has a hard time coping with Japanese culture. Scarlett Johansson is also stranded in the same hotel, and they strike a platonic relationship. There were moments while watching the film that I could feel exactly what the main characters were feeling. My girlfriend also felt a similar disconnect from the surroundings while she lived there teaching English. The main past-time of singing Karaoke or playing games in noisy arcades was not my idea of fun. We spent a good deal of time watching movies instead. Of course, Japan wasn't always depressing, and my heart jumped during the scenes when Johansson visited Kyoto. Kyoto is mythical in it's beauty, and it was the most memorable part of my visit. In a way, I connected with both of these characters, because I was visiting while my girlfriend was working, but I also was the Lost American, trying to make nice with the natives. It was a sad time for me, I ended feeling like I couldn't wait for the 3 weeks to end and go home. I stayed the 3 weeks but we broke up the day before I left. **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** In the final scene, there is some speculation about what Murray says to Johansson as they hug. I easily could tell, just by the tone of his voice. I believe he gave her the assurance that when she came back to the U.S. that they would get together again. That quiet and simple enough of a statement would elicit the smile and the comfort on her face. But it also allowed her to be comfortable with him leaving at the same time. **END SPOILER ALERT**Sophia Coppola wrote this story based on her own time in Japan while she was with music director Spike Jonze. She does a great job showing a rarely seen aspect about being a Gaijin in Japan. Murray gives us enough deadpan humour to offset the twilight zone time they spend acting like goldfish stuck in a fishbowl. For me, this movie translates well the feeling of being a foreigner.",6,1,4,14 May 2007
Doctor Strange," Playing it too Safe
","When I started to hear about the type of world this movie was exploring many months ago, I became more excited to see this movie than probably any other movie released this year. I am very interested in quantum physics and the whole idea of multiple universes, and the idea of being able to travel and manipulate other dimensions I thought was the basis for an exciting movie. Then came the reviews talking about how 'heady' it was, working at a higher level than your normal super hero movie. Along with that you have Benedict Cumberbatch, which not only sounds like an exquisite English breakfast, but is a very enigmatic actor who has made his mark in a very electrifying way. To top it all off, there was the promise of mindbending special effects that reminded you of Inception or Interstellar. So it is funny that all these elements on their own seem to be the right combination for a real audience favourite. So why do I feel rather indifferent? Here are some possibilities: <ul><li>Benedict Cumberbatch needs his English accent as part of his prowess, the lame American accent diminished his character. In general, he was too 'safe' as a personality to be engaging enough. It is inevitable that all Marvel films be compared to the first Ironman. Robert Downey Jr. was allowed to personify his character and was very engaging. </li></ul><ul><li>The action scenes seem to come out of nowhere. The designated bad guy along with his evil plan are established right off the bat, so it is just by the screenwriters choice when to break away from a mentoring scene to start the 4D fight scenes. Then back to the mentoring. </li></ul><ul><li>One thing that we all remember is the bombastic 'BBBBBBAAAAAAAA' score from Inception. It has been noted that all Marvel movies have generic scores. My feeling that it is part of a greater sympton of the studio playing it safe when it comes to these things. </li></ul><ul><li>The story structure, spelling out the origin story, has the same familiar beats. Again I think of Ironman, where both have a jarring incident in a vehicle to kick off their road to recovery. Going through origin stories have become tedious. I was hoping that with the more intellectual material there would also be a more intellectual approach to the filmmaking. My guess is that the studio wanted to play if safe with this material to make sure younger crowds wouldn't get lost. Yet I remember learning about the 'force' in Star Wars slowly without needing a great deal of exposition. Better yet, the capabilities of this power was revealed through major story points throughout the film. </li></ul>-Again, the special powers are introduced without any great mystical approach. The world beyond our dimensions can be strange and frightening, but this movie does it in a conventional way that is not that intriguing. Appropriate comparisons to the 'Matrix' shows how revealing these strange powers can be done in an original and exciting way. What makes this film worthwhile? <ul><li>Terrific effects featuring the expansion of the folding skylines first seen in Inception. The best sequence in the film. </li></ul><ul><li>Other fun sequences that make use of the other multidimensional universe. </li></ul><ul><li>Great mentor character played by Tilda Swinton, I only wish the rest of the characters were written as well. </li></ul><ul><li>The trademark self-mockery that allows the audience to buy into the goofy comic book world. </li></ul><ul><li>Nice tight pacing that kept the film moving along and not exceeding the 2 hour mark. </li></ul>It is hard to fault any one department for the absence of real spark to this film. I would say it was the studio playing it too safe with the material as the main fault. But it is also that we have seen too many origin movies to be that absorbed by them. I think the bad guy proved to be menacing enough, but could have been far more intriguing and cerebral in his personality. (Too 'by the book' haha). But something as fundamental as a more striking musical score could have done wonders. I will recommend this movie, not being familiar with the comics, because there are enough engaging moments to keep you entertained. It is the potential that is lost in the business-like approach to making yet another superhero movie.",6,5,11,5 November 2016
Interstellar," Downbeat Predicaments Drag this Overly-Complicated Epic
","This film is has so many subplots it should have been a mini-series. Over-reaching in ambition, there are too many complications dropped in to allow you to settle down and just enjoy the wonder of space. With so many elements to this extravaganza, there are 3 hours worth of story to trudge through. I go on and on about the 2 hour rule, the amount of time an audience is willing to sit before they get fidgety. But certainly I think a movie can go into overtime if it justifies it. Interstellar does not. What started losing me was the numerous themes the film was trying to juggle, and kept throwing at us to provide momentum through the long long running time.What would have justified the running time were longer moments of enjoying the ride. Less moments of just how depressed everyone is. Giving characters something to live for is necessary, but the sentimentality goes too far when we need a spark in the screenplay instead. This includes a downbeat revelation about the main storyline that cheats not only the main characters, but the audience as well, who both have invested a great deal of time this far into the story. Nolan decides to delve into psychology and about why people lie. That is one of the many themes that should have stayed out of this screenplay.With some dumb moments where odd things happen in the first act, you immediately go 'well OK, that doesn't make sense now, but obviously it will be about something in the third act'. But when they do return, it doesn't resonate like the screenplay wants to. Worse, the final resolution comes through such an absolute ridiculous metaphysical macguffin, that it feels glossed over because of the implausibility. Ands that's in a film that acknowledges a lot of 'hey this is science fiction' type of implausibilities.As a big event film, it certainly delivers. The trip through the wormhole is thrilling. Moments of danger in the cockpit are well executed. Matthew McConaughey has plenty of personality to carry a film of this size. But he gets dragged down by his resentful daughter. The entire film has too much sad and angry moments. McConaughey is only in his element when he displays his heroism, something sadly lacking in a film about mankind's survival.",6,0,4,29 November 2014
Pacific Rim," For Kids?
","Yikes, I was being given many assurances that this film was the Bees Knees. It was the great new franchise that would have everybody wearing PR t-shirts and buying PR toys. In Asia, probably yes. I really think I gave this film a fair chance at wowing me. And it did for the first 30 minutes or so. The imagery was fantastic, as in Grand Canyon fantastic. Then it was a long, long, touchy feely group exercise with our young cadets. Many people I'm sure will harken back to 1997's Starship Troopers when watching scenes of rivalry between soldiers. All I could think of as these scenes dragged on was how much more edgy director Verhoeven was with similar scenes, and thus far more interesting.Afterwards, I'm surprised how Del Toro, the director of Pan's Labyrinth, does not make a film like this without being edgy? I think it is that element that prevents this film from appealing to adult audiences. Certainly there is 'grit' in the production design. But all the gouges and chipped paint everywhere was actually a bit too distracting as well. For a military operation, they have no regard whatsoever in the upkeep of their facilities and machines. I certainly can give credit to Del Toro for doing a great job on his first big budget summer tentpole.But now I will go on about the obvious decision to mask the quality of the effects by having each and every monster vs robot battle take place at night and in the rain. The reason is the same as 1998's Godzilla. Because to sell the size of these 8 story tall creatures, they had to be able to blend in with their surroundings. Since the effects apparently weren't good enough, they get shrouded in murky rainy scenes. Another major aspect to this robot warrior world is the need for the two drivers to psychically link to each other by experiencing each other's traumatic memories (?!). I know what the intention was, to make this a more Avatar-like world where your 'spirit' world must be linked to your physical world. But really, is driving an oversized tank much harder than say, flying a commercial airliner in the near future?Eventually this kind of story manipulation to get the backstory and weaknesses of each character spelled out failed to get me excited. It started to feel more by-the-numbers screen writing, a complaint I had with Star Trek: Into Darkness. But I was encouraged by the fact that this was not a sequel, and Del Toro is a far more respectable director than Michael Bay. The best feeling I got from this mess was that I would love for Del Toro to direct one of the new Star Wars films. Not that Abrams would do a bad job, but Del Toro brings a dark element (in a disturbed kind of way) to his work. In PR the only hint you get of that is the side character played by Hellboy's Ron Perlman.I hope this plays well with a younger audience, I just had really nothing to attach to with this world. The big robots were OK, but the fight scenes were not satisfying at all. The monsters were too undefined. What's the exact difference between a 4 and a 5 monster? Those kind of details would be interesting to us adults.",5,2,8,16 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars shot on Video  UGGGHHH!!!!
","I don't need to mention what most older fans like me miss about the new installments compared the original.  I suggest you read the comments by sloopydrew,  he spells it out pretty well.Here is my problem,  I was given assurances that the digital video transfer to film would be basically better or the same as film.  That's mostly wrong, my friends.   Here is my critique of what's good and bad about the look of the video:1. The shadows  also known as gray degradation.  Video never can handle the very subtle and small increments of gray that make up shadows as they gradually go from lighter to darker.  The reason film still survives today is because of this shortfall in video.   What you see instead are bigger blotches' of gray that are pixelated (pixels are the units of light that make up a video screen).   This is especially evident in Padme's flat on Coruscant.  It reminds you of a highly compressed DVD image.  Instead of a nice smooth shadow of a dark room,  you see a bunch of squares,  and extra video noise.2. The CGI  The computer animation is definitely hit and miss.  Some things seem plastic looking,  you can tell it's from a computer.  However,  a good deal of it looks just fine,  not any different from how it looks on film. I will look at `Phantom Menace' again to compare,  but it seems to me you could see the blue screen effect,  where it's obvious that people look they are standing in front of a screen.  The character's outlines are fuzzy in places,  like they were airbrushed.  This is especially obvious when Padme or Anakin try to ride an animal.3. Colours  Although not as vivid as the old Technicolour process,  the colours are fine.  But once again no visible improvement over film.4. Resolution  hmmm,  there's some good and bad with that.  It holds up very well on the big screen,  but actually there were times I could see more detail than the production may have counted on.  I could see the make-up on Anakin's face.  What was especially striking was the sweat and tears on people's faces,  they glistened in a way that film does not.   I guess that's good,  but I believe that make-up for movies shot on video will have to evolve in order to get the right look on compared to film.Would this have looked better if seen on a Digital Projection system? Well, at least currently that's beside the point,  since there are only a handful of the systems in existence.  Lucas knew very well that the majority of viewers around the world would be seeing this on film,  and he allowed the quality to suffer in the ways mentioned above.   He can't rightly defend shooting it on video,  with the argument `that's the way it should be seen', because about 95% of the movie going audience probably doesn't really have a choice but to see it on film.Thankfully, Hollywood has not embraced digital video instead of film.  I truly believe, however,  like any new technology,  that the quality will improve and get cheaper.  So I am willing to change my mind,  but not yet.A quickie review of the film (sorry video) itself.  An improvement over Phantom Menace,  this time the camera and the characters move around a bit more.  The film is not terribly fun to watch,  unfortunately,  a good part of the story could've easily been condensed to get this movie to clock in around 2 hours.  The action scenes at the end have a dynamic that has never been scene before,  pushing up the excitement quota up a couple notches. One thing I will say in defense of Lucas,  he made this film strictly for the hardcore fans,  and you have to give him credit for honoring their loyalty.  (The hardcore fans are mostly the ones that are posting the Lucas is God' reviews).   In essence,  he made this film NOT to please everybody, but stuck to his vision.  A pretty gutsy move for a film franchise that has reaped in billions of dollars,  and has as much hype as when man went to the moon.One last comment:  I, an older audience member that was jazzed by the original Star Wars series, seem to have grown past the Star Wars mythology and feel in this day and age more affiliated with 'The Matrix' mythology. I certainly could sense a charge of excitement in the crowd when the trailer for the 2 new installments of 'The Matrix' played in the theatre.I'd give the film a 6 out of 10.I'd give the technical quality a 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,17 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Motion Sickness - Wait for DVD
","I am joining another reviewer here and will only see a Paul Greengrass film on a small screen. I previously complained about the shaky cam in my review of Bourne Supremacy, but could not condemn the film since everything else was done very well. This time, the shaky cam is now doing more to inject tense feelings into what could be a thin story. I sat in the fourth row, and had to frequently look away or down to keep my stomach from fluttering. I eventually had to walk out to relieve the nausea, only returning later by sitting in the very back of the theatre. Greengrass said he wanted to make essentially a smart popcorn film, and he has. He may even have come up with some clever enough scenes to dare and shoot them on a tripod once in a while. I'm afraid what he is really doing is ratcheting up his camera-work (that looks like it was done by a 5 year-old), thinking that it is necessary to outdo the previous film. There is a great deal of evidence why; much time is taken to merely go over old material covered in the first two movies, the new CIA bad guys are like the old CIA bad guys, and NSA surveillance scenes are a dime a dozen nowadays. So it is only Bourne and his lightning fast action scenes that make this film worthwhile. I was thoroughly enjoying the intelligence they put into the set pieces, extending their potential and increasing the adrenaline. Also winning honors is the under-rated Joan Allen. Her intensity energises the screen, and provides a voice for the audience - rooting for her to save Jason and other colleagues from elimination. Greengrass delivers on the popcorn part for sure, but gets an 'F' for over-using an over-rated camera technique. Instead of giving this film a thumbs down, however, I am recommending that you watch it only on a smaller screen.",6,10,30,3 August 2007
Rush," Not the Definitive Racing Movie, But Zips Along.
","I was energised by the reviews for this seemingly out-of-water subject for director Ron Howard. Especially the talk of the technical advancement of small cameras that can give you a microscopic glimpse of the physics at play when racing a formula 1 car. I was almost stunned at how cliché sounding the exposition was in the first act. I thought, OK it starts out by-the-numbers, but it will finish off a winner (can't help with the racing analogies). I was disappointed how little racing footage was shown. I have yet to see a properly made movie about the drama that occurs on the track during a race. I don't know why directors claim that watching racing is boring. We get glimpses of the forces at hand as the camera is jerked around when attached to the car. I suppose ultimately they are afraid to spend the money to make such action scenes.It was made clear in the reviews that this was not a film about racing, but about two prominent characters from the racing world. With the 70s period being depicted, it's almost like 'Forrest Gump' or something as we relive 1976. I was also feeling kind of trapped in the script that insists on keeping the story factual. The movie spends a great deal of time on relationships, and exploring what their relationships are about. But I felt their was too much time in sacrifice for good old racing footage for the touchy feely stuff.If there was any talk of Oscars, the only one I would consider is Daniel Bruhl for lead actor. That is kind of strange that the marketing features Chris Hemsworth, despite the striking persona Niki Lauda displays as a major component to this film. Worth noting is the careful balance of action, tech talk, and marital relations the script adheres to. Such as a major race being shown through the wife watching it on TV.I enjoy racing movies sometimes, but not when it really isn't about racing. This movie spends less than half the time on racing, and the rest doesn't resonate in an award winning way. Despite my cynicism about this imbalance, there were certainly some poignant quotes that made me think. So credit that to the screenplay. As for director Ron Howard, the only sense of his style that helps perhaps is the pacing. He keeps the momentum going, deliberately sacrificing a beat or two that would normally allow a heavy moment to sink in. For this film it works, because it represents how shallow the main characters are. My final verdict is that it is a watchable movie, but still is not the definitive racing movie. I would wait for the DVD",5,8,18,3 October 2013
The Aviator," Could have been better Casting
","One very important factor in doing a biopic on Howard Hughes is the casting of the lead. As I watched this film, I wanted to buy Leo as Hughes, but it felt like Tom Cruise playing Hughes. Leo is definitely a pretty boy, and this is certainly the biggest role of his career. But I felt that perhaps someone else could have played him better. Someone else who could perhaps give you a glimpse inside the madness. Russell Crowe, although not a match physically, had that kind of insight in 'A Beautiful Mind'. Alongside that, as much as Cate Blanchett was serviceable as Kate Hepburn, I could easily imagine Emma Thompson personifying Hepburn much better.I have no other major complaints about a film that took eons to make the big screen. It is certainly to the audience's advantage that a film about Howard Hughes be given the big budget treatment. The test flight scenes, as well as the 'Hell's Angel's' unprecedented aerial scenes are appropriately depicted with top-notch CGI. Perhaps, along with 'Gangs of New York', having DeCaprio attached was the along way it could get made. For Scorcese, this is his best film in years. He is able to delve deeper into a character than your average Hollywood filmmaker. Scorcese does an excellent job depicting Hughes' descent into madness. The extra length of this film dedicates a good deal of time to this sad aspect. You have sympathy as Hughes fights the takeover of TWA, and the upbeat ending is welcome.The production design is perfect, no corners were cut. Camera angles and pacing are engaging. The make-up on DeCaprio is excellent. The use of period film quality is unique, and creates an outstanding sense of 'living history'. This film deserves Oscar nominations for almost every category, except the acting. Once again, there's nothing wrong with DeCaprio & Blanchett, but they are not perfect.I will probably see this film again, only because I can identify with the seemingly overwhelming odds against you when trying to achieve a personal accomplishment. I also identify with being a misfit, but yet being valued by society.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,3,6,5 January 2005
Oblivion," Same problems as the overly complicated 'Prometheus'
","I was ready to look up who wrote the script for this film, because there are the same problems with this film that plagued 'Prometheus'. I don't even know where to begin with what's wrong with this film. Aspects of this science fiction reality aren't explained, or worse, when they are explained, don't make any sense. Both films repeatedly throw a new wrinkle into the story, that you perhaps believe will lead to some big revelation, but only accomplishes creating more unanswered questions. Another similarity to the other film is the production design. The epic landscapes are good looking. Our main characters' home looks a little like the Jetsons' home, with slick looking technology. I spent the drive home from the theatre trying very earnestly to figure out the plot. This is the kind of movie where a plot twist, intended to keep the audience on it's toes, negates the actions made by a major character earlier. To make complaints about the story, one has to talk about spoilers, so be warned...If Jack has memories of Julia being his wife, then why does Victoria kiss him like a spouse during the flashback on the Odyssey? That whole thing of who is the real wife and who is really Jack is kind of explained but is too convoluted by that point to have any real emotional impact or meaning to the audience. What was the whole point of the robot aliens destroying Earth? The only thing I could kind of recall was that maybe those huge water convertors were actually for creating energy for the robot aliens, or something like that. A major question that came to mind was the premise of the underground surviving humans. Morgan Freeman is basically a cameo appearance in this film, the whole underground world of the surviving humans that he leads is given no screen time. On reflection, I think the screenwriter left that area unexplored in order to keep it as a 'mystery' to the audiences. I figured out the supposed aliens were really human within the first 20 minutes, so the potential for more exposition in their lives was lost. Instead long periods of time are spent following Jack going about his chores, along with the visit to his 'special place', a mountain retreat unharmed by the global annihilation. The central explanation of why Jack and Victoria exist and what is found on the mother ship is almost laughable. A non-feeling robot ruler ('Sally') would not go through so much trouble to get rid of the last humans, and worse, have the same friggin' weakness that not only acted as the super-dumb climax to 'Phantom Menace', but copied again more recently in 'Battle: LA'. Ugh! You not only copy a big climax used twice before, but it is a weak idea for a resolution in the first place! Please, a smart robot would make the drones autonomous, and be able to function without the mothership. Frankly, I could go on with spoilers for a few more paragraphs, but it would not help make any more sense out of Oblivion. Too much is tossed into the story without much inspiration behind it. It is only Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise that keeps any energy going. The music suffers some of the similar problems with the director's last film 'Tron: Legacy', there is too much throbbing pop music to the sound at times when simpler more tense underscoring would have helped. It is composed by the band M83 instead of Daft Punk, but you could have fooled me. Mainly, because both bands seemed to be under the director's orders to make it sound like the generic Hans Zimmer busy strings from 'The Dark Knight'.Alas, I must blame this director who has a wonderful vision to his last two films, but lacks any true momentum within the acting, editing, and more importantly pacing. If you are a science fiction buff, I suggest see this film once on the big screen (I took some critics advice and saw it in Imax) to enjoy the nice visuals, but otherwise forget about ever wanting to sit through it again.",5,1,5,19 April 2013
Watchmen," The 'Citizen Kane' of Super Hero movies
","I don't read graphic novels or the like, so my only history with seeing comic book characters are those on the big screen. Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X Men, and so on. Of all the these that I have seen, Watchmen is the 'Citizen Kane' of super hero movies. Honestly, this movie broke barriers the same way Orson Welles did. Seeing super heroes naked, committing crimes, doing the dirty work for the government, rape, and showing very graphic scenes of gore. On the flipside, this very dense movie lacks the momentum expected in these kind of crackerjack movies. But once again, this is not that kind of movie, and deserves to be in a different category than big budget tent pole films. It deserves accolades for being probably the most expensive niche film ever made. Not everybody will get excited over the story of a retired, very mediocre looking guy reacquainting himself with crime fighting. There are long epic passages of storytelling, which I'm sure are gratifying to the fans of the original story. This film is supposed to cause you to think about the complexities about having super abilities and the difficulty of staying true to your morals. If one is prepared to watch this kind of film, especially after more than one viewing, one can truly appreciate what has been achieved here. The downside is, being the first of it's kind, there are probably now going to be other filmmakers who will draw inspiration from this genre busting movie and refine it in films yet to be. Meaning that the new formula will be tinkered with, and no doubt ending up being more popular than this one. The same thing happened with 'Citizen Kane'. Welle's film did not get a warm response upon it's initial release. It was only years later when it got the attention it deserved.This film, the next film by the director of '300', shows a competent hand with a distinct vision. I feel we the audience are not as advanced as he is in presenting us with a new look and feel. There is a state of mind in the film industry that films like 'Watchmen' are not what people want to see. It will take a movie producer with foresight to see that it is ultimately an appropriate new avenue to explore if one wants to present audiences with something new in the now overcrowded comic book movie genre. 'Watchmen' certainly fulfills the eye candy quotient, but it's different pace and sentimentality probably will test the patience of younger audiences. So yes, you might as well make the film for adult audiences and make it R-rated. The amount of positive elements that push the envelope will cause subsequent films to have no choice but acknowledge these new aspects to the super hero genre, and we are all the better for it.'Watchmen' follows a group of people who are troubled human beings first, and super heroes second. The comedian character represents all that is ugly about America, from JFK to Viet Nam. The scientist character similarly represents the abuse of America's military might. No one is truly innocent, and 'Watchmen' first threads then unravels these problematic positions they take when dealing with the real world. I am giving this film a 7 out of 10, but I might find it worth a better rating over time. Right now, the only reason I don't give it a better rating is my own aversion to the dated period details: Nixon, Eighties music, excessive night-time Noir production design, and mostly the lack of momentum that made '300' so exciting to watch.",6,4,8,26 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," A game of 'Hide the Cliche'
","Another entry in the spy fairyland movies,  where the CIA is seen as the Wizard of OZ these days.  I cannot believe there is yet another completely implausible James Bondish feature like this,  where 'Sum of All Fears' bathes the viewer with a little bit more realistic approach to the spy world.  We cannot savour the adrenaline rush of the action - if we don't believe the peril of it's stars.  Damon is just too darn good,  and the rest of the bad guys are just too darn dumb.  The only fresh approach to the formula is the Bladerunner-esque portrayal of the superhumans that are the assassins.  My biggest beef though is the TV ads boasting 'a car chase better than the French Connection' - or something like that.  Much better work was done with the similarly French based 'Ronin',  and Willaim Friedkin already did the driving-against-one-way-traffic stunt in 'To Live and Die in L.A.' way back in 1985.A good job by the director in getting the paranoia under your skin, and a smart job by both Damon and Potente in trying not to fall into the cliche traps too often.I give this a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,16 June 2002
Justice League," Bland Superhero Ensemble Movie is no Avengers
","There is no denying the only reason this film exists is because of the gargantuan amount of money 'The Avengers' raked in. The Avengers stunt was carefully setup and well executed, with a charismatic villain. This new type of group superhero movie has now lost it's excitement quotient. I actually found the extended cut of Batman v. Superman to be an entertaining movie. I found Ben Affleck to be a good balance of smart and tough. He is slightly demoted this time around as we have to be committed to this being an ensemble piece. The introduction of the new characters are the bright spot, as we are introduced to actual new superheroes, instead of a reboot of spiderman, etc. The screen time spent on developing the Cyborg character, for instance, creates some depth and sympathy. Same for the Flash character, who visits his father in prison (obvious plot bait for a future episode). Aquaman is one of those weird superheroes that needs to be setup carefully. It is understandable that Hollywood has never tried to do this type of hero before. The villain, guess what, wants to destroy the world. He is part of the generic side of this story, being able to summon flying robot insect people (or something like that). You might expect that other subplots would arise involving others colluding with the main bad guy. Thankfully, subplots that add extra running time are kept to a minimum. Mainly, because with so many main characters, you have your hands full just keeping them all busy. Pacing is good with this film, trying it's best to get through a heavy emotional beat in a hurry. For me, I think a popcorn film needs no excuse to stay consistent with the number of minutes between action scenes. Joss Whedon found the right formula with 'The Avengers', so you can expect his influence on Justice League to be familiar territory. Gone are the flashback/nightmare scenes that were a curveball from BvS. Wonder Woman is already a familiar character, so it is nice not to feel that she has to regurgitate much of her past. Her action scenes perhaps have a bit more imagination to them since she is still a new character with new superpowers. Jeremy Irons is more light-hearted than Michael Caine's portrayal of Alfred. It is too bad this film felt it had to hold back with the kind of world Zack Snyder had created. It ends up being not very exciting and more of a chore. Certainly the novelty of creating ensemble films are feeling stale. Nevertheless, to get a chance to see more Wonder Woman, and some likable new co-horts, you won't get bored.",6,0,0,8 December 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Delivers the Goods
","I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews for 'Revolutions'.  I thought it was much better than 'Reloaded'.  Why?  First, the pacing was much better.  'Reloaded' got really talky several times in the film. 'Revolutions' keeps it to a minimum, and the action scenes keep coming at a steady pace.  'Reloaded' had two large set pieces with more of the haki saki kung-fu.  While well done,  they were kind of a yawn.  Too many other films have burned us out on that stuff.  'Revolutions' only includes it sparingly, and accentuates the 'Star Wars' super big CGI scenes.  I heard complaints that many of the questions weren't answered.  Nonsense! There are many scenes of full explanation and resolution in 'Revolutions'.  Oracle spills her beans, Neo fulfills his prophecy, Zion's fate is determined, every character pretty much wraps up their story.  Lack of character development is mentioned.  Well, perhaps the commander of the ATU's needed some background on why he screams incessantly while killing off the machine invaders, but it didn't bother me.  All other characters were fleshed out in 'Reloaded'.  Some reviews say that they didn't care what happens to the characters.  I was tense at times, when some of the characters were in peril.  Everybody does something for reasons that are clear.  The climax is fulfilling, and in general lives up to it's promises.  One thing no one argues about, is the fantastic special effects.  They are creepy, huge, and exciting.  I am waiting for it to come out on Imax before I see it again. But see again I most certainly will.  I give a 7 out of 10.",6,0,0,6 November 2003
Man of Steel," Unfair to Compare Superman to Dark Knight
","I read a few reviews before seeing this film (yes FILM not video) and saw that many reviewers were faulting it for being too by-the-numbers. I agree about that for the finale, but in actuality my impression was the opposite. The filmmakers were trying their best NOT to be by-the-numbers. I also felt that by design, the marketing of the film was supposed to make you think of The Dark Knight, with Christopher Nolan attached.I think that is a bit unfair. Yes, Superman should be re-invented and more grounded in the real world. But the movie jumps around too quickly for the kind of resonance we are looking for in our origin story. The biggest problem is that the adult Clark doesn't have time to talk and engage with people to humanise him. Compared to the charismatic and playful version of Clark and Lois played by Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, Henry Cavill and Amy Adams are too withdrawn and unhappy. We the audience need to like this guy. And sure, we all get our hearts tugged with the poignant flashbacks to his childhood with his father. But that was the kid, we need to see some resonance with him as an adult. We only get some of that as Clark returns to his mother.But then there is the pacing. The screenplay tries to have the heartfelt moments but be a popcorn movie too. Literally within the moment of finding some sentimentality BAM! something crashes through the walls. Unfortunately, the frenetic editing pace started to remind me of the worst of Michael Bay. Much has also been made about the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer can have his brief moments of grandeur, but most of soundtrack material sounds generic. He can work up the score to give you all the evocative feelings that are happening in the story, but he can't write a memorable melody.The gritty blue-ish tint to the film works well. It did a good job grounding Metropolis as a regular world. Lois Lane seems to just pop up everywhere in the film. She is used unconvincingly to bring peril or a surprise rescue all too conveniently. Her ease of access and involvement in almost every aspect to this story felt manipulative. In general, you get to understand the style of writing in the screenplay, as it was more necessary to come up with another big action scene that include our main characters than it was too justify it. Again, there is an out right goofy moment where Superman surrenders to General Zod. Out of nowhere, they decide to take Lois Lane as well. Why? Lois is everywhere.This kind of story manipulation to give us more popcorn thrills is to the movie's detriment, however, this is more nitpicking than anything. If we take on this franchise reboot on it's own, without the shadow of The Dark Knight clouding over it's expectations, I say we have a very energetic and successful beginning. All the elements needed to wash the bad taste of Superman Returns out of our mouth have succeeded. Just some minor course corrections are needed. Cavill needs to lighten up a bit and try to have some fun once in a while. Lois should have to try a little harder to get in or out of a predicament. And the producers should have a little more faith in telling a story without resorting to yet another building being demolished.",6,0,2,14 June 2013
Bridge of Spies," A 'Lincoln'-like Examination of an Historical Event
","Although this is an exceptional story that enjoys examining the minutia of the period, the story arc as a whole does not really offer anything new. This leaves the performances as the primary appeal for the film. Tom Hanks has proved himself as the Average Joe of this generation. Then again, I never felt he was really in peril at any point in the film, perhaps because of his role in Captain Phillips or even Saving Private Ryan. In those films he was an Average Joe who nevertheless had the courage to face violence when necessary. One of my favourite films with Tom Hanks starring is Road To Perdition. Because that was also a period piece, sometimes I felt I was watching the mafia character he portrayed. The most standout performance is Mark Rylance playing Abel, the Soviet spy caught in the U.S. He certainly could get an Oscar nod for a supporting actor.The story rolls along well enough, the longer length of the film comes from the fact that two stories are told. First is the capture and conviction of Abel in America. The second story follows the downing of Francis Powers and the setup of the exchange. I think some places to condense the exchange story could have brought the film back closer to a more appropriate two hours. Why? Well, I forgave Spielberg for the longer running time in Lincoln, because that film also had such a large cast to flesh out, and most of those characters were the real attraction in that film. Here, time is spent with Hanks visiting many East German characters that aren't particularly noteworthy, along with a few side trips that ultimately slow the momentum.One thing that has become annoying is the one-note style of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. As usual, every scene has a washed out backlight. Spielberg is known for incorporating longer single-take shots that are well choreographed, traveling along with the momentum of the scene. Oddly, he is too constrained with that style, where I was hoping some dynamic camera-work would provide a unique perspective of some interesting locations. I can't say I totally disagree with that decision, other than when a dynamic shot occurs, such as one showing the sentencing of Francis Powers, it seems it is the only time the films shows any real visual energy. The music hits the right beats, but again, does not try to stand out in any way.I doubt general movie goers will embrace this movie. The subject matter will not really connect with anyone beyond those who enjoy period pieces like this. Hanks' character, unfortunately, has no Oscar moments to emote. The climax of the film also doesn't have any fireworks in the normal sense. I would recommend this film as a chance to get a glimpse of a piece of history you probably never knew before. But I would not really not call it one of the best films of the year, or a highlight of either Spielberg's or Hanks' career.",6,5,10,23 October 2015
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Mindless fun - but disrespects T1 & T2
","It seems that this film is the victim of trying to stuff as many 'what if this happens' into the script to the degree that it is no longer a movie, but a 'puff' piece trying get your attention in any way possible.  It's like all these reality shows trying to one-up each other (Who wants to Marry a Survivor Idol).  Many sequels have turned into disappointing rehashes. Alien 3 destroyed the feeling of having emotionally vanquished the big bad bugs by killing the girl and tossing Ripley back in the fire.  Godfather 3 should never be considered a legitimate successor to GF1 & 2.  When a sequel feels the need to outdo it's predecessor, it begins to lose credibility.  The most obvious problem is that, while the first film creates a successful 'formula', and the second film takes the formula and pushes the envelope, the third film can't do anything without feeling like a repeat. 
Indeed, T3 turns into a comedy, because everything it does as a different take on the formula is a joke.  This is too bad,  since you are dealing with a mass murdering cyborg, nuclear armegeddon,  and main characters fighting within inches of their lives.  One scene, the 'new' John Connor pleads for Arnie to help stop Skynet, Arnie replies with a dumb one liner that takes all the air out of what could have been a tense and gripping moment.  Same thing for any moment where we are supposed to take things seriously.  You can't,  so you don't feel the anxiety when lives are in danger. 
T2 had this tenseness,  you cared about their survival.  In T3, you already know the score.  When Arnie first runs into John,  he is scared and asks 'Are you going to kill me?'.  Of course not, we already know he is the good guy from T2.  And so on.  Just like Alien 3 & 4,  you feel you are in an alternative reality,  it has the same characters, same situations,  but it doesn't ring true.  So we are only left with appreciating the stunts and special effects.  The action sequences are fun, thank God (shame on you, Hulk).  The pacing is very good (to the point that it deliberately leaves out some necessary mechanics of the story).  It clocks in less than 2 hours (something that other blockbuster movies should adhere to).  The third act propels the story very well, although the convenient daughter-of-a-Military-General-who-heads-a-secret-program arrangement reeks of cliche (hmmm...such as 'Hulk'?). 
I'll admit I had fun,  something some movies have forgotten about (Stars Wars 2).  I wish T3 could've taken itself more seriously.  But I agree with many other reviewers on this website that it has desecrated James Cameron's creation, ('No Fate But What We Make' - guess not).  So I guess I like this film,  but it's no T2.  I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,2 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Do you care about a machines feelings?
","Yes, you do.  Star Trek's Data was a successful robot that was human enough in character for viewers to care for it.  It is rare that a movie can get an audience to care about a robot.  I, Robot manages to do so because of the creative license it has taken in animating a plastic face to give it human expressions.  I guess the viewing audience has accepted this concept from the morphing Terminator in T2,  that a robot can assume complete facial features.  But then again I didn't shed a tear when Arnie the terminator was liquidated.  I,Robot is trying to be both a thought provoking science fiction story and a big budget action film at the same time.  When Will Smith does his 'Bad Boys' routine, it is incongruous with the Blade Runner-esque future world that he is surrounded in.  The big dumb action scenes butt up against any attempt to be a stylish suspense film.  Poor old Will keeps getting side-tracked by destroying freeways and buildings. Then there's the slap-in-the-forehead moment when we see Will's boss ask for him to turn in his badge.  My god,  the catering assistant could've pointed out that cliché is as old as fossil fuels.  All credibility is lost when the movie stops to show a Converse Shoes commercial. We pay ever increasing admission fees for these movies,  and more and more are we subjected to the one thing we leave our TV sets at home for - NO COMMERCIALS.  It's bad enough that I walk into the auditorium a few minutes after the posted start time and they are showing regular TV advertisements.  It's disgraceful.So amidst all this commercialism and standard explosions and chases,  we are supposed to care about whether some dude committed suicide or not.  But instead, I ended up caring more for Sonny,  the CGI robot with convincing facial expressions and superblue eyes.  In the end,  I could care less about the several plot twists that didn't make sense, I more enjoyed the screen time of Sonny,  a hybrid Data.

Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now Redux - A piece of History
","I give this version an 8 out of 10,  original version 8 out of 10 also.The redux didn't change my reaction to the film,  which I have seen probably 10 times.  The most significant change is added depth to Martin Sheen's character, Capt. Willard.  He gets to have some fun and shows compassion for his crew.  Most of the additions lighten up parts of the film with humour and transgressions from the main focus of the plot.  The most fascinating aspect of this re-release is the vivid colours and excellent sound.  All previous big screen viewings of this film I have seen in the past have been scratched old prints played in a theatre with inferior sound.  This new print was made with the mostly defunct Technicolor process (now called Technovision).  The yellows and reds jump out with searing intensity, (there are really no blues in the film).  Combined with a booming soundtrack, this is a feast for the senses.    There is additional material where Kilgore's pre-occupation with surfing is accentuated, including a funny gag where Willard steals Col. Kilgore's surfboard.  Later, helicopters are hunting for Willard and crew,  with loudspeakers blaring Kilgore's voice, `Return my surfboard'.   The next major addition is the boat arriving at a decimated post up the river,  where the Playboy girls are stranded.  This gives Coppola a chance to infuse sex into the film,  as part of his plan to include all the required Hollywood Blockbuster elements.   By far the longest and worst addition is the `French plantation' sequence.  It feels like a reel from `Indochine' or something was accidentally thrown into a film.   It consists mainly of a bunch of French guys arguing about some philosophies that you can't understand.  The audience feels like Willard does on-screen;  bewildered, tired, and wishing you could leave.  But no, a French women has been making eyes at Willard,  and drags him into her bedroom.  More gratuitous nudity.  You almost forget what movie you're in, except that you can see the river outside the window.  Oh yeah,  the boat, Col. Kurtz, the mission.   The few additions of Kurtz don't change your opinion of him,  but they don't hurt the film.When this version comes out on DVD,  use the power of the remote to skip the French scenes.  Otherwise,  this epic has grown well,  and the aficionados will have a chance to appreciate the lost scenes, for better or worse.",8,0,0,27 August 2001
Spider-Man," Anyone reading this?
","This movie will probably set a record for the number of reviews posted.  So why waste your time reading mine?Ok,  my review.  I didn't follow Spidey too much when I was young.  I was however,  struck by how the whole story resembled Superman.  I mean, sure, the comic books needed to follow certain staples on super-hero lore,  but come on.  (SPOILERS!!) - Cliff Robertson is a dead ringer for Glenn Ford in Superman,  he even looks like him! - Peter goes to the big city and gets a job on the newspaper- hmmm,  bump into Klark Kent working there?  The editor spits out lines exactly like Jackie Cooper. -Peter gets all bent out of shape when his uncle/dad dies.  Prompting him to use his powers to help the people he's close to. - As much as Peter loves his sweetheart,  he eventually breaks it off to fight crime. - The Bad Guy kidnaps his sweetheart to lure him into a confrontation. - A big flying battle on the streets of Manhattan.Having said that,  I did not have high expectations for yet another comic book hero movie.  I was actually very pleased with the results.  The movie provided a story that didn't try to rush through plot points.  Although it very conveniently puts all the characters in the right place at them right time for the story to go where it does. Such as how the bad guy discovers the identity of Spiderman.  One of the best things about the film is Tobey Maguire.  He is pitch perfect as Peter, and has a good handle on the emotions.  You can feel the anger build in him.  I also applaud the screenplay for trying it's best to avoid the cliches, kudos to David Koepp. Even Sam Raimi, who is great with comic book imagery,  shows more depth than any film he's ever done.  He definitely knocks Tim Burton and his bad Batflicks out of the water.  So I believe I am like the 547th person to post a review.   I hope there is someone reading this.  Most of the other reviews are like carbon copies with the same word,  like 'Awesome'.   My suggestion to you other guys,  if you want to give some helpful advice about the movie you saw,  find some other words to use besides 'good'.  ('The story was good,  the acting was good, the special effects were good,  all in all a good film').  A review like that really has nothing to offer anyone else reading it.  Get in touch with your feelings!  Find something unique to say!  6 out of 10",7,0,0,8 May 2002
Collateral," Wacky story pulled off by talented Mann
","The premise is like 'Phone Booth',  a very unlikely scenario is supposed to be swallowed by the audience without it turning into a farce.  How can a movie convince an audience that a weak-kneed cab driver can become an accomplice for a hit man? Our beloved hit man, Cruise, has a ludicrous assignment of laying to waste so many people in such a way that could not happen in reality.  'Phone Booth' pulls it off by pulling the plug on the idea quickly before it gets lame (it clocks in at 81 minutes).  
Director Michael Mann, the stylistic director of 'Thief', 'Heat' and producer of 'Miami Vice', is very skilled in setting up the characters with well written dialogue.  Mann's editing style includes throwing in 'garbage' shots.  He will dwell on something insignificant, such as something you might stare at while waiting for a traffic light. Mann is underrated as a director.  He consistently gets convincing performances from talented actors.  Jamie Foxx stands out as a major star in this film by underplaying his character.  Cruise, has no choice but to play Tom Cruise.  In this case, he is a nice bad guy that kills bad bad guys.  Shot in very cold fluorescent looking light, he is convincing as a hit man.  Mann plays with the HDTV format.  You would never guess this is the same format used to shoot 'Attack of the Clones'.  There is a video artefact called trailing that is reminiscent of older video technology. I'm certain that this effect was deliberately incorporated to give it a 'reality' feel.  Compared with the night video shot for the 'Cops' TV series, or other HDTV movies with night photography, this pushed video 'look' seems to also include the look of the glare from bright lights that are in the frame.  I am still not a fan of HDTV video replacing good old 35mm film, but it makes sense in this case, when considering the overall tone of the film.  This is somewhat ironic, whereas most 'films' shot on video want to try their best to avoid the 'video' look.
During this two hour movie, the cabbie named Max is forced to examine his life while he is being confronted with the life or death situation involving Cruise. Here is where the true core of the movie resides.  The screenwriter(s) adroitly avoid the machinations of a plot that looks contrived on paper, and instead concentrate on the three central characters (the third being Annie, the pretty prosecuting attorney).   Once we get inside the head of Foxx's character, we can believe the series of events (but barely at points) that drive this film. It is rare that a film delivers on both story and action.  The action scenes are quick and violent,  and keep the adrenaline pumping. 
While this film will not change the minds of anyone about Tom Cruise, nevertheless he performs well when in the experienced hands of renowned directors (Scorcese. Levinson, Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick, Pollack).   The audience can be assured also that you won't readily be able to predict how the night will end, which keeps you involved in the third act.  I would not be surprised if the film is remembered at Oscar time, including acting by Foxx, and director Mann.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,19 August 2004
Dunkirk," Visceral and Original
","The inevitable question rises when a major war movie is released 'does this have anything original to say?'. Astoundingly, Nolan's new film is a yes. If one were to extract a theme from this script is that people will go through extraordinary lengths for survival. Not to take anything away from acts of survival in 'Schindler's List'. This movie needs little dialogue to show the unspoken communication between the vulnerable soldiers, perhaps left to die on the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Nolan found a great moment to flesh out, and more importantly, deliberately exclude a great deal of side stories that easily could bogged down the pacing and the running time. Turning this film into a tight action film running only 1 hour and 47 minutes. Three primary stories are followed, two of which are filled with surprises. The first is the young English soldier who you sense is essentially lost. You never see him with his regiment or carousing with other comrades. Knowing he must do anything he can to survive, he sneaks his way through the crowd and ultimately must sneak around more to continue to stay alive. The second story follows a father and his two sons as they heed the call to take their private boats across the channel to help the evacuation. Here some hard drama occurs where you might not expect it. Mark Rylance as usual becomes transparent in his role. You can read with his eyes what is going through his head as one truly appreciates the exceptional circumstances that are taking place. The third story was somewhat featured in the extended trailers that were shown in theatres. Tom Hardy and his cohorts are on a fruitless mission to try and stop the German aerial assault on the retreating soldiers. In the large Imax format, the flying sequences are much more than showing the dogfights that take place. They put the audience in the air, being able to take a bird's point of view as we get the geography of the action scenes.The editing is something worth noting, as there are jumps forward and back in time as the narrative follows one character's timeline, and then another character's timeline. It all remains coherent by giving the audience key moments from different perspectives, and again keeping the number of characters we follow down to a handful. It also makes for a quick piece of storytelling when the premise is simple enough to get with a few lines of dialogue here and there.",7,0,1,24 December 2017
Ratatouille," A Rat who Cooks in Paris? If it's Pixar - Yes.
","Brad Bird really put himself on the line with this strange concoction of a film. The only way this concept could work for the length of a feature (at 1 hour and 50 minutes - that's an eternity in animation time), is to go all out. Indeed, that's what this epic does and succeeds. From a floating imaginary chef to hair pulling as puppetry, the film is stuffed full of little details and subplots. No, you can't let a film with a strange Tom and Jerry feel to it become the central part of the film, so the character of Linguini and his own strife counter-balance the rat's story. Indeed, Linguini, a clutz in the Jerry Lewis vein, carries the second half of the story, with the rat mostly disappearing in many scenes. What Brad Bird accomplishes, meanwhile, is that Pixar magic, where you get an unexpected emotional attachment to strange world they have created. So, in the end, this is not a story about a rat who likes to cook, it becomes the moral that anyone can try something new. AND - there are no dumb Randy Newman songs. The pacing is quick, there are a few good action scenes, and humour exists, but mostly forced. This is still more of an adult orient animated film (there is a love story), but the rat is cute and the unorthodox premise never bores. As uncertain to the reaction when the film opened, there is a solid timeless quality to the execution that will make it a classic. Something that could not be said about last year's 'Cars'.",6,3,8,8 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Fantastic Marvelous Amazing Generic Superhero Movie
","I don't have any childhood attachment to Spiderman like most other people do. I was more a Superman person. When the Sam Raimi version of 'Spiderman' came out, it was a fresh take and felt it was 'what a Superhero movie should be'. It was not all bluster, and Tobey Maguire had an alluring charm. On the other hand, there was always the moment where everyone could tell we were no longer watching live action, and essentially switched over to watching a Spiderman cartoon. It didn't hurt the quality of the film, I knew from Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman's soundtrack work that it was in good hands. That was until Spiderman 3 (see my review). Spiderman 3 did for me what 'Batman & Robin' did for that franchise. Wisely, the studio put Batman back on the shelf in 1997. The origin story for the Batman franchise was presented in the first film in 1989, SIXTEEN YEARS before the complete reboot and retelling of the origin story in 2005. Here, Sony (watch for Sony product placement in TASM), within just 5 years, is rebooting and is shoving the same familiar origin story last seen just 10 years ago. 16 years is almost a generation between reboots. 10 years for Spiderman is too soon. I have been watching 'modern' superhero movies for the last 12 years (starting with the first 'X-Men'), and there have been some truly great inspirational releases over that time. But there are so many superhero movies out there, and they all have the same clichés now. It is the same generic formula over and over: 1. Innocent Boy 'A' wants to date Innocent Daughter 'B' of Successful Father 'C'. 2. 'A' finds secret power. 3. 'A's father 'D' dies, causing 'A' mental anguish. 4. Scientist 'X' becomes Designated Super Villain 'Y'. 5. 'A' becomes superhero 'Z', both loved and hated. 6. 'Z' Threatens 'B', causes panic in Gothametropolis. 7. 'A' is in mental tug-of-war whether to fight crime or marry 'B'.And so on.. However in this unnecessary Spiderman reboot, the generic formula is worse'D' is also 'X' while 'C' hates 'A' and 'B' knows about 'Z'. I am becoming burned out on the traditional super hero films. No, this reboot is not 'Batman Begins' just because they put in the Hans Zimmer WWWHHHHOMMMPPP music stings and busy strings in the soundtrack. Maybe they thought this would feel more authentic by adding a lot of old furniture in the movie. They also tried to add authenticity by casting genuine Academy-caliber actors as the aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). But as the movie began telling the origin story again, wasting too much time setting up sequel bait, I began to groan almost right away. Andrew Garfield is the new Tobey Maguire, and yes he is a likable boy/man (he looks like a college student going to a high school). His character is not quite the same Peter Parker. Now he is jumpy and has better agility before his transformation. Garfield's charisma wins you over, thankfully, because having to sit through the same story plot points was starting to give me restless leg syndrome. I have been a veteran movie-goer for over 40 years, and I just can't get into cliché teenage romance stories these days. At least the original Spiderman set Peter in college, and a far more interesting life. Scenes of skateboarding and high school socializing are meant to connect with the young crowd, but they feel clunky and cliché nonetheless. I know this is a big 220 million dollar film, so I was impatient for the movie to get to the big action scenes. The movie finally gets you there, and the effects are clearly better than the original 'Spiderman' for the most part, but that is to be expected over the course of 10 years. They are well done and are exciting, but are relatively straightforward. The villain for this film is a lizardman, who looks menacing enough, but is not a Super Villain by any stretch of the imagination. Any member of the audience who saw 'The Avengers' earlier in the summer will get a sense of deja-vu, as the Stark tower appears, almost identical, in this film as the centerpiece of the big final action scene. There is a desperate attempt to incorporate a number of skycranes as part of the big finale that makes no sense whatsoever, and provides very little payoff anyway. I was waiting over two hours for this? Yet another fight on top of yet another skyscraper? Been there, done that, way too many times. I will still recommend the film for the action scenes and the ability of Garfield to carry the film. But it is not as good as Raimi's interpretation , especially 'Spiderman 2'.",6,7,15,7 July 2012
The Exorcist," DVD Commentary - don't bother
","I am commenting specifically about the new 'Version you've never seen', which was rereleased in theatres recently and has come out on DVD with a Director's Audio Commentary.   There is little else in the way of extras on the DVD.  The Theatrical Trailers are just the new ones created for the re-release.  The film was directed by William Friedkin,  who did a masterful job making 'The French Connection'.  For the commentary,  he talks non-stop, but really says nothing at all  about the making of the film,  or the reaction to it's controversial subject matter.  Instead,  he talks the movie.  In other words,  he's like an annoying roommate who saw this really cool film and wants you to see it.  But instead of letting you just watch it in silence,  he tells you exactly what's going on in every scene,  like you can't figure it out for yourself.  For example,  he goes on about how troubled Father Damien is about his dying Mother.  Well, gosh,  his character says out loud how he wishes he could have done more for his dying Mother.  How about some insight into how some of the special effects were done?  How did the actors cope with performing some of the scenes?  Why did you originally cut the scenes from the original release?  Go to the trivia section for this film and there are a few pages worth of interesting anecdotes,  virtually none of which is mentioned by the director.  Friedkin doesn't reveal really anything useful, except: - The scene where the detective and the mother have a 'cat and mouse' conversation is his favourite scene. - Father Damien is frequently shown rising from the ground (up a stairway, walking up a hill)As for the film itself, there are plenty of recommendations out there that establishes this film as one of the great scare flicks,  up there with 'Psycho'.  Unfortunately,  the audience for scary movies is different now then it was in the 70's.  The movie originally came out before the surge in the 80's of teener slasher movies ('Friday the 13th, Halloween,  etc.),  and really is for a more older sophisticated crowd.  It isn't surprising to hear that younger audiences watching it these days may find it slow, boring, and perhaps even silly.   One thing that escapes them is that this film,  as opposed to most mindless horror flicks,  is actually based on fact!Movie:  7 out of 10 DVD extras:  3 out of 10",Null,1,2,8 May 2002
Quantum of Solace," Where am I?
","This movie tries to outdo too much. It is 'The Bond Identity' on adrenaline. But that is really to it's detriment. This is immediately evident in the opening car chase. Every shot is so split second, that exploding cars and trucks become meaningless, almost a parody of itself. I mean, come on, you spend the time to shoot this sequence, give the audience a chance to feel what it was like. This movie is far too jumpy. It reminds me of the Michael Bay syndrome. His movies need to cut every half second because if it ever slowed down, you would catch on that you are actually watching something dumb. That being said, there are a mix of good action sequences and just dumb ones. Bond motorcycles over three boats and jumps into another one to chase after the villain - all in stride like it was well choreographed. It's just too easy for Bond to slip in and out of the villain's lair without a scratch.Then there's the weak script writing, where Judi Dench has to show up in all the convenient moments to keep the plot going. Doubly so for the very last scene, which wraps up everything way too conveniently. Literally, she just pops in from nowhere, any spot on the planet. There is also the same complaint with too nebulous of a evil crime syndicate or what have you. Then there is a relatively stupid finale in a pretty lame looking location.One thing I will hand to the cinematography, the action unit director knows that you can shoot exciting action sequences without the use of shaky cam. Let this be a lesson to future action filmmakers.",5,3,4,5 May 2012
No Country for Old Men," Is this the Sopranos? - **Spoiler Alert**
","There are 3 acts in a given movie. The setup, the complication, and the resolution. This screenplay smells as though it has been simmering over time with rewrites and re-imagining. The first two acts are classic 'Blood Simple' mechanics of messy violence and greed. You could almost see this as the world of 'Fargo', where killing sprees seem to be commonplace. Here, we're back in the slow south, a favourite setting for the Coens. The villain is worth the ticket price alone, a truly well cast and twisted killer that uses a novel device to eliminate any obstacles. The setting is also fun, set in 1980, you are immersed in the old Texas towns like in the original 'The Getaway'. Tommy Lee Jones, who is a main character, gets very little screen time. Josh Brolin is the archetypical everyguy. He makes (mostly) smart decisions once he discovers a stash of drug money. But it is Chigurh, the villain, that dominates the mood of the piece, and will certainly be talked about in the future. There lots of 'gotchas' that make you jump, and the well crafted sequence of events are fun to watch as they play out. So you are juiced through the 1st and 2nd acts, only to be given a different outcome.**Minor Spoilers ahead** The 3rd act is definitely unpredictable, so one can be assured that it won't be the same shootout on the rooftop that you've seen a hundred times. What happens instead, without us first realising it, is that basically the end of the 2nd act is the end of the movie, and the subsequent scenes are like 'what ever happened to...' And again, it is not what you think. Which brings us back to Tommy Lee Jones, a tired old Texas Sheriff who chooses his own happy ending, giving the audience a different closure than they were expecting. Think of the finale of 'The Sopranos'. **End of Spoilers**So you are guaranteed to be talking about this ending when you walk out of the theatre, it may be a good thing. For some, however, there may be more of reaction that this is an art film disguised as a thriller. My final summation is that it is a some of both, 2 acts of thriller and 1 act of art film. That tips the scale enough to give this a 6 out of 10.",6,3,7,21 November 2007
Batman Begins," Batman begins Again
","Hollywood is now in complete auto-loop mode by remaking it's own movies. We are supposed to erase all four previous Batman movies and start all over again? So we return back to that fateful evening his parents were killed. And all intentions are that they are going to 'remake' the Joker episode too. This must be likened to that new catch term - a 're- imagining'. How many rewrites do you think it took to have Batman 5 (or Batman Do-Over 1) to start with Bruce Wayne intentionally wasting away in a Thailand prison? This movie not only goes into far left field in terms of treating the kabuki of action movies, it goes into the parking lot. Another no-no is the lack of obligatory over-the-top action set pieces at least every 20 minutes or so. Here we get lengthy character development. But as one character declares - we are defined by our actions. The characters and the camera never stop moving. We float along the city of Gotham, or glide through other locations (which all seem to have high ceilings with catwalks). As the pieces start falling together in the second half of the film, our patience is rewarded with a solid lead character that we know intimately. So every action has meaning, and the action movie actually has a story. Ang Lee tried this with 'Hulk' a few years back, but failed because the character development was dull and tedious. (see my review for more explicit details). Here, the whole story of bats as the source of childhood fear is far more interesting. Every step of Bruce's transformation is done with a more Down to Earth approach. This means there are flaws in Bruce's motives, and things don't always go to plan. Michael Caine is well cast as the surrogate father. Morgan Freeman seemed to be cast primarily because he is a big name. Christian Bale on his own is a risky gamble for the franchise. I enjoy his strong acting abilities, but that almost works against you when the audience needs to buy that you like running around in a batsuit. Katie Holmes still comes off as the requisite leading babe, but no complaints there. Thankfully, there are no goofy love games (such as that bogs down the 'Spiderman' movies) as these characters interact. The script successfully steers away from most clichÃ© plot follies. Bad guys are thankfully not all dressed up like Liberace. This movie also gets some points for being gritty, casting Liam Neeson (everything he does is excellent), and mostly for a script that was brewed long enough to have a refined taste. But once again, is all this enough to cover the fact that there are few jaw-dropping effects? For a guy like me who likes intelligent movies, the answer is yes. For the guy who needs to see an explosion every 10 minutes, the movie might drag. But for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie, it certainly did not drag at all for me. One thing I missed was a little bit of looseness of the characters. The movie almost never lightens up, and rarely has time for any fun humour. Others might be upset to see our hero attack the police, causing harm to men in uniform. It might be a little hard to sympathise with Bruce's desire to be a vigilante. This sometimes gives you an uneasy feeling about whether to applaud his actions. The script also carefully tiptoes around this grey area. The movie accepts that the police does not approve of those who take the law into their own hands. This is a strange clash of the real world versus the comic book world. But I for one am thankful that I don't have to see any more men in tights and goofy make-up. And god forbid please - no Prince music, MTV, or over- the-top set pieces.",7,1,2,15 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Subpar to the Nearly Perfect Original Trilogy
","There are two separate things I want to touch upon in this review. First is how it feels to return to Middle Earth and sit through yet another epic 2 hour 50 minute journey. The other is my reaction to watching a 'film' in HFR (48 frames per second). I have not read the Tolkien novels, and didn't find that a problem when watching the original LOTR Trilogy. First of all, it was pleasant to feel that I was watching a production that was in good hands. The pacing (except for about two spots) was energetic, the dialogue and acting successfully avoiding cliché. The period of time spent with Bilbo reluctantly setting off on an adventure was drawn out way too long. I'm sure it is verbatim to the novel, but is obvious that a lot of this slow story development would have been streamlined with a more agreeable running time in mind (save it for the special DVD release). Not being familiar with the novel, I was finding myself being whisked along for the ride (once it gets started). There is intelligence in the creatures they encounter, and consistent backstory with all the elves and dwarfs and orcs and so on. There are a few more extended dialogue scenes, that on a normally disciplined running time, would have been trimmed to avoid the dullness of exposition. As much as I was mildly interested in this prequel for the content, I was more eager to witness what may be the birth of a new era in film presentation. Digital theatres will sometimes feature programming shot and presented in video (Metropolitan Opera for instance), with a totally different look. For the first time since silent movies changed from 15 frames per second to 24, there is a new barrier being broken. Video runs at 30 frames per second, so this new 48 frame format bests even the 'live' look of normal video as compared to the look of film. I took a survey of movie reviews to find out the reaction to the HFR showing. Most of the reviews were negative. The look of video has a stigmatism to it, as 'cheaper' looking compared to film. To be sure, lighting as seen on video is generally more harsh than film, where film is known to have better contrast, the ability to see detail in shadows. I must declare that there was a moment of surprise as the movement and detail were much more crisp that any movie I have ever watched, even animation displayed on an Imax screen. Yes, the higher frame rate looks like video. But every other aspect of the image looked exactly like the same production style and depth as LOTR. More impressively, 90% of the digital effects held up to close scrutiny with the clearer image. There were the following few exceptions. The most major hindrance was the look of the sets that were supposed to be rock or sculpted stone. I guess because having seen the making of documentaries, I know that most of the fake rock is made of styrofoam. Also a sequence where digital wolves are running across the wilderness. I'm sure it was a challenging effects shot because of a moving camera along with moving digital animals in daytime combined with live action. Some of the background did not match in resolution to some CGI, but was forgivable. The look of video only became apparent during shaky hand-held shots. However, my mind's initial interpretation of watching this type of movement in a fantasy environment, was as if I was watching a high quality video game. It has become a real issue, because audiences need to be given more jaw dropping effects every summer as the bar continues to be set higher, with video games following close behind. One thing that is the most revealing technically with HFR is the lighting. For instance, I could notice the artificial light replacing the supposed candlelight on a table. There also is the perfectly lit miniature of a mountain or a foot bridge with the main characters seen from a distance. But they may not look any better in the standard 24 fps. So congratulations are in order for both the story and technical achievements as we extend our stay in Middle Earth. The filmmakers did not forget that one their primary jobs for these kinds of films is to make sure the audience is entertained. And entertained I was. Further notes summing up my first viewing of an HFR moviePROS Eye-popping clarity, incredible detail especially in wide shots. 3D benefits from brighter and more cleaner image CGI characters are more lifelike, but still only as good as the quality of the CGICONS Video look. Slower fps provides the film look. In higher fps, Animation looks like video game animation. Extra sharp resolution makes it easier to spot characters shot against green screenREACTIONS TO OTHER COMMENTS 'Some action looks sped up' - I did not notice anything like that, perhaps they are used a bit more motion blur, or can't handle some fast motions without strobe. 'Notice costumes, make-up, and wigs'. I was actually amazed how all the production design held up under such intimate scrutiny. 'Soap opera, BBC television, stage play'. These are all mental associations that these viewers make when first witnessing a narrative feature that doesn't have that film look. But it is not because of the lower quality of the production. Update: I finally watched the film on DVD in 24 fps. All the effects in 48 frames that looked iffy looked just as fake in 24 frames. So ultimately that is a strike against the effects work for this film, especially to the almost seamless effects work in the original LOTR trilogy.",6,2,4,17 May 2013
Saving Private Ryan," A Timeless Piece of Filmmaking
","I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank a soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps 'Patton', but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as 'Apocalypse Now' is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war.",9,4,6,3 June 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," More Bond than Bourne
","Although I have this mild complaint, I give this film a rousing positive review. Brad Bird turned what was a more gritty MI:3, where Ethan's wife was being threatened, and there was a fair amount of violence, into a more light-weight roller coaster ride. This film suffers a bit from the older James Bond films, where a lot gadgetry that could not possibly really work brought down the realism of the film. The newer Bond films wisely disposed of all the gimmickry adding more gravitas to the peril our heroes are facing, such as the 'Bourne' franchise. Throughout most of this film, despite being shot and slammed against hard objects, everyone jumps back up and dusts themselves off. There is also the situation where someone could rappel down a wall with a simple rope, instead wears some magnetic suit and needs a remote rover to be driven around. I felt the film featured these electronic toys too much as a crutch for propelling the action scenes. Another mild criticism is Jeremy Renner's character. I think he deserves the accolades given to him and the film benefits from his involvement. However, knowing him as a far more tougher guy from 'Hurt Locker' and 'The Town', it is little hard to believe him as being a little skittish in this film. The third act gets a little over-the-top and Jeremy Renner's big secret turns out to be a little underwhelming. The handling of other character's personal lives is virtually nonexistent. One other piece of criticism that was hard to shake was the very core of the central plotÂ….Slight Spoiler ahead: The IM team is trying to stop someone from using stolen Russian launch codes to launch a nuclear missile. Can't the Russians just change the codes? Spoiler finished.Now the good news. There is a great surge of energy throughout this film. It is a 'blink and you miss something' type of pacing. I think the co-producer J.J. Abrams can be thanked for creating just about the right tone for a summer popcorn movie (even though it's being released in December). I enjoyed the big screen set pieces and especially enjoyed the incidental bits of setbacks and humour. For instance, there is moment where Ethan forgets to take off his goggles that has a payoff later. The action set pieces are still over-the-top, but designed in such a way as to provide maximum thrills. Normally I would go into greater depth about this film, but the truth is that there is not any award-winning observations to make. The wall-to-wall music is punchy in the right places, the cinematography is nice looking, the sound effects are well done, the acting is fine, etc. I place this as perhaps 2nd best of the franchise next to MI3, only because we get some better character development out of that one.",6,1,6,16 December 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Poetic Filmmaking - The Mona Lisa of the Film Medium
","This is a film lover's delight, sweeping you away from your environment and immersing you in the sights and sounds of another place and time. As much as I consider Citizen Kane one of the greatest films ever made because of it's innovations, Lawrence of Arabia succeeds as the Mona Lisa of movie-making. Each stroke, colour, action, is perfect. I will watch this film every few years, and have no problem sitting through the 3 hour plus running time. I've had the pleasure of seeing this on the big screen a couple times in my life. More recently I viewed it in HD, and it looked incredible. For such a long film, there is breathtaking set piece after set piece of huge scenes that truly define what an Epic Movie is. And you would think a long running time means a slowly paced story, but the different chapters in this film vary in pacing based on the momentum of the scene.There are scenes of thousands of people stretched across the desert vistas that are almost impossible to believe there are no visual effects involved. The grand staging of scenes in large rooms with a lush colours are a marvel to witness. Striking visuals come one after another; a large boat seemingly sailing in the desert, large cityscapes with period detail, sweeping battle scenes, and train wrecks.The list of iconic actors is also astonishing. The debut of Peter O'Toole as Lawrence is mesmerising. Alec Guinness provides an elder's wisdom. Omar Shariff and Anthony Quinn are larger than life characters. There are no missteps and endlessly breathtaking photography. One thing that comes from repeated viewings is David Lean's careful poetic presentation of the story, which is part of the secret of it's longevity. Perhaps it is the lyrical portrayal of such a heavy subject of war that keeps this film from reaching the 10 star status that other war films possess.",8,0,1,15 September 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The issue of Plot Holes - how far do you expect us to go?
","The first warning that a reviewer should give any prospective moviegoer about this film is the requirement to overlook the MULTITUDE OF PLOT HOLES. Is it possible to latch on to the likable characters and amazing CGI chimp work and forgive the MASSIVELY HUGE PLOT HOLES? One can start to watch a movie and have a cynical attitude, however I will give a movie a break on one deficiency or another, but can you suspend disbelief when there are GAPING JAW-DROPPING PLOT HOLES? OK, we all know that this is a science fiction film. ROTPOTA is following the recent formula where movie franchises are rebooting with more realism and Earthbound storytelling. I was not a huge fan of the original movie series, but acknowledge as a strong work of science fiction, and some of the sequels held intriguing possibilities. One big credit goes to adding the new twist in this origin story that the source of accelerated intelligence in the apes came from a research lab trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's. But after that, the sequence of events are less inspired. We have a too broadly painted animal keeper who likes to abuse apes. You would think a special habitat built especially for apes would employ animal lovers, but that would be pointing out one of the ASTRONOMICALLY GARGANTUAN PLOT HOLES. Ultimately the film loses it's appeal, and one becomes strained as you try to continue to give the film a fair break.The good news is that ROTPOTA wins you over because of the great teamwork of Andy Serkis and Weta in creating a amiable character Caesar along with a cast of other apes. Although you know that the apes in this film don't completely resemble a true chimpanzee, and the movements still resemble humans in capture gear, you have a deep enough story to follow it through. And credit must be given to director Rupert Wyatt for being bold enough to have a lyrical directing style usually absent in a summer tentpole film. One drawback is that the second act is slow to resolve the inevitable uprising (as seen in the trailers - so no spoiler here), and great leaps of faith are required as character actions occur that would make a 4 year old SCREAM IN UTTER FRUSTRATION AT THE SERIOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOT HOLES. Some events in passing include Caesar monkey-ing around with a small Statue of Liberty souvenir (echos of the end of the 1st film), as well as TV new reports of a Mars space mission getting lost. These are obvious sequel setups. Although I didn't get too excited at yet another remake/reboot, I feel encouraged that subsequent sequels will have similar imaginative but COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS PLOT HOLES that will take the audience into more original and inventive movie fare. Yes, there are no superheroes in this film for once. I would suggest that waiting for the DVD would be best, lest you groan a little too loud in the theater at the INCREDIBLY HUMONGOUS PLOT HOLES.",5,4,14,6 August 2011
Drive," Great use of Subtlety
","It would be difficult to write about parts of the storyline in this film, because many expectations change when the consequences of one event folds upon another. A terrific original screenplay defies Hollywood conventions of over-the-top plot convolutions and unrealistic twists. Sure, there are a couple coincidences, but there are many rewards for keeping the story simplified and enhance the characters' arcs. The director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in painting a cool atmosphere with glistening city lights at night and a throbbing synthesiser soundtrack. The film elevates itself above any other similar film in it's drama, perhaps better than the character rich film 'The Town' from 2010. The editing emphasises the main character's withdrawn persona, hiding his emotions (indirectly hinting at his criminal past) while romancing his neighbour. Moments in conversation where a 'normal' person would express their feelings or be more extroverted, are instead tension filled passages of silence that speak louder than words. With great use of subtlety, the film does wonders in terms of depicting the main character's withdrawn mental state, but still visualising his thoughts and intentions without direct exposition.Another accolade must be given to actor Ryan Gosling in the lead role. We the audience must invest time into this character, which the film keeps in the first person narrative, most activities outside of his knowledge are outside of ours. He must show realistic reactions to danger, even though his past is never quite explained. The right emphasis is given to revealing moments of his capabilities, so when he is set in harm's way, we believe he can stand up to the test. The rest of the cast is well heeled in talent, allowing the sense of naturalism to provide the tone. As you may notice in critical reviews, when a film exposes no obvious weaknesses, the positive rating goes up. I myself am having a hard time exposing any weakness in this film, I felt I was in good hands, and was not annoyed by any plot contrivances. I happen to be a fan of Michael Mann, as must the director of this film, and the right homage elements work for me. I think of this perhaps of the antithesis of 'Fast & Furious'. One of the best films I have seen this year, could even get an Oscar nod with the screenplay or editing.",8,100,177,21 October 2011
2012," The Day After The Day After Tomorrow
","Emmerich has basically made a sequel to his movie 'The Day After Tomorrow'. When I saw the trailer, I was astounded for the first time since perhaps 'The Phantom Menace'. I remember the huge crowds on opening day of 'Independence Day'. The lengthy trailer for 2012 showed extended sequences that rivaled anything seen, even in 'TDAT'. But the question in my mind was, what else did the movie have to offer that wasn't already seen in the jaw dropping trailer? The answer is - zilch. I was appalled that they literally put all the money shots in the trailer, and had very little left to make us fork over the 9 bucks. Out of a 2 1/2+ hour movie, you get about 10 minutes of FX shots. No kidding. The rest is filler that is worse than the worst daytime soap opera. There are overlong and boring dialogue scenes of divorced parents and their kids trying to get along. Been there and done that way too many times. Yes, the end of the world is pretty boring. In 2012 sit in airplanes for hours upon end, or spend extended periods of time staring at computer screens with your cliché simulations and other mumbo jumbo. In 'TDAT', you had Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum get all cute and cuddly, there is no such chemistry between Cusack and ex-wife, or between the President's daughter and the chief scientist.This movie could have taken a different perspective on such obvious material, but seemed obligated to give the standard speeches as we grapple with losing our loved ones. That's what also makes this movie no fun, there is an understandable but generally overly depressing chain of events, as no one gets through the big event without some downers. The movie this most reminded me of was the extra boring TV cut of 'Earthquake'. It has a similar arc, spending endless time setting up characters that are quickly forgettable. Then only to have the big moment come and go in just a bat of an eye. I am actually stunned that nobody pressured Emmerich to trim the film down to a more reasonable length. It would give the theaters more showings and the audiences some more of their lives back.",4,4,8,13 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," All the Strong Points there, except the Music Score
","I was delighted to see my fears were unfounded as the 3rd outing still had something new to offer, except for periods where it felt like 'X Men: 90210'. There were imaginative set pieces, huge plot twists, a good amount of Wolverine, and the 'Mutants are People too' vibe. What kept it from being a gripping and driven film is the absence of a compelling score (see IMDb trivia about this movie and 'Superman Returns'). It is easy to tell when a movie is not greater than the sum of it's parts. I think of 'U.S. Marshalls', the sequel to 'The Fugitive'; there was something not quite there in the pacing, or in the framing of the shots, or the subtlety in the lighting. There are few FX shots that are that kind of 'wow' these days, and only near the end do the fireworks really begin. However, the script was thankfully bulletproof. With all characters well established, the arc of each character's stories are exciting to watch, and I can only say that the Blue Beast was too boring to justify the amount of screen time given. Here the Hairy over-sized cookie monster has to muddle through boring C-SPAN political dullness that gave me flashbacks of the Intergalactic Senate in the 'Star Wars' prequels. None of that procedural mumbo jumbo carries an ounce of the story's momentum. Whatever is discussed can just be recapitulated as a CNN news report, or in a few lines of dialogue. But back to the Music Score, John Powell's bland scoring was lacking when the right moment was needed, or, the film mix needed tweaking. Actually, the showing I was at had some sound glitches in the beginning two reels, so that may have been a factor as well. I think the story material more than makes up for the weaknesses, and you may find yourself choking a tear or two. I recommend those who have seen the other X Men movies to go see how the X Men world turns.",6,1,2,26 May 2006
The Incredibles," Not the Best Pixar ever - but great anyway
","One thing I will hand to Pixar, they are acknowledging their adult fan base. Adult oriented animation is growing mainstream. This animation feels more like a regular film in that respect. We now take for granted the spectacular animation, so we pay attention to the story and characters. The story is not the most original - some have brought up the similarity to 'Spy Kids' and I will concur. The very thing you will notice is much less humour. Once again this is not a bad thing, because we are given a more fleshed out relationship between the father and mother. Also, one of the kids definitely is a rebel, a nice touch to show that there no longer is such a thing as a nuclear family in this day and age. The film tries to unshackle the world of make believe as you watch this film, though only so far. With heavy music cues and 60's era production design, we are left no doubt that the audience is supposed to be thinking 'James Bond' as we watch our hero's venture on to the villain's island base of operations. But there is one cool difference with this film. In many recent live-action adventure films, there would be a point where it was obvious that we were no longer looking at live actors, but pure CGI. The complaint rising out of this was 'I can just stay home and play a video game'. In 'The Incredibles', we know this all pure CGI, so we don't need to lodge that complaint. Also, Pixar shows that our heroes are sometimes fallible. Now to the technical side of things. I liked 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' purely because of it's loving depiction of the cool look of the era. In this case, all the cool things from the early 60's are lovingly rendered in this film, from cars with lots of chrome, to traditional 'Metropolis' skylines, to the jazzed up mega-stylish sets from the old Bond films. Indeed, it seems that Pixar polled their animators to see what their dream animation pieces would be, and they are all lovingly displayed neatly into the storyline. There is the 'Doc Ock' machine, giving it realistic destructive capabilities. Then is the completely left field character who designed the superhero costumes. Her house is all things art-deco. There are comic book moments, car chases, tremendous point-of-view action shots, realistic lava, a fantastic waterfall, and on and on. I do not know the budget for this film, but there are many many setups, all with greatest 3D animation so far ever scene (until 'Cars' comes out next year). Some looking far more realistic than the previously mentioned CGI shots from other live-action films. The shirt and coat the main character wears is far more realistic than the CGI coat worn by CGI Keanu Reeves in 'Matrix Reloaded'. Water, hair, and fire effects are similarly realistic. The only complaints? We see too little of Samuel Jackson's character, and we don't get too concerned about the peril our heroes get in, because we know they will survive to get our prerequisite happy ending. But then again, everyone knows that this will spawn a sequel, so who cares?I give this a 7 out of 10.Added 6/13/08: Alas no sequel is in the cards, it shows how much work went into the success of the original project. This film still remains one of my favourites.",8,0,1,5 November 2004
A Quiet Place," Science Fiction Horror uses Sound as Clever Device
","I approached this movie knowing almost absolutely nothing about it, except that it was popular and that director John Krasinski did some good work for a relative newcomer. My preconception about a horror movie with the title 'A Quiet Place', maybe had something to do with an evil guy who is blind? What I didn't know was this was a Science Fiction horror film. Aliens on Earth. Cut to the chase, the film starts with most of the population already obliterated by very fast and very hungry creatures about twice the size of humans. They can't see but they have ears that can hear very long distances.The device of having nobody make any noise is presented as a nice twist to horror films out there. There is some appreciation to the steps taken by this surviving family. Everyone is always barefoot, sand is laid out in trails to other locations. It was a pleasure as always to watch actress Emily Blunt, playing the pregnant mother. The older daughter is also well written, going through adolescence in the middle of what is basically a war zone. More interesting and more inventive than 'Signs' or 'The Happening', just to name a few 'War of the Worlds' style of alien invasion movies. I was fascinated by the premise and how well the movie used sound to add tension. The family has different methods of suppressing sound or making sound when it is to their advantage. They live in a world where light and general visibility aren't a disadvantage. So many good moments, where an unexpected sound is like a Air Raid siren, causing panic and running. But also a solid third act where the family is separated and have their own demons to face (so to speak).Solid direction from Krasinski gets great performances from Blunt and Millicent Simmons as the deaf older daughter. He also expertly stages some fight scenes that can get your adrenaline going. Also deserving proper credit are the special creature effects. These creatures, although man-like in stature, have very disturbing looking heads without eyes. All in all, a snappy piece of Science Fiction horror that fans of Alien will approve. Characters sometimes will make dumb moves, but the script has put proper motivation behind why. For certain, audiences must try to put away Krasinski's 'Jim' character from the office. He is not a nerdy practical joker, and portrays himself as normal loving father. Emily Blunt emotes well enough, though the entire cast communicates through sign language (also a win for Hollywood including people with disabilities in a major release).I give this a 7, with high hopes for more good direction from Krasinski.",7,0,1,9 January 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Misses the Beats - But not a Waste of Time
","There are several flaws to this sequel. First, was the strange opening act, which for an action thriller was very sedate. Second, was the unfortunate lack of charisma by Jeremy Renner. The last sentence I found very surprising to write, since I think his work in 'Hurt Locker' and 'The Town' was very magnetic. One has to point the finger at the director Tony Gilroy. I found the movie lacked the right tempo, missing the beats where a sharp new piece of the puzzle should have hit the screen.The first act is completely without momentum. Renner is introduced, slowly, without any dialogue, as he trudges through the mountains. He's unconcerned about who he is. He never shows a great deal of urgency when his life is in danger. He seems a little calm most of the time. Fireworks yet? No, he shows up at the cabin. But lo - there's an unexpected agent waiting for him. Here it comes the moment of attack? No, they sit around and drink. The first act is intercut with a recap of the Bourne movies, trying to lay the foundation for a new secret agency with new code names. Ed Norton thankfully puts a face of integrity on the whole new merry-go-round.Most audience members looking for a good action-packed Bourne sequel will find themselves a little short-changed. There are many moments in the plot that could have been expanded for a few extra thrills.**MINOR SPOILER AHEAD*** For Instance, when the chemically altered agents are killed off, it is done simply with a pill. They fall over with a nose bleed, pretty unexciting. How about they become suicidal? Or they are chased by an assassin instead of taking a pill? Think outside the pillbox guys! **END SPOILER*** The whole motivation for Renner to run around and elude the bad guys, is pills. Sorry Mr. Gilroy, lame. Rachel Weisz, the only excellent element in this film, desperately tries to explain the whole pills program. It takes several pages of exposition. Guys, 1 page instead of 10 pages to explain the MacGuffin doesn't make it any more believable. Really.Nevertheless, I kept my attention on the story, finding little emotional attachment to Renner, but enjoying the acting talent of Weisz and Norton. I also found fault with the soundtrack. Again, no sense of fireworks, no hero beats. Better pacing could have saved this film. The biggest sequence you watch near the beginning is a drone attack on Renner. The casual pacing of the dialogue and editing saps most of the tension from the sequence. Gilroy fails to catch the moments of sixth sense with the right music cue or edit that helped turn Matt Damon into a superhuman. Renner has the super-abilities, but the moments aren't captured dramatically.If this script was produced without the Bourne product placement, it may have stood out on it's own, and provided audiences with a slick thriller that didn't need to fulfill the action requirement. Renner should not have to live in the shadow of Bourne, but the studio sees the brand name as insurance that audiences will show up to the theatres.I will barely recommend this film, finding enough parts to be watchable based on good filmmaking, even though the sum is not a greater whole.",5,2,6,15 August 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," Fits Perfectly in with X-Men Canon
","It is easy to agree with all the mediocre reviews of this latest outing of the X Men franchise. It is a lot of 'been there, done that'. But, while I sat and found myself being entertained and enjoying the two and half hour experience, it won't matter over time. Those looking for something new and unattached to any franchise aren't looking for a film like this. Those who find the X Men franchise to be on stable footing, and don't feel that it has worn out it's welcome yet, will feel satisfied with this last X Men ensemble film for a while. Bryan Singer has an adroit approach to this X Men comic book movie genre. He can create very human perspectives to fantasy stories. If there is one great flaw to this film, is that he created a moment that was too human, too raw in emotion to overcome. And that is early in the film when we find that Magneto had settled down with a wife and daughter, Minor Spoiler Only to see them murdered in front of his eyes, destroying his life,End Minor SpoilerAnd finds that destiny cannot escape him. For the audience, that moment where Magneto decides mankind is out to destroy him, is such a human moment, it is hard to transition to the comic book tone from that point on. Tonal shifts in a movie should not be taken lightly. Again, this is a part of the reason the film feels lackluster after the first act. Oddly, no one is to blame for this reaction. It is the same reaction I had to the Hobbit films coming out after Lord of the Rings. And the same reaction to seeing Terminator 5. The same tropes that are canon with these franchises have little new to offer, and is harder to excite the audience. I have always liked the slick production design, and have embraced the younger cast with the X Men films recently. The scripts are smart, the human conflicts are well executed, and the action scenes are well paced. So there is nothing to fault this outing, and I predict over time (assuming they will give the franchise a needed rest) that this installment will feel right in place with the others. As for the longer running time, again the pacing kept the story rolling with enough momentum to forgive going over the two hour mark.",6,4,11,9 June 2016
Transformers," Disturbing Pro-War Propaganda Disturbs otherwise Harmless Action Flick
","I was ready to switch my brain off walking into the theatre, especially when it comes to Michael Bay. But what bothered me were the obvious pro-Iraq war messages being delivered front and centre. A lot of current events involving world affairs play a part in the story. Why? This is a dumb movie based on a kids toy. That's what's disturbing. The pro-Military message: 'We are in for the long fight', (like Bush's perpetual War Against Terror) is being drilled directly into young teenagers heads. For the sake of the Transformers legend (Good robots battle Bad robots over Energy Cube) there isn't much need to bring Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bush, and Rumsfeld (played by Jon Voight). Worse, there is the heavy line at the pinnacle of the movie, where our hero says 'No Sacrifice, No Victory'. Pick up your Army brochures in the lobby. The film gets off to a disturbing start, with an all too familiar site of US soldiers (and civilians) fighting and dying in the middle east. What is this scene doing in a kids Transformer movie? There are also jabs at outsourcing in India, immigrants speaking Spanish, and clichés about African-Americans. Technically, there was too much reliance on CGI to wow you at the end. Unfortunately, Michael Bay's patented moving camera shots left me feeling a little dizzy, and mostly unable to get a good angle on the robot fights. Seriously, when you cut from a tracking shot straight to another tracking shot, you need to be able to get your bearings. But no, you cut away too quickly for anything to register. This carries on at the end for way too long. There are really so many wow shots one can handle in succession to have any real appreciation for the peril that anyone might be in. It is really too bad this all falls apart in the third act, because I could feel the Spielberg influence in Shia LaBeouf's character, and could dig the Boy and his Car subtext. I also applaud the over-the-top attitude about how the robots behave. This is the first American movie that has really embraced the kooky Japanese MechaGodzilla type of nonsense. This comes complete with a clueless military, two kids that always hold the key to everything, and kid-friendly heroes. Michael Bay has no idea how to make a proper film, having directed 1000's of TV commercials. At least there was some decent story elements that entertained me most of the time. But Bay will never get any legitimate credibility as long as he literally has no ideas beyond - keep the camera moving.",6,0,2,5 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A More Mature Outing Mixes Things Up
","Having just come from the theatre, the one thing I think tarnishes this film most is the product placement. The Disney overlords deemed it necessary to feature prominently cute groundhogs (also featured prominently in Toy departments). The other thing one would have hoped that we moved on from is having the Death Star as the big objective like the last umpteen Star Wars films. Lo, something shows up in the fourth act that uses Death Star as part of it's description. Otherwise my reaction is that this film properly succeeds in all ways to what was setup in 'The Force Awakens'. Having all the characters on the chess board setup and ready to play, a bit of alternative strategies come up with interesting combinations. Not that is is a complaint, but part of the kabuki in Star Wars films is the storytelling pattern: 'we have get to the gizmo on the starship that needs to be shutdown in order to let the rebel alliance escape.' This time, however, the pattern is broken and gives the mature members of the audience a chance to enjoy some unpredictability in the script. Story is big with this film. I read a few reviews before screening it and heard mumbles about the middle film keeping the wheels spinning but not getting anywhere. I felt the opposite. It feels like some of the storyline you would expect to occur in the 3rd installment of the new trilogy pops up in this film to give the audience some surprises. (Another major character gets offed). A good action film keeps in motion physically. This very long film accomplishes that. Even though the stakes have not changed, a good deal of running around expands the universe with other characters and locations. I really welcomed the homage to 'Empire Strikes Back', which also was the more mature of the original bunch. Even with it's long running time, actual screentime for some of the major characters can seem fleeting. For instance, Carrie Fisher's on set illness is evident as she remains seated through most of the film, her character virtually disappears for a time early in the film. Luke, as expected, actually talks in this film, and is expected to play the Yoda part from 'Empire'. Again, things don't got exactly as expected, and leads to Luke vanishing from the screen for a time. That leaves our main characters, Kylo, Rey and FInn and their separate paths as they fulfill their parts in the story. Rey, the confused Jedi-to-be is amazing to watch on screen. The energy in her eyes lights up the screen. Kylo is never happy, which leads to snap decisions that are dramatic to watch. Finn happily finds strength in character. His knowledge as a former member of the Empire works well. As I write this, I looked over some user reviews that give this a 1/10. That is ridiculous. It reminded me of the same wave of hate when 'The Force Awakens' came out. There were pages of 1 or 2 starred reviews back then as well. These type of ratings mean nothing if you are truly objective and scrutinize the film on it's merits, not because the filmmakers didn't make the film YOU wanted. No film ever earns a 1 or 2 stars unless it was made by someone unknown, incompetent, and inexperienced. I liked 'Force Awakens' (and those who hated it, why did you watch this one?) Compared to that one, I found 'The Last Jedi' story more interesting, and the characters more engaging. I gave 'Force Awakens' a 7/10. I give this an 8/10 because if this movie tried to play it safe and stick to the mold, it would've felt more obligatory than entertaining. I was thoroughly entertained through the 2+ hours, invested from the previous movie into the characters and story, and left the theatre satisfied. Not a dull moment.",8,0,3,18 December 2017
Brave," Pixar Not a Level Above the Rest Anymore
","As I was finishing watching the new Pixar movie, I was trying to figure out how the title 'Brave' fit into the film. It wasn't clearcut, other than a final bit of narration. I understand the original title was 'The Princess and the Bear', and that is a more appropriate title. About half the movie follows the shenanigans of the young redhead and said bear. Does it work? Sure, the bear is given human qualities, but still can evoke a sense of danger. In general the complaint seems to be that the arc of the story doesn't push the envelope, things that you expect to happen with the story pretty much happen as planned. I decided to watch this movie in 3D, because I heard that the lush visuals helped make up for the simple story. This was true, so my final verdict is thumbs up, but it still fails to live up to the competition. The competition I am talking about is the excellent 'How to Train Your Dragon', released a couple years ago.HTTYD was a surprise hit, combining memorable characters with some good fairy tale dragons, as well as teenage rebellion, etc. 'Brave' ventures into similar territory, and frankly didn't entertain me as much as HTTYD. I think another story layer was missing. I think also that this director was not at the level of sophistication as former Pixar director Brad Bird, for instance. I can't say there was any point where I got bored, or where a character became annoying. The crowd I was a part of in the theatre was full of kids, and they laughed at every pratfall. There were only sparse moments of adult level humor, certainly not enough to deem this a mature film in any way.One thing I thought was a bit of a letdown was the confines of the film's environment. The scenes in the forest break new ground in terms of texture and colour. Half-rotted tree trunks with a variety of shades of green moss create super-real visuals that benefited from the 3D effects. But most of the film takes place in your run-of-the-mill castle, including an extended action scene that feels like a video game where you chase around endless hallways and stairwells.There is certainly nothing to bemoan this latest CG animated film now seemingly lost in a glut of animation releases these days. We all know Pixar can do better, and I certainly won't declare that the Pixar magic effect has worn off. On the other hand, the usual captivating animated short that precedes all Pixar films was not all that as far as I was concerned. 3 men cleaning the moon was more simplistic than average and had a ho-hum payoff. For me, the fast-paced short that appeared before 'Wall-E' called 'Presto' is one of the best.Kids will be fine with this film, and adults will not get too bored, but all you really have left is the striking visuals (sometimes).",6,1,4,1 July 2012
Evil Dead," Big Budget Not Remake of Original
","Other than taking cues for creativity in depicting possessed people and the way they commit acts of gore, this film more than stands on it's own for thickly layered evil. Roughly the exact opposite of the Paranormal movies, where scares are derived from long periods of nothing, this films tries to up the shock value more like the torture porn 'Saw' movies. What also pushes the envelope is the incredible punishment all our victims can endure. Which makes the film just that more creepy and bloody. I was amazed to read that the budget for this heavy effects film is just 17 million. There are enough practical scenes of gore to make three low budget horror films. But there are also well shot scenes of swamp and creepy forest chases that did not look easy to film.We barely get to know our group of cabin dwellers before the evil takes over. Each scene was well thought out in terms of pushing the ick factor, making each possession as superhuman as they are supernatural. Yet the director is wise enough to keep this film from feeling conventional. Again, seemingly a great deal of time was put into creating a creepy atmosphere (foggy woods, dark and lonely cabin rooms, point of view attack scenes), and trying it's best not reveal how much was created in a studio.Some of the gore reminded me of the classic 80s version of 'The Thing', which also took pride in coming up with creative gore effects. The recent remake of 'The Thing' was an example of how hard it is to try and best the original or at least give the title some dignity. In this Evil Dead update, other than a few obvious CGI effects, most of the gore is only touched up slightly with digital manipulation. When things get crazy as time goes on, the film still finds ways to up the ante, and make it not so predictable as to who will survive and who won't.To compare this to the original Evil Dead is not appropriate, because other than the basic premise, this film finds it's own sense of style and execution. It certainly invites a sequel, but I have no great enthusiasm for an obligatory 13 sequel franchise to milk the concept beyond it's rate of return. So with a real budget I would guess near 25 million, there are thrills aplenty in this graphic and creepy franchise maker.",6,1,2,12 March 2014
Jurassic World," Old Fashioned Creature Scares instead of Uber-CGI
","After the seemingly unneeded critics review embargo lifted, I started reading through the reviews to get an idea of what was in store for JP4 (or JW4?). One reviewer hit upon the appeal of the original movie, was that it created a world where you could actually believe they made dinosaurs. None of the technology depicted looked like fantasy, and none of the activities of the dinosaurs defied the laws of gravity. Fast-forward 22 years, and filmmakers seem to be obliged to give us over-the-top, causing realism to get tossed out the window. The other thing lost on modern CGI spectacle films is the sense of tension. Here, after years of tinkering, Spielberg carefully crafts new set pieces that can still get you jumpy. Also credit the careful effects work, the CGI contains enough animal characteristics to feel realistic. One of the new conventions that I don't disagree with these days is not even bothering to create characters that you are going to care for. Another recent blockbuster 'San Andreas' disposed of the formalities and went straight into havoc mode. Here we don't get preachy or run through the obligatory checklist of all cliché characters and their cliché hangups. We still get stuck with a strange subplot about weaponizing the technology in regards to breeding Dino-Soldiers. Believe me it was supposed to be worse.So I congratulate the filmmakers for being more concerned about creating a film that holds some good scares than trying to make it about bigger CGI. Nevertheless, all the wide shots of the theme park, and stuff like the monorail, looked like CG models. It was also interesting to see effects shots that were in the trailer many months ago looking very different in the final film after they were all 'cleaned up'. One thing you wish could be improved upon is the intelligence quotient of the cast. It's OK if some of your expendable cast does some illogical things, but you should expect your main characters to act intelligently to keep the audience with you. It's these intelligent moments that are missing that makes you appreciate the original creation by Spielberg and how infrequent such a well crafted film comes about (I saw JP four times in the theatre when it first came out).The scary moments in JW are borrowed directly from the film Aliens, which is not such a bad thing. I remember enjoying some good scares in that monster film. There are many borrowed moments from the first Jurassic Park, including the tear-jerking animatronic dying dinosaur breathing it's last breath. But why throw in the holograms? Most things they showed in this film I could buy as present day technology. But in the main pavilion they show 3D holograms of dinosaurs walking around. Of course 3D holograms that you can walk around and see a complete 360 degrees does not exist. It was too bad they decided to toss this in, it made the film more about CGI eye candy than realism.All the acting was competent, it was just too bad that they had such flimsy setups to work with. Problems with jumps in time and many events happening off screen created a choppy attempt at creating empathy between relatives. Still, the scary sequences still work because the filmmakers know how to make you squirm. Fans of Chris Pratt will be glad to hear he somehow can eke out some charisma despite so little to go on. Less so for Bryce Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are trapped in their cliché roles. And poor Judy Greer, looking to show some acting range, has to literally phone it in. Ty Simpkins, the kid from Ironman 3, is allowed to respond intelligently and had the best chance at keeping the audience grounded. Less said for the third act, where Chris Pratt needs to take charge and be the connecting thread for all the final showstoppers.This film ultimately gets a thumbs up, and could be possibly one of the best of the summer films in terms of getting the most thrills for your buck. Perhaps Hollywood is finally hearing our complaints about Summer Films getting over-bloated and testing our patience by going over the 2 hour mark. Jurassic World benefits from this. Good pacing on the one hand means large chunks of story go missing, but it means you get out of the theatre before your attention span wanes.",6,0,5,12 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Not as much of a Thriller as I Hoped
","I had deliberately not read any reviews for this film, hoping to watch it with fresh eyes and be given a chance not to know any spoilers. All I knew was that this film had a twist on the time travel theme. For some reason, I was expecting a thriller movie, instead I discovered it was a romance movie. I had not read the original short story by Philip K. Dick, so I don't know the original plot. In this case, a man is not given a choice between a career in politics or stay with the love of his life. He wants to stay with his soul mate, but the powers that be try to steer him toward becoming President. It reminded me of another romance with a little science fiction thrown in, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. 'Eternal' had a similar premise where a device is used to keep apart two people who seemed destined for each other. 'Adjustment' could have worked as an intriguing thriller, with the 'plan makers' having a more darker influence on the main character's life. The only element of danger is a threat to our protagonist that his memory will be wiped if he doesn't accept the career path chosen for him. For the most part, however, it seems the filmmakers needed to keep the tone much lighter, with virtually no violence and mostly non-threatening action sequences. This tone is reflected in the music by Thomas Newman, which contains the familiar feel-good light arrangements, queuing the audience that everything will be just fine and our main character is not in any dire predicament. I kind of wish more jeopardy was prevalent in this story, than just be about the power of love. This lack of jeopardy made the third act much less compelling, and resolution all but certain.The adjustment bureau's premise is still interesting, and it is engaging to learn the 'rules', of how the 'agents' operate. There are some smart moments where the agents discuss among themselves the meaning of it all. The screenplay also does a good job of keeping just enough of the greater plan a mystery so we the audience aren't being dumbed down with a lot of textbook exposition. Indeed, a lot of exposition is still necessary in order to connect the dots, but the story rolls along with a decent pace. What keeps this film from being mechanical is the good chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, with sparkling dialogue that almost seems improvised. The filmmakers knew that this chemistry was critical in order for the audience to invest their time and emotion into film's plot. Our desire as the audience to see these two people together made us willing to invest our own emotions into the story. So the screenplay, acting, and editing are to be acknowledged in what makes this film succeed. It is only the intended lightness of the story that keeps the third act from having any real gravitas. The potential to have more thrilling elements could have improved the story without losing the romantic core of the plot.",6,0,2,7 March 2011
Black Hawk Down," An effective but incomplete depiction
","The following is more a critique about the film compared to the book, than a review.  I give this film 3 stars and a thumbs up.  This is what Pearl Harbour should've been like.I'm sure people who read the book will react differently from those who didn't.  The book is excellent in cranking out the many details that transpired,  making the reader feel like they are right there.  So many anecdotal events occurred,  it seems strange that a 2 hour and 20 minute movie could not show them all,  even though the actual event lasted a little over 12 hours.  Most people have already seen `Saving Private Ryan'.  We were all shocked by the brutal reality of battle,  and the film deservedly got many Academy Award nominations.  So this time around,  when the blood splatters on the camera lense,  it feels somewhat familiar.   'SPR' also worked because many of the cast were fresh faces,  allowing us to see them as their characters,  not as familiar actors.In 'BHD',  we see Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, and others from Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbour'.   That cast,  along with the battle,  is fresh in most people's minds (since it was mandatory that everyone see it).    So this time around,  we, the audience,  feel like we've got combat experience going into this film.   Also,  Ewan McGregor,  now quite familiar as a Jedi Master with a Scottish accent in `Star Wars',  does a poor job with an American accent.  One thing that both 'Private Ryan' and 'Pearl Harbour'  did NOT have during their battle scenes was music.  Without music,  the battle scenes feel like documentary footage.  With music,  like in 'BHD',  it pulls us out of the immediate surroundings,  and reminds us that it is a movie. I was quite surprised how much of this non-stop battle was underscored with a Hans Zimmer soundtrack.  Perhaps the decision to go heavy on the music was to pump up the patriotism,  post 9/11.All that said,  `Black Hawk Down'  is a smart, unflinching,  realistic, and unapologetic film.There are periods during the battle where events seem incoherent,  which realistically depicts the confusion that really happened.  But it stops short to show the whole story behind some of details on screen.  Near the beginning of the film, we see a short clip of the film 'The Jerk',  where Steve Martin is being shot at.  The gunman misses and hits some cans.  In the book,  this scene is referred to later during the battle,  where bullets are puncturing a piece of metal,  demonstrating how poor a shot most of the Somali shooters were.  `It's the cans!  He hates the cans!'  the soldier declares.  It is a telling piece of humour that helps relay the sense of disbelief the Rangers had while it was happening.  Many of them said it was like a movie.Another such moment occurs when another Ranger stops when he sees a hand sitting on the ground.  The movie literally stops when the soldier stops to pick up the hand and put it in his jacket, (I almost thought that something had gone wrong with the movie projector).  We learn later in the book that the hand was matched up back to the soldier who lost it.   Then there is Mike Durant,  the most memorable part of the original incident in 1993. The book gives more detail about him being held captive and how he was eventually released.  The movie merely supplies some post-script about his fate.There is some obvious foreshadowing at the beginning of the film,  and Capt. Steele,  trying to corral his troops,  goes against Hollywood type by showing his vulnerability.   The movie doesn't quite effectively show the Delta troops' influence on the Ranger's behaviour.  It is an important sub-context in the book.  Delta soldiers are trained to be very independent, and the Rangers are trained to stick together and go by the book.   My guess is that the Delta side of the story could not be told, since officially they are not allowed to reveal anything about themselves.  This is unfortunate,  because the movie could have done a better job in setting up the relationship between the Deltas and the Rangers.   It would give more depth to the clash between Capt. Steele and the Deltas later in the film.Those are my gripes,  but everything else Ridley Scott does is right on. Scott said he wanted to show things how they really happened,  good or bad. For that,  this movie allows the good guys to do not-so-good things,  and gives credence to the fact that the men in charge don't always make the right decisions.  Other than the wall to wall music,  the movie puts you right there,  with very few of those glitzy TV commercial style shots that Bruckheimer is infamous for.   I felt that futility and desperation of the lost convoy was less effective when the film jumped back and forth between them and the pinned down Rangers.  The lost convoy, as it reads in the book, is a trip into pure hell,  the reader wants to scream in horror as much as those that were there surely did.  By cutting away from convoy,  the audience gets a chance to escape,  where there was no escape from the hail of bullets and RPG's in real life.If you are trying to decide to see this film,  it is up to you whether you can handle the graphic violence,  and the somewhat one-sided point of view of the conflict.   If you can,  you will be rewarded with a gripping story, a thoughtful narrative,  and 2 hours and 20 minutes of film that will never leave you bored.  Few films have done that.",6,0,1,21 January 2002
The Hangover Part II," Urge to both swallow and spit out this sequel at the same time.
","It is easy palatable, following the same exact paradigm as the first film. A common analogy is comparing a movie to a roller coaster ride. Say 'Hangover' is one of several roller coasters, and it was the favourite one you tried. So, H2 is like taking your favourite roller coaster ride again, except instead of sitting up front you sit a couple cars back. This film has just about exactly the same beats as the first one, where the right audience would start saying 'Uh oh, I know what's going to happen' with great anticipation. The wrong audience would start saying 'Uh oh, I know what's going to happen' with little interest at all. Well, is the film funny? Are there different jokes than the first film? Yes, some of the new gags have alternative punch lines. Things like the monkey don't work as well. The group has chemistry as an ensemble, and you enjoy their bickering most of the time. One thing I remember fondly about the first film is that it kept our main characters normal. That aspect is what made the movie special, and here that same approach is used, but perhaps does not resonate as much at the end this time. The Thailand location is utilised well, with a little local flare.But I am still on the fence whether to recommend this carbon copy sequel. If it was so much fun the first time, why not jump on for another go 'round again? On the other hand the idea of 'Oh no, here we go again' should stop you dead in your tracks from ever visiting this sequel. Since I didn't stop watching once the obvious happened, I guess I will fall on the 'why not' side of the fence. But please, a THIRD sequel is just going through the motions.",6,0,1,21 January 2013
The Dark Knight," Epic movie-making
","This film is so huge, it would be best for me contemplate the story so soon after seeing it before submitting a review. One reason for the crowds is that now Heath Ledger will reach legendary status with this being his last film. That makes this film an instant classic. Nolan could have folded to the pressure of the hype, and somehow tripped up on this sequel. Indeed, it took a lot of effort to avoid the genre conventions when piecing this story together. One particularly applauds the addition of Aaron Eckhart, but also his character. They both have integrity and a larger-than-life persona that works with the rest of the acting troupe. Eric Roberts works well as a mobster, but Morgan Freeman has a pretty thin role this time around (and may get thinner). So much screen time is devoted to Harvey Dent that it takes away screen time of our main character. Even our main antagonist. This actually works in the film's favour, as overall, we get to see just enough of them after the 2 1/2 hour running time. The film is very aware of the backstory built-up in the first film, that means we need to see very little of Bruce Wayne's life. The Joker is very slowly revealed in the story, another intelligent approach, giving the audience just small tastes of the Hannibal-like appeal of a criminal-minded genius. This is a villain with a complexity unmatched in any comic book movie brought to the screen. Every time Joker does appear, you know something unpleasant is going to happen. It is very hard to discern the actor Heath Ledger with complete facial make-up and greasy hair. The intensity of Ledger is surprising, something no one but Nolan seemed to know when casting him, which originally had some people's head scratching. I agree an Oscar nomination would be warranted as much as Hopkins did in 'Silence of the Lambs'. If there any sequels with the Joker, the actor will have some very big shoes to fill.Next to the character the Joker, there is other good news. We get a wicked Bat Motorcycle, some large set pieces involving trucks, helicopters, and more trucks. We get a damsel in distress situation that shows this film has a dark side. The ending of the film, operatic in it's arc, leaves with a notion that we the audience should decide if we can really root for Batman, regarded by Gotham as a vigilante. You also wonder how you can top an event film like this. Everything is big in this film (partially shot in Imax), Hong Kong skylines and big shootouts. Also ever present is the loud soundtrack, especially with a large sound system at the Imax theatre I attended. The subwoofers had plenty of work, as each bullet fire, explosion, even Batman's voice, was full of bottom end. Punctuating these loud sections was a signature crazed cello piece (penned by Hans Zimmer), representing the Joker's fringe of sanity. My only complaint is a couple lapses in logic for the big finale, and the twitchy feeling that I was ready for the film to end just near the climax. Minor to say the least.",8,2,5,5 May 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Movie written backwards
","***MINOR SPOILERS***Such as Memento, this movie plays backwards. Charlie Kaufman, makes this backwards narrative important, although we don't realize it at the time. As Jim Carrey has his memory erased, he goes back farther toward the beginning of the relationship. This return to innocence is very touching. The brilliant script takes many of the Hollywood romantic notions and breathes new life into them, a very big challenge. There is a unique perspective when we get to see 'flashbacks' of their romance, but we are actually seeing Carrey 'awake' in his memories and trying to change them. There are the heartbreaking moments where Carrey realises all the good memories that are being erased, and wants to stop the process. The visuals are very dreamlike and are fun to watch. Had this story not been thoroughly explored and expertly executed, it would have come off dumb and been ignored.I have noticed very long and impassioned reviews about the romance and how the movie has caused the reviewers to think about their own relationships. This happened to me as well. This comes primarily from the unexpected ending where Carrey and Winslet have exposed their darkest thoughts about each other just as they are falling in love. I think Kaufman might have gotten the idea for this movie by posing this question. 'If you knew that a relationship would have many ugly moments, would you still go through with it?'. It carries a strong emotional impact as they confront the decision.So, in effect, we have a very Hollywood romantic notion that 'love is timeless'. That notion is aided by the excellent acting, especially by Kate Winslet, and the well crafted script. I am sure this script will easily get an Oscar nomination. I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,29 September 2004
Elysium," The Wailing Woman Cliché is Getting Old
","It has become such a cliché, that it is heavily featured in parody movies. The switch to slow motion as the tragedy unfolds and the soundtrack falls silent except for a single old woman wailing a sad song as if at a funeral. I'm not sure who started this phenomena, perhaps Ridley Scott. But it has been such a staple for action soundtracks in the last 20 years or so, to use it more than once during the course of the movie is to draw ridicule.I had a lot of problems with the sound design and the sound mix of this film. They tried to stuff every beat in the film with some unnecessary sound or line of dialogue that would have been better left unsaid. While I can appreciate the film not wasting our time and keeping the pace and energy going (take that, Wolverine), it was almost afraid to catch it's breath. To have one of these blockbusters actually star a talented actor in Matt Damon, they should have let him breath between action scenes a little, get inside his head a little more. Visit with his ex-girlfriend a little longer. A little more character development in that area would have helped the large gulps of story that we chase through on our way to the big space station.I was rooting for both the intelligence of Damon, who knows how to put some necessary humour into his character at the right time (take that, Pacific Rim). And my compliments to the producers for letting the film be a soft 'R' rated release, without a doubt lending better to realism amidst the dystopian future world (take that, World War Z). I think Sharlto Copley displayed far more depth and capability in being a dominating villain than the thin character that was drawn for him in this movie. He shows no consistent behaviour while deciding whether to kill Damon or not. But the delivery of his lines is so engaging, it is a delight to watch him do bad guy stuff.It is a less appealing story that normal Sci-Fi fantasies intentionally avoid, but Elysium tries to feel like a documentary about a third world country. You will probably hear some hoots in response to the over-pronounced delivery Jodie Foster gives, making her villainous character more annoying than interesting. As I tried to keep remembering I wasn't watching 'Oblivion', I was feeling satisfied in the attempt by the filmmakers to meet the audience's expectations. Other blockbusters recently having been lacking a soul as they rush through the by-the-numbers script clichés.I wish it was released before 'Oblivion', and perhaps this well made sci-fi action film might have felt a bit more fresh, and had not wasted my intelligence like that Tom Cruise vehicle did. On the other hand, would I have been invigorated by the exo-skeleton - fulfilling that 'Terminator' quotient? Or would the fatal injury of Damon's character fulfill that 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' quotient?-major spoiler aheadOr would I have been satisfied with the magic computer code saving the day - fulfilling that 'Independence Day' quotient? -major spoiler finished In the end I was thankful that the busy pacing got us through to the resolution in a 1 hour 49 minute runtime. It's just too bad that the theme of dystopian sci-fi has cluttered the 2013 movie calendar. It is hard to tell how this film would have stood out, especially with less of fulfilling Hollywood cliché quotas and less of that wailing woman.",5,1,2,18 August 2013
Grindhouse," Rodriguez = Homage / Tarantino = Art Piece
","Review of GrindhouseRodriguez = Homage / Tarantino = Art PieceIf you are a fan of both of types of film described above, then you will be satisfied. Both are done very well. But the Tarantino part is far less an homage to the scratchy Drive-in exploitation films you used to sneak to into as a kid. Terror Planet - the Rodriguez part - masterfully uses the elements of bad projection and jump cuts to add to the horror of this dark zombie flick. No question Rodriguez is at the top of his game, using all the nuances that go along with low budget horror films to heighten the entertainment. There is not one shot that doesn't represent an existing convention that began with the 70's genre. Even the absent-minded plot holes are gleefully butchered (why do cop cars just blow-up for no reason?). But far beyond loving homage, this is a well paced action film that visits all the facets of the genre in one great set piece after another. Josh Brolin is a standout in casting as a picture perfect B movie star, who nevertheless is an engaging character. For the second part, Tarantino pays far less attention to the technical elements of classic Drive-in movies. Instead, it is two sets of conversation pieces involving two sets of outgoing women. No doubt, Tarantino is very original when writing dialogue, that is definitely his strength. But after the rousing first half, I found myself yawning as Tarantino's wordy dialogue played out in real time. Whereas Rodriguez used jump cuts to speed through parts of the zombie tale, we 'grind' to a near halt as we sit around in a bar as hip chicks engage in girl-talk. Kurt Russell, the designated villain, has little depth. Then there is a second set of talky chicks who drop references to 'Vanishing Point' and 'Dirty Larry and Crazy Mary', as they have a showdown with Kurt Russell. Too much time is spent in adoration of the genre and the cars, instead of engaging in it. Indeed, by the second half of Tarantino's film, all the technical defects (scratches, jump cuts, etc), have completely disappeared. I found myself wondering if the big car chase and payoff at the end was worth the talky beginning 2/3 of the movie. Hey, I dig Tarantino sometimes, like 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill 1 & 2'. But I think sometimes he wallows too much in his own Tarantino-isms. This is the case with 'Death Proof'. If this is supposed to be a movie about people who are thrill seekers in nice old muscle cars, then how about an action movie featuring those cars instead of long scenes of just talking about them. However, if you look at the Ying Yang of this double feature, perhaps it is a good counter to Rodriguez' fast paced piece with a slow paced character piece. But you better be in the mood for it, honey, because you are in for the long ride with the girls, and it takes a while to get to the action. I can't say it was not well done, Tarantino deserves credit for his contribution, but I came for pulp exploitation, not for chit- chat.",6,9,17,6 April 2007
The Artist," This is the best film of 2012? Really?
","Audiences of late are being educated about life in the early part of last century with the very layered 'Boardwalk Empire'. Moreso, the scripting and characters are intricate and have a complexity that modern audiences expect in intelligent filmmaking these days. Here comes 'The Artist', a very simplistic and unadventurous throwback film. But really, even back then filmmaking was capable of complexity, like 'It Happened One Night'. Frankly, the story was so cliché and clunky, it felt like a film student's first screenplay. And the production was no more impressive than a stylised episode of 'Moonlighting'.I have been a fan of Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin's James Bond spoofs. And I expect great things ahead for both of them. I am certainly convinced that they will make better films than this, one that really might deserve an Oscar. This is not a bad film, but 'Citizen Kane' it is not. It really does not break any new ground, has slow character development, and the script at points felt repetitious. Although the photography adhered to 20's techniques, still some creativity could have been welcomed. Black and white photography can be stunningly beautiful. This film shows little flair despite being a bold period piece.So what is left is the music, and there is nothing either disappointing or epic about the soundtrack. Again, for such a film to draw attention to a different place and time, only to model itself as the cookie cutter film establishment circa 1920's, loses it's chance to add nuance and complexity. 'Boardwalk Empire' injects timely cultural nuance, along with the limitations and different mindsets of a less sophisticated time. Perhaps some reference to the silent comedy stars that suffered a similar fate (Charlie Chaplin was a silent film legend, but his comedy could not translate into talkies). In general, this film had a lot live up to when I walked into the theatre after winning so many accolades. There was nothing unique to this compared to other throwback films. It is not innovative in any way. They could have injected more subtle humour and less dog tricks (Disney has the silly dog film market covered). A bad Coen brothers film is better than this. I was surprised how little meat there was on the bone after sitting through it. Certainly a film like 'The Tree of Life' is a more memorable film from 2012. Heck, 'Moneyball' has a more intricacies to it and it's a baseball film. I am truly sorry I could not get into this film, and I will probably be considered someone who can't appreciate small art-house films. It depends, a small film with a great script will standout. This small film without a great script does not.",5,6,13,2 March 2012
Super 8," An unbalanced mix of Scary/Silly & Deep/Shallow
","There are some great moments near the beginning of this dense script where you feel that Spielberg Magic. Like Drew Barrymore in 'E.T.', Elle Fanning stands out as a young talent. When there is subtly in the storytelling of the coming-of-age dimension of this film, you feel grounded in a solid drama. Natural based humour around goofy teenagers works to start with. But then a way too convoluted conspiracy develops with no chance of making sense. Here is where the large wish list of ideas that Spielberg and Abrams dreamed up begin to dismantle the momentum that we the audience had invested in for the first 45 minutes or so. Gone now is the magic as a poorly written B-movie monster horror flick invades the town.'Strange' things begin to happen all over town with such over-the-top silliness and randomness that the storytellers make their fatal flaw. You throw so many 'mysterious' incidents at the audience with such succession that we no longer can keep track of what the clues are supposed to mean and begin to no longer care. Thankfully the mostly solid acting is able to drag you through the nonsensical military invasion going on in the town. We have the troubled father of Fanning's character Alice. At one point he has a deep emotional impact upon the backstory, but then is clumsily written into being involved with defeating the bad guys.There is a Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy to this movie. At one point you feel it could be a better take on an M. Night Shyamalan film take can convincingly bring terror into the domestic environment (like 'Sixth Sense'). Other times, it feels like a too silly to be taken seriously 'Goonies' type of adventure. Which brings us to the monster that is supposed to be the big scary killer lurking behind the scenes. (Not a spoiler here) It turns out the monster is too fake to be believable. There is 'Jurassic Park' inspired monster attack that makes up the final act that just does not have the same impact. Abrams' 'Cloverfield' was much better at creating a chilling dark creature that could make you jump. In that film there is a smaller insect-like alien that lurks in a subway that is genuinely terrifying. Nothing in 'Super 8' comes close to that level of chills. Which leaves only the thrills, and the train wreck that is a centerpiece of the film does a good job of it. The extended train disaster launches large train cars into the air at frightening speeds with monster sound effects as they crash and explode with summer popcorn movie splendor (especially in Imax).This movie gets a mild thumbs up for all the positive intentions of Abrams' script. He is a disciple of Spielberg, and it is good to see that other filmmakers can recreate the old school magic, as he does here literally by creating 1970's homages to Spielberg movies. This includes overlapping dialogue of hyper teenagers, sweeping crane shots of bicycles through middle class neighbourhoods, a John Williams style score, Vilmos Zsigmond style lensing, and attention to little details in the kids environment. All of this works well, and I applaud Abrams for displaying his knowledge of the Spielbergisms. Unfortunately that also includes the gimmicks that Spielberg adores so much. In the third act, all the characters become chess pieces as they race around to witness and discover some very implausible stuff that helps reveal the big conspiracy. By then however, there are large military trucks taking over the town, and eventually the lamest looking battle scenes that all but remove any subtlety that began so quietly at the beginning. Despite this, we are hauled through a great deal of relationship melodrama that feels like remnants of one of Abrams TV dramas. The second act gets especially bogged down in emotional situations that at that point do little but destroy the momentum of the impending danger of the sometimes forgotten monster on the loose.I give it a slightly favourable 6 out of 10 since there was nothing bad enough in the clunky storytelling that turned it into a Tony Scott-like embarrassment.",5,11,23,12 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Postcard Fairy tale
","When Edward Zwick made 'Glory', it was remembered at Oscar time because there were realistic performances that caused the movie to transcend from being merely a period drama or other typical war film.  His latest war drama uses broad brush strokes to depict this era.  Major characters in this film are drawn in a simplistic manner.  While this makes it easy to catch on whom everybody is, it leaves little intrigue.  Most of this film is predictable. However, I have a fascination with Japan, and this film presents many postcard shots of what we would expect Old Japan to look like. Too bad that the film was mostly shot in California, and relies heavily on computer effects.  Some of the effects were not quite there, (a formation of soldiers standing in a field 'jump' out of place, but nothing that I would complain about).  My biggest problem with this film is the convenient plot points that come about near the end of the movie.  No spoilers, but reality seems to be chucked out the window when it comes to some implausible heroics and romantic notions of political changes of heart.That being said, I enjoyed this movie, as if it were a classic stage production. Cinematography, production design, costumes, and makeup were very well done.  The cast does a great job portraying their symbolic characters.  The story moves along without plodding, although there were a couple moments near the end that I felt weren't worth the time. 
This movie is not as good as Zwick's 'Glory'.  In fact, it seems as though he needed to borrow one of the most powerful scenes from 'Glory' to add some spark to this movie.  He plagiarizes himself with a scene where a new recruit tries to load his gun while Cruise fires bullets at him.  Effective as that scene was, it was 'Glory 2'.  The music was superficial, with little ethnic influence.  As good as this film is, it isn't Oscar worthy.I give this film a 6.5 out of 10.",6,1,2,28 December 2003
How to Train Your Dragon," Gives you that Pixar feeling.
","The poorly titled animated adventure belies the simple boy meets dragon story as seen in trailers. This is a beautiful looking Viking epic, starting with an almost impossible opening sequence that juggles the introduction to all the characters, some jokes about viking life, all the while a huge dragon attack is taking place. As with any tentpole movie, effects or extravagant animated environments mean nothing if the story and characters aren't interesting. Here, our dragon trainer has a likable misfit nature that keeps the audience (both young and old) amused. That is one element usually missing in non-Pixar films. There are well formed characters throughout the ensemble, all of them showing personality and capable of generating good humour.I went to the 3D showing, and was not expecting much more than a cutesy tale of a boy training a dragon. To be sure the cutesy stuff is in there, certainly not shying away from giving dragons Disney-like big eyes and even purring like a kitten. What I was pleasantly amazed to find was that there is a lively Viking adventure that has a whimsical spirit. The Vikings come off as more than 2 dimensional, and the sweeping 3D shots give a great thrill ride around jagged cliffs. The central plot is a Vikings journey by boat to fight the dragons, and most of the obligatory love interest and bully subplots don't get in the way. Perhaps one could complain about plot holes in how a young kid disappears constantly without anybody connecting it with his new dragon training abilities. Several convenient plot points allow the story to whisk us along, wasting no moment on screen to move forward boy-trains-dragon, boy-meets-girl, and boy-rebels-against-society story arcs.If you can keep the audience entertained, then you can pull off the magic act of suspending disbelief, something harder to do with adults watching this type of animated fare, then you have achieved that Pixar feeling. One of the very few animated films not made by Pixar that have done this.7 out of 10.",7,1,3,11 April 2010
Sicario," Different Story Structure Creates Strong Tension
","This film is supposed to center on the FBI agent Emily Blunt being lured into an undercover drug operation. Her character represents the audience, and the screenplay toys with us (and her) hinting at larger things going on. With military interdictions on foreign soil, you will be reminded of recent films like 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'The Hurt Locker'. This film can be rightly called a suspense film more than a thriller, because you are given clues to what the real story is, but are only given bread crumbs of information along the way. This film has more emotionally based photography (by the great Roger Deakins), and a very selective point-of-view as we stick to our vulnerable main character.Emily Blunt, recently seen as a fierce and fearless warrior in 'Edge of Tomorrow' transforms herself quite believably to a competent but insecure law enforcement officer. The center of the real story is lead by Josh Brolin, who only needs to give you a wink and a smile to let you know that much more is happening, and frequently challenges Blunt to keep going along with the plan, even though the stakes are obviously getting higher.This is one of the better screenplays to be produced, where it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience (we know some kind of dark operation is going on). When danger comes to our main character, we are surprised as much as she is, being lulled into a sense of security. The screenplay seems to instinctively know at what point we need a piece of information to stay engaged. Benicio Del Toro, as always, threatens to steal the movie from our other like-able characters with his mannerisms and general mystique. The ensemble in general has plenty of moments to exert their influence. What is interesting about the structure of this film, is that it is setup to feel like an action flick, but instead finds nuance in the preparation for the big action moments more than the bang and booms usually associated with that type of film. As an outside observer, the photography floats and hovers around the edges, providing more of a glimpse of the meat of the scene. This type of photography wisely represents our main character, who eventually resorts to her own interpretation of what is going on, but struggles by being an outsider from having any control to what is going on.The screenplay creates a third act that is less about Blunt and more about Del Toro's character. What is great about the third act is that finally fleshes out who Del Toro really is, and is responsible for the fireworks that make up the climax. This can be surprising, because it doesn't involve Blunt's character at all. Which is fitting for the screenplay, since in order for it to succeed in maintaining unpredictability in regards to Blunt's exposure to danger, having her involved in the finale would remove that unpredictability. The music provides some good tension-building low tones. Although there are some grim images of violence, I would not consider this film as particularly violent, instead allowing the chatter of preparation and knowledge of the danger to fill the void.",6,0,0,5 February 2016
Jack Reacher," Does Not Rise Above the Chaff in this Crowded Genre
","With Tom Cruise attached to this straight genre film, I figured that there was an intelligent script that attracted him to the project. Alas, it feels more like just a paycheck film. This is a middle-of-the-road uninspired production with no real flair and no standout performance by Cruise. Most supporting actors fair even less. All due to a traditional character structure, with familiar subplots. Worse is the dumbed down exposition. Way too much time was spent spelling out this story, such as the unlikely match-up of the district attorney prosecuting while his daughter is defending the alleged sniper. If this was to be a truly intelligent thriller, the script would not have given some obvious clues to the audience early in the film. Nothing is original in this detective whodunit. Without giving anything away, the sniper's face is presented to the audience at the beginning of the film, and we see that in fact it is not the man arrested (and tortured) by the police.Tom Cruise is supposedly a man with a clean record, but takes part in vigilantism. His actions are very visible and seems to want to simultaneously hide and be very visible at the same time. So I felt confused as to what my expectations for this film were. It is certainly not a tough guy action film, even though it is written that way. There are only a handful of action set pieces involving a shoot-out or a car chase. It wasn't much of a whodunit since we are presented the villain in the opening scene. There are some adequate thriller elements. The real motive for the shooting does provide possibilities for intrigue, but this is mishandled. Which brings us to Werner Herzog, which other reviews acclaim as a enigmatic bad guy. I wasn't so struck by his persona. He certainly had a hard luck story that makes you cringe, but again goes nowhere.Rosamund Pike, the defense attorney, is supposed to be the possible love interest and foil for Reacher. After all, why would she waste time following around this loner who has no current credentials? And, Reacher admits that the defendant was capable of losing it. Here is another moment where the script could have soared. The film could have examined the questionable innocence of soldiers becoming mentally disturbed from fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq, where soldiers in real life snapped and went on shooting sprees. Instead, it plays it safe, turning our seemingly trigger happy defendant into a war hero because his shooting spree happened to take out some terrorists in disguise. This is way too convenient and telegraphs too much to the audience.My expectations were forced to be lowered at this point. Although is supposed to be a mystery where we are given dramatic clues and a trail of detection is spelled out, there is too little to chew on. Again, a smarter thriller would have interwoven a little more doubt into the motives of the characters. Maybe there was another motive behind the D.A.'s daughter working on the defense? Maybe another detective's motives could have been explained, and help me understand the fear in his eyes. All this seemed to be be heading to an obvious conclusion, and all we are left it is how entertaining is to get there. I like Tom Cruise, and although it is not cool to like him, he still can star in a blockbuster that bring in boxcars of cash. He succeeds by doing a fully expressed performance of Tom Cruise. I liked his mix of serious and goofy in the last Mission Impossible movie. I also liked the mix of superiority and vulnerability too. This is what is missing in the Tom Cruise in this film. His voice never switches into high pitch whine mode, his eyeballs don't start to bulge out in the face of danger. Instead he is man who is resigned to play out the tired bar fight as a demonstration of his badassness (yawn).This film fails on many levels trying draw the audience into the mystery, and any sense of danger only comes to a half-boil. I think it was a mistake to make Reacher so invincible. One scene that is prominently featured in the movie trailer is a moment where Reacher tries to hide from a police dragnet by mixing in with a crowd. I honestly find that highly unlikely. If you witnessed someone fleeing a high speed chase, would your first instinct be to help him? Especially without knowing anything about this man? He could have just murdered a bunch of people. That made no sense at all, but looks good in a trailer.I am left to believe the main interest for Tom Cruise to appear in this run-of-the-mill film was so he could recreate his own 'Bullitt' car chase. In fact there are some identical moments between the car chases, include sideswiping, and of course the distinctive sound of a big block engine. I certainly am not urging them to make this into a franchise.",5,14,32,21 December 2012
Thor," Clunky Sections makes this a Minor Addition to Superhero Genre
","I will hand it to Kenneth Branagh, he knows how to put energy into a film. I was able to stay engaged for most of the action pieces, despite the horrific and clunky Earth scenes. A ragtag trio of scientists befriend the misplaced Thor, and nothing special happens as they seem to be stuck in a fake looking movie set that is supposed to resemble a small town in New Mexico. Spoiler Alert:It is no surprise the small town is destroyed in the big climax, cars flip through the air Michael Bay style, and buildings explode.End Spoiler Alert. Credit the producers for keeping this film in the tent pole mold, delivering the goods for a lesser hero than the other bigger comic book icons. However, for the Asgard world, there were some large crowd scenes, and rainbow bridge effects shots that looked blurred as though to cover how unfinished they looked. I do not know the comic books, and judge this upon what new aspect this incarnation can bring to the screen. The cast is well versed, and the hero, Chris Hemsworth fits the uniform convincingly. The Earth scenes once again take a turn into B-movie territory, finding absolutely stupid material to waste time on. The story gets points for not getting too cliché, but loses major points for lapses in logic and unrealistic actions taken by major characters. Say for instance the government agent from SHIELD. He seems to have little security or authority to control anything. Nothing the government is doing, or Natalie Portman's physics experiment for that matter, is adequately explained. Almost as if the Earth portion of the film was made by a different director, all the story and logic makes much more sense in Asgard land. Although there are character twists, there are few double or triple twists that spin out of control in other tent pole films. In fact, there is some resolution with the mythic characters that resonate with the audience. Credit that as well to the music soundtrack, fulfilling a much needed role in wall-to-wall operatic drama. But then there is the editing. It is sometimes a little too frantic, perhaps needing to take a breath more often. There is a 'Lord of the Rings' type battle that opens the movie and shows the different tricks the big hammer weapon can do. Alas, no other action scenes in the movie top this big battle, leaving me almost let down, but not actually feeling disappointed. But the fun hammer moves we are teased with in the first act, only briefly return in the third act, and it feels too little too late.Despite the minor missteps in the premier of yet another possible superhero franchise, one must applaud the correct performances elicited by Branagh to pull off the mythical world. One only wishes Branagh was equally adept at eliciting down-to-Earth performances as well.",5,0,2,6 May 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Worth repeated showings
","My first impression during the first part of the movie was 'where is the non-stop action?'.  Instead we are given about a half an hour of exposition. New characters, the city of Zion, grumblings about Morpheus, life with the wife and kids.  I guess the Wachowski's felt it was necessary to flesh out the world that was first introduced in the first Matrix.  I am also sure that part 3 will be all about Zion and the characters we have just met.  So keep it in your back pocket.  Once the action begins, it carries you through most of the movie.  It FELT like the movie began to drag everytime a philosophical discussion began. Being a philosophy nut myself,  I would've been ok with it, except the discussion was drawn out too long and sometimes was somewhat incomprehensible  'Some things change, some things do not'  (what?).  But I feel confident that I will eventually be able to figure it out watching it again.  So that is what I came out of this movie thinking.  I will probably like it better the second time, now that I have overcome my anticipations and can settle in and accept what the movie has to offer.  Nevertheless, the philosophy could have been simplified and trimmed down to keep the dialogue scenes from dragging as much as they seemed to. So enjoy the terrific special effects, TRY to understand the dialogue, and then watch it again to really comprehend it all.  I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,15 May 2003
Mystic River," Plot mystery unfair to audience
","**MAJOR SPOILERS**This review focuses on the tricky screenplay and the end results,  so please don't read this if you intend to see the movie.I waited for this to come out on DVD and I'm glad I did.  Given that the acting and direction are terrific,  but the story for this film left me disappointed.  No doubt,  the movie has been set up as a mystery.  Did Tim Robbins kill Sean Penn's daughter or not?  The initial suspicion I had early in the movie was correct.  The plot is actually quite convoluted and takes advantage of too many far out coincidences.  But going into the third act, I felt cheated into being able to intelligently dissect what the answers are.  Out of the blue,  two side characters seen only a couple minutes throughout the film,  given no foreshadowing,  become the prime suspects. One thing that nags at you throughout the entire film is what possible motive Tim Robbins had for killing his best friend's daughter?  But, in order to sell the idea,  they have him in the same bar as her,  have him leaving the same time she did,  Tim kills someone the same time she is murdered,  then later starts to become wacko in order to get us to believe that he would confess killing her to Sean.  Why would Tim lie to his wife about killing a mugger instead a child molester?    What difference would it make?  When the very apt Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne follow leads,  we are not given any hint of who the real perps are,  until minutes away from our surprise climatic ending. I felt short-changed in that respect,  where I invested nearly two hours of clues to come up with my guess at the ending,  only to have brand new information toss it out the window.  Of course,  movies aren't required to follow rules,  and sometimes it works to make the audience work a little bit to figure things out.  But here,  we are not given a fair chance.  Perhaps that was the point of the movie,  to change it from a perceived mystery into a character study. But I don't buy it.  Yes, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins,  along with the excellent dialogue and direction, deserve the critical attention it received.  But how about the movie audience,  we don't get our reward for investing our interest in the characters.",Null,0,0,11 June 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Starts fresh but ends stale
","'Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. 'Swingers' was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently, we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet, there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted, when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series 'The Sopranos', which also juxtaposes violence with humour. You can only allow so much humour before you start to lose interest, and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples, and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes, while technically well executed, become tedious. I was rooting for this film, because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter cliché action scenes. 'Bourne Identity' had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters, but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.By the third act, my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long, because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and ½ hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped, thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD.",6,46,94,10 June 2005
War of the Worlds," See it for the Effects, Enjoy the Ride
","I am always eager for Spielberg to 'wow' movie audiences again in creating big movie moments, last seen with 'Jurassic Park' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. One thing that bothered me about the making of this film was the rush to production, and merely months to create a huge blockbuster that could normally take a year. My fear was that some special effects could look unfinished, or the film editing not quite refined. My guess is that every last hour was exhausted getting this film in the can, and some parts of the film are unbalanced. But first the fantastic news, the special effects, which there are aplenty, are definitely up to snuff. Although, there were quite a few feathered matte lines associated with very active camera shots filled in with ominous clouds. There is a fun 'circling the van' set piece that resembles a few CGI intensive car commercials. My guess is that the only really thing in that shot besides the actors were the seats they were sitting on, and the rest of the van was photo-real CGI. This film really is another feather in the cap for ILM, able to conjure clouds, fire, water, as well as creepy aliens. One thing for sure, this is the film I really wanted to see when I was lured into seeing Shylaman's 'Signs' (see my review). We get a great revisit of ILM's great achievements. A recreation (or perhaps borrowed to save time) of the 'water tentacle' from 'Abyss'. The fearsome cloud effects seen originally in 'Twister'. Then the velociraptors that stalked in 'Jurassic Park'. Spielberg also pushes the amusement park ride by defying logic and allowing our main characters to be literally inches away from every battle and massacre that occurs within driving distance. But the script and story seem to get lost. In the first half of the movie, we feel the terror quite effectively by witnessing very widespread death and destruction. But the second half lacks momentum, as Cruise and his kids lose focus and can't quite spell out their plans. The relentless fight for survival in the first half is replaced by darkness and depression, instead of hope and determination. The scattered second half is what I feel could've been tightened up with a little more time for refinement. I'm not spoiling too much by saying that the last part of the film takes place in a single basement, and loses it's earlier large scope. The expectation is for this dark creepy basement to give you the whillikers, but after a while I felt like I would rather take my chances and run away instead of hangout in some creep's cellar. I also think a tighter script would have produced other poignant moments if they were fleshed out better. A few more side characters would've added depth. A few less family quarrels would've prevented being a turn-off for audiences. 'Close Encounters' maintains that balance, again with the added depth of some side characters. In other words, Spielberg has his cake but does not get to eat it too. He gives us great eye candy, but it is hard to swallow the human side. But in this case, I don't care. Having spent a while to think about WOTW, weighing the good parts with the average parts, I feel about 80% satisfied. I rank it better than 'Minority Report', but not as groundbreaking as 'Jurassic Park'. As far as supplanting the 1950's version as the new classic? Of course not.",7,1,6,29 June 2005
"Hail, Caesar!"," Classic or Formula Coens is in Eye of the Beholder
","The Coen brothers have been making their style of movies for long enough now that they have a definitive formula to their screenplays. Everything therefore is gauged in your appreciation of their formula. Many claim to have spotted a trend of classic followed by a dud. I have not paid that close attention to that phenomena, but I judge by my own reaction: was I entertained?, was I drawn into the story? Everyone may have their own list of favourite Coen bros films throughout the years, and there may be certain attachments beyond the quality of the filmmaking that can be attributed to that.For instance, I found 'Fargo' to be a simple tale with a B-movie budget, with the Coen's tapping into an obvious well for humour - the quirky behaviour and language of Minnesotans.'Miller's Crossing', on the other hand, is such a well layered piece of scriptwriting that it deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence with 'Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'.'Barton Fink' I have a bias against since I knew for a while that this script was born out of exhaustion when the script for 'Miller's Crossing' was taking so long. It feels like a half-baked attempt at finding nuance while hoping to get a green light by throwing horror into the second half.I'm sure I have already caused disagreement with other Coen bros fans. 'Barton Fink' has a legion of critics who say it's one of their best works. Which brings us to the too lightweight 'Hail, Caeser!'. Right off the bat - where is George Clooney? Sure, he is kidnapped, but that shouldn't limit his screen time to a few poignant pieces of dialogue with his captors. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, which is really only a cameo. She is talked about more off-screen than is seen on-screen.I thought many critics would be comparing this film to 'My Favorite Year', where a big movie star disappears, and a studio employee is responsible for finding him and returning him back for the big finale. The era for that film is the golden age of television. This is a slightly older period, but nevertheless the script is a series of set pieces meant to highlight movie-making of the early 1950s. What actually brought me out to the theatre to witness this on the big screen was Roger Deakins' cinematography; only to be denied a proper showing with a dim bulb and fuzzy out-of-focus image.This film is a series of set pieces, kind of stitched together through the Capitol Studio lot, with James Brolin being the ringleader. Here I was not sure what to make of Brolin's character. Is it a complaint that he was too normal (too human)? There are other set pieces that are close to slapstick, including Clooney's character, which kind of betrays the tone with the more serious Brolin and his tender wife. With other films taking the film-within-a-film motif to a greater degree, I felt the characters had too few layers, and hence a little less satisfying.But then again, a lightweight Coen bros film is still astute in fleshing out dialogue and finding an offbeat subject that has a sense of individuality. With some setpieces finding true smile-inducing characters with appealing antics (Alden Ehrenreich performs lasso tricks!), and a briskly paced day-in-the-life of the motion picture studio, this film still has much more to offer than other similar attempts (puts the over-rated 'The Artist' to shame).I am writing this review having just watched it, and perhaps it would be more fair to let this movie settle in my mind before deciding whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. On the one hand, the editing room scene feels like classic Coens. But on the other hand, attempts to build tension don't connect in the climax. There certainly is a split between critics and audiences in finding the love for this outing. Almost the same complaint was made about the flawed 'Tomorrowland' which was supposed to feature George Clooney prominently, only to disappear for the first 40 minutes or so of the film. In this case, our likable gruff, Mr. Ocean Eleven, is dressed both in character and in costume for a larger scope adventure, instead literally is parked in a chair for almost the entire film. So for that I was disappointed. James Brolin, who had the right tone and was a lot more intriguing in the recent 'Sicario', is a little too normal for this film, and he is the main character. With a star studded cast and a story that jumps around a lovingly recreated early 1950s Hollywood, it is hard to get emotionally involved with any of the main characters, so the final determination I suppose comes down to - was I entertained? I would say, just barely, making this a more mediocre outing than other heightened Coen worlds that are preserved in the pantheons of the critical mass. On the other hand, on a cold February afternoon that a Minnesotan like me decides is better spent inside a movie theatre, I felt I got my money's worth.",6,2,4,13 February 2016
American Gangster," Not the best of Denzel, Russell, or Ridley
","I love director Ridley Scott, but this was not my favourite from him. I love Denzel Washington, but I felt that this was not his best film. I love Russell Crowe, but this wasn't a juicy role for him. I love gangster films, but this was not my favourite.So what can I say about a film that sometimes looks like a Harlem Sopranos, or has cliché TV announcer exposition through the early 70s. What stands out in this film that makes it unique? The story of Frank Lucas is kind of well known. Denzel is great in the role. Crowe is almost exactly in the era and location to be Serpico. No car chases, but otherwise has a 'French Connection' quality to it (including a key scene). Did Ridley Scott want to de-emphasise production style for pedestrian docudrama? Did this movie not try hard enough to show a unique view of a well worn genre?I say.. guilty. Although competent acting gives this a positive rating from me, I can't recommend it for much else. Therein lies another drawback, the 2 1/2 hour running time. Something I believe is unjustified for - once again - lack of depth, in what we are supposed to feel for all involved. When Michael Mann makes a 2 1/2 hour movie ('Heat', 'Insider' with Crowe), I am drawn in through the third act. Here, it was not gripping me. So go for the stars, but don't expect to feel much pull into the material.",5,13,23,16 November 2007
The Good Shepherd," Would've Been Better as a Mini-Series
","I had heard in reviews that there was not much action in this study of a man who kept his life a secret. I also read that the tone of this film was akin to 'Smily's People', a famous mini-series about spying during the cold war. While watching this lengthy history of Ed Wilson and the CIA, I was disappointed how it seemed each setup cutaway before we could really absorb what was going on. Then I realised the problem, this should have been a mini- series. The essential problem was trying to cover such a huge amount of history, but forced to stay focused on our main character. This caused the screenplay to hack off the meat of the material just to be able to follow the single arc of Mr. CIA. At the very least, we should've been given more background to the supporting players. Also, even though it is certainly accurate how his wife was alienated, it made for repetitive and depressing screen time. I think one mistake was casting such a mega-star with so much luggage and such huge lips. It made it impossible for me to buy Angelina Jolie as the wife, it would have been better to cast someone a little less well known. So I have many major complaints about this film, but only that I wish the screenplay was structured to supply more depth into what the heck Wilson was doing, and less into an uninteresting domestic life that goes nowhere. We are shown more than enough to get it. Also, in this day and age of much gripping portraits of the underworld ('Syriana'), this approach of 'less-is-less' film-making is a couple decades out of date.Update 9/6/2012: Showtime is now developing this movie into a series. Thanks for taking my advice!",4,1,3,23 May 2007
Arrival," Part 'Contact' Part 'Interstellar'
","It is very hard to find some new angle when it comes to Aliens. You leave it a director with a vision, top notch actors, and a decent budget. But it still depends on story, again what's the new angle? You may remember that 'Contact' and 'Interstellar' had a daughter who gets messages from outside our world. Both movies intertwine the daughters life experiences with the plot line. Now comes our protagonist's daughter, Hannah, who lives in the memories of Amy Adams, the mother. I instantly knew the flashbacks that show the daughter alive before her fatal disease at the beginning of this movie would be relevant later in the film. The main complaint is not the story so much as not enough layers that one would hope an intelligent looking film like this could portray. More layers, but not TOO many layers, like Interstellar was guilty of. It just felt like the second act, a threat of force against our visitors, was kept at a slow cook. Same with the slow revelations as communication with the aliens is developed.Here is the good news. I complained a few years ago that in recent Hollywood movies aliens is aliens is aliens. In other words, there was nothing mystical (or scary) about the aliens after being depicted multiple times in multiple movies over time. Does anyone remember 'The Arrival' with Charlie Sheen? That was 1996, the CGI aliens looked fake, and were nothing close to being scary. So credit Denis Villeneuve for taking care in making these aliens frightening. A suggestion I made in my review of 'Cowboys and Aliens' is that they should make the aliens have some kind of supernatural influence on people, Twilight Zone freaky. The remake of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' gave the alien some control of a guy's brain waves. That was cool. Here the slow discovery of the alien's language has a nice twist to it, but the story has little else at that point.I felt like saying to the filmmakers at that point in the second act, 'Okay, something exciting better happen now'. The threat of using force by a couple other countries gives some urgency in getting Amy Adams to find out the purpose of the aliens visit to Earth, which has been benevolent so far. Ominous music, and other hints seem to warn the audience that these aliens can overpower us puny humans. The supporting characters should be more substantial to help create some depth. Jeremy Renner for instance doesn't seem to have a lot to say, even though he supposedly is one the country's most brilliant scientists. Otherwise Amy Adams has no friends and has little to hang her emotions on.So finally the third act tries to put it all together, slowly. I mention 'Interstellar' because in that movie the daughter became the connection to the 'answer' in that movie. Without getting into spoilers, you may find the big resolution not very spectacular. I really enjoyed the idea that consciousness could evolve and advance our world after contact with aliens. It just doesn't resonate as much with such a simple and personal answer. I also mention 'Contact', because the female protagonist develops her own special connection in deciphering the alien's language.I have really been enjoying the smart and intelligent 'Black Mirror' series of films. They are like an extended TV episode, where there is only room for a simple story, and can be explored fully in the shorter amount of time. Arrival probably would have been better as a 'Black Mirror' episode, and the slower second half of the film tightened up as a result. I would ultimately recommend this film, with a warning this is not a special effects spectacular, but a more of a suspense film. The filmmakers successfully make these aliens feel dangerous that we don't really know the outcome.",6,1,8,13 November 2016
The Conjuring," No Frills Basic Scary Movie
","This is a film specifically formulated to provide the fun scares without creeping you out too much. Hardly an 'R' rated film, it uses all the basic tenets to give you the chill up your spine that you came for. But not much else. I was getting a little concerned how often horror films turn to young girls for all the very adult scares. In this case there are 5 daughters to get molested by the devil. Supposedly, all the events in this film really happened. If so, it is utterly coincidental that all the trappings necessary to make a creepy horror film are provided. The rickety old house out in the creepy looking woods. The family unable to leave the house after the hauntings begin. The vulnerable young kids. The self-slamming doors. The creepy cellar. And so on.It is entirely understandable why this was released as a summer film. The pacing and the camera-work made the film approachable to mainstream audiences perhaps looking for a amusement park attraction, the haunted house ride that has a ugly old lady with smeared makeup ready to surprise you around the corner. No different than the basic tenets a summer action film provides, 'The Conjuring' has competent acting and good storytelling.Minor Spoiler ahead Just don't expect the obligatory extra shock at the end when the movie deceives you into thinking all is well. Or expect any greater fireworks once we get to the Exorcist vs. the Devil confrontation.Minor Spoiler finished. But nevertheless fulfills the necessities to get you to jump or squirm in your seat. Not a classic of the genre, but puts in the extra effort to give us the goods without making us groan.",5,1,3,25 August 2013
Paths of Glory," A Early Masterpiece by the Genius Filmmaker
","It seems amazing the jump in scope and complexity from Kubrick's previous film 'The Killing' and this landmark motion picture. The competency in direction - acting, staging, pacing, editing, and of course the pristine cinematography. It seems it was made by a director with many more years of experience. As many people involved with the project knew, this film would be remembered through time. Based on a real incident, it reflected the change in sentimentality of how soldiers were being used as human waves, where it was acceptable to allow for a certain percent of casualties. This disregard for human life is eloquently displayed with a series of scenes the demonstrate the futility of war. From the miserable trench conditions, to the fighting for mounds of dirt, to the blind military strategy that merely repeats failed attacks, to the absurdity of threatening death as punishment as part of the 'rules' of war. Partly what makes this such a timeless statement is the fact it was banned in many countries, because of the possible explosive anti-military sentiments it may have provoked.Sadly, this film was ignored by the Academy Awards, there are many aspects of the film that are excellently executed. Primarily is the lean script. Clocking in at 88 minutes, each exchange by the great cast is sharp and poignant. The intriguing audacity of executing your own soldiers during a war creates meaningful contradictions. A Colonel wants 3 men shot for cowardice, as a representation of each group. Why not kill all the soldiers if they are all accused of cowardice? And what real incentive does it give the other soldiers to go on to a battlefield and be killed or stay in your trench and be killed? These dilemmas are intelligently staged with a crisp pace that successfully develops sympathy from the audience. Part of what makes the casting great is the use of actors that have distinctive characteristics that present more of the human side of facing death.I don't think anyone will deny the artistic freedom of using American actors as French soldiers. Or the fact this 1916 period piece has distinctly modern dialect and frank honesty about religion, military power, and what the definition of true patriotism is. Even better is that these subject matters are cleanly addressed with not one moment feeling like a dry debate. Rarely do these confrontations occur sitting down, the body language and use of space creates a dynamic that feels heavily thought out and rehearsed. The locations are exquisite. Ironically, the locations were filmed in a castle in Germany. All the characters in this film are well drawn and a joy to watch when sparring against each other. Kirk Douglas particularly savours his juicy scenes of disdain and rebellion. George McCready is the antagonist, and speaks with a lofty prima donna delivery that makes him all that more detestable.This film succeeds on all levels, it has great action scenes but has a moral message. It has unpleasant confrontations with death but is still beautiful to look at. The subject matter is serious yet very entertaining. It achieves the classification of a film masterpiece because of the ability of the filmmaker to encapsulate the heart of the story with only a few scenes (the entire film plays out over the course of 2 days) with well honed dialogue and an active camera.",7,1,2,28 November 2013
X-Men: First Class," Dense drama is this summer's blockbuster to beat
","Comparisons can be made to Christopher Nolan's reboot of Batman, where scripting and story are refined and the genre is examined. Commonly in these types of films there are scenes of obligatory rivalry, villainy, comedy, exposition, where the dialogue is clunky and the scenario is cliché. A good example of this is the movie 'X Men Origins: Wolverine'. A good measure of a bad script is when your characters end up in a bar. The bar is the place you write your characters when you don't have any original ideas. To my memory, there are only a couple very brief scenes in a bar in XM:FC. And these sparse bar scenes are for mainly for comedic gain.This dense origin script knew what central themes it was examining before it set about to make action sequences. In other words, action scenes don't exist just for the sake of action. Characters have motivations that drive the action. The only place I might fault the storyline is trying to embed itself into the Cuban Missile Crisis. The antagonist seems to have free access to anywhere and can somehow easily convince the powers that be to instigate nuclear war. Fortunately, it doesn't matter since Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. I have never been a big fan of Kevin Bacon, but he shines in certain moments, like in 'Mystic River' or 'Animal House'. Here he is allowed to be creepy in a very convincing way, almost making the extra aspect of possessing special powers unnecessary.Although there is much buzz about Michael Fassbinder (I raved about him myself in my review of 'Inglorious Basterds'), I was impressed by the performance of James McAvoy. He takes on the persona of a younger Sherlock Holmes. He is convincing when he puts his fingers to his temple in order to project his mind. This type of activity could easily come across as silly if not approached properly. The Magneto character without much surprise is as strong as Darth Vader in screen presence. The audience almost trembles as Magneto occupies the screen, ready to get angry at his past.One thing about this tentpole film is that it resembles the original X Men film, where emphasis was placed on character instead of action. Both these films have limited action sequences. It is actually refreshing to not require some over-the-top CGI to have a good time during the summer blockbuster season. Case in point is the noisy 'Transformers 2', where it was just meaningless nonstop destruction. The director Matthew Vaughn infused elements of his strong film 'Kick Ass' into XM:FC. There are scenes where teenagers work out together their issues, sometimes not knowing if their choices are the right answer. Teenage struggles work as a metaphor with having special powers. They struggle with their identity, deal with sexuality, and personal appearance. It takes very dedicated script writing to flesh out the large number of characters being juggled around in this story. Much credit must go to the screenplay writer, even though Bryan Singer wrote the story.The music by Henry Jackman is hardly original, it borrows heavily from the memorable soundtrack of 'Inception', including the use of guitar to add texture to the pulsing strings, etc. Perhaps big summer films require the wall-to-wall bombastic music to carry the momentum, and I won't deny it works. But you sometimes wonder if this is a situation where the editor puts temp music in, in this case 'Inception', and the director gets married to it. This diminishes the ability for the soundtrack composer to come up with something unique. It even sounds like Jackman hired Johnny Marr again to do the guitar.As for the direction, there is a lot that could have gone wrong. There is a fine balance with story pacing. You want to keep the momentum going without losing the beats necessary to establish emotion. Again, this is done to perfection in Nolan's Batman series. In XM:FC the intelligence of the main characters comes across with very competent acting. So Vaughn should be commended for getting good performances from his cast. I expect to see this film again, primarily because it has so many characters with their arcs, that I need another viewing to take it all in. All the mutants introduced in this film are given situations that are explored. The special effects are top notch, except for a couple iffy wide shots, but they are not distracting. Speaking of not distracting, I am glad the producers didn't try any hokey 3D conversion for this flick.",7,2,5,3 June 2011
The Wolverine," Slow Pacing and Detached Hero Underwhelms
","I already gave this movie bonus points for daring to be small and actually shoot some scenes on location in Japan. It dawned on me how the X-Men franchise went the opposite direction as the Avengers. X-Men began as an ensemble then broke the characters off (Magneto and Xavier as part of X-Men first class & the first Wolverine). Avengers introduced the main players on their own before combining them. The problem with the X-Men franchise is that the Wolverine character on it's own leaves something to be desired. It feels like The Wolverine set out to be the antithesis of the standard super hero movie. But I think they swung the pendulum a little too far the other way. I fault the motivations of Wolverine in this smaller film. He is supposed to be always gruff and not interested in helping anyone. But he is somehow convinced to go to Japan based on a man he helped 60 years ago but never maintained contact. I think he should have been someone a bit more deeply connected to Yashida and his life was in danger, not just a visit to his deathbed. I don't require a summer film to be non-stop action, but the pacing in this film still could use some spark. The time spent setting up the characters in Japan is too sedate. You can spark the story along by learning about these characters while taking action. I think of the pacing in the Bourne movies. Wolverine's exposure to the Yakuza threat should have been through confrontation, not exposition by his designated sidekick. The slow cooking plot is just not tautly edited to create any real momentum. The story itself lacks any real surprises, and Wolverine's tepid involvement just gave the whole movie an emotional detachment. I will credit the female lead, Tao Okamoto, as being both attractive and a credible actress. I found her somewhat a sympathetic character, but in the end, the clumsy setup didn't allow her important opening scene to transpire with the gravitas the movie wanted. I think of the gravitas thrust upon us in the latest Bond film 'Skyfall', and it all seems to come back to Wolverine's detachment with Yashida, the person he dispassionately is supposed to say goodbye to on his deathbed. We needed another scene after the exciting Nagasaki bomb sequence, where Wolverine and Yashida bond after saving his life. I was thinking perhaps Yashida taught martial arts to Wolverine and we see Logan for once have a home (playing into the whole Samurai and Master relationship). Maybe a subsequent flashback where Logan parts ways with Yashida, perhaps over a dispute that could resonate in the present day. So much more punch was possible in the storytelling. Alas, there is generic exposition, despite the attractive oriental setting. As for the new mutants, I found the sidekick Yukio a lame mutant, but a terrific character nonetheless. Straight out of Tarantino's fun 'Kill Bill Part 2' or Rodriguez's 'Sin City', the innocent schoolgirl with deadly fighting skills made her by far the most interesting character in the film. Her supposed special talent is to foresee someone's future. But yet she never demonstrates that ability. The other is the actual villain of the movie, Viper. She is an intense young woman who can blow poison gas, or train insects to burrow into your heart, or something. Her evil powers were pretty lame as well. As for Yashida, the industrialist who wants immortality, that also seems half-cooked. The third act throws in some special effects that frankly seem out of place for a film that quite deliberately made a point of NOT being that type of film. The pacing of this film should have taken more of a Bourne approach, and let Wolverine show a little more empathy for other humans, instead of wallowing in his depression of Jean Grey. Wolverine could have been like the new Bond in his motivations, and not perpetually detached.I'd wait for the DVD.",4,2,6,5 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Mixed Feelings for Third Outing
","Let's face it, the Joker was always the best villain, and it is difficult for any other villain to fill those shoes. I had high expectations for this movie that I think never could be met. There might be other issues I have with this movie that may have been more my mood than how good the story was. There was a sense of too much layering on perhaps a story with too many plot points. Then there is long second act, where Batman takes a leave of absence, where we are required to spend time with our other new characters. Sadly, Michael Caine is missing for most of the film this time around, but at least he handles the heavy stuff really well when he's on screen. Anne Hathaway did not seem like an obvious choice for Catwoman, and frankly I still believe some other actresses could have been more catlike. I have always recognised Hathaway as a capable actress, and find her quite attractive. I just can't buy her being tough, sorry. I thought Commissioner Gordon's character was underwritten in this film. The newcomer that had a lot of stuff to do, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, seemed to be written as a way to connect the dots as the big spectacle is slowly pieced together.As I patiently waded through all the details of the big city takeover, I was thinking that this feels like a Tom Clancy novel, which spends a great deal of time, sometimes an agonisingly long time, building up to the big spectacle. I felt as long as the details they are throwing at me are plausible, I will go along with it. The thing that was nagging me throughout was Tom Hardy playing the type of villain that looks like a wrestler from WWF. Maybe the Rock. Hardy is just not menacing enough. A big component of The Dark Knight has always been the Hans Zimmer bombastic score, which had some amazing finesse for the 2nd film. Here, there really wasn't any signature theme I could latch on to. In fact, as the third act continued on with a lot of running around, it felt like the score was doing some extra heavy lifting in order to carry the momentum. Sorry to say, but it almost going into Michael Bay territory.I am still trying to decide how much I liked the finale, and whether it was worth all the buildup. This is where the less you know the better, because frankly that is all the film has going for it. Director Nolan and his screenwriter brother probably talked about resonance when building the character's backgrounds, but they dug a little too deep I think. What they probably felt would be a poignant twist to a main character, turns into something too far fetched (even for a superhero movie). The character's twist could have been something less directly attached to the villain, and slightly more plausible. The places where the film felt a little bloated is when it tried to get political (didn't we all learn that lesson from George Lucas?). There are places where the dialogue concerns stocks and assets and takeovers, and so on. The 2nd film avoided all of that.I will recommend this film, because as an event film it will be hard to avoid anyway. However, in comparison to the other juggernaut release of summer 2012 - 'The Avengers', TDKR didn't have a lot of excitement to the plot and a villain that did not match up to other villains.",6,7,16,20 July 2012
Mother!," 'The Guest Who Wouldn't Leave' meets 'Rosemary's Baby'?
","My conjecture at what this movie is about is a question mark because I wonder even if the filmmaker knows what he has concocted. Above all else, you will have a hard time predicting what will happen next in this nightmare movie. You get the impression about midway that this film is playing upon a woman's fears after just getting married and later having children. It provides nightmare images from her point of view throughout, giving you a strong feeling that Jennifer Lawrence is just on some heavy meds. It is hard to recommend this movie on it's face. It runs long, has some rather repetitive story moments, and provokes flat out laughter at some of the directions the story takes. One thing for sure, don't try to make sense of it. Jennifer Lawrence is a newlywed fixing up a creaky old house for her poet husband Javier Bardem. Bardem is well cast, because it's hard to read a guy who although seemingly well-intentioned, has a foreign demeanor. Hence the Rosemary's Baby connection. The husband has an agenda that leaves the wife all to her lonesome. But then, a guest arrives. Then his wife. Then his two sons. Then other friends. It is like a Monty Python sketch. By the third act, this absurdity caused laughter to ring through the auditorium. Something I wonder if Director/Writer Darren Aronofsky really intended. What makes this movie watchable is the guessing game about whether the REAL freaked out person is Lawrence or Bardem. Lawrence is seen taking some kind of medication (or is it a potion?). We get some Lynchian imagery that suggests the house is alive(?!). Bardem becomes withdrawn as he suffers from writer's block.There are fun moments along this creepy kooky ride, and only starts to drag near the end. I think some of the story could have been condensed, and find our way to the inexplicable explanation a little sooner. I guess what I am really ultimately trying to conclude is whether the director has a method to his madness, or just wants to toss together a bunch of unnerving scenes that play like your nightmare's greatest hits. Such as going to a formal gathering in your pajamas. Or someone taking your newborn baby and letting him get handled by an unruly mob. Or getting assaulted yourself. Much attention is paid to the creepy old house. Perhaps it is only a manifestation of Lawrence? Or Bardem? Or his admirers that find God in his poetry? The ending only seems to partially explain. Perhaps also deliberately not revealing everything. Perhaps the director was just finding a bunch of annoying things that a self-centered artist can commit in a relationship. Ultimately, the long running time and the moments of absurdity means you should probably wait until the DVD comes out.",5,2,5,20 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Welcome to my Nightmare
","My first reaction when walking out of the movie theatre was exhaustion. Once again, for the sake of being a Big Blockbuster, the filmmakers feel the need to extend the runtime to 2 hours and 30 minutes. As the audience was first starting to get pummeled with scenes of gravitas one after the other, I felt a good vibe going. The energy was flowing, pacing seemed good. Then came the flashback/nightmares. The film decided to surround the story, from the very first frame, with flashbacks. But perhaps to break the monotony, the flashbacks were morphed into nightmares. OK sure, it breaks the monotony, and adds more running time, but they didn't make much sense. Perhaps halfway through the film, when another confusing nightmare played out, the vibe went from excited to WTF? Then it hit me. My God, they've taken both of these franchises and turned them into Michael Bay movies. Michael Bay movies are trademark all commercial and no substance bombastic extravaganzas. Tonally, this film is a mess. Wisely, it finds it's footing and stays more with the Batman story arc. But cramming in the Superman arc as a separate but equal focus of the film was probably never really workable. Complaints that there is no humour to the tale comes from the fact that there is so much to for the audience to buy-in already with this siamese twin of a film, that any moments of levity would damage the already uncertain tone. The biggest casualty from this is the Lex Luthor character. His tone was supposed to be crazy and dark, but could still have had a comic side (done with great success by Gene Hackman). His character never solidified into an identifiable persona that we could love to hate. Another complaint about this film is 'where is the fun'? This is supposed to be an event film. Again, the poorly assembled action scenes could have steered us into fun action setups. But they were rushed along too much. It has much more favorably going for it than not, and all that $250 million budget is definitely up there on the screen. The cinematography by Larry Fong always has a larger than life feel, and is gorgeous to watch. But what was the point of the subplot about a secret government bullet that seemed to lead to nowhere? And why scenes of political quibbling (was George Lucas a script adviser?). Oh, yes there is supposedly a huge shocking thing that happens to one of the main characters at the end of the film. But nobody in the crowded theatre bought it for one second. Ultimately it comes down voting with my head or my heart. My heart has a weakness for big budget action spectacles as long as it has some original angle. My head becomes annoyed with the overstuffed and overlong plot. I would say a very tepid thumbs up to see it on the big screen for the event movie it is, but maybe find a cheaper matinée and skip the 3D.UPDATE - Comments on 'Ultimate Version' versus Theatrical Version. *MAJOR SPOILERS*I just recently viewed the 'ultimate' version of Batman v Superman and thought I would share some comments. First of all, one of the primary reasons the theatrical release was not accepted well was because of the shift from dark to light in terms of tone for recent movies. Star Wars shifted to a more light tone (as evidenced by the reshoots of 'Rogue One'), and even 'Deadpool' helped declare that audiences wanted to be entertained and have fun at the movies. Enough of the sad and dark stuff. Here are the primary benefits of the longer cut:Lex Luthor's character is fleshed out. Almost as if to respond to complaints about how disjointed his appearance was in the film, the 'ultimate' cut let's him talk about his father and his misfit as new CEO. Metropolis versus Gotham Subtheme. The football game of Metropolis versus Gotham represents the subtheme of Superman versus Batman. The screenwriters included several more lines by almost all the characters relating to how crime ridden Gotham is, and how much Metropolis is in love with Superman. Some of the extra scenes were better left out:Klark Kent gets further angered by talking to people about Batman being a menace. Almost all of them were about the branding, which felt too repetitive in the longer cut. Extra Violence. There are even more shots of people being riddled with bullets, or other acts of violence that make this film feel like a hard 'R' rated film. There are extra gritty scenes in the prison that feel really out of place in a superhero movie. Of course, that was the general dark direction the Batman series had gone under director Christopher Nolan. But you sense that there is a line where the audience is being turned off. Which is version if Better? No question the longer cut is better. The narrative flows smoother, giving characters more screen time that was needed. I complained that the theatrical cut felt like a Michael Bay movie. The ultimate version definitely never feels that way. I felt the extra time with Klark helped give him the equal weight needed to give the final showdown a better setup. Even so, both versions suffer from too many subplots. So the 'ultimate' version is still quite overbloated, but yet more watchable at nearly 3 hours. Perhaps they should have included an intermission, like the old roadshow movies of the 50's? As mentioned earlier, you must accept this movie for what it is with it's dark gritty tone. The timing of the release was unfortunate, but will probably be better respected in the future.",6,2,4,29 March 2016
Blade Runner," Blade Runner Redux 2007 - Zhora Fires First! (just kidding)
","**This Review contains many spoilers - beware!** This is a review of the Blade Runner - Final Cut released in fall 2007. Ridley Scott has tinkered for the third time with his original work. In the 90s, his director's cut gave justice to the original piece, with no dopey narration by Harrison Ford, and a snappier ending. This time, it's just fixing famous gaffes and cleaning up the famous visual effects. I had the pleasure of seeing a showing of the 'Final Cut' at the same theatre I saw the film throughout the 80's - the Uptown Theater in Minneapolis. I believe this is the fourth time I have viewed the film there. One thing you will be very impressed with is the quality of the print. This shall no doubt be obvious on the upcoming DVD release, as the colours are beautifully digitally enhanced. The visual effects also look very clean, and hold up very well. The cleaning up is primarily on the flying cars, they no longer have telltale black matte lines around them.A couple changes caused me to laugh out loud, however. First and foremost, is the infamous Snakemaker scene, where Deckard confronts the snakemaker in his shop. In all previous versions, you could easily tell that the dialogue did not match what was shot. Now, Harrison's CGI mouth magically is saying the correct dialogue, along with the Snakemaker. Another is the scene where Deckard kills Zhora, where previously it was obvious that it was a stunt woman crashing through the windows. Now she has the CGI face of Joanna Cassidy. Then there is a change in dialogue when Roy confronts Tyrell, instead of saying 'I want Life, f*cker', he now says a more politically correct 'I want life, father'. Sure, it fits, but why bother when everyone knows that line so well by now? That scene also has additional gore as Roy stuffs his thumbs into Tyrell's eyes. Also fixed is the annoying shot as Roy releases the bird at the end, when originally the sky changed from dark and rainy to sunny and clear. Now the bird flaps away into a dark industrial CGI sky. The 'Final Cut' thankfully has no drastic changes from the Director's Cut that came out in the 90's. Same beginning, same ending, same famous Unicorn question and same moody score (one of the best movie scores ever made). If you have the opportunity to see this print, do so. It was fascinating picking out details in the background, and scrutinising the visual effects (coolest looking scenery ever). For those who have never seen this film, please ignore some the clunky dialogue, and the ploddy pace. This movie is not a 'Terminator' type of Sci- Fi thriller, it is a mood piece, dripping (literally) with atmosphere. For the uninitiated, the production design (conceived by Scott along with Syd Mead) inspired a new generation of Sci-Fi Grunge, where the future had a retro look to it, and had a noir quality. Christopher Nolan admitted that he based the look of the new 'Batman Begins' franchise on Blade Runner. This movie still rates about an 8 out of a 10. Even after viewing it about 15 times.",8,2,5,9 December 2007
Signs," Jaded after too many DVD extras?
","I have been digging all those DVD extras for a while now, and have fun learning about Mr. Shyalaman as a moviemaker. But it is nearly impossible now to relive that 'Sixth Sense moment'. Am I Jaded ? Have I become so immersed in the mechanics of movie-making that I can no longer let myself go and be swept away by a seductive movie such as Signs? I pick out the lapses in logic, or the unnecessary soap opera-ish subplots, and I become aware that I am watching a high profile gimmick and hype movie that is trying to hypnotize me. Instead, I found myself groaning about three different times. The minor league hero who couldn't make it in the big time. The father who tries to raise his kids without his mother, 'I want to stay here because this is where Mom used to live'. Then there is Mr. Shyamalan playing the guilt ridden neighbor. Once I saw him, I recognized him from being on TV, or on the DVD extras. I believe many people recognize him by now. So when he was on screen, I am watching the director acting, instead of thinking of him as the character. But then there is the whole 'What does it all mean?' suspense. The more the film paraded all it's quirky characters and their obligatory hang-ups to pass the time, the higher the anticipation for the payoff for all this waiting and near misses. So ultimately I was disappointed due to the high expectations for a big payoff (you know - Close Encounters kind of stuff), that the scant hand or leg here or there just didn't satisfy. Alas, the whole subject matter of who 'they' are and what happens is side-stepped. (You may have heard that some trailers have given it away, which is it true, but not too badly)So I believe the story could have gone through another rewrite. I would've enjoyed less soap opera and more chasing the bogeyman. And a big warning for those who are hooked by the teaser commercials, don't expect to find satisfaction for your curiosity.The few goods things to say are: - Good job to Shyalaman for telling a story in his unique vision, avoiding some clichÃ©s. - A ferocious soundtrack that provides most of the special effects. - Decent spooky stuff to give you a chill once in a while.This was no better or worse than Unbreakable. I give it a 6 out of 10.Update: Upon second viewing, I was able to appreciate the terrific acting and cinematography to excuse the over-the-top quirky lines here and there (such as the now infamous 'The Happening'). It is really only the third act that fails to thrill, but it is a good ride up to that point.",6,0,1,3 August 2002
Live Free or Die Hard," Action - Stunts - Car Chases - BOOM!
","By chance I noticed that my favourite theatre was showing a Midnight screening of Die Hard 4. Being a fan of the first three films, I was a little jazzed for another go-round with John McClane. Was it worth it? Well, it's no Die-hard 1 or 2, but gives you some fun action. The biggest setback is the lack of original ideas, there are aspects of identifiable plot points from many other films. There are pieces of 'Last Action Hero', 'True Lies', 'Die Hard 2', 'Italian Job', even 'Road Warrior'. The biggest asset is a well paced storyline with plenty of action. People who are fans of real stunts over CGI will be generally pleased. The scenes that are obviously digital effects are not make-or-break scenes, the entire film doesn't depend on whether we buy the effects shots or not. There is a good deal of car/truck/helicopter/jet fighter chase scenes. However, by we the time we get to the third act, it all starts to feel familiar. Knowing this, the filmmakers cut to the chase and don't even pretend that SuperJohn (TV ads say he isn't another superhero - but he does have super powers). McClane continues to walk away from explosions, car wrecks, exploding cars, exploding freeways, and exploding buildings. The bad guys he kills along the way are just statistics after awhile. The key villain has a nice angry look, and a couple other supporting characters aren't wooden. Buddied up this time around is Justin Long (of 'I'm a Mac' fame). He just barely makes the cut of being cool enough to be a Keanu Reeves, without it feeling like 'let's add all the things that young people find hip and cool'. The movie certainly does lobby for the younger generation (a McClane prequel is on the drawing boards). It features hackers, Kevin Smith, a teenage McClane hottie, cluelessness about the 70s, OnStar, Blackberries, and so on. If it wasn't for extra re-writes and even more helicopters, it would be like 'Mercury Rising' or some other action-for-action's-sake kind of dullness. The movie has moments of serious bad guy stuff, and missteps trying to toss in inappropriate jokes. The film constantly is riding the line of trying to have it's cake and eat it too. A few scenes seem to cast a serious tone on brutal violence, but then gleefully slaughters bad guys. 'Kids, Violence is Bad, now lets go kill more Bad Guys'. It is obviously the film was shot to be an 'R' rated film. There are scenes that look like bad TV dubbing, with actors saying tame words over naughty words, but the lips aren't matching. The cinematography was notably slick, something better than '24'. I Give it 6 out of 10.",6,3,6,1 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," X Men Unleashed
","I would say that when you create a reality with so many people with special powers, you have to live in it.  In other words,  you have to deal with the real possibilities each mutant has.  If you were to make a movie depicting the consequences of said powers,  it would have to be epic, with mutants making trouble all over the place.  Or battling one power against anothers. In this case, Bryan Singer does exactly that.  It reminds me of Superman 2, where the 3 villians discover that they can control the world.   
The special effects are flawless, the action is furious, the characters are explored and are mostly convincing.  The story feels like it benefited from some re-writes.  There are disturbing correlations with registering mutants with the latest homeland security measures dealing with terrorism.  Even the Special Ops forces storming the X Men's school grounds,  looks eerily like footage from the Iraq conflict.  This makes the film all the more resonant. 
Only a few complaints.  The movie tracks in at 2 hours and 15 minutes,  and feels about 15 minutes too long.  The third act gets a little discombobulated with the twisty turny endings that seem to be all the rage these days.  Why do filmmakers feel the need to pile more and more plot points in the third act?  Perhaps they are afraid that the 3rd act is weak, and they need to add more story elements to confuse you.  Please please please trim down the convoluted endings!   There have been many duds released lately (Basic, Identity, The Recruit),  that have been condemned by critics for deteriorating into utter nonsense.  The other somewhat disturbing aspect of the movie is Wolverine's violent blade-wielding attacks on said Special Ops, and other normally good guys. Remember Terminator 2?  Great care was taken to keep the film on a comic book level by only slightly injuring the innocents (police and bystanders), and not worrying about the negative reaction to a high body count. Wolverine is not a nice guy here.  I give this film a 7 out of 10.  I will probably go see it again.",7,0,0,2 May 2003
Thor: The Dark World," Sleepy Operatic Second Installment
","Of all the current Marvel super heroes who enjoy their own solo films, Thor is my least favourite. I remember going through the whole Greek mythology in grade school and never could get into it. The other turn-off is the focus on yucking it up with the younger characters. Leave the goofy relationship material to television shows. Then there is the decision to turn the great Stellan Skarsgard (I remember him back in 'Hunt For Red October') into a humiliating clown character. As an audience member, I was embarrassed for such a high brow film to stoop to such broad comedy gags.There is considerable amount of time spent on other planets to setup all the rivalries and bad guys. The film lacks any punch, as it goes through the confrontations, it all plays out like an extended stage opera. The characters are in their grandiose outfits making grandiose pronouncements. All against large backdrops (yes you can tell it's all CGI). Anthony Hopkins is getting on in his age and his performance lacks fire. Tom Hiddleston, the great baddie from The Avengers, is literally sitting on the sidelines for the whole film.About an hour into watching it on DVD for the second time (the first time I saw it in the theatre I fell asleep three times), I realised the main problem with this movie is the sappy music. The soundtrack is the most boring generic underscoring I have heard in a long time. The music lacks any stingers to grab the audience, no depth in it's arrangements. It is amazing how just one aspect of a film can help kill it. Even when things pick up in the third act as London is ground zero for the big alien invasion. The production values are definitely there (although the 170 million price tag seems a bit much). The direction and editing is also just there, no flare or real energy in the story's momentum.Even though it clocks in at 1 hour 52 minutes, I swear it felt over two hours. I would still recommend this minor installment in the Marvel family of films, but not if you're sleepy.",4,0,1,23 March 2014
Lucy," Luc Besson's Best Visionary Scarlett Johansson
","Some people are hailing this as Luc Besson's best piece of Science Fiction work since 'The Fifth Element' Scarlett Johansson. A mythology, similar to Neo in the Matrix, revolves around the idea Scarlett Johansson. The wrinkle in this film is the blue pill allows you to see the code behind the 3 dimensional Scarlett Johansson. But for only 24 hours. Morgan Freeman, who appears in every film released, plays a smart guy who knows exactly how the ability to Scarlett Johansson.The film starts in a very gritty scenario that resembles his first Hollywood style film, 'La Femme Nikita'. Scarlett Johansson, who you think could be Marilyn Monroe's kid, gets in trouble with dangerous drug dealers. There are shocking moments of terror and violence that Besson has a flair for, and doesn't disappoint here. Feeling a sense of educating the audience as if a National Geographic documentary was directed by Micheal Bay, the frenetic editing wants desperately to make us connect with something deeper. But ultimately the story seems just interested in giving us a series of flashy sequences that feature Scarlett Johansson. Anytime Scarlett Johansson leaves the screen, even Morgan Freeman can't save the vacant space where a more coherent story should be.It kind of reminded me of the last 'Jack Ryan' film. The filmmakers have a checklist of requirements for a run-of-the-mill action thriller. Car Chase - check. Fight scene on the walls - check. Slowing down time - check. The audience reaction to the imagery-filled climax was that this supposed deeper imagery came out of nowhere, and didn't really fit what looks and feels like a Scarlett Johansson vehicle.But I really like Scarlett Johansson. I like watching her on the big screen. The material certainly has potential. But so did Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity and Johnny Mnemonic, etc. The material outside Scarlett Johansson is so weak in it's structure, the slightest puff of wind would cause it to collapse. Does the movie play self-aware and wink at the audience with a 'we know this is silly but just go along with it'? Not if it thinks it can take itself seriously with the animal documentary footage. So, no, not meant to be silly. Did I enjoy myself? Sure OK, this was a flashy but digestible action thriller. But if I had the choice, I would save the money and checkout Scarlett Johansson on DVD or streaming. But you may notice I have mentioned Scarlett Johansson twelve times now. So for some people that is enough to see this movie.",5,5,15,27 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Too-Fast Pacing Almost Ruins the Magic (Minor Spoiler)
","For those who want a sense of what a J.J Abrams version of a Star Wars film is like need to look no further than the most recent Star Trek movies. Abrams himself said he wanted to turn Star Trek into a Star Wars style show. Such as the reaction of the Star Trek films, there is good and bad with Abrams inhabiting our beloved heritage. I was 13 years old when the original Star Wars came out. I went to see at least 6 times while it played for over a year at the St. Louis Park theatre (sadly no longer exists). There was a vivaciousness to the original version that clicked from scene to scene. Interesting enough, the key to keeping the momentum going was the pacing. Science fiction movies up until that point had a convention that all activity in space happened in slow motion. George Lucas applied the style of old Flash Gordon serials to the science fiction conventions and created a sweeping adventure. Abrams, however, has taken this fast pacing a little too far, where we miss the emotional beats that the original gave us time for. The rushing around is to the film's detriment, as we have no time to take in what is happening. Lucas told a simple but well told story, and filled the world with lots of details. The Abrams world has no interest in lingering around to actually feel like we are living in these places we the audience are visiting. Ironically, the only time a couple extra seconds are spent anywhere is to stage a callback to the original movie. Such as the chess game with the small creatures on the Millennium Falcon. That moment had no bearing whatsoever on the story being told, and did not offer anything new.The quick pacing also didn't give me time to understand what was going on and why, but only for some minor plot points (how did the Millennium Falcon get trapped by the bigger ship?) Once the movie was over, the mind goes into a blur trying keep track of the obstacles needed to be overcome, and what the consequences were, and how the characters reacted, only to have another dilemma replace the former. In other words, the story has a bunch of distracting little actions scenes that only complicate the story. It will quickly become apparent to fans of the original that SWVII is basically a remake of A New Hope. As those beats are recognised by the audience, it shows real thought has gone behind how to present them. But again, that means little is new here. On the other hand, dark times were upon us die-hard Star Wars fans (I used to have a shoe box full of Star Wars bubble gum cards) after the miserable prequels sucked all the life out of the Star Wars franchise. So, I was happy to have that giddy feeling about 3 or 4 times as Abrams rejuvenated everything that was missing from the prequels. I truly believe over time that those prequel films will be mostly forgotten as the new set of films steer the franchise into the future.A course correction then will hopefully occur for the next film, with the pacing slowed down just a little (this is not a Michael Bay film). Another thing that Abrams got lucky on is that all principles from the original film returned and passionately contributed with similar results. This includes John Williams, who displayed his trademark genius in bringing a movie to life. Also credit goes to ILM, the effects house that has created a multi-billion dollar global phenomena with their jaw dropping effects. ILM was born out of the original Star Wars, and has changed the movie world forever. Harrison Ford owns his role, with natural and engaging dialogue by Lawrence Kasdan. So the sum off all the parts contributor-wise makes Star Wars a greater whole film than the recent Star Trek films. So a hesitant applause is in order for the return of our beloved Star Wars franchise. Abrams proved he can fulfill our wish list of what we are looking for in a Star Wars film (fun! - duh), and direct actors well enough so we believe they really live in these other worlds.I have GOT to tell everyone reading these reviews on IMDb to ignore the 1 star ratings all the fanboys are giving this film. They give it such a low rating not because the film isn't well made and entertaining, but because the film didn't do things exactly like they wanted. It is one thing to nitpick about little inconsistencies, it is another to declare that just everything and everyone was horrible. These same people will probably admit that this film is still better than the prequels, and these same people will still buy the blu-ray when it comes out so they can enjoy hating even more. Guys, we won't take you seriously giving this a 1 star rating. If the acting was bad, or the CGI was misused, or the pacing was dull, etc., it would deserve something that poor. But (as all the film critics agree - Rotten Tomatoes has it certified 95%) a real review with such geeky complaints would still give this film 5 stars instead of 1. I give it a 7, because it had me laughing, I got weepy once, I was drawn in by the action, and there was a feeling of that Star Wars magic that was completely vacant in the prequels.**A Minor Spoiler** Adam Driver as Han Solo's son looks amazingly like a young Harrison Ford, and makes an interesting troubled villain. His character will be interesting to follow in subsequent movies.",7,1,12,19 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Suffers as Setup to next film in Trilogy
","Having not read any of the books, and seeing a trend here (Ender's GAME), or a trailer shown before this film (Divergent), they all reflect what the latest generation is reading therefore finding as the preferred escapism. Here it is the blend of teenage rebellion and teenage emotional struggles with relationships. As important as this is in understanding what drives a character, I once again thought it unnecessary to drag the film over two hours. No question it was the second act where we seem to be building up to the next big event, only for Katniss for some reason popping up back home to get some more quality time with her loved ones. This second act obviously wanted to be longer, as subplot after subplot accumulated, especially around Philip Seymour Hoffman's character (a fresh baddie). Yet the expected resolution of these subplots are either skipped over or lightly touched upon. The third act thankfully found a lot of fresh dynamics to the actual game. This prevents a been-there-done-that sequel pitfall. For the most part, I felt this film was no better or worse than the first film, which I reluctantly liked.Hand it to the able creative and technical crew, with perhaps only a handful of CGI shots that looked iffy. Jennifer Lawrence does her best looking frightened most of the time, thankfully the brutality that was just hinted in the first film is hinted just a little more for PG-13. The biggest problem is the story, suffering from the middling 2nd part of a trilogy. The story isn't allowed to get too far in the resolution of the anticipated confrontation. So that forces many characters to remain in a holding pattern as the wheels spin for an extra half hour beyond the normal running time. As for the sequel bait, the same complaint can be made for many other recent last second revelations. It is a table turning moment that would have made the film we've just watched far more interesting. It reminds me of the long dragged out process over three films for Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader. It took two long films for him to just lose his hand! I think others in the audience had the same letdown as I did about the ending hinting at more interesting fireworks to come.",6,14,34,5 December 2013
Looper," Smart Script makes most of Time Travel Twist
","....Many minor spoilers throughout...This seems to be one of those screenplays that was given time to explore the possibilities and push the extremes. I suppose going to these extremes is required to find any daylight out of the well worn clichés with Science Fiction, but does it really need to sacrifice young kids? Sure, there is shock value. Does it aid the story? It does in a way the Terminator movies do. A lot of 'fixing' to make this click on all cylinders includes an obligatory Bruce Willis in Die Hard mode mowing down countless bad guys with nary a scratch. Then there's Emily Blunt, who must make out with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, just because that's why. But who knew walking into a crime time travel thriller (see Time Cop), they would find 'The Omen'. The child Pierce Gagnon has an intense look in his eyes that can really make you believe he has a harsh future ahead of him. He is well directed by Rian Johnson, and pulls off a good deal of dialogue that you actually enjoy listening to. One such scene is between Levitt (you know, 3rd Rock from the Sun) and the always likable Jeff Daniels. When each character settles in, it is a joy to watch them try and outwit each other. There are nice moments like that throughout the film. But there are also clunky moments, mostly scenes where things are pushed to the degree that you lose touch with the core of the film. There is the strange course of events that go on with Emily Blunt and her child that make their characters less believable, but by that time you're in the 3rd act anyway, and this film has no intentions on sequel-baiting.'Looper' will probably earn itself into my collection, with some slight hesitation, such as the clearly unfinished or just plain low budget effects. Especially the flying motorcycle, there are a couple shots that should have been left out of the final cut. But there you go, trying to push the Sci-Fi and the action to it's own detriment. Was the flying motorcycle essential to the story? No. Levitt seems to have gotten a little too comfortable with the generic leading man role. He plays it a little too tough and gruff. Thankfully, he is allowed a few moments of humanity. But not for Bruce Willis, the older version of Levitt. He has the thankless task of hunting down sweet little kids, not matter how sorry he is.You should check out this original and well acted film, and forgive it's excesses.",6,3,10,1 October 2012
Life," Alien-Gravity Hybrid Knows how to Push Buttons
","It's one thing to go ahead and do a wannabe knockoff of a couple successful science fiction films. Some movie producer saw how the audience got their thrills from 'Gravity' and figured there was some money to be made. Despite the recent 'Alien' prequels being released, the scriptwriters deftly copied scenes from 'Prometheus' and carried on with a non-stop thrill ride that knows it can't stop. A few plot holes help deliver these thrills within a short period of time. It's another thing to make a watchable wannabe knockoff, and 'Life' pulls it off with a cast of Hollywood regulars and decent budget. 'Life' wastes no time getting to the nitty gritty. Samples from Mars contain a microbe that goes beyond the average animal (or alien) intelligence. Same goes for the metamorphosis of the microbe, as the film jumps forward in time to show that the alien lifeform has remarkable dexterity, strength, and intelligence. Cue the body count. Like other good horror films, it is a guessing game who gets struck by the sneaky alien octopus. He climbs around trying to escape his captivity with a mind of a human. I really have to hand it to the guys who rendered the slimy alien in this film, it is top notch. This little fella is seen throughout the movie and is believable as he crawls around, as well as when he crawls into human bodies. Once this smart squirmy alien gets out of his cage, I got this giddy 'well, no guessing what's going to happen now' as the story becomes relentless in how smart and capable the intruder is. You'll cringe during the bone-crunching and body-snatching scenes. This little varmint is pretty good at doing all the classic alien encounters. As for the 'Gravity' part of the script, it certainly helps to up the ante by adding the thrills of smashing up a space station. Again, nothing new here, but delivers the goods for those who are excited by the dangers of space. What's nice though as where 'Gravity' zigged, 'Life' zags. By taking things suggested by the other films to the next extreme, we are given a roller coaster ride that wants to outdo the others. There is a group of recognisable faces. No single character really reveals any depth. But then again, there's not much time to as our alien gets down to business. Although I didn't see this in the theatres, I would not have been disappointed. Nevertheless the plot gets a 1 out of 10 for originality. But once you a settled in and gotten over it, you've got a good looking thriller on your hands.",5,1,4,18 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are a Delight
","I am almost always willing to watch a Tom Hanks movie. Except for those Da Vinci Code movies, he has chosen characters I would enjoy watching. So along with Halle Berry, they get to play make-up and dress-up as they gleefully play a multitude of roles in this reincarnation movie. As the thread of the different characters in different time periods unfolds, there is an exuberant feeling that there is some brilliance behind the filmmaking. I think of the densely detailed 'Fight Club'. Some very visceral events are presented with such gravitas that you could find yourself gripping your seat.But then the movie presents new stories with more conventional (meaning less realistic) plot points that weaken the film as a whole. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the extended runtime as we watch this story weave it's way to the resolution. Initially, these episodes pack a punch that feels as though there was a heavy emotional payoff coming. But then there is perhaps an overreach in trying to deliver more conventional third story action pieces, not-so-surprising twists, and that cliché last second rescue from certain doom. I lost any deeper emotional connection with our main characters at that point.I still appreciate the matrix-like view of reincarnation, affecting all of our personalities as they simultaneously exist across many time periods. It could have been brilliant. But then it starts to look like 'Attack of the Clones'. It is definitely worth renting the DVD like I did.",5,0,3,18 August 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Keanu finds a Franchise
","I was a little amazed at the number of people attending the matinÃ©e showing of this film. My excuse for being there was that Hollywood has been releasing garbage this time of year, and this was the first film that showed some interest. Curiosity was the main attraction for me. How would they expand this code of honor among thieves mythology? How would the film expand it's world with a larger budget? Would the film meet it's higher expectations? To some degree this film has a bit of repetition from the first film, revisiting locations from the first film, with characters reiterating events that happened. I got to hand it to Keanu Reeves, his dark persona makes you think he was created from a graphic novel that is larger than life. Yet there are a few quirky moments that makes you think this guy is nuts. There are certain moments of offbeat humour, but I wish there were more. The story itself is a simple revenge story that has no real twists. You know John Wick will do what he says. The action beats are top notch. A fair mix of car chase, martial arts, but primarily a tsunami of bullets. The film seems to take pride in keeping count of how many shots Wick fires per cartridge, as we witness the meticulous routine of changing cartridges throughout each orgy of gunfire. With a visit to Italy, production design has a chance to find new backdrops for our storybook characters. One could believe Nicolas Refn directed this film, with the heavy use of colored lights and lush architecture to enhance the look of our characters. There is not a great deal of subtlety in the story or dialogue, perhaps trying to feel like an old western, where one didn't need more than a few words to spell out their revenge. I applaud what looks like a new franchise for Keanu. It's fun to just let the large set pieces play out, giving the filmmakers an opportunity to show their creativity, as well as competency in pulling off Bond/Bourne level of action sequences. I liked the quirkiness of the first film that is less apparent in the sequel. I like the locations and new characters featured in this film. One might wonder though how much of the fearless barrages against busloads of bad guys Wick can sustain before it gets old. For now, I once again will give the filmmakers kudos for clocking the film in at 2 hours, no over- complicated subplots, no extra twists.",6,2,11,13 February 2017
Minions," OK Summer Air Conditioned Fun
","I had a choice of seeing 'Ant Man' or this light fare when deciding on a movie. As much as Ant Man is being lauded as good craftsmanship, I am getting a little fatigued on Super Hero movies. Yes, Ant Man is not a sequel, but I grow tired of the same origin story, the same kind of villain, etc. My decision to see Minions was based upon the idea of watching something diverting with perhaps some originality. I had a grudgingly agreeable time with the Despicable Me movies, partially because they were a little more risqué. The minions were obvious a comic relief for young children, as they constantly were doing physical gags. One reviewer likened 'Minions' to a Looney Tunes cartoon, for which I have a fond regard from childhood. So perhaps I thought this big budget outing of the little side characters could have some inventive sight gags. Looney Tunes was created for adults back in the day, Minions is aimed almost strictly at the kids. The biggest letdown was how lame the villain was. Another thing perhaps worth mentioning is the majority of the film consists of gibberish dialogue that has no captioning. This prevented me from getting that connected with the three main minion characters. In general, the adventures the three minions go through was not driven with much purpose. Yes, there is the overarching story of the minions looking for a new villain to serve, but almost the entire film consists a series of set pieces (like a visit to a department store, with the retched 'clothing montage') that do not advance the story at all. The hyped up 'Scarlet Overkill' is just an empty shell of a character compared to Steve Carell's inspired Gru. This is more than obvious when a young Gru appears as part of the closing credits, and I find myself laughing and getting far more excited about these few sight gags than I did for the entire film.Laughs were few for me, although the crowd of kids in attendance were laughing quite a bit. The lack of laughs came from; uninspired villain, main characters that were too superficial to care about, and set pieces that provided too little bang for the buck. I think it is obvious that this was meant to be a lighter and fluffier animated film, not meant to evoke Pixar (like the movie 'Planes' never tried to be a Pixar caliber film). So for me it comes down to whether the brisk pacing and short running time is your best bet for sitting in some air conditioning on a hot summer day. If you're tired of yet another super hero movie, the answer is a not so enthusiastic yes.",5,3,5,17 July 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," What Do You Call a Guitarist without a Girlfriend? Homeless
","This screenplay seems to extend that joke to a full length film. I'm not sure if the not-so-great music in the film was supposed to be source of heart , or if it was supposed to reflect the losing formula of the character. There seems to be an intention to setup the audience for a moment of character growth for the struggling musician, only to have him turn it down, and continue struggling. These type of depressing films can work if we can sympathise with the main character. Oscar Isaac certainly is a likable actor, but we cannot sympathise at points where he acts like a jerk. I think of a lead character in a film as your friend. Because he's your friend, you will be interested in following his story. But when your friend rejects your advice and starts acting like a jerk around you, you start losing interest in his story.What Coen brothers films are famous for are their side characters. Here we are treated to some fun moments, and strangely unfunny moments. By the third act, the screenplay's intentions become glaringly apparent, we the audience get to experience firsthand the rough life you go through when you are trying to survive when you are homeless. It is a serious subject, and there a multitude of real stories where in a bad economy, people become lost in finding their place in the world. The main reaction I had was that there were moments I could relate to personally, as a person who suffers from depression, so the screenplay successfully accomplishes it's purpose.This film rates far better than 'A Serious Man', another Coen brothers test that does it's best to defy audience's expectations with things like character development, and a traditional ending. I could appreciate this outing for the reason of the deliberate mood painted in poignant scenes. The expression of depression is well articulated. Going on a road trip with catatonic passengers. Fatally striking a cat with your car. Losing your job. Losing your girlfriend. Your music being rejected. Getting screwed with your old job. Losing your valuables. Like a top ten checklist of anxieties that can keep you up at night. The fact we can find humour in spots shows potential for sympathy, but on the whole I was left not wanting anything to do with a story that had no real heart or insight, like a traditional ending. I guess it was because I still believe an audience deserves some expectations fulfilled when paying to see your film.I'm sure the screenwriter knows the difference. In 'No Country For Old Men', the screenplay gives you the traditional character arc resolutions in the third act, albeit presented in a idiosyncratic way. Here, Llewyn gives little clue about where he is going, and leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled.",5,4,7,11 May 2014
Sin City," Best Comic Book film ever made
","There have been many attempts to make a movie look like a comic book. 'Dick Tracy' effectively used prosthetics and comic book colours and costumes to give it that look. However, the story suffered. 'The Shadow' also made good use of creating a comic book reality, where people talked and acted like they were from a comic book. Even 'The Hulk' had the innovative use of transitions by scanning across boxes on a comic book. And so on. The primary flaws of these films were both a gripping story and lack of complete immersion into the comic book world. (For some reason I am reminded of 'Cool World', another disaster).'Sin City' finally takes the comic book film genre into it's rightful place. That is, completely separated from reality. Here, Marv, a lowbrow dude, can't be killed by a hail of bullets or otherwise. Backgrounds are completely comic book in their illustrations, using CGI selectively to animate them. The broad use of monochrome design with splashes of colour works perfectly. The overall tone of the film feels like 'Pulp Fiction', both comic in their ultra-violence. Indeed, this is the first film I have seen that is a worthy successor to the 'Pulp Fiction' style, with 'Kill Bill' a close second.But back to the true strength of this film - story. The three primary plots are original and fast paced. Simplified but not stupid, strong performances (although Bruce Willis didn't break any new ground) of characters who have strong personalities and strong motivations. Mickey Rourke, almost unrecognisable as Marv, gives one of the best performances of his career and carries the film more than anyone else. Rodriguez was perfect for directing, using his experience from his early films to create high energy scenes. The film is fast-paced, with little extraneous dialogue to bog it down.This film should be considered a classic, it certainly will be a cult hit for years to come. You maybe have seen close attempts of a film like this, but none in the past have achieved the absolute comic reality portrayed in this film.I give it an 8 out of 10.",7,0,1,6 April 2005
Moon," Hero Too Annoying To Care About
","After attempting to watch this movie twice, there was a lack of momentum that allowed me to invest myself into it. There certainly is no disrespect for Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Spacey playing the voice of HAL (or equivalent thereof). One thing that is hard to ignore is the low production values, giving this feature length film the feel of an episode of a Sci-Fi TV show. The premise doesn't seem entirely strong for a feature length story. Worst, is that Sam Rockwell playing a clone of himself does not come off as believable. With many films successfully wowing the audience depicting one person as twins (Dead Ringers is just one that comes to mind), it is odd how almost obviously disjointed the two characters are in scenes together. There is no eye contact between the clones, the conversations don't feel natural, even the physical interaction doesn't connect the way it should.I blame the under-ambitious script for lack of gripping drama. I also had a very very hard time buying into a premise that Earth-saving materials were being mined on the moon by just a single guy???? Worse, they hire someone that is unstable (even if he is a clone, why not clone the best and brightest?). The pacing is slow. Both versions of Sam Rockwell's character are just annoying. Neither gain my sympathy as they both bicker and fight. Revelations in the plot that are meant to be showstoppers seem pretty predictable.The mystery I am supposed to care about was too shallow and uninteresting for me to finish watching. I certainly don't think Sam Rockwell is part of the problem, and maybe a better budget would have made this more multi-dimensional. But for what it is, I can't recommend it.",4,2,7,24 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Locke 2: Fury Road
","This film took director George Miller 12 years to make, and it shows. There is a great deal of depth to this fictional post-apocalypse world. Here the same back story is depicted, with a larger and more ferocious telling. I expect this film will greatly influence future action movies, primarily because the elements of this action film are so fresh and unique. Director George Miller should especially be recognised for getting performances that get the character's emotions without much dialogue. Much needs to be said about the action cutting of this film. First, there is little or no 'shaky cam'. For me, the ferocity of the pacing for an extended action sequence seemed almost impossible, yet it kept my adrenaline going. I'm not sure how many edits are in this film, but it feels about twice as many as a normal action film, yet it doesn't suffer from Michael Bay syndrome (addicted to quick cuts).George Miller has created a 'look' to his Mad Max films by undercranking the camera. This means instead of playing back at 24 frames per second, the motion is sped up so there is perhaps 26 fps passing by within a second. Next, is starting the story as the chase begins, giving the character momentum. How to make an original action film? Spend months designing and building wild vehicles previously only seen as bubble gum stickers I used to collect as a kid. The personality designed into the cars and trucks rivals some of the actors. There was an interesting shifting of the weight of the story to the supporting characters, allowing the main characters to go through most of the movie without any dialogue. It is a bit of irony for Tom Hardy to have so little dialogue while spending the entire movie in a traveling vehicle. Around the time of the release of Mad Max was 'Locke', in which he spends the entire movie talking while in a moving vehicle. Charlize Theron needs no backstory to understand she is tough. A lot of good adrenaline inducing tribal drums punctuate the soundtrack. One of the chase vehicles has six drummers bashing away while a fire wielding heavy metal guitar player assaults the sonic landscape. No other film this summer has this kind of well paced action with original visuals.",7,0,2,15 September 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I Really Liked Explosions #47 and #83
","You will read a common refrain in every review about TF3, the overlong series of explosions that make up the final hour of the film. I came into this movie with low expectations. I expected the low-rent dialogue that would normally be rejected by a bargain basement sitcom. I expected nonsensical plot points, that can be easily seen as a convenient way to BLOW SOMETHING UP. Yes, something must blow up every 15 seconds, or we are ready to pull up our twitters. I came for the spit shined special effects by ILM, still setting the bar of all VFX houses. Indeed there are more rendered frames of CGI than probably 'The Phantom Menace'. Thankfully, Michael Bay had to decaffeinate his editing in order to have the full 3D effect. I could actually understand the geography of the action sequences for the first time in a Transformers movie. Until the final hour, that is.Bay did a lot of things right this time. He has less screen time of dumb dialogue and just goes straight to the eye candy we all came for anyway. The slower editing pace, finally, gives the audience a chance to look at these mangled pieces of metal animated as if they are surreal sculptures (or even like that icky exhibit of frozen bodies). Some have half their brains blown out, or an eye blown out. Every megamechatron has like ten thousand little parts that you can see, meaning it overwhelms your Imax 3D vision with information to digest. That's what was precisely wrong with TF2. No one could make heads or tails of who was the bad robot and who was the good robot. Now we get more than 10 frames to glimpse each CGI extravaganza of little truck or car parts. I compare this to 'The Phantom Menace' since both are films are similar in which the filming of the live actors has no feeling of being connected to the uber-robot battle going on behind them. No matter whether our hero and heroine get trapped in a collapsing building, or get tossed into a brick wall, they bounce back like Looney Tunes characters.There is not much to say about the story or the acting. Other than regurgitating file footage of the space program that has been seen already for decades on the big screen. I was yawning almost immediately as we spend the first twenty minutes watching something from the History Channel reviewing our proud accomplishments in space. Although there is the alternate universe being described, it's still the same cliché footage we've seen over and over. A complete waste of the audience's time. In my editorial mind I thought, I could have saved everyone's precious time by just cutting to the big hook, one of those voltron gobot thingies crashed on the moon. There, setup over, let's move on. Shia Labeouf is trapped with everyone else in a one dimensional character, so I do not blame them for looking like cardboard. I was almost ready to compliment Michael Bay for not even pretending any characters have any anchor in reality, and just having each moment of revelation be merely a beat and move on. Yeah we know the nice looking guy is really a bad guy. Yeah, we know the shady robot has something to hide. Now let's BLOW SOMETHING UP.There are literally at least 100 separate shots of big explosions in this film. Each one is lovingly framed, many in slow motion, Ka-Bloom! A large ball of fire, then some smaller debris shooting away, and a cloud of smoke. Bay must of had played with fireworks as a kid. I found myself smiling at the incessant explosions at first, then by time we enter hour 3, it becomes simply monotonous. Believe it or not, each explosion should have meaning, or we are just watching a 4th of July show. This explosion is important because it is putting our good guys in peril. That explosion is important because it is sending dangerous debris into harm's way. Instead of that, TF3 has explosion after explosion, with no real context, that you start to get burned out. Bay apparently wanted to make the central character of the movie the actual explosions, anticipating that 12-year-olds will get excited after every explosion goes off. But I pose this question to the editor and director: If you are throwing literally dozens of explosions as part of the big finale, won't the audience start losing track of what the significance of one explosion was along with the others? 'Remember explosion #64? That was a real good explosion'.Which brings us to the last hour. The film goes way overtime by making sure we get to experience every last building and vehicle blow up in Chicago. Someone should have confronted Bay and forced him to cut a few minutes. Literally, most of the final battle does not wow you, it begins to annoy you, since it has no meaning anymore. About 10 minutes after I felt like the film should have been wrapping up i wanted to yell, 'Can I go home now?', But no, another 20 minutes of sensory overload to the point I didn't care if he got the girl in the end or not.",5,3,8,7 July 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," Too Much Shaky Cam! (minor spoiler)
","I give this sequel a marginal thumbs up,  but I have two major problems.I still have a headache from the first problem.  The shooting style revives the trendy 'shaky cam' which translates into 'someone who can't hold the camera steady is shooting something supposedly spontaneous and compelling''. TV series andcommercials used this style to excess and has thankfully receded to only a few places. The big problem when you do the Shaky cam to excess,  is that when EVERYTHING is 'spontaneous and compelling' then NOTHING takes on greater urgency.  When this type of shot is used sparingly (someone is shot and fighting for his life),  you get that 'Cops' kind of reality.  This film takes it too far.  As much as I believe a director should try to take chances and try to be original,  you have to know when you are drawing too much attention to the style and distracting from the story.  This is especially ineffective in the action scenes.  But wait - that's when you SHOULD have that urgent kind of camerawork, right?.  The problem is,  the action scenes are shot in Super-Shaky Cam.  I literally could not follow a big fight scene,  and had a hard time appreciating the car chase because the frame was too blurry to make anything out.  This really disappoints me,  because there is a good franchise in the works here.  The gritty and smart Bourne shows a sharp focus on cutting to the chase and treats anything else as a waste of time.  Joan Allen is the very apt CIA chief who refuses to look the other way, and she holds the screen with as much energy as Chris Cooper did in the first film. Brian Cox does a great job of giving you that 'Oh God I'm screwed' look. The locations once again are rich in texture,  no pretty shots of Red Square.  I have to give the first film a better rating for one big reason - (*MINOR SPOILER*)This film leaves Bourne chasing around to save himself without a nice looking girl by his side.  The James Bond comparisons to this new kind of spy are more accurate when you get the hot chick into the mix.  The lovely Julia Stiles only gets as much screen time as she did in the first,  too bad.     (*END SPOILER*)I give this a 6 out of 10.",6,1,3,23 July 2004
Sully," Fact is less interesting than Fiction
","'Spoilers' in this review.I put the word spoilers in quotes for two reasons. First, of course, we all know about this high profile incident and the outcome. Second, the other 'revelation' that occurs in the third act never actually occurred in reality. The filmmakers explained when the movie came out that because there was no controversy to wrap the story around, they made one up. This kind of reminds me of my reaction to 'Argo'. One reason why the audience will invest their time into a movie is knowing that the stakes are real. 'Sully' shows that sometimes fact is not as exciting as fiction. So I have the same reaction to 'Argo', which is 'why am I watching a fake story?' In this case you get into groan territory as Sully faces a review board. Characters playing aviation officials look accusatory as they confront him with the idea he should have tried to land the plane at a runway close by. All be damned that he successfully saved all the passengers, he should have saved the plane! Spoiler Sully acts like John Wayne and publicly shames all the officials as he points out that human reaction time was not factored in. The hang dog reaction on the officials faces is so over-the-top it feels like a farce. This 'oh we feel so terrible, let me lick your toes' response felt just dumb. Spoiler finishedEastwood handled the material otherwise very appropriately. Finding momentum by reviewing the moment via flight control and passengers midway through the film (instead having it as the finale) helped feed the story. Otherwise, we all know that the pilot was a hero, had no dark secrets, and was completely exonerated. Compare that to the Academy nominated 'Flight'. This fictional story was wrapped around a hero pilot that had dark secrets. That fictional story also allowed for a more dramatic crash landing. To 'sully' the material with any fictional personal problems or what not (wife can't deal with, other crew members think the captain is taking all the credit) would have turned this fact-based movie into something it wasn't. Sully the character is a straight arrow, nothing to hide. Nothing terribly exciting either. Thankfully Eastwood also knows the limitations of the material, with the film clocking in at a thankful 96 minutes. I suppose the big draw to see this on the big screen was to watch the special effects sequences of the miraculous water landing. I chose to wait until the DVD came out because I felt I might not be invested in this movie beyond the special effects. Tom Hanks is always charismatic, even more his sidekick Aaron Eckhart (proudly sporting a 70's moustache). His co-pilot character is allowed to be more engaging. I expect my reaction if I saw this in a theatre would be neutral, not a waste of money but not an award winner. I usually declare 'wait for the DVD', however I am writing this review long after the big screen release, and the new phrase needs to change to 'wait for DVD/On Demand' for this day and age.",6,0,0,10 February 2017
The Island," Nothing New
","Michael Bay is a great TV commercial director. He keeps the camera moving, putting lovely models in front of glitzy backdrops. I wouldn't quite go as far as saying Michael Bay is a good action movie director. Action movies get energy from quick cuts and a moving camera, but there needs to be a coherency to all the mayhem. This film feels like retread all the way. 'The Island' is a remake of 'Logan's Run' in the Blade Runner-esquire Los Angeles (but now with sunny skies!). I like Ewan McGregor sure, but he's not given enough depth to create any attachment. Ditto for Johansson the Airhead, For some of the machinations of the plot to succeed, not only did the logic of the story get dumbed down, but so did our main characters. Once again, great for a 30 second spot to sell a car, but not workable in a 2 hour timeframe. So it's going through the motions of the discovery that we can easily guess. There are a couple nice set pieces when we see the whole cloning technology, and implanting memories. My hopes were on something slick and well staged when all the whizzing cars and explosions took over in the third act, but it was so bad as to be goofy. Ladies and Gentlemen, you are reduced to big loud signs planted on nearby Holograph Generators, with dozens of Danger and Hazardous signs. And just in case you STILL don't get the big explosion coming up, you have a 'Do Not Press This Button - Generator Will Be Destroyed' sign plastered right on the machine. This deflated the whole works to the level of the old Batman TV Shows. But Bay had to tame his vision to under 120 million, and you see the difference when compared to the meta-blockbusters of 'Armageddon' (200M) and 'Pearl Harbor' (140+M). You get a ridiculous 'action' scene where our heroes slide down alongside a stairway, made all exciting by simply shaking the camera back and forth. I think the shaky cam is way overdone these days, (see my review of 'Bourne Supremacy'). This is ultimately what kills the movie, all the action scenes are pure hokum. The CGI air cycles you couldn't buy for a second. The car chase scenes had no direction, it was just aimless cars flipping and exploding ad nauseam. Once again, I am willing to credit Michael Bay's previous films, putting some huge action pieces on the screen. I will still pull out my cable copy of 'Pearl Harbor' once in a while and fast forward to the attack scenes. So that's it, a medium budget sci-fi retread with no A-list actors and nothing really new to offer. You can only hold our attention so long with flashing lights and spastic camera-work, until the thin plot makes you groan. More groans abound as you see commercial logos parade in front of the camera every ten minutes or so. My guess is that Bay was going after the quintessential 'Blade Runner' future world Christopher Nolan was also going after in 'Batman Begins'. But there was no striking vision in this future world, and instead he created a mish-mosh of today, near future, and manufactured future that fails to excite. These is no resonance of a deeper philosophy, which comes belated and through the most unbelievable bad-guy-turns-good moment. Truthfully, 'Revenge of the Sith' stands as the most spectacular CGI effect film of all time, and nothing released this summer will measure up in that respect (although McGregor is allowed to expand his acting talents a bit).",4,5,10,25 July 2005
