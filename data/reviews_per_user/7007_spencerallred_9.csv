The Avengers," A action film you do not want to miss
",the end of phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe this movie stars of all 5 marvel heroes as Loki wants the tesseract as he comes to earth and starts a war with all of these different aliens and creatures as well. i went to see this film with high expectations and what happened my expectations were met all of it every single part of the movie. this movie made me love the characters more than ever i mean Robert Downey Jr in my opinion was the best actor for marvel i mean no one else can really play iron man like he can i thought Samuel l Jackson did a fantastic job as nick fury he really added the tension and added that comic book type in himself as it seems. now how good was this movie its just not really good it is amazing the special effects were good the acting was good the directing and the editing was very well put together. spoilers ahead. hulk was by far the most interesting and most fun character in the movie this is the best hulk yet although i was kind of disappointed by how hulk did not get much screen time as much of the other characters did. some other minuses that i didn't like is that there are some parts where i got a little too winded out from all the action and yes thats my favorite kind of action but i felt like there were a little too much of it. there were lots of elements that were built into this movie where you can feel and see all of them. it does has its funny moments which i really like because without that element of laughter it would be too serious and i thought that they did really well with that part as for the setting i felt like there wasn't a lot of setting involved which means not whole lot to remember forever but that is easily missed the last one is the antagonist Loki i think that he should be a villain in every marvel film just because he is very enjoyable to watch on screen has great talent and great acting skills. so overall this movie is breathtaking exciting dazzling i would really recommend this movie to all ages really i give this a 8/10 good job marvel!!!,9,1,4,10 February 2014
Iron Man 3," iron man 3 not a film that i like to call a epic finale
",iron man 3 is the 3rd and final installment of the iron man trilogy it is directed by Shane black and Shawn pierce this my review of iron man 3spoilers ahead! so iron man 3 kicks off the story of how tony created this weird thing called extremes and explains he did not know he created this extremes we also see that tony stark has built 42 iron man suits. the character Killian played by guy pierce is the main villain of the story. but is hidden by decoy called the mandarin who is supposedly to act out as a tourist.there are some pretty high expectation that i had with this movie but sadly i did not get the expectation that i wanted. first of all the plot the story was kind of interesting did not have a good spotlight on the film itself. the pacing was a little too slow. the acting was yet again great but it seemed like tony stark was not himself at times which the direction in that was a little off on that. i thought that the digital effects was not that great but there were some scenes where it had great digital effects. The dialog and the screenplay was played out well it had smart and funny dialog like it has always have been. some of the things that i did not like is the fact that they changed the music from a good epic rock and roll to a just a guy singing what is up with the soundtrack what have happened here.Some of the things that i did like about the movie is the sense of wittiness and funny humor mostly made by tony stark Robert Downey Jr just has the acting component within his own smart brain.in closing overall the film is kind of good per say but i saw some things that the film needs to work on and get better at i give this a 7/10 stars mostly because it has more elements that make it better than just okay i would still recommend this to marvel fans a lot though,7,0,1,22 April 2014
Man of Steel," this movie could have done a lot better
",the new superman remake man of steel highlights the capture of special effects or too much special effects. with the special effects they had a lot of equipment starting for man of steel.in this movie man of steel was directed by Zach Snyder and written by David s goyer DC a superhero company created man of steel along with other ones like the batman trilogy and green lantern this movie was remade because Snyder wanted to make a true superman film that will capture that cannon as it was stated in his interviews. this film is the basic story of Clark Kent becoming superman seems like a simple story just like the comic books but yet the movie made it confusing and it just seemed out of place. the movie opens up with krypton in rest after Clark is born and the main antagonist is approached showing his true evil mostly in this opening spoilers up ahead. the film then shows the death of Clark father after he is killed by general zodd the main antagonist then the world blows up this scene kind of bugged me because this plot point was too long it almost felt like Snyder wanted to tell Clark's life but also tell the story of his planet and just decided to cram it in there just to be done with it. the rest of the story is just talking about Kent's life and learning about his powers although Snyder needs to do a better job with the directing and also the film editing the plot threads did not mix well with the sequences in the movie. the bad thing that was about this movie is the special and visual effects yes it is good to have them but not too much of it it was just kind of overwhelming and finally the acting had a great cast of actors the actor for superman did a great job for his character and i think Amy Adams did a nice job too.now would i recommend this movie yes but only to those who love action movies and also to superman films would really enjoy the comic book action in this moviefor me i would give this movie a 6/10 because it didn't grab my attention that much and it is one of those movies that you go watch it and you go wow this movie was a visual experience but probably not one to go ahead and be obsessed with it that show i felt personally.,5,0,2,10 February 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," a film that has very good solid filmaking
",the third installment of harry potter franchise as the kids grow older into their teenage hood i would have to say that this film has some good solid filmaking to the point where it is so solid that when i watch it it makes me tear in proudness of the good work that is put into this film Alfonso Caron the director is one of the directors to choose from if u want a good movie. And again the leading actors are once again solid acting as teenagers who play it well. the special and visual effects are not great but its passable for this type of solid filmaking. in my opinion and reaction of the film is that its a film with great solidness and great acting that this movie should be looked at as examples from other directors i would give this movie a low B+ to a high A-,9,0,1,26 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," a fantasy film that will be loved for generations
","harry potter and the philosophers stone is a family film which is directed by Christopher Columbus.the first film in the 8 film series marks a good start in the franchise. there are a lot of memorable characters and overall a film that we will remember this film Will be loved as a family movie it has good cast a pretty good story and good special effects and its good for its era of cinema. i think what this film did the best is its acting and cast these are 10 year old elementary British kids who has some great talent in acting and Daniel, Emma, Rupert should receive millions for there great acting talent. i should also take notice of the beautiful design of hog warts such a pretty sight to see very nicely structured not to stretched to far in detail what my opinion and reaction of this movie is that its pretty well done film and will be a film that will be memorable and a childhood memory i would give this film a low B to a high B+ good film work!",8,0,1,26 November 2014

Thor: The Dark World," one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
","Thor the dark world is the second installment to the Thor sequel when i went to go see it i had high expectations for this movie this did not meet my expectations at all, now i am a big action fan and i did not like this movie they had so much plot holes to count the characters did not have very good development this is a warning for readers that there are spoilers up ahead! i did give some credit about Loki death but then eventually faked his death and marvel has done a great job at doing things like that the pacing of the movie did have some slowdowns but the pacing went along with the action of the movie spoilers ahead for readers, malikieth who is the villain of this movie was not very interesting in fact he was the worst villain i have ever experienced seeing by my waste of time i give this a 4/10 did not like it.",5,6,9,7 February 2014

The Matrix," the special effects are spectacular
",the matrix stars Keen Reeves in a huge action film that has a lot of cool special effects the story in this movie might seem complicated first but it still pushes the plot forward within the first act of the plot. the story has a lot of interesting and entertaining plot points and sequences that we will never forget. the characters are somewhat interesting mostly this movie is sort of like a build up to the next 2 movies. i thought they had a nice screenplay has a nice of use of action. what makes this movie good is that the special effects has gone into a lot of detail to match up the thrill that it gives. the slow motion set pieces were done well and were done at the right time and rate for each frame of shot. i would recommend this movie into people that are action fans or thrill seekers.,8,2,4,9 June 2014
