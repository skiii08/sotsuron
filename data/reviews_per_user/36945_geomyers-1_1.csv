50 First Dates," Great little movie
","This movie has a little in it for everyone. It's a comedy and a love story. I'm a huge Drew Barrymore fan and she does a wonderful job in this movie. I'm not normally a big Adam Sandler fan and certainly not much of a Rob Schneider fan at all. However, Adam is very endearing in this movie. He is really very good at playing someone who is sensitive to others needs. The big shock for me was the really great job Rob Schneider did. He was extremely funny and pulls off the impersonation of a Hawaiian quite well.Overall I thought that the film was tremendously entertaining and had enough little plots twists in it to keep me interested. I especially liked the ending because it didn't knuckle under and finish with a pat Hollywood ending",8,0,0,25 June 2004
