First Man," Boring :(
","I had high expectations and was so much looking forward and I was very much disappointed.
There were a few good scenes where you could get the oppressive feeling what these brave astronauts went trough and it gave you a good sense of how brave these men were.
But overall, the movie was boring. Terribly boring. I was very disappointed.... and that scene at the end when he dropped that bracelet in the crater, I was thinking... really?
Don't get me wrong, It's a sad story behind it but I thought the movie was made very depressing and boring. Sorry. Trailers gave me a different expectation.",2,10,16,26 October 2018
