The Avengers," Buddy Comedy + Action Sequences out of Transformers
","A whole bunch of supposedly clever dialogues (more or less clich√©d lines), some funny moments and lots of pointless banters among the lead characters.The character interactions are sometimes amusing and more or less remind you of buddy cop movies from the years past, only set in a SciFi/CG background.Disappointing and ridiculous action sequences in the same spirit as Transformers.In a nutshell, it's basically an extended version of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. If you liked any of these past movies, chances are, you'll like this one, too.For me, there have been, and will be plenty of better super hero films.",6,3,15,5 May 2012
300," Pretty video-gamish movie with lots of visual style but no substance
","This is one of those movies that completely rely on visual styles to impress the audience. Unfortunately, if you can get past the eye candy, there isn't much beneath it.It's one of the most pompously idiotic movies I've ever seen. There is almost no acting save for some over the top bellowing from the main characters. The action scenes are well done, but after a while it gets repetitive and pointless. And at times, it almost feels as if I'm watching someone play a latest Xbox 360 video game.And somehow the movie makers decided to inject the 'fight for freedom' theme into the Spartan mind set. This obviously doesn't make any sense, since Sparta was one of the most totalitarian societies of the time. The movie makers decided to glorify one of the most ruthless societies in the history, while making a mockery of one of the greatest empires the world has known.",5,9,18,10 March 2007
