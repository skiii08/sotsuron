Hereditary," Great til the end
","Loved this movie till the last 20ish minutes. The ultimate plotline takes a turn that ruined the first 3/4ths of the movie. There were great twists throughout, I just didn't like the end. Also, while it did have some good tense moments, it wasn't horrifying at all.
Otherwise, Toni Collette was fantastic and should be recognized for her work.",6,0,2,11 June 2018
