The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," josh hutcherson's performance is heartbreaking.
","In Mockingjay Katniss finds herself in district 13, a secret district most people in Panem believe no longer exists. Which is understandable as everyone is hidden underground in a secret bunker. Katniss makes a deal with president coin thanks to the help of Plutarch that ensures the safety of the tributes held in the capitol and a mission to rescue them, in return Katniss is 'the Mockingjay' a symbol of rebellion throughout the districts.Jennifer Lawrence embodies Katniss flawlessly once again on screen and gives a stunning performance as the female hero of the movie shooting down two capitol jets with her enhanced bows created by Beetee. Jennifer wowed the audience when she sung during the film, the song is also featured as the first credits song but sung by Lorde. Who knew Jennifer could sing?Once again Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of Effie Trinket gives the film the light and laughs it needs, Mockingjay is dark, the darkest of the three books, which is quite hard to fathom when you know that ultimately the books/movies are centered around teenagers fighting, wars, death and poverty. Haymitch is sadly absent throughout most of the movie, but the few scenes he is in he steals with his jokes on being sober and about his relationship with his best friend Katniss.Josh's performance as Peeta steals the movie for me, Peeta is now in the possession of the capitol and he's secretly being conditioned to say and do what Snow wants him to. Watching Josh as Peeta is absolutely heart-breaking as you see him slowly come to realise what has happened to his home, his family and to Katniss. Peeta's final scene in this movie is gut wrenching and sure to bring the audience to tears.Fans of the books will be pleased to know that the team behind the making of the movie have done an amazing job at converting the story from sheet to screen in a way that enhances the story more than expected and that warrants the need for a part two, is it November 2015 yet?.A moment of respect is featured at the beginning of the credits that pay tribute to the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman who passed away last year whilst filming Mockingjay P2.",8,23,64,13 November 2014
