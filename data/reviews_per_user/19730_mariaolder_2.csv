Captain Phillips," A genuinely powerful movie!
","A film that is a truely powerful, engaging and emotional thriller. A fantastic film thats based on a true story which makes it all the more powerful. The tremendous acting almost gets you into the intense emotions shown in the film. The film may begin relatively slowly but builds as you watch more and more managing to keep your eyes glued to the TV. I highly advice this film. I can't imagine what that poor captain went through and the bravery and ingenuity he showed in real life.",9,0,0,24 June 2020
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An ok film but nothing compared to the first two.
",The first two films were so much better. I know Megan Fox was fired for a reason but she was better at acting than the new cast member. That whole plot hole definitely put a dampener on the film.,6,1,1,25 February 2020
