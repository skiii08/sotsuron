Requiem for a Dream," BE Excited! BE BE Excited!
","You can not take your eyes off this film. Like a car crash, it's is horrifying yet tugs at your primal urge to view the dark side of life.Realistic and brutal, the acting is Oscar worthy and the story magnificent.Cinematography and editing is the best I have ever seen in a film of this type (urban, gritty, yet almost fantasy)....no, actually there was no other film of this type at the time. It is really unique and set the standard for filmmakers in the future to aspire to.It's that good.The relationships of the characters to each other and themselves are psychological conundrums that really fascinate and terrify at the same time.What these people do to destroy themselves is believable, and can happen to anyone. That's what's so frightening about it.But you really care about these people, so it sends you on a journey to be with them every step of the way, literally, through amazing camera-work you see out of their eyes and feel what they feel.I can't say enough about this film. Top 5 of all time...at least.",10,0,1,9 July 2010
Edward Scissorhands," A film to keep in your library
","A fairy tale that is moving and beautiful. Definitely a multiple time screener.This and Nightmare before Xmas is Burton's best work. You really become involved with the characters, their alienation and 'different-ness'.Even the heroine who appears to be the popular girl, has a side of her that just doesn't fit in with others.The cinematography is beautiful, the score is emotional and the acting fantastic. Vincent price is delicious as well as the whole cast.It's a blend of comedy and tragedy and pulls you through a wide range of emotions through the film. A real trip, and unforgettable!IMO, The character of Edward is one of the classic characters in the history of fantasy film, alongside Willie Wonka, Oliver Twist, Mary Poppins, ET, Alice in wonderland and a few others.One of my top ten of all time. If you haven't seen it, I promise you, if you have a heart, it will touch you.",10,0,1,9 July 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Moving and thought provoking
","I LOVED this film. While not a fan of Austin Kutcher, I really enjoyed his performance,but more than that, the story itself is superb. This film is just immersive, pulling you into a world of endless possibility. The thing is, it is partly true. We can change our future, though not by going back to the past but by changing how we live today.There are lessons to be learned in this film. Everything we choose has consequences to our future. As I look back on my life, I see the time I wasted and wish I could go back to do something more productive with that time, rather than just partying and having fun, but well, that's another story.A great film makes you think about your life. That's what this film does. This is a must see. Don't hesitate to watch it. It will enthrall, and entertain you and make you think about life, and how you can make it better. You'll appreciate what you have now...",10,3,5,9 July 2010
