Raiders of the Lost Ark," liked
","Really loved this film. Harrison Ford amazing 'We went on an adventure to make an adventure,' Spielberg said in 2013 and part of the enduring appeal of the film – which was followed by 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – is the appeal of the charismatic hero figure. Jones is a brave and humorous hero but is allowed to show weakness and be afraid, making the character real. Who can forget the line: 'Snakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?', as he drops a torch into the Well of Souls, revealing a floor crawling with thousands of the poisonous creatures.",10,1,2,15 November 2015
