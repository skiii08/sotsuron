It," What about the bandages?
","The fat boy jumped into the water after being cut and bandaged... why didn't anyone stop him? And his bandages didn't fall off? Also, what happened to the floating kids in the end of the movie? The clown was disturbing, but he looked too clean, too sterile. The bully kid... did he get possessed at one point? How come he suddenly turned into an outright killer? The black boy... at one point we see him next to the well, exhausted after the fight with the bully; in the next shot, we see him in the sewers, running with the other kids. Other than that, this film was actually a pretty good thrill! The special effects were awesome, and it had some genuinely creepy moments. Spooked me a bit! What I liked the most is that 'It' featured all different kinds of horror -- from jump scares and gore to suspense and disturbing creepyness.",8,2,4,22 September 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Made Just For You
","You compromise good taste if you pay to see a crappy film just because it's a pi√±ata full of eye-candy. Buying the ticket translates to 'I want more of the same', which feeds the Hollywood anus to excrete more of the same unoriginal crap movies with offensively gigantic plot holes, and jokes that used to be funny in third grade. If you compromise a good story for beautiful special effects, you are automatically refusing to see a movie that has both a great plot and marvelous special effects. Yes, imagine if you had movies that had *both* of these elements. Well, you can't, because you are an easy to please idiot. I can't blame Hollywood; they manufacture what the market wants. You loved Transformers 2; they made it just for you. You waste your money on fecal matter and you've learned to enjoy swallowing it, because they put lots of butter on it.",1,4,14,14 November 2009
Halloween," Not scary one bit
","I just saw this movie for the first time, as a 29 years old adult. There was nothing scary about it. The gore was cheap and unrealistic. The situations were awkward. Some things are magically opened and pushed while there was nothing in the story that suggested supernatural forces. Is Myers possessed by a demon, or is he a psychopath? Is he immortal? The unknown can make a character creepier, but that's not the case with Michael, because he isn't well grounded in reality. I think this movie was a money-grabber when it came out. Carpenter is a brilliant director and this movie just doesn't feel like any of his other works. To those who haven't watched this as kids, trust me, it's not worth watching it now as adults. Go watch any other film by Carpenter.",5,3,6,5 September 2016
