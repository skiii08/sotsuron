The Blair Witch Project," Quite possibly the scariest film ever made....
","I was skeptical going into this film... I had heard the buzz... Scariest film since The Exorcist, which coincidentally was made the year I was born (1973). I didn't think there was any way Blair Witch could possibly be that scary... It was, and it is so brilliantly made that it messes with every part of your mind... The beginning of the 'documentary' is funny and cheesy as most are... Then gradually the 'filmmakers begin to get scared and so does the audience... I don't spook too easily but I was scared out of my mind when I left the theater... I don't want to give anything away... The less you know going in, the better... But know this... This is one of the scariest films you will ever see... And it is also one of the best...",10,1,2,23 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Good, but what's the big deal?
","This is a good film... The storyline is interesting, and the plot, even though it takes an hour to get going is there. Yes, there's a lot of sex, but with the exception of one scene, it is no sexier than Basic Instinct or 9 1/2 Weeks... I don't understand the secrecy that has followed this film for the past two years... There is nothing about it that is that shocking... It's just a good, solid film with good performances by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman... If you go in expecting the most shocking film ever, you will be disappointed, as the majority of the crowd was when I saw it... Give it a chance... It's worth a look...",8,0,0,23 July 1999
