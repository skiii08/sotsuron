Resident Evil: Afterlife," I feel bad for die hard fans
","This film was a POS. There is no denying that simple and plain fact. This film has barley any cohesiveness as far as plot and character development go. The characters are two-dimensional and have no arcs or changes what-so-ever, unless you count being controlled by a ruby scarab beetle mind control injection device which causes memory loss where at the beginning of the film your character knows nothing and at the end they remember everything...I don't need a direct game to film adaptation. I understand as a filmmaker myself that it serves no purpose to try and condense a 20 hour+ game into a 2 hour story. It mainly wont work and the basic actions the game character preforms would be tedious in a film. What you want to translate over from the game is story, character depth, goals, believability. Afterbirth has none of these things. We jump into a fun action sequence that serves a very small purpose on story and a huge tech demo for 3D. It does nothing other than setup the tone for the film, which is what you want your opening to do. Unless of course you open your movie with an insane amount of CGI bullet dodging, sword deaths, and gun play; then proceed to have your main character lose all their powers and survive a high impact plane crash into a mountain...I could really flay this crap pile but I only have 1000 words.",3,5,12,11 September 2010
Cloverfield," stop being stupid
","The fact that this movie doesn't end with a solid resolution should not affect its grading. You are supposed to understand that we as the viewer are watching the tape of what happened, not experiencing it. The idea of the film is to be a film about real people, the monster thing is the catalyst for what makes them realize whats important in life. They went with realism and to give you that we cant know the ending because it wasn't filmed. This movie takes place in the 'now'. We meet the characters, we feel for them, then we get scared as hell when the tension heightens. This movie was awesome and you need to use your brain a little movie when viewing cinema.",Null,1,5,17 January 2008
