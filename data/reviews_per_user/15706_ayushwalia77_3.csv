It," Not worth the hype
","I went for the movie without having any knowledge what so ever of what it was and how it was going to turn up. Movie started with a scene which terrified me to my very soul. I was actually afraid and that scene just raised my bar of expectations. What happened afterwards was clearly not what I expected. As the trailer suggests, it's about a town where children keep going missing from time to time. First half focuses on this very concept and a bunch of children (who call themselves losers) keep seeing this clown who tries to scare the hell out of them.Second half gets slower where Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his friends tried to find the missing kids. At the end of the second half, you might feel that a lot could have been done with the movie's ending but the directors/writers didn't try that hard. I kept loosing interest as the movie reaches the last 20 minutes.It's not like one of those traditional horror movies which relates to ghosts or super-natural powers. Though I loved the new concept, I still believe that movie is definitely not worth the hype that it is getting.As somebody in the reviews section said: 'IT truly is the scariest movie of all time... If you're 10 years old or younger, maybe. '. I completely agree with this.",8,2,8,10 September 2017
Lion," Great movie delivering powerful messages
","Innocence of Sunny Pawar clubbed together with exception performance by Dev Patel. Sunny Pawar (Saroo) is a five-year-old child who lives in a small house with his mother (who collects rocks) and his brother. Messages that this movie focuses on: 'Adopting helpless/orphan children', 'Missing child cases', 'Never loose hope. You never know what life has saved for your future', 'Don't judge somebody before knowing the whole truth', 'Hollowness of Indian Society where people just care about money (Noor & Rawa tried selling Saroo for money)'and finally 'Once a Indian always a Indian'",10,0,0,27 May 2017
Warrior," Great movie with great performance from Joel & Tom
",Loved the plot of the movie. The performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are really great. They both show the love real brothers will share in real life. One fighting for saving of his family (daughter and the house) and the other one to give the money to his best (dead) friend's wife. Tom Hardy really looked like a MMA fighter in this movie. He was bulky and strong and looked as if he can really kick some serious stuff. Joel on the other hand looks perfectly like a professor with a family. The ending scene kind of made me cry where Joel just lifted up Tom and started walking out of the ring without caring for the officials or anyone else.,10,1,2,24 December 2016
