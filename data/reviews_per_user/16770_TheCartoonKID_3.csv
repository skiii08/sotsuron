The Blair Witch Project," its not that scary!
","right get this. I'm 13 and I've seen this movie and I don't find it scary at all whereas my parents wouldn't let me see it at first coz 'ooooooooo no, its too scary for you' yeah right! the film itself was ok, a tiny bit creepy at parts but not enough to make you jump! I think it could've done with more gore coz all we saw was a red blob that was apparently an ear and a finger.eww. all in all it was a good movie though I wouldn't have gone to see it in the cinema as its not a proper movie.",Null,0,2,3 October 2002
Finding Nemo," Grab Shell for the ride of your life!
","If you haven't seen this movie get down to the cinema before you miss out on the best film of all time! It is without a doubt the sweetest, funniest, most exciting film I (and many others) have seen in years! The backgrounds are beautiful and so life-like! And I can barely find words to describe the characters. They are superbly animated and are brought to life by some extremly talented actors. If (and I very much doubt it) you aren't sure of the plot, here's an insight to it: After the death of his wife and 399 children, Marlin the Clownfish becomes over-protective of his only surviving son, Nemo. When Nemo gets tired of his fathers protectiveness, he abandons the safety of his home and ends up being captured by an Austrailian diver. Nemo then finds himself in the company of the 'Tank Gang' in a dentists office tank. Meanwhile, Marlin desperatly tries to find his son, with the help of the memory-losing, optimistic and Danger-Prone Dory, a Regal Blue Tang fish. Together they encouter vegitarian sharks, a forest of Jellyfish, the EAC-surfing turtles and many more colourful characters in this story about the seas most dedicated father, Marlin and the funniest fish in the world, Dory. I am positive that any Disney-Pixar, fish or touching-movie fan will not be able to resist the brilliance of this film. Treat yourself to Disney-Pixars Greatest acheivement, Finding Nemo! 10/10!

Platoon," A kids review...
","*Possible Spoilers* I watched this film last night out of personal interest in seeing Willem Dafoe, who I am a big fan of. Note that I also saw this movie because of my interest in war, the army and the fact that I am a 15 year old tomboy might have something to do with it. Anyway, I was amazed and touched by this film. Great performances by Charlie Sheen and my favourite, Willem, made this movie stand out. I couldn't believe it had been in my cupboard my whole life and I had missed it! It really IS the greatest war film EVER! My favourite scenes include the part where all the guys get 'high' and are dancing to 'Tracks of my Tears' which I am listening to at this very moment. Also, the scene where Elias is killed is possibly the best one. It is so touching, yet scary, and it had me screaming at Barnes and crying at our TV. I hope more people out there watch this film for generations to come, because it deserves all the positive reviews it can get. 10/10!",10,2,4,19 January 2004
