The Blair Witch Project," Good idea, shame about the ending.
","The Blair Witch Project had the elements to be an outstounding movie. One which at last does not count on computers to give you a scare, it instead use's light, sound and camera angleing to prevoke you. This is how it should be such as in the original version of 'The Haunting' back in 1963. But instead of building you up to a dramatic ending which will stay with you at least untill you reach the cinema exit it leaves you with an ending that makes you wonder wether it was worth spending the money to go and see it.Still nice to see America producing something original for a change.",4,0,2,31 October 1999
