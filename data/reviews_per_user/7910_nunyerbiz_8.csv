Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's been two years and still...
","Phantom Menace is the weakest of the series. Over the last 4 or 5 days I have watched the entire four films over again. Here's my objective reasonsing behind my opinion. First, two things that I will not hold against this movie or Lucas. 1) It is impossible to follow the original trilogy, especially after 16 years. Expectations combined with the grossly overdone media hype pretty much sealed Phantom Menace's fate as a dissapointment. 2) I'm sure it is very difficult to SPECIFICALLY write a movie as part one of a trilogy and have the story make any real sense. While Lucas has always claimed that A New Hope was envisioned as the start of a trilogy, I just don't buy it. The ONLY aspect of New Hope that lent itself to a sequel was the fact that Darth Vader didn't die.Here are the big problems with Phantom Menace that were never problems with the original trilogy. 1) Lack of direction. While the CGI shots were all gorgeous, and the sets and locales very nice, the actors were all very wooden and appeared bored. While directing was never a strong suit of the original trilogy, at least it wasn't a liability. 2) Lack of character development. Some might say this is due to lack of direction, but I think it's due to a fairly weak script. In A New Hope the main protagonists really pulled you in and you were interested in their struggles. In Phantom Menace, the characters were just too shallow. Anakin was VERY unconvincing, due to a combination of horrid dialouge and wooden acting. Obi-Wan wasn't even needed in the film at all until the climax. The characters in Phantom Menace simply didn't inspire any great emotion. Something that you cannot say about A New Hope some 24 years later. 3) The BIGGEST fault in the film and something that is DIRECTLY against Lucas' own views. SFX that take precedence over the story. That should be the tagline for Phantom Menace. The story is very compelling, deep and interesting for about 20 minutes total. The rest of the movie is simply padding for the next blockbuster CGI overload. The Pod Race scene and the journey to the underwater Gungan kingdom being the two biggest offenders. Sure, these scenes look great, but both could have been cut down by at least half and the movie would have been just as good. Another example is Jar Jar. While upon repeating viewings, he gets less and less annoying, being annoying isn't my biggest fault with him. My biggest Jar Jar issue is that Lucas forced him on us. It's as if he said, 'Maybe if I put JarJar in 85% of the scenes, the audience will forget he's a fancy computerized cartoon.' Of course this horribly backfired. The majority of the audience found Jar Jar annoying, therefore concetrating on him more, which made him look that much more like a cartoon as opposed to being just another character. Sure CP30 was annoying here and there in the original movies, but you never thought of him as a man in a suit, he was always a character. I quickly wrote off Jar Jar as a computerized Looney Toon only put in the movie to fall over himself. Lucas never pulled him off as a character. (The other CG characters were much more convincing however).In my opinion, these are the three major faults of Phantom Menace that place it squarely on the bottom of the Star Wars movies. None of the original three films had any of these same faults. That being said, I still thought it was an enjoyable movie overall. I don't share the love it / hate it mentality of many of the reviewers here. As a stand alone film, I would give it 7/10. Here's my ranking for the Star Wars films.Episode 1: 5/10 Episode 4: 9/10 Episode 5: 10/10 Episode 6: 8/10 (NOTE: I thought Episode 6 was only 7/10, but it gained one point for the final space battle. That scene simply hasn't been equalled by ANY movie in the last 18 years)",2,0,1,22 May 2001
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A movie with a good heart... but just too scatter-shot to recommend
","The premise should be familiar to anyone reading this, but just for the sake of being thorough: A television music composer, Peter Bretter (Segal) gets dumped by his longtime TV star girlfriend (Kristin Bell). This break-up is completely unexpected to Peter and in an effort to get over his failed relationship, he inexplicably winds up vacationing in the same Hawaiin resort as his ex and her new love interest. All is not lost for Peter, as an attractive employee at the resort might just be just what he needed.Typical of most movies from the Apatow stable, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is somewhat crippled by a script that just can't decide what it wants to do... and ultimately throws everything up on the screen hoping that it all sticks. There is a story here that just about anybody who has ever been dumped can easily relate to, it's just too bad that the gloriously simple premise is under-minded by pointless cameos and subplots and general meanderings that hurt the pace while returning far few laughs. Even setting aside the Apatow stable of recurring actors, there are still a lot of scenes that just don't really go anywhere apart from giving Segal somebody new to talk to.. a bartender here, a chef there... Sometimes these scenes lead to a laugh and sometimes they don't... but they always succeed in making the movie feel somewhat aimless and confused. A few seconds later, and Peter is back in his room crying over Sarah. The editing and pacing is just all over the map.First time screenwriter and leading man Segal does an admirable job when he sticks to the basics of his universal premise. Granted, the setup is nothing short of dumbfounding... As somehow he winds up at the same resort as his ex, and for reasons that nobody will ever properly explain, manages to score the best room in the place for free... but that is all a minor nitpick once the movie gets rolling. When the wheels really come off the train is when the usual stable of Apatow cronies elbow their way into unwarranted screen time. Paul Rudd and Johan Hill do little to justify their presence. I have nothing against those two in particular, and they have both done great work in other works from the Apatow posse... but here, they just distract from what could have been a much more well honed piece of work.When the movie stays on point, you have a pretty respectable romantic comedy / breakup movie. Segal isn't going to be quitting his sitcom actor day job anytime soon, but he acquits himself pretty well in the leading role. His character is generally pathetic and self-loathing, but always in a 'lovable loser' type of way that manages to keep the audience rooting for him despite the mess that he should only blame on himself. Kristen Bell frequently rises above the material, especially later in the film, giving what could be a typical 'cheating ex' clich√© of a character some decent depth. Mila Kunis is also surprising as the new love interest for Peter, as she shows some true chops that should make you forget about any 'That 70's Show' typecasting. Last but not least is Russell Brand as 'the other man'. His character was so ripe for overdone parody, it's a credit to Brand that he pulled it off with such wonderful subtlety. With the few exceptions when he is actually performing his 'music', he steals many scenes without ever appearing to try.Overall, there is an enjoyable movie wedged in here... It's just too bad that it's so scatter-shot in it's execution. A solid 20 minutes of runtime could have gone to the cutting room floor and the pacing in general could have been much tighter. I had a good enough time seeing this one, as it did feature a decent chunk of legitimate laughs. It's just too bad that the days of a concise, character-driven comedy seem to be a thing of the past. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a lot going for it, but ultimately it's bloated running time and odd pacing make it a less enjoyable viewing than it could have been.3/5",6,4,11,27 April 2008
Balls of Fury," Not uproariously funny, but an enjoyable enough farce.
","A silly, juvenile but ultimately likable enough comedy. While it never goes too lowbrow for a cheap laugh, it never really nails anything uproariously funny either. The lead is some guy I've never heard of or seen before and he doesn't do a ton to make himself memorable... but it does feature Chris Walken... And even though he's just hanging around for a paycheck, he's always fun enough in ridiculous roles like the one that's presented here. James Hong also steals some scenes... he is a charter member of the 'oh... I know THAT guy! He was great in suchandsuch' Hall of Fame. One of those character actors that you know will deliver capable comic support. Maggie Q is cute as a button and provides some great eye candy, if 85lb Asian chicks in tight workout clothing is your thing...It's sort of loosely based on 'Enter the Dragon' with Ping-Pong instead of Kung Fu... and some Karate Kid thrown in for good measure. Like I said, things never really hit any great comedic heights... But Balls of Fury is a harmless farce that has it's heart in the right place, never trying too hard to please... just enjoying it's lot as a ridiculous little time waster. It's perfectly worthy for an 11pm HBO viewing after you realized you shouldn't have had all that Mountain Dew caffeine with dinner.",6,1,1,29 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Much better than Ep.1, still lacking charm of originals
","There is something about the two Star Wars prequels that I just now put my finger on after my first viewing of Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. To be blunt, these films just lack the charm of the original trilogy. The characters are all written and played very straight, almost to the point of becoming two-dimensional. There isn't any natural dynamic or tension between anybody you see on screen. Therefore, every instance of emotion, conflict and even humor come across as forced. The master/apprentice relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan seemed somewhat plastic. My 'exhibit B' for this argument is Jar Jar from Episode 1. It was obvious he was written as comic relief. He had no other legitimate reason to be there. When you know what the punchline is ahead of time, the joke usually falls flat.That being said, on to the main course:THE GOOD: 1) The plot worked and moved along well, only bogging down slightly in the middle of the film. Various loose ends from the previous film were tied down and you definately can see everything coming into place for a nice pseudo-conclusion in Episode Three. 2) The actors seem comfortable in their roles and deliver solid work despite the somewhat banal dialogue they have to work with. 3) The CGI sequences mesh very nicely with the story being told. Unlike in Phantom Menace, where the plot would stop for 10-15 minutes so we could be attacked by eye-candy. (Pod Race anyone?) 4) Yoda (trust me, see the flick just for him)THE BAD: 1) The love story between Anakin and Padme just didn't convince me. I think the script was somewhat weak in this subplot. While doing their best with what they had, Christansen/Portman can't compete with Ford/Fisher in the 'sophisticated girl falls for bad boy' department. 2) Sam Jackson just doesn't work well in toned down roles. Cast him as a bad guy, and you have a villian that instantly rivals Vader or the Emporer based on his charisma alone. Make him play a level headed good guy, and honestly, you're wasting his gift as an actor. 3) I have a couple of other minor gripes, but I don't want to post anything that would be a spoilerCONCLUSION: Overall, Episode Two is a solid addition to the Star Wars saga. While it still feels stiff compared to the originals, I am looking forward to seeing it on the big screen at least one more time.I really wish I could have reviewed this movie completely based on it's own merits. However, after growing up with Star Wars for as long as I can remember, that simply isn't possible. I drew comparisons and contrasts against the other Star Wars films long before my fingers hit the keyboard.",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
Top Secret!," I just can't get my wife to orgasm....
","This is the third film of the great ZAZ triad...Airplane - Kentucky Fried Movie - Top Secret!All I can say is that if you liked Airplane! you will love Top Secret. Great WWII/50's rock/Iron Curtain parody combined with fabulous sight gags makes for a great ZAZ movie.The cast is great... and how can you possibly argue with a movie that has an 'Anal Intruder' ?!?! If you like the Airplane! genre and you havn't seen this yet... please go rent it NOW! If the video store is closed, then break in and take it.... you will not be disappointed...Highlites include: The Anal Intruder, The East German national anthem/East German womans Olympic team, the 'spoon' tunnel, the prop room, the backwards swedish scene and Omar Shariff being compacted....My Rating: 7.5/10",7,1,2,28 October 2000
Remember the Titans," Feel good movie... a little too feel good...
","Ok.. We all know the basic plot of the film, so I won't go into that.
I thought this was an above average film. Denzel is intense and commanding as ever. The supporting cast is solid. The only problem I had with 'Titans' was that it all worked out too perfectly. I felt the movie would have been much more convincing had the script not been quite as watered down. I'm sure that was the work of Disney.
It's worth the $7 bucks, but 'Titans' hits you with an arm tackle instead of an all out blitz.3 outta 5",5,0,0,28 October 2000
Toy Story 3," Still a fun Pixar effort, but the weakest of the Toy Story films.
","I know, I know... I'm sure I'm going to get destroyed over this review. Anything under eight stars for a Pixar movie is blasphemy! While I thought TS3 was an entertaining two hours... it just wasn't quite up to par with the first two entries from the trilogy.The opening and ending dealing with Andy growing up and the toys outliving their usefulness to their owner was well done Pixar heartstring tugging... no complaints there. The middle act, which boiled down to a prison break movie, was a bit dull despite all the Pixar eye-candy trying to convince me otherwise. There were some gags to be had, a funny turn by Potato Head needing to use real vegetables, some thin and obvious (but still humorous) banter between Barbie and Ken and the now required shtick of Buzz Lightyear getting reset to various memory-wiped settings... but in general the middle 60 minutes of the film just seemed oddly disconnected from the rest. The end result was an odd sandwich effect, with the bread on either end actually being much more enjoyable then the meat in the middle.While I'm certainly not trying to slag the movie, I don't think 7/10 is anything approaching a hatchet job, I found this one to be clearly a level below the two films that preceded it. Pixar didn't waste the magic they built up with TS1 / TS2... but they certainly didn't expand on it either.",7,22,40,20 July 2010
Click," Enjoyable formula flick for Sandler quickly becomes tedious
","Wouldn't it be great if you had a universal remote that you could use to pause, rewind and fast forward your life as you see fit? Skip past all the boring stuff, pause and rewind all the fun stuff. It would be a blast right? Then again, it does kind of sound like the typical 'be careful what you wish for?' Hollywood movie.Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman. He is your typical 'Hollywood' middle class, white collar husband and father. Impossibly cute kids, impossibly gorgeous wife, seemingly great job as an architect... not many problems to be found on the surface. Of course, as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that our protagonist needs more time in each day to play the roles of father, husband and successful business man. Through some goofy circumstances Sandler bumps into mad-scientist Morty (played for a paycheck by Christopher Walken) and obtains the 'universal remote'. This remote seemingly answers all of Michael's problems. It gives him all the time he needs to become a bigshot at the office, after which he'll have all the time he wants to spend with his family. Of course, comic and dramatic hijinks ensue, eventually leading Sandler's character to realize what the true meaning of life is all about.Click is highly formulaic and as such, highly predictable. If you don't see every major plot point coming way before it's delivered, then either you weren't paying much attention or you haven't seen that many movies. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with formulaic and nothing wrong with predictable. Movies succeed or fail far more on execution than originality. Hollywood rarely reinvents the wheel, it just churns out different variations. The only real problem with Click is that it gets lost in it's own message and is eventually drowned by the weight of it's dramatic second half.Everything starts out great. The comedy is delivered at a pretty consistent pace without ever diving too far into low-brow areas that Sandler's early movies were known for. There are some great supporting performances from Nick Swardson, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and especially David Hasselhoff. This is easily the best performance I ever recall seeing from ol' Dave. He comes so close to going over the top without ever getting there and steals just about every scene he's in. The plot is enjoyable and the characters are funny, but you just know the other foot is going to fall. Things just can't keep going smooth for Michael.Once things turn south for our protagonist, so does the move itself. Michael realizes that the remote is not the silver bullet fix he thought it was and the script does everything it can to make sure we understand that. We end up with a plodding second act that meanders and quickly loses steam. Sandler is allowed to stretch some dramatic muscles and does an admirable job, it's just unfortunate that he is allowed to indulge. The plot is lost with far more views into the future than need be. Eventually the point of the story is beaten into the ground and everything devolves into little more than Rick Baker's makeup effects. By the time the inevitable 'Tug at the heartstrings' moment arrives, it's impact is dulled by the ponderous journey it took to get there.Overall, I admire Click for what it tried to accomplish. Sandler is really a better talent then he's ever been given credit for and his performance here is really solid. The problem is that Click should have left some of the second act on the cutting room floor instead of going out of it's way to play up Sandler's dramatic side. What could have been a truly enjoyable 90 minutes clocked in at a somewhat lumbering 107.Click won't make you want to change the channel, but it probably won't make you rewind and watch again either.5/10",5,1,3,15 November 2006
