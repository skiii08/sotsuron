Iron Man 3," Wasted potential, terrible advertising
","You think I mean that they screwed up the Mandarin with magic rings and all that smoked stuff... no, I'm not. What I mean with 'Wasted potential' is with the Mandarin that they established HERE.An intimidating terrorist who I actually enjoyed a little more than the comic book Mandarin, with some fantastic techniques to get fear out of respect from other people, as well as having an army of radioactive people who shoot fire; what could go wrong?Alright, so it was pretty well established that Guy Pearce's character (Aldrich Killian) was a villain by the middle of the movie. Even then, I was still enjoying it. But then, they completely get rid of that fantastic villain concept they created and turned it into something lazy...Another disappointing part was that they advertised this as a film which, like The Dark Knight Rises, would include Tony Stark (being serious) at near-death. And he sort of was, for about 20 minutes, and it was taken as a joke, with the kid and everything...Also, there's not much Iron Man in here, that's right, the best action scene we get is saving people from falling off a plane. Why do that when you have the Iron Patriot armor and you can put it to fight against the original; or the Mark 42, 41 or any of the over 35 armors that ultimately get destroyed... needless to say, that was worthless, as RDJ is already signed on for Avengers 2 and 3, so...They made us think this film would be as well balanced as the first one, but they didn't deliver; terrible advertising, the film was filled with hit-or-miss jokes and unfunny gags, they made us think this was going to be a serious, smart, action-packed, dramatic Iron Man movie, which we desperately needed if they wanted to revive the franchise after the terrible lazy fest that Iron Man 2 was...Finally, I'd like to add that, while the final sequence was fun, everything went down when Tony Stark calls the Mark 42, and then, it gets destroyed and he starts running away... you've got at least another 30 armors to choose from! Are you retarded or what? And then, they supposedly kill off Pepper, which I thought was a brilliant move, but then they bring her back for a non-spectacular finale that doesn't leave me satisfied.Iron Man Trilogy went downhill with Iron Man 2, and while the third one is better than the second, it still isn't enough to equal, if not improve, the first installment, or even its own advertising and expectations.Sorry, 6/10, hire some other writer for the next one...",6,1,3,2 February 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Very good movie, the best from Marvel Studios?
","Marvel Studios took a bold step back in 2008 with Iron Man (2008), which was both critically and commercially successful, but sadly things only got worse and worse from then on. When they announced Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was clear that there was potential, seeing as how the first half of 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger is probably some of the best material in superhero origin movies.'The Winter Soldier' delivers as much as it possibly could; Chris Evans becomes Captain America in this movie and absorbs the role of this patriotic ex-soldier who goes from seeing the world in black and white to noticing the gray in between and carries this entire film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow once again and she finally shows some more than just being cool and agile, but she's not a character that'll stay with you 'til the end of the year; at least you will remember she was here. Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon, even though he is very much two-dimensional and a comic relief, but he works and his action scenes flying (that could be counted with the fingers in one hand) are really impressive. Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is, to me, on par with Chris Evans in both performance and overall character, being the only (?) other person from the 40's to be in present day and having his memory constantly erased to be a mercenary. Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson are good as well. The performances aren't exactly top- notch, but they're (arguably) the best on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Like Watchmen, this film takes the 'does the end justify the means?' question and uses it as a recurring theme throughout the film; there is also, as mentioned earlier, a lot of learning we don't live in a world in black and white anymore, and there's trust as well. Considering how much themes I've mentioned, this could've been as good as The Dark Knight, but it sadly is not. There are a lot of themes and a lot of commentary (that I'll get to in a minute) which could definitely be taken more seriously had there not been so many scenes that were dedicated mostly to comedy, but the way it's done it is, still, arguably the best usage of themes in the MCU.The social commentary is mostly about, again, the ends justifying the means and more importantly, vigilance being the price of safety; in Benjamin Franklin's words ''He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither'' with (S.H.I.E.L.D.'s) Project Insight, which consists of targeting all possible threats and neutralizing them.The score is mostly forgettable, which is a disappointment considering Alan Silvestri's jaw-dropping Captain America score in the first movie.The villain is overall HYDRA, which means trouble, since we don't get to know Alexander Pierce(basically who represents HYDRA in this movie)'s motivations. Bucky is a victim, not the villain.The film is, however, saved by technical aspects. The Russo brothers did a great job of mixing practical effects (God, I missed those) and CGI to create a more grounded in reality superhero movie that has action you actually care about.Action, excitement, emotion, themes, commentary, solid performances, an intelligent script, and good characters make Captain America: The Winter Soldier one of the best Marvel films and hopefully also one that means they're finally starting to take things more seriously.9/10",9,0,2,4 August 2014
Interstellar," A Beautiful Space Journey
","Nolan is a very hard filmmaker, if you like his style then you'll like most, if not all of his movies, but if you don't care for it (his style), you hardly will. I consider myself a fan of him and openly admit he's one of the best modern directors, but when I say it I'm not saying ''he's the new Hitchcock'' or ''he's the new Kubrick', but rather that he's directed some of the best films in the past couple of years, stand-outs if you consider they are summer blockbusters that don't let themselves be limited by that.Matthew McConaughey (hope I spelled that right) is good in the film; I keep trying to catch True Detective because I hear he's great in that, but I have yet to get a chance to see it. I wont say it's his best performance (not at the level of Mud or DBC) but it certainly is more than just 'competent', and the character itself is written to be very memorable and relatable.The whole cast is spot on (Michael Caine brings a certain charm to the film as always) even thought there are way too many familiar faces.It's a very ambitious film, and I'm a sucked for that kind of movies that try to go beyond what they're limited to (i.e. Dark Knight wasn't limited by the expectations people had of a superhero film or a summer blockbuster), and it's always good to watch a film that is both viscerally and mentally (and also emotionally) thrilling. The movie deals with interesting themes and subjects that are as relevant today as they will continue to be for a long time, and hopefully, this movie will too.The third act may be a bit odd to some viewers, but I just recently marathoned sci-fi flicks, finishing with 2001 and I gotta say, I wasn't too confused by it, and neither should you if you're used to that kind of thing. Now, granted, I'm not saying this is the new 2001, but people seem to have similar complaints to those they had with that film when it first came out. It's overall an engaging, entertaining, well- acted and well written thought-provoking exploration of characters and themes, and a journey that is both viscerally and story-wise beautiful. As I said earlier, the film will likely have an impact on you even if you're not a father, but if you're able to, take your father to this film.8.9/10",9,2,7,9 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Meets the hype and surpasses it!
","The film starts out and already kicks off with the story; it manages to engage in the very first 5 minutes with an exciting, intense action sequence involving Sentinels and various X-Men. Right off the bat it's arguably one of the best action scenes in the X-Men franchise (it doesn't have that many) since the opening of X2. The story consists of Logan (Wolverine) being sent back to the past to stop Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Bolivar Trask, who was developing the Sentinel program, which would be cancelled but then picked up after his assassination, given how dangerous mutants would show to be; so to stop her, he needs to recruit the younger versions of both Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr. The story picks up quickly and moves forward in a way in which it never feels slow or boring. The characters are great; even though there are too many (Logan/Wolverine, Prof. X from past and present, Erik from past and present, Raven, Bolivar Trask, etc.) to focus on, and the cast is spot on! Seeing veterans such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen star alongside modern talented actors like Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, etc. The movie has a lot of thought-provoking elements that will truly have you meditating about them for a while; it'll take you a while to pick a side.Overall, very entertaining, great cast & characters, score is fine though not too memorable, great action, and the best part is that it's a big middle finger to X-Men: The Last Stand.10/10This movie will satisfy you and leave you wanting more.Stay 'til the end of the credits.",10,3,5,24 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice!
","First things first, I do think this is the Marvel (Studios) movie that focuses the most on the characters; on The Avengers you know that Thor and Hulk could solo the chitauri, but here you know how much they need each other both to fulfill missions and to support as friends. You buy how they grow from reluctant sort of mercenaries/bounty-hunters to really good friend, almost family. They all feel like they belong in the movie and they all get characters arcs (though Star-Lord's gets kinda lost in the plot until the very end), which are subtle, but (and especially referring to Rocket here) very Star Wars-y, particularly Han Solo's in Episode IV. This is fine by the way; Star Wars is one of my favorite movies of all time.The story is surprisingly solid and the movie absolutely knows what it is since the beginning. It's a goofy, fun, action-packed, character- driven space adventure with some emotional moments here and there.Characters:-Peter Quill/Star-Lord: I thought he was good as a protagonist, he was relatable, clearly taking inspiration from legendary characters such as Indiana Jones, Han Solo (back to Star Wars), Marty McFly, etc. and at the same he feels very unique because of the 80's child inside of him. Some of the humor provided by him is a little forced and out of place, but when it works, it really works. Chris Pratt becomes Star-Lord effortlessly and with this movie will easily become the Harrison Ford/Arnold Schwarzenegger of this decade, with all kinds of movies wanting him as a lead in many movies.-Gamora: My least favorite character to be honest; Gamora worked as a strong independent female at first but often had lines such as Captain America's fish-out-of-water humor in The Avengers that made her seem really stupid (as they did to Cap, in my opinion).-Drax: Man, did Dave Bautista surprised me. I liked the character of Drax a lot more than I thought I would; he's not just the muscle, he's also big part of the heart and charm of the film. One of the funniest moments of the film to me was his ''Nothing goes over my head...'' line, which, among many others, was greatly delivered on this role that is sure to make this former wrestler as popular as the Rock (Dwayne Johnson).-Rocket Raccoon: Alright, before watching the film, I thought he was going to be an annoying comedic relief with no use whatsoever in the plot and I wouldn't care about him (*cough* Darcy Lewis *cough*), but he ended up being possibly my favorite character in the film. The first time he shows up he is in fact very Han Solo-ish, a reluctant guy who just wants the money and has a friend with limited vocabulary. However, as the story moved forward, I realized he had a screen presence that I haven't seen in CGI characters his size (Caesar and Gollum may be exceptions, but other than that) and then he has an emotional moment that is also in a way expanding his origin, and in that moment I really felt sympathy for that guy. By far my favorite character, very reminiscent of why we like Han Solo so much.-Groot: Rocket may have been my favorite character, but Groot was definitely the first one for whom I really cared about. Seeing Groot being torn apart by Gamora while he has such an innocent facial expression gave that moment a lot of relevance to me; Groot quickly shows he's the most noble of the group and possibly the most supportive. Going back to saying he was like Chewbacca, I do think this shows just how much you can make us care about a character that doesn't even talk that much. Second favorite of the team.The action is really good; once again, reminds of Star Wars a lot. The visual effects are amazing; if the film doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for them, I will give up even more on them. I forgot Rocket and Groot were CG characters in some moments.There is emotion and it works, yes, and again, there's surprising dimension to Rocket's character (but don't get preachy; that still doesn't mean you can compare this supporting, mostly comic relief-ish character to Wonder Woman).My reservations:-Comedy: Again, I like to have fun in movies and this one succeeds at that, but some times the movie feels a little needy when it comes to humor. The film wants you to laugh and cuts many dramatic/climactic moments for unnecessary humor. That's not to say there weren't funny moments; there WERE, but some that attempted to failed miserably.-The villain: Once again, Marvel Studios shows how their weakest aspect is to write villains. No personality, back-story is pretty forgettable, and he just feels really out of place being all serious in the middle of this goofy world.By Marvel Cinematic Universe standards, it's around 8.5-9/10. By superhero movie standards, it's around 7.5-8. Overall, I will give it an 8/10 Overall, I think the strongest part of the film is the character interactions and they make the film, at least to me, more re-watchable than every other film I've seen this year, even X-Men and Apes, which I thought were better movies. If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Marvel's action-packed adventure space opera Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice.8/10",8,5,9,11 August 2014
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight meets and exceeds the hype!
","The campaign for the film was one of the biggest in cinematic history, and it didn't disappoint; The Dark Knight provides entertainment to all kinds of audiences with its action, suspense, thrill, outstanding performances, great scrip, strong directing (including IMAX shots throughout the movie), themes, complex story, and much more.The movie really fulfills its purpose, it surpasses its predecessor, and the predecessor saga(Burton-Schumacher)in terms of cinematography, entertainment, comic book accuracy, and realism as well. The Dark Knight is the most thought-provoking Batman movie and the second most thought-provoking comic book movie overall (Watchmen is the 1st); with its main theme being corruption, and not only as in corrupt cops, but also as in how far can we be pushed before we kill a man? How thin is the line between good and evil? How easily can a hero become a villain? The Dark Knight raises these questions and expertly represents them with its characters.The best part to me is how perfectly Batman and the Joker contrast with each other; Batman won't kill and the Joker won't stop killing; Batman struggles to prove that anyone can become an incorruptible symbol and the Joker is trying to prove that everyone can be corrupted.Possibly the best performances in superhero movie history. Heath Ledger steals the show but at the same time overshadows Bale, Eckhart, Oldman, Freeman and Caine, who also give really solid performances.Though some might say it's overrated, the film itself deserves the rating it has, as it outsmarted any other superhero movie as of 2008 and so far still does.10/10 stars. Amazing film!",10,0,1,11 September 2013
