Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is potty humor of the worst sort.
","Sorry, but this is not my kind of movie. If you like gross, insensitive, unimaginative humor, or if you just want to throw away some of your money, it may be yours.The offensive scenes are too frequent for comment. Suffice it to say that by the end of this awful flick you just want to take a bath.Some moron reviewer said this is the way all comedy films will be done in the future. If so, God help us all. I keep trying to think of a word or two that will capture the essence of 'Borat,' but all I can come up with is GROSS! Unless, REALLY GROSS can count. Yuuucccckkkk!",1,23,46,20 January 2007
Once," Sweet...
","The chemistry between the lead actors (two people I've never heard of) is what makes this film a treat to watch. Marketa Irglova (whoever she is and wherever she came from) has a screen presence without a doubt. The scene in the music store where she and her street musician acquaintance (Glen Hansard) first make music together is magical and worth the price of admission in and of itself. This is a sweet, poignant movie that is simple yet somehow captivating to watch. Maybe I'm just a sap for love stories, but the sound track that goes with this one is good enough to help carry the story and make us really care what happens to these people. Marketa and Glen make the music, and we are caught up in their moment.",8,13,14,28 July 2007
