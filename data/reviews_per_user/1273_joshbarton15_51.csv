Ford v Ferrari," Fast AND Furious.
","Batman v Superman, Freddy vs. Jason and Kramer vs. Kramer, there's been plenty of battles of the heavyweights depicted before in Hollywood however, none of them have been as fast or as furious as Ford v Ferrari (or Le Mans '66 as titled here in the UK), an adrenaline fuelled race to be the best from director James Mangold.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle against the corporation and themselves to build a revolutionary racing car for Ford to challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.Le Mans '66 does what every great sports film should do in making you care about the characters first and foremost while the sport actually takes more of a backseat. The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.When the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.Coming to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.What makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all.",9,5,15,13 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Denis Villeneuve... making sci-fi great again
","Los Angeles, 2049. Thirty years have passed since Deckard and Rachael fled the city to make a life of their own. The futuristic cityscapes created by visionary director Ridley Scott were the perfect backdrop for one of the most influential science-fiction films of all time. While the creative team may have changed for Blade Runner 2049, the cityscapes remain for one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in 2017.When K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could change the future for both humans and Replicants, he tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) for answers.It's no secret that audiences didn't take to Blade Runner straight away upon its release in 1982, people not seeing the mark the film stamped in the genre of sci-fi or film history until the years after. Several versions of the film and over thirty years later, Denis Villeneuve brings us Blade Runner 2049, a direct sequel and continuation from Scott's final cut of his original film.Villeneuve, who I'd have to describe as a visionary, is one of the most exciting directors working today and he brings his A-game to Blade Runner 2049. It's always risky making a sequel after such a long time, especially for a film as renowned as Blade Runner however, from the very get go, it's clear that this film is being made by someone who is incredibly indebted to and respectful of the original.This is a beautifully crafted film, visually stunning and utterly engrossing in its narrative. I was worried about how they would take the story forward but knowing nothing about the plot and going in blind worked wonders because I was gripped from the opening shot to the very last. The runtime could have been an issue but when the film is of such a high quality, it ultimately flies by and finishes too soon if anything.The work from Roger Deakins on the film's cinematography is nothing short of masterful, surpassing Jordan Cronenweth's work on the original which is no easy task. Deakins has never won the Academy Award and if he doesn't for his work on Blade Runner 2049, I'll lose hope in him ever picking up the award. The music from Vangelis in Blade Runner was mesmerising and while both Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch ensure this film has an impressive soundtrack, it never comes close to topping Vangelis'. Coming to the performances, Blade Runner 2049 features a cast intent on making this as memorable as the original. Ryan Gosling leads the film with an impressive performance where the subtlety of facial expressions are as important as the delivery of lines, leading to arguably Gosling's best performance to date. The returning Harrison Ford is as gruff as you'd expect as a Deckard who's been in hiding for thirty years, his pivotal role in the film surprising yet incredibly worthwhile.The supporting roles, ranging from minor to major, are filled by plenty of capable actors, whether it be Jared Leto's mysterious turn as Niander Wallace or Robin Wright's authoritative showing as Lt. Joshi. The pleasant surprise was Ana de Armas, who I didn't think too much of as an actress prior to this film.Blade Runner 2049 is a heavy dose of pure science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on the genre for sure. With this and Arrival last year, Denis Villeneuve seems to be on a one man mission to make sci-fi great again.",10,15,36,8 October 2017
First Man," A technical marvel.
","Having been amazed by Damien Chazelle's previous two films, Whiplash and La La Land, there was an unavoidable sense of high expectation from me towards his latest film, First Man. One of mankind's greatest achievements gets the silver screen treatment and, with Chazelle at the helm, there was every chance it'd be out of this world.In 1969, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) became the first man to walk on the Moon. It's an iconic moment in history and Chazelle's film takes a look at both the life of Armstrong and the work that went into the dangerous mission, a number of years before it even happened.Damien Chazelle certainly has a sense of grandeur that can be found in all of his films, Whiplash having it in the phenomenal sequences of music and La La Land having it in spades serving as an ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. When it comes to First Man, he achieves this with some quite stunning moments that places the central character, as well as the audience, amongst the stars. The space sequences are utterly breathtaking, Linus Sandgren's spacious cinematography and Tom Cross' editing capturing the wonder of such an achievement for mankind, the Moon landing sequence in IMAX up there as one of my favourites of the year.It's not just the visuals that work wonders in First Man either, the use of sound prominent once again in a Chazelle film. The sound department often go under the radar in a film's success however, Chazelle utilises them so well again in First Man that it's too hard to ignore the great work they carry out. Then there is the score from Justin Hurwitz, tense when needed but also balletic when we travelling through space.Josh Singer's screenplay does more than just tell the story of the Moon landing, it tells the story of a man driven by personal tragedy to succeed in his field and make this American dream become a reality. Singer's screenplay doesn't require a performance full of charisma and with Ryan Gosling as the lead, Chazelle's film is driven by a perfectly understated performance. Then there is Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife, Janet. Foy has made quite a name for herself as the Queen in The Crown and she doesn't do her growing reputation any harm here with a steely performance in First Man.It's a film that ultimately blew me away in the IMAX format and I'm sure I'll be as transfixed on repeat viewings. Damien Chazelle has earned a place as one of my favourite directors of all time in just three films and with First Man, it just further proves he has the filmmaking world at his feet.",10,6,13,16 October 2018
It," Falters a little as a work of pure terror but truly soars as a coming-of-age film
","Floating red balloons, a clown's face paint and high-pitched laugh are all rather innocent items in such a troublesome world. Throw them into an adaptation of Stephen King's It however, and they become much more sinister and unsettling than you could ever possibly imagine. It is the latest horror phenomenon to be unleashed upon the world and if you haven't heard of it, you must have been living under a rock. King's novel is regarded as one of the scariest of all time so would they be able to do a similar job with this film adaptation?When children start disappearing in the small town of Derry, a group of bullied kids, who refer to themselves as 'The Losers Club', band together to take down the monster responsible, which has taken the form of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard).While it may not be as terrifying as the marketing would lead you to believe, there is no denying that It is certainly one of the most unsettling and sadistic films in recent years. The very sense of a monstrous clown praying on and devouring children is enough to make you shudder but when they decide to present it in such a graphic manner, it all becomes even more horrific.As we all know, there is much more to horror films than just jump scares and director Andy Muschietti fully understands this, his film offering an array of techniques that mean Pennywise will get under your skin by more than just making you jump. Muschietti utilises the musical work of Benjamin Wallfisch and Chung-hoon Chung's cinematography to great effect, particularly whenever Pennywise makes an appearance. There is a fair share of CGI used in It which, rather disappointingly, takes the edge off some of the film's major set-pieces however, It remains a well crafted horror film.Coming to the performances, It features a suitably unhinged turn from Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Clown. The subtlety of some of his more sinister moments make the moments he lets loose much more impactful, certainly giving Tim Curry a run for his money as the best incarnation of the character.The real star of It though is the extremely talented group of child actors assembled for 'The Losers Club'. We spend pretty much the entire film with these kids so they had to make sure they casted actors with enough screen presence, even in their youthful years. The group share such a wonderful chemistry, both the moments of banter and care towards one another feeling so genuine that you can't help but root for them to take Pennywise down. They were all really good here but Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia 'Amy Adams Jr' Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, who we all know from Stranger Things, were the true standouts for me.It falters a little as a work of pure terror, the disturbing nature of the film striking much more of a chord for me, but it soars as a coming-of-age film, thanks to the writing and performances of the main group of characters. Bring on the second chapter!",9,5,12,10 September 2017
Detroit," Start and finish are good but the middle act is sensational
","Racial tension always has the potential to reach boiling point and Hollywood hasn't shied away from depicting such a thing happening over the years in films such as Do the Right Thing and Selma, neither being afraid to show just how ugly things can get when they go beyond the boiling point, often making for quite tough viewing. Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit is certainly a film that shares a lot of similarities with those two films.The Detroit riots led to days of violent public disorder back in July 1967, leaving parts of the city destroyed. During the riots, three African American men were murdered at the Algiers Motel. Bigelow's film opens with an animated prologue that explains the ethnic situation of Detroit in 1967 and wastes no time by getting straight into the matter of how the riots broke out. It's from here that Detroit took me by surprise a little, Bigelow choosing to spend the opening act of the film stringing together a number of sequences depicting crowd violence and police brutality, filmed almost in a documentary style. It feels as if there is no real narrative at this point however, I do like how it gives some context into how bad things got in the city throughout the riots. We are introduced to a number of characters but these introductions aren't drawn out at all, purposefully by Bigelow as she wants to focus more on the violence on the streets.Then, suddenly, the characters we've had brief introductions to are thrust together in difficult circumstances and this is where both Detroit and Bigelow are at their best. The central act of Detroit takes place within the Algiers Motel and it makes for one of the most intense and brutal sequences of film so far this year, the aforementioned tough viewing well and truly coming into effect. It's a bit of shame that what comes before and after doesn't feel of the same standard though otherwise we'd be talking about film of the year material right here.Coming to the performances, Detroit sees two exciting young British actors work together in John Boyega and Will Poulter however, the writing doesn't really allow both men to get a chance to shine. On one hand, Poulter is absolutely brilliant as Philip Krauss, a Detroit policeman who uses and abuses his position of authority to intimidate and humiliate those he comes across in the Algiers Motel, in a performance that will leave you seething with rage. Then there's Boyega as Melvin Dismukes, a security guard who tries to defuse the situation, who feels rather wasted which is annoying because Boyega is such a talented actor. He just doesn't really get anything to sink his teeth into, Poulter instead revelling in the chance to play such a vile character.Bigelow's Detroit is an important film, elevated by a tight central act, that feels a little underwritten in other places compared to her other work. That being said, it's still a very good film that you should see, even if you just go to witness Will Poulter's superb performance.",8,7,21,9 August 2017
Rocketman," Taron Egerton is electrifying in this larger than life biopic of a true legend.
","Having worked in the entertainment industry for an amazing five decades, it comes as a surprise that Rocketman is the very first biopic of such a colourful man and performer as Elton John. A string of hits and powerful personality has led to him influencing many that have followed, his legacy sure to live on for years to come.Rocketman is a retelling of Elton John's (Taron Egerton) fantastical life, from his breakthrough years to his struggles with depression, substance abuse and the acceptance of his sexual orientation.As soon as Rocketman starts, you know what sort of ride you're in for, Dexter Fletcher having a clear vision on how he wanted to portray the life of such a big character, by going big with the production. This isn't a conventional biopic by any means, Lee Hall writing it as a number of flashbacks amongst a group session during Elton's time in rehab. It isn't always big glasses and loud outfits mind as Fletcher and Hall work together, with input from Elton himself no doubt, to tell an unflinching tale of love, most importantly for yourself.Rocketman doesn't dance around the troubles in Elton's extraordinary life, his family life at a younger age setting him down the long and winding road to stardom that inevitably leads to plenty of drugs and alcohol, all while trying to navigate the homosexuality that first finds love, followed quickly by pain. It's funny when it needs to be but also incredibly touching at times.All of this comes amongst what I can only describe as a fantastical celebration of Elton's string of hits, the fantasy elements working a treat and suiting the man down to a tee. It's a proper musical by nature, so expect to be toe-tapping when he hits the big time with Crocodile Rock or even wowing a local pub with Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting), the musical numbers intertwined with specific moments in his younger life brilliantly.The musical numbers and Elton's story are major players in the film's success however, Taron Egerton's electrifying performance as Elton John is the real driving force in making this a stunning biopic. The singing is note perfect and the charisma really does ooze from the screen as Egerton, quite literally, becomes Elton. Seriously, there were a few moments where I thought they had chucked in stock footage of Elton just to mess with us but it was indeed Egerton, that's how good he is here.The supporting cast, Jamie Bell in particular as Elton's longtime songwriting collaborator Bernie Taupin, deliver alongside Egerton to make Rocketman stand-out amongst many other biopics. Richard Madden as John Reid delivers a juxtaposed performance that will really get under your skin while Stephen Graham nearly steals the show as Dick James, Elton and Bernie's first manager.There truly is no stealing the show in Rocketman mind as this is well and truly Taron Egerton's film. If Kingsman earned him a reputation as a rising star, Rocketman will make him a true star.",10,57,109,22 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Cooper and Gaga light up the screen together.
","Another year, another remake from Hollywood, this time in the shape of Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born. The third remake of the Frederic March and Janet Gaynor starring 1937 original, following the James Mason and Judy Garland 1954 and Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand 1976 starring remakes, sees Bradley Cooper and pop sensation Lady Gaga take on the iconic story. Having not seen any of the previous iterations, going in blind made the experience that little bit more special.When Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper), a seasoned musician with a major drinking problem, stumbles upon the talented Ally (Lady Gaga), an unknown singe-songwriter singing in a drag bar, the pair develop a professional and personal relationship which will change their lives forever.For a directorial debut, A Star Is Born is a simply stunning effort from Bradley Cooper. Having both produced and co-written the film too, the sense of pride and passion runs throughout in the meticulousness of just about everything this film has to offer. Cooper had me captivated for every single second of film and, for your first attempt at directing a film, that's quite something. Judging from the total silence from the audience as the credits rolled, I'm pretty sure he had us all captivated.The film is driven by two incredibly different but equally fascinating performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga. As the older and wiser musician battling with his inner alcoholic demons, Cooper is superb and delivers the best performance of his career. Lady Gaga proves any of her doubters wrong with an incredible performance that is sure to see her amongst the major contenders come awards season. As a pair, their chemistry is undeniably strong, making for such a genuine on-screen romance.The staging of the concert sequences and the songs that accompany them also play a major part in this film's success. Matthew Libatique captures the sense of playing to a huge crowd with some kinetic cinematography, much like he did in Straight Outta Compton. Pair that with Gaga's performance in the sequence where they sing 'Shallow', a song you won't be able to get out of your head, and you'll get goosebumps. It could be a moment where Ally owns the stage with full confidence but she's overcome with emotion and totally overwhelmed by the occasion, Gaga selling it beautifully.If I was a betting man, I'd say expect to hear a lot about A Star Is Born over the coming months, and deservedly so. This is a truly powerful film from Bradley Cooper that makes me want to see Lady Gaga take on more acting roles, which is something I never thought I'd be saying a few years ago.",10,7,26,29 September 2018
Wind River," Hits with such a silent yet powerful punch
","Taylor Sheridan's Wind River opens with a young woman running across the vast, cold landscape of a Native American reservation in Wyoming. Showing signs of a struggle and her eyes filled with fear of both what she's fleeing and the harsh conditions of her surroundings, it's an opening that grabs your attention within seconds. The final film in Sheridan's American frontier trilogy, having previously written Sicario and Hell or High Water, Wind River is only his second directorial effort and it's certainly one of the best films I've seen this year.After discovering the body of a young woman on a Native American reservation, hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) teams up with FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to track down whoever was responsible. What I've found to be such an impressive feature of Sheridan's work on this trilogy, concluding with Wind River, is that he lays out such a simple narrative with such powerful results. The coldness of the characters reflecting the coldness of the setting, making this quite a different film from Sheridan's other material in terms of backdrop. Not so different is the fact that Wind River is a film wonderfully driven by the writing of both its characters and narrative, the uncompromising brutality of the narrative and the film's subject making for a film you just don't want to stop watching. The atmosphere Sheridan creates through the often sparse dialogue combined with Ben Richardson's cinematography of such a vast snowy landscape leads to quite a haunting experience.Coming to the performances, Wind River, much like Sheridan's other material, doesn't feature any showy performances because it doesn't need to. Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner are both very good here, Olsen bringing an out of depth feel to Banner, similar to Emily Blunt's Kate Macer in Sicario, while Renner shines with an understatedly powerful turn as Lambert, a man who feels personally driven to help with such a case.Wind River is one of those films that hits with such a silent yet powerful punch, the final title card making this film feel much more than just a random murder mystery, truly shocking me as I read it for myself. Having concluded his American frontier trilogy with such a film as Wind River, I'm looking forward to whatever Taylor Sheridan delivers next.",10,2,6,7 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not quite a Star Wars great but Rogue One is still mightily impressive
","Bold and brave, just like the set of characters the film follows, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a Star Wars film but not as we know it. Set just before 1977's A New Hope, this doesn't continue the saga, instead going back to show a pivotal moment in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a criminal and daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a weapons designer forced by the Empire to complete their super-weapon, the Death Star, a weapon rumoured to be capable of destroying entire planets in one strike.With the Empire having such a powerful weapon at their disposal, the Rebel Alliance recruits Jyn to work with a team, led by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), to infiltrate the enemy and steal the design schematics for the Death Star, to aid them in taking down the Empire.Yes, this is a Star Wars film but that doesn't stop it from being a massive risk. Rogue One has the challenge of being set so close to the fantastic original however, Gareth Edwards does a great job in delivering a film that pays homage to events in the original trilogy while stamping its own fingerprint on the franchise.This is a war film within the Star Wars franchise and Edwards certainly makes it certainly look and feel like one. The production design is full of dirt and grit, totally missing from the prequel trilogy, and there is some quite wonderful cinematography from Greig Fraser, honing in on the close proximity of war all while still managing to make this feel like a Star Wars film. Like The Force Awakens last year, Rogue One possesses some magnificent shots that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.The combination of both of these with the special effects certainly make Rogue One such a visual treat. There were two uses of CGI that I absolutely hated and they really did distract me from what was happening in the film, one character getting a lot more screen time than I thought they should have had and the other almost looking as if no work had gone into their appearance.The writing in Rogue One, in terms of story, allows the film to move at such a brisk pace, leading to an enjoyable experience at the cinema. There are plenty of references to other Star Wars films and it all concludes with a final act that you just have to sit back and applaud. If you have trouble seeing Rogue One as a Star Wars film, this final act will persuade you to change your mind.I found the the characters to be the one thing that really held this film back from being a great Star Wars film. Jyn is just about the only one who gets any element of character development, meaning it's tough to really root for them all. There is a severe lack of characters for people to fall in love with, unlike the best of the Star Wars films. There is one returning character in Darth Vader, who I was particularly excited to see on the big screen again, and believe me when I say, there is a Vader moment that will make you lose your s**t. It's just amazing.Coming to the performances, Rogue One definitely possesses one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a Star Wars film. Felicity Jones truly brings a lot of steel to her good performances as Jyn Erso, Alan Tudyk steals a lot of scenes with his often comedic performance as K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, and Donnie Yen finally gets his chance to shine in a major American blockbuster, taking it with plenty of style too as Chirrut Imwe, a blind warrior.The other disappointing aspect of Rogue One is it's score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino. John Williams' scores bring a certain kind of magic to the Star Wars films but I just didn't feel that same sense of magic with Giacchino's score here. Disappointing for me when I know Giacchino is such a capable composer.As a whole, Rogue One is a risk well worth taking for the Star Wars franchise, opting to attempt and deliver a distinctly separate film from the rest of the franchise. It has a few issues holding it back from being great but I will certainly be heading back for repeat viewings.",8,8,16,16 December 2016
Passengers," Runs out of steam with a daft and very predictable finale
","Putting two of the biggest stars in the world right now together in a film about two people stranded on a spaceship might be a recipe for box-office success in the mind of a studio however, the real interest I had in Passengers was whether it could deliver a good enough story for the two stars to tackle. A lot of the personal success this film would have for me would come down to that.Thirty years into the Starship Avalon's one hundred and twenty year journey, carrying 5,000 passengers and 250 crew members, to colonise Homestead II, a malfunction awakens two of the passengers, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). With ninety years left of the Avalon's journey, Jim and Aurora try to figure out what exactly made them wake up so early.Now, I only saw the first trailer for Passengers so I was very surprised the way this film actually ended up going. When you look at it, it's almost as if Sony have been marketing a completely different film because when you see Passengers, you will get that there is no twist as to why they woke up, it's just that Jim wakes up first before deciding to wake Aurora up.This is where the film treads a very thin line in the story it tells. To have Jim wake up and spend a year on the ship by himself, all while growing an almost stalkerish fixation on Aurora before deciding to wake her up explores an idea I never thought this film would even entertain. I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy Passengers for its first two acts, but then comes the final act.It comes dangerously close to completely ruining the film, going for the full blown ridiculous finale that just feels totally out of place. Looking back on it, from the moment Laurence Fishburne briefly turns up as Chief Gus Mancuso, I felt the film lost its way totally. A lot of what they set up was hindered by a predictable and rather tame finale that should have been a lot braver, my preference being that they killed Pratt's character off while he was floating into space. Visually the film is top of the range, strong special effects and detailed production design really settling the audience into the setting of this ship desolate ship with only two people awake on it. I also found Thomas Newman's score to aid the film perfectly, suitably accompanying Jim on his lonely beginnings on the Avalon and then crescendoing magnificently alongside the fast-paced finale, even if it is a little daft.Coming to the performances, Passengers shows quite a new side to the cheeky and lovable Chris Pratt with his turn as Jim Preston, going from lovable to utterly creepy in half a film. It's a decision that could have backfired but Pratt handles the switch rather well. I was worried about Jennifer Lawrence phoning it in for Passengers however, I'm glad to say she actually looks like she gives a damn in this film. Overall, Passengers isn't the stunning piece of sci-fi that we wanted, almost bottling it and going for the easy way out instead. It's quite generic stuff made to be entertaining by a strong start and middle, and two leads who do work quite well together.",6,3,10,23 December 2016
Us," Jordan Peele is a filmmaking force.
","Riding on the wave of success Get Out has provided him with since 2017, Jordan Peele returns with Us, a psychological horror that promises to get under your skin even more than his debut effort managed to. Peele showed innovation aplenty with Get Out, the social commentary apparent in the film providing it with much more to say than it seems, a trend that could make its way into Us as well.When Adelaide and Gabe Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke) take their family on a break to the beach, they are faced with a fight for survival when a group of doppelgÃ¤ngers begins to terrorise them.Watching Jordan Peele's Us comes with the pleasure of trying to work out what is happening and why, much was the case with Get Out too. The film is packed with symbolism and foreshadowing that further viewings will only become more rewarding, not that this initial experience wasn't in any shape or form. This is another twisted treat from Peele, the tropes of horror executed brilliantly with the perfect amount of humour littered throughout, meaning you should probably try and see this with as big an audience as possible.Coming to the performances, the beating heart of Us is an utterly spellbinding Lupita Nyong'o in a dual role that showcases what huge talent she possesses. As Adelaide she encompasses the dread and fear of someone haunted by a childhood experience that leads to her crossing paths with Red, her doppelgÃ¤nger, who she portrays in such an effectively creepy manner. Winston Duke is great as her husband, getting the majority of the comedic moments and making them really work amongst the sheer terror the family are facing. Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex are both pretty good too as the younger members of the Wilson family, as well as excelling as their doppelgÃ¤ngers too.Peele manages to hold the audience in the palm of his hand, from the masterful opening to the closing sequence when revelations have been made, and he uses music so well in his film, Michael Abels' score aiding the tense moments to great effect.While I think Get Out is a better film, Jordan Peele does enough with Us, his sophomore effort, to show everyone that he is a filmmaking force to be reckoned with. Whatever he does next, whether it still be in the horror genre or not, I'll be there for it.",9,15,25,24 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Well worth a watch for Eurovision fans.
","The Story of Fire Saga is very silly, there's no doubt about that, but it doesn't feel as if it makes the most of being set amongst the infamous singing contest that has provided copious moments of entertainment over the years. Will Ferrell is as you'd expect Will Ferrell to be in a film like this while Rachel McAdams proves yet again that she belongs in more comedies. The songs are absolute belters and there are some very funny moments along the way however, it suffers from being a tad too long, comedies running for two hours or more will always find it hard to sustain the laughs. That being said, The Story of Fire Saga works too as a respectful love letter to the Eurovision Song Contest rather than the giant pisstake that I was expecting.",6,11,27,26 June 2020
Knives Out," Magnifique.
","The murder mystery isn't really a genre that has seen much exposure in Hollywood over recent years, studios more intent on setting up more profitable cinematic universes. Step up Rian Johnson with Knives Out, a classic whodunnit that brings us cinema's next great dysfunctional family.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy novelist, is found dead in his study, private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to investigate his death, leading to clashes with the eccentric members of Harlan's combative family.With Knives Out, Rian Johnson has woven a tapestry of delightful twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes and guessing right until the end, littered with memorable dialogue and enough family feuding to last a lifetime ensuring the path to the truth is an extremely entertaining one. It's also one of the funniest films of the year, Johnson lacing the film with intricacies that can be easy to miss but play a major part in siding against such a despicable family. The attention to detail from Johnson in his narrative is nothing short of stunning.The Thrombey family would be nothing without such a high calibre ensemble bringing each and everyone of them to life with such verve and class. Daniel Craig is the star of the show with an exquisite performance as the eccentric private eye Blanc, Craig having a ball with the southern drawl and nailing the comedic beats to a tee. Ana de Armas gives her best performance to date as Marta, Harlan's nurse, the innocence and vulnerability shining through her incredibly emotive features.There isn't one member of the ensemble who feels out of place, the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette bringing the sweetness as well as the viciousness when required. Chris Evans looks to be having an absolute blast playing a Tony Stark type character after playing the boy scout for so long in the MCU, his line deliveries having me in stitches at times. The great thing about Knives Out is that I have my favourites from an initial viewing however, the characters are all so good that my favourites could change every time I revisit it.Knives Out is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had all year, Rian Johnson serving up a real treat of a whodunnit for audiences around the world. If there's one character I'd love to see more of, it'd be Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc.",10,8,25,28 November 2019
The Irishman," Another masterpiece from Martin Scorsese.
","When it comes to crime epics, there isn't a more go-to director around than Martin Scorsese, his filmography speaking for itself, with the likes of Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed only a few of the classics of the genre he has made spanning a career of over fifty-years. The Irishman doesn't just boast a masterful filmmaker at its helm but a deliriously impressive cast full of frequent Scorsese collaborators such as, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Joe Pesci and, surprisingly working with Scorsese for the first time, Al Pacino, in its arsenal.The Irishman chronicles the life of Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a truck driver turned hitman who had ties with the Bufalino family and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).Make no mistake, the scale of The Irishman is just about as epic as you can get, Scorsese's film spanning a number of decades and the filmmaker masterfully delivering a surprisingly meditative reflection of both a hitman's life of crime and his own career. Moments feel like they could come straight out of Goodfellas or Casino yet The Irishman is an entirely different beast altogether, slow and calculated in its execution but so engrossing and hard-hitting when it needs to be.Steven Zallian's screenplay combined with Scorsese's masterful direction ensures The Irishman doesn't overstay its welcome at 209 minutes. Sure, you could say there are scenes that could be cut entirely or shortened however, it's an absolute pleasure to watch this film play out from start to finish, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography and the legendary Thelma Schoonmaker's editing only adding further quality to proceedings.The method of de-aging has been used a number of times before, most notably within the MCU however, it has never been used to this extent, the majority of this film spent with these actors in their younger years. It honestly did take a while for me to get used to it but it soon becomes seamless and makes the possibility of these actors working together throughout the ages a truly captivating cinematic reality.Coming to the performances, The Irishman features a mightily impressive cast littered with strong performers but it's the main trio of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci that really are a force to be reckoned with. De Niro is the best he's been in years as Frank Sheeran, his charismatic yet nuanced performance giving the film such a powerful driving force in the lead role. Pacino steals the show as Jimmy Hoffa in what is also his best performance in years, making his first time working with Scorsese an even more special occasion. It's Pesci, brought out of retirement especially for The Irishman, who really caught my eye with a incredibly cold and quietly unsettling performance as Russell Bufalino, a polar opposite to his performance in Goodfellas. Harvey Keitel and Stephen Graham throw their acting weight about accordingly while Anna Paquin does a lot with very few words, a true testament to a performance.The Irishman hits Netflix soon but I'm so glad I got the chance to watch this masterpiece on the big screen. For that, I'd like to say thanks to the Prince Charles Cinema and, more importantly, Martin Scorsese.",10,9,22,23 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," An utter blast
","Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",10,180,356,25 October 2017
Ready Player One," In Spielberg we trust
","Steven Spielberg is a director whose name is synonymous with Hollywood blockbusters, having played such a big part in pioneering what they are in film today. Take a look through his back catalogue and you'll see Spielberg has delivered some of the most revered blockbusters of all time. Ready Player One sees Spielberg jump back into the sci-fi fold and it's safe to say that he well and truly feels at home delivering plenty of thrills and spills.When it's revealed that James Halliday (Mark Rylance), the deceased creator and owner of the OASIS, a virtual reality world where people can live out their wildest fantasies, has left three challenges for all players to participate and gain total control of the OASIS as well as his entire fortune, it falls upon Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) a.k.a. Parzival in the OASIS to solve how Halliday's past holds the key to their future. He faces a race against time though in the shape of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), a corporation man hellbent on getting his hands on both the fortune and control of the OASIS.It's so great to see Steven Spielberg back in the genre of sci-fi, with some of my favourite films of his including Jurassic Park and E.T. coming from a genre he clearly thrives within. The idea of Ready Player One is one that would light up the eyes of a director like Spielberg, what with it's vast virtual world and array of pop culture references (including works of his own), and it's one that he takes full advantage of, delivering a film full of explosive spectacle and pulsating action.Spielberg is my favourite director and I've always been amazed by the sense of adventure he creates when crafting his films. Within the OASIS of Ready Player One, Spielberg delivers some of the most visually stunning sequences I've seen in a long time, made somewhat more spectacular by the impeccable visual effects on show, handy when a large portion of the film is set within the OASIS. The visuals combined with the kinetic energy of the action make for such a feast for the eyes and, even when there's so much happening on screen, nothing seems to get lost in the background.This was the worry going into Ready Player One; that all it would be is just a mishmash of pop culture references that ultimately amount to nothing. While the story might be quite basic and there doesn't seem to be much room for any character development, the references are used in such inventive ways throughout, the highlight being an incredibly entertaining sequence that sees Spielberg toying around with proceedings at the Overlook Hotel, proving that he still knows how to make us all jump. Kids could be left mentally scarred mind.Coming to the performances, Ready Player One features a cast who all help maintain the film's energy to varying degrees. Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are certainly actors who have very bright futures ahead of them while Ben Mendelsohn showcasing why he should be the go-to-guy for villainous roles in future projects, his turn as Sorrento here being one of the film's high points. While Ready Player One may not be Spielberg's greatest film, it provides a near two-and-a half hour experience at the cinema full of immense fun. It'll be interesting to read the source material however, for now, I'd advise anyone to just buckle up and enjoy the wild ride.",9,34,79,20 March 2018
Molly's Game," Jessica Chastain brings the fire
","Aaron Sorkin makes his directorial debut with Molly's Game, a film he also wrote, and if you've ever seen a film written by Sorkin you'll know that you're in for a film where the dialogue comes at you like bullets being sprayed from a machine gun. We've seen Sorkin write films about Facebook, baseball and Apple before but Molly's Game see Sorkin explore the world of poker to bring us the true story of Molly Bloom.Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) was known for running the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game, an entrepreneurial path chosen after injury cut her dream of skiing for the American Winter Olympics team short. It's a path that led to interactions with the Russian mafia and Bloom becoming a target for the FBI, ultimately leading to her attempting to clear her name.Right from the film's opening sequence, you know you're in for another special screenplay from Aaron Sorkin as Jessica Chastain narrates over the point where Molly Bloom had to give up her skiing career. It's fast-paced and full of a lot of nonsense however, it's the true mark of Sorkin's quality that he can fill it with so much nonsense but still have the audience feeding from the palm of his hand. Sorkin's dialogue usually brings out the best in his leads and in Jessica Chastain, Sorkin really does have one of the best leading his film. Chastain has previously proved that she is a force to be reckoned with but this is her finest hour for me, driving Molly's Game forward with such ferocity and composure. It's not only Chastain who gets to shine mind, Idris Elba is as good as he's been in a long time as Molly's defence lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, the scenes the pair share being noticeable high points of the film. There's a host of supporting characters who all add different dimensions to the narrative, Kevin Costner as the authoritative father figure, Brian d'Arcy James as the totally inept poker player Bad Brad and Chris O'Dowd as Douglas Downey, the man who introduced Molly to the mob. For a film that's so dialogue heavy, Molly's Game has a hefty runtime of nearly two-and-a-half hours however, thanks to the quickness of the screenplay and the quality of the performances, it's a film that absolutely flies by. Expect this to be a big player in the writing department come awards season.",8,10,29,3 December 2017
Moana," Top tier Disney that brings all the classic Disney traits along for an unforgettable journey
","Disney's 56th animated feature film comes in the shape of Moana, a film that takes the audience on an adventure across the ocean with the usual mix of beautiful animation, heartfelt narrative and catchy songs. Disney have already had a strong year with the likes of Zootopia and Finding Dory so the pressure was on for them to deliver a hat-trick for the year.Moana Waialiki (Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief who's tribe lives on the Polynesian island of Motunui. Having a connection with the ocean since a very young age, Moana has always been stopped by her father, Chief Tui Waialiki (Temuera Morrison), from going out beyond the reef.When she hears of the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and how he holds the key to stopping Matunui from decaying, Moana sets sail across the dangerous ocean to locate Maui and have him restore the heart of Te Fiti, an island goddess, so she can restore life to Motunui.As I've already mentioned, Moana brings a lot of classic Disney traits to the table and it does it so well, putting it up there as one of the best Disney films in recent years. The animation on show in Moana is just stunning, awash with such vibrant colours, bringing the ocean and characters to life quite brilliantly.I really enjoyed the film's writing of both narrative and characters too; the story being one that resonates with real life and having to look after our planet, along with the emotional family element that really sets the story in motion. The film is very funny as well, Heihei the rooster stealing many scenes and a nod to Mad Max: Fury Road as Moana and Maui run into a group of Kakamora pirates on the ocean. Never thought I'd ever be seeing a homage to that particular film in a Disney animation.The characters are as colourful and strong as the animation, and the voice work from Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho is top notch, both sounding as if they've fulfilled a dream of playing a character in a Disney animation. Then there are the songs of Moana, beautifully written and performed by the respective cast members, my personal favourites being You're Welcome and I Am Moana.Moana really is top tier Disney and while I think I preferred Zootopia, Moana is superior to Frozen, Disney's biggest smash-hit in the past few years. I know what I'd rather see a sequel to.",8,5,16,4 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man is home.
","When it was announced that Spider-Man was coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the world went a little bit crazy because, you know, Spider-Man is arguably the most iconic Marvel character of all time. After his brief yet unforgettable appearance in Captain America: Civil War, the anticipation levels were sky high for his first solo film within the MCU and they couldn't have chosen a more apt title than Spider-Man: Homecoming.Overawed by fighting both with and against some of the Avengers, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) tries his utmost to impress Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) with the hope that he'll be invited to join the team. Juggling the dual life of high school and superhero duties as Spider-Man proves harder than he first thought and when he comes up against Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton), who's created an array of advanced weaponry from salvaged alien technology leftover from past Avengers battles, he is put the ultimate test.With Sony and Marvel Studios settling on joint custody of Spider-Man, the time has come for him to take his rightful place in the MCU, and thanks to Jon Watts' direction and a number of great performances, he well and truly settles in as if he's never been away. Understanding that the Spider-Man origin story has been done enough means that the film picks things up right after Captain America: Civil War, with Peter Parker having been Spider-Man for a while now and struggling to live life as both a high school student and Spider-Man.The inevitable clash between the two lives is what really drives Homecoming forward as a film, the high school setting dropping us right into an environment the MCU hasn't explored before. It's here where Homecoming excels, Watts delivering plenty of funny and charming moments that wouldn't feel out of place in a John Hughes film like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which gets a neat little visual nod here.Homecoming possesses a number of action sequences that deliver their fair share of spectacle, which isn't unusual for the MCU however, they feel pretty run-of-the-mill which may come down to Watts' inexperience directing action. Watts seems more at home directing the more personal moments of the film, whether it be Peter and his best friend Ned daydreaming about girls or Tony Stark mentoring Peter in his duties as a superhero, and as I've previously mentioned, these are the moments where the film will make a connection with the audience.Coming to the performances, Tom Holland may just be the best Peter Parker/Spider-Man there's ever been on screen. He captures the innocence of Parker, the cockiness of Spider-Man and the naivety of both extremely well to give the MCU another troubled lead. The supporting cast of those we see him interact him as both Parker and Spider-Man play their part in making Homecoming such a fun film, particularly Jacob Batalon as Ned, whose friendship with Parker is one of the major strengths of the film. The presence of Tony Stark/Iron Man is nothing to worry about as he's not in the film as much as the marketing would lead you to believe.The MCU normally gets criticised for having weak villains but Michael Keaton's performance as Adrian Toomes/Vulture certainly bucks the trend. Keaton uses his facial expressions to great effect, creating an unnerving and psychotic presence around Toomes, particularly towards the end of the film. He's definitely up there as one of the better villains in the MCU so far, that's for sure.With Spider-Man: Homecoming, Marvel Studios have brought Spider-Man to his rightful home with such a refreshing film. There's a few twists and surprises along the way, plus an end credits sting that has to go down as one of their most inventive and best yet. This film only raises my excitement for Infinity War more.",8,1,6,6 July 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Grief. Tragedy. Justice. Superb.
","Here in the UK, you can tell when we're entering a new year in film when the films that are expected to be big hitters come awards season start being released week after week throughout January and February. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is certainly one of the aforementioned big hitters and deservedly so.Still feeling aggrieved and frustrated by the lack of police investigation going into the violent rape and murder of her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) hires out three billboards on a stretch of road to challenge the local police, polarising the local townsfolk in the process.Martin McDonagh made such an impression on me back in 2008 with In Bruges, a film that shook my funny bones to the core however, with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh has delivered a black comedy driven by an emotional complexity unlike any of his previous films. Grief, tragedy and justice are all key themes in Three Billboards and McDonagh incorporates them brilliantly into his film through both the narrative and the memorable characters he has written. I howled with laughter at In Bruges and, while Three Billboards is full of some devilish laughs, McDonagh's latest evoked far more emotion from me than I was expecting. The story takes a few turns that I didn't expect it to and I have to applaud McDonagh for that.As strong as the writing is, Three Billboards is really driven home by a phenomenal ensemble cast, led by an exceptional Frances McDormand as the mother seeking justice in her own way. McDormand is fantastic at showing both the hard exterior and emotionally driven interior to Mildred, akin to the character she portrayed so brilliantly in Fargo. The supporting performances given by are of the highest order too, Woody Harrelson as the police chief living with his own personal troubles and Sam Rockwell as the officer with a penchant for unlawful policing, the latter making himself a major contender for Best Supporting Actor awards in the process.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a profound piece of cinema that presents much more to its audience than any of the trailers suggest. If you're a fan of films with great dialogue and even better performances, this is a film you will not want to miss. What a start to 2018!!",10,2,5,7 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Still cannot believe the Skywalker Saga is over.
","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker marks the end of an era for Star Wars, an era that began in 1977 when George Lucas birthed a franchise that would change the landscape of cinema forever. Being the final chapter of the nine-film Skywalker saga, The Rise of Skywalker is a lot of film to digest, J. J. Abrams with the daunting task of closing the iconic saga in a fitting way.Having escaped the clutches of the First Order at the end of The Last Jedi, the surviving members of the Resistance band together to face off with the enemy one final time.Say what you want about any of the films, there's a certain magic in the air you can feel when watching a Star Wars film, a major reason as to why so many people have fallen in love with the franchise over the years. That same magic was in the air as The Rise of Skywalker began with the opening crawl in a packed IMAX screening, generations of families and scores of friend groups all bubbling with anticipation.J. J. Abrams delivers a final chapter that moves at a break-neck pace, particularly for the first half of the film, full of dazzling spectacle and a number of call-backs to other films in the saga, which should come as no surprise due to this closing it all off. The script features a fair amount of exposition that can get quite grating at times, as well as some comedic moments that don't land as intended. The pace of the first half leaves hardly any room for the narrative or character moments to breathe however, there is a lot to get through here so I quite enjoyed how quickly it moved along.It all leads to a pretty epic final act that had me right on the edge of my seat, including one of the great Star Wars moments that gave me goosebumps. The visual effects are, of course, of the highest quality, bringing the action to life with a stunning amount of detail. With this being the last film of the Skywalker saga, it means it is also the last time we will hear a new Star Wars score from the legendary John Williams, and he delivers another spectacular score to accompany the film.Coming to the performances, the clear stand-out in The Rise of Skywalker, as with the other films of the sequel trilogy is Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. The confliction he faces on his journey is what makes him the most compelling character and Driver really does great to show the pain it brings Ren. Daisy Ridley has been a great find from this trilogy and she's good again as Rey, but not as good as she was in the previous two films, meaning her character arc doesn't end up being as powerful as it could have been. Anthony Daniels has been the only mainstay throughout the entire saga so I was glad to see him get a lot to do as C-3PO, getting a lot of laughs in the process.The Skywalker saga is over and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker concludes it in a very satisfying manner, for me personally anyway. This conclusion had me enthralled from start to finish, damn near bringing me to tears in its final act, and for the joy it brought me along with the other films in the saga, I have to say a big thank you to Star Wars. It may be a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away but it will never be forgotten.",9,1,5,22 December 2019
Lion," Such a powerful film!
","Missing child cases are ones that really do send a shiver down the spine, the uncertainty of the child's whereabouts or whether in fact they are actually still alive being the major worries. You can't possibly understand the effect it must have on a family. In Garth Davis' Lion, we see the effects of such a case on the child rather than the family left behind. Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a five-year-old child living in a remote Indian village with his mother, brother and sister. Spending his days helping his brother steal coal from trains, Saroo joins his brother for a job one night but finds himself lost and on a train to Calcutta, nearly two-thousand kilometres from his home village.Surviving many challenges and meeting various faces, Saroo is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Twenty-five years later, Saroo (Dev Patel) decides to track his lost family down.I must start by saying that I absolutely loved Lion, a film that deals with such a traumatising true story in such a delicate manner. Garth Davis splits the film into two halves, the first focusing on Saroo as a five-year-old lost in such a densely populated city and the second looking at Saroo as a grown man, so far away from the life he left years before. It is quite tough to watch at times, particularly some scenes of a young Saroo trying to survive on the streets of Calcutta however, Davis' film builds to a truly beautiful conclusion that left me emotionally destroyed.I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. Davis plays it out brilliantly and the inclusion of real life footage in the end credits, along with startling facts about how many children go missing in India, just added more power to the already powerful film.Lion doesn't just get its power from the story but from the tremendous performances also. I have always liked Dev Patel as an actor but this is the first time I've watched him give such a powerhouse of a performance as a grown up Saroo struggling to cope with tracking down his lost family. From here, Patel could really go places, starting with awards recognition in the early new year.Sunny Pawar deserves a special mention for his performance as a young Saroo, lost and alone in such a unfamiliar place. It's always a risk to have such a large portion of the film led by such a young actor but it's ultimately one that pays off greatly in Lion. There's also fine support on offer from Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, ensuring the quality runs right throughout the film.Lion is a film that I urge you to go and see because a film like this needs the coverage and its subject matter is something people need to be made more aware of.",10,147,183,14 December 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Malek will rock you!!
","Queen are and will always be one of the most iconic bands of all time, there is no denying that. Fronted by Freddie Mercury, the kind of showman that comes around once in a lifetime, they rocked the world with a number of hits that remain as classic anthems, recognisable to many around the world. I grew up listening to their songs so Bohemian Rhapsody was always going to be film to keep an eye out for me.Starting in the early 1970s, Bohemian Rhapsody chronicles the formation of Queen and the life of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), leading to their legendary appearance at the Live Aid concert in 1985.An icon such as Freddie Mercury needs a memorable performance and in the shape of Rami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody certainly has that. Malek transforms into Mercury, mannerisms and all, and the end result is just superb, Malek delivering a performance of gravitas and showmanship akin to Mercury. There's also a slight sense of vulnerability to Malek's performance, evoking an emotional response to how hard Mercury's life must have been while handling life-changing events.Malek shares such a great chemistry with other cast members portraying the rest of Queen; Gwilym Lee as Brian May, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor and Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon. It's great fun to watch them interact with one another and see how some of Queen's most famous songs were created and brought to life in the recording studio. Lucy Boynton impresses as Mary Austin, Mercury's lifelong companion, but due to the creative choice in making this more family friendly she feels a little underused. There's also an unrecognisable Mike Myers to look out for in the film which adds a bit of light relief to proceedings.The family friendly approach to this biopic means restrictions on how much they could delve into the personal life of Mercury so, if you're expecting an unflinching insight into his life, you won't get it here. That isn't to say Bohemian Rhapsody avoids any issues in his life to make everything seem sunny because this film has some powerful moments in relation to Mercury's AIDS diagnosis, the moment he breaks the news to his fellow band members really striking an emotional chord with me.Then comes the emotional crescendo that is the entire Live Aid performance the whole film has been leading to. The old Wembley Stadium is resurrected through visual effects wizardry while Mercury is resurrected through the brilliant Malek, strutting his stuff with such stage presence to admire. Seeing that iconic performance brought to life in such an admirable manner made this closing sequence, particularly the 'We Are The Champions' segment, such a joyous experience.Ending on such a high note means you just can't help but leave the cinema with a beaming smile. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of Queen and one of the greatest showman to ever live, Freddie Mercury, and the film does a fine job in making sure both will never be forgotten.",8,4,7,25 October 2018
Baby Driver," A slice of fried cinematic gold
","Edgar Wright may not have made too many films however, he's one of the few directors working today that can generate such a buzz for his projects, thanks to their originality and sheer entertainment value. His sixth film, Baby Driver, has been no stranger to positive word of mouth and it is well and truly deserved. Believe the hype because Baby Driver is a pure slice of fried cinematic gold.After being coerced into working for a crime boss, young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail, finding love along the way.Wasting no time in dropping the audience right into the frenetic action, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is relentlessly paced throughout, building in kinetic energy as each chase sequence rises in intensity and magnitude, leaving you well and truly on the edge of your seat. Featuring incredible stunt work and some swift cinematography from Bill Pope, Baby Driver possesses some of the best chase sequences I've ever seen on film.Another aspect of the film that elevates it to another level is the soundtrack Wright expertly utilises for not only the major chase sequences, but the smaller scale scenes too. Every song works so well, whether it be Tequila accompanying a shootout or Hocus Pocus playing over the film's major chase sequence. Seriously though, the chase sequence that sees Baby trying to escape via both car and foot is just insanely well put together, Hocus Pocus being the real cherry on top.Coming to the performances, Baby Driver features a small yet impressive cast, ranging from relative newcomer Ansel Elgort through to the seasoned pro that is Kevin Spacey. Elgort may not be as charismatic as you'd think however, he really does suit the role of Baby incredibly well because it isn't a role that requires the most charismatic of actors. There are other roles in the film for that, one of them being Jamie Foxx as Bats, a member of the heist team who has a penchant for violence and running his mouth. This is the best I've seen Foxx for a while and, along with the rest of the cast, he looks like he's having a ball.Edgar Wright's Baby Driver has an old school crime caper feel to it but with Wright's sharp writing and knack for humour plus the amazing chase sequences at hand, it really does become something else entirely. This is sure to be one of the most original and thrilling films you could see all year.",10,24,47,21 June 2017
Justice League," Major step backwards after Wonder Woman
","Before Justice League, the DCEU took a number of films to finally find its feet with Wonder Woman, and when it finally did, there was hope that the future was bright for this cinematic universe. With Justice League, I can't help but feel they've taken a huge step backwards in terms of quality because this film is an utter mess.After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Earth is seen as a defenceless and fearful target for Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). With an attack imminent and a restored faith in humanity, Batman (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of other, more powerful beings; Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to fight to save the world. Justice League very much feels like a film made by two directors with differing visions for the final product. Extensive reshoots and additional scenes were written and directed by Joss Whedon after Zack Snyder's departure from the project due to personal reasons. You can really tell which scenes have been added late on, making for a film that ultimately shifts away from the tone established by Snyder in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I don't want to bring up studio interference again when talking about a superhero film but this really does stink of it unfortunately.This should feel like an event film but it just doesn't at all, which is really disappointing for me. The DCEU have blatantly rushed into Justice League and with a mere two hour runtime, they've crammed way too much into the plot. I get trying to streamline the film however, this is a case where the extra minutes are needed to allow the film to breathe.It's an unusual beast though this film as it feels like way too much going on in such a short space of time but it does certainly have it's entertaining moments, mainly when the team are together. There's a few decent action sequences, the finale sadly being just an overblown mess of CGI, and some of the characters really get their chance to shine but it's nowhere near as epic as it probably should and could have been.Coming to the performances, Justice League features a dynamic between the team that mostly works but also feels incredibly forced at times. The best thing about the film is easily Ezra Miller's performance as Barry Allen/Flash, Miller nailing the giddiness and unheroic nervousness perfectly, and he steals the whole film from all the other heroes. Look out for a hilarious first meeting between Flash and Superman which had the audience in stitches.Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot don't perform as well as they have in these roles before, which I felt might be down to the jarring shift in tone that doesn't serve them so well. Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher are served better by the film's tone however, Fisher falls into the background even when it feels like they're really trying to give him something to do.I had such high hopes for Superman in Justice League, particularly the moment of his return, but I can't help but feel let down by the result. Henry Cavill certainly deserves better than this, his lines being so awful and the CGI cover-up of his moustache being one of the most distracting things I've ever seen in a film. Unfortunately, weak villains are a bit too common in superhero films these days and Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, is arguably one of the worst of all time. Not only a giant CGI atrocity, Steppenwolf doesn't really feel like much of a threat at all, which is bizarre seeing as he's supposed to challenge the team. Justice League is thankfully better than Suicide Squad however, when you stand it up against something like Wonder Woman, it goes down like a lead balloon. It's almost as if there's a lack of respect from the studio towards one of the great superhero teams of comic-book history.",4,1,2,18 November 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan delivers yet again
","Christopher Nolan is a director who doesn't really do things by halves, so when it was announced that his latest film would be a war film, the levels of anticipation I had for it went through the roof. He's directed some of my favourite films so to see Nolan make a war film for the first time, particularly about something like Dunkirk, was always going to be one of my most anticipated films of the year.As 400,000 men wait to be evacuated from Dunkirk beach with the enemy closing in, Dunkirk follows the efforts of men on land, at sea and in the air who fought so bravely to make it possible for them to return home to Britain.Desperation runs rife during war and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk doesn't waste any of its runtime is depicting just how desperate a situation it was as men waited to be taken home, not knowing when the enemy would strike next. Nolan's boldest decision in Dunkirk is to not show one German soldier throughout and it really adds to the film's intensity, the fear of the men trapped on the beach fully embedding itself in the audience's mind as a result.The narrative choice was one that surprised me but, while it took me a few minutes to work out exactly how it was panning out, it's a choice that makes Dunkirk unlike any war film I've ever seen. The three narrative threads the film follows take place over different time periods however, Nolan ensures they come together rather magnificently, intercutting between each narrative seamlessly thanks to Lee Smith's sharp editing.Nolan has formed some incredible collaborative partnerships throughout his career, most notably with Hans Zimmer who has scored a number of his films. Zimmer really feels as if he tries to outdo his previous works each and every time, which is only a good thing for us, and his work on Dunkirk is up there with his finest to date. The inclusion of the ticking clock superbly fitting in with the theme of time and emphasising the desperation of the situation.A relatively shorter collaborative partnership in comparison is that between Nolan cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who first worked with Nolan on Interstellar. Just like Interstellar, van Hoytema's breathtaking visuals fit with Nolan's narrative superbly well, accentuating the scale of the operation at Dunkirk even in such a close-knit narrative.Coming to the performances, Nolan's Dunkirk features an ensemble cast who all impress despite having to work with very little character development. People may find it hard to connect with the film as a result however, I felt for these characters as much as I have in films with well-rounded characters so the lack of character development didn't really hinder my experience. It was a real pleasure to watch actors like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh bring their usual qualities to a film but it was even better to see acting newcomers in Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles, yes Harry Styles, make their mark in Nolan's film.Myself and other film fans may sound like broken records when describing each new Nolan film as a masterpiece however, when the man keeps on making the films he does, it's certainly justified. More so because Dunkirk is exactly that, a masterpiece.",10,6,12,31 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Redefines the word epic within the superhero genre.
","Decimated and beaten. With all the dust settled (sorry) from the end of Infinity War, this is how Avengers: Endgame begins for earth's mightiest heroes. After 21 previous films and 11 years building to this point in the MCU, the expectations for Endgame are undoubtedly huge and theories on how they will conclude the Infinity Saga have been running wild.After Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half the living population in the universe, what's left of the Avengers must reassemble once more to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.It's near impossible to discuss the narrative of Endgame without spoiling the film for everyone so the best I can do is that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a great job in giving the film three distinctive acts. Each act offers a range of different emotions but all three of them together combine to make a superhero film that really does define exactly what an epic is, working as a love letter to the entire backlog of MCU films and their audience in the process.The Russo brothers, who have been at the helm for, now including Endgame, four of the very best MCU films, really do deserve all the praise they get for how they handle the roster of characters on show. Being the culmination of the Infinity Saga, there are some huge moments that provide such a satisfying pay-off for anyone who's been majorly invested in these stories and characters, like myself, since Iron Man back in 2008. The brothers know how much these characters mean to some so it's great to see them ensure a rousing finale is provided for all to sit back and admire.The action is rather subtle for the first two acts but it's delivered amongst some fantastic callbacks that feel deeply nostalgic, even though they're only from within the past decade. There's a number of brilliant surprises along the way that brought out nothing but a feeling of sheer joy. It's when the film reaches it's third and final act where things reach such a level of crowd-pleasing fan service that I couldn't help but let out a few screams. Trust me though, I wasn't the only one. It's as big as expected, particularly on an IMAX screen where the film really does flourish, and there's one moment in particular that floored me, a shot that will go down as one of the greatest in the superhero genre.Coming to the performances, Endgame really does belong to the original six members of the initial Avengers cast; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. With a film juggling so many characters, these six get the majority of screen time and Downey Jr. and Evans are the two major stand-outs in Endgame, both giving possibly their best performances in their respective roles. Hemsworth continues to deliver on the comedic aspect of Thor while Ruffalo brings probably my favourite iteration of the Hulk within the MCU to life brilliantly. Johansson and Renner have always felt like the Avengers no one really cares about however, I think things might be about to change because they get a real chance to shine in this one.Outside of the original six, the rest of the cast (and what a cast) just suit their roles down to a tee. Paul Rudd has a larger role than I thought he'd have and that's a good thing because the man just brings the entertainment factor to the team that feels different to what everyone else brings. Josh Brolin returns as Thanos and, while his presence isn't as impactful as in Infinity War, it's great to see the performance of an actor like Brolin brought to life through the motion-capture wizardry that we know looks seamless enough now to not hinder a film.Accompanied by Alan Silvestri's brilliantly rousing score, Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event for the ages. Not only is it the closing chapter of a 22 film arc, it's a celebration of what makes these films and their characters so special to the millions that have supported the MCU since its inception back in 2008 with Iron Man. It's a sprawling epic that will make you laugh hard one moment before reducing you to tears the next, and if that's not enough, even the end credits are suitably epic for such a triumphant finale.",10,2,5,26 April 2019
The Favourite," Twisted Pleasures.
","It's safe to say director Yorgos Lanthimos has been pretty hit or miss for me, The Lobster leaving me bored stiff but The Killing of a Sacred Deer leaving me in a trance like state. Both were pretty out-there so I went into The Favourite expecting more of the same and, with Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone as the leads of the film, it's hard not to get a little excited for.Early 18th century England and a frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits on the throne. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who runs things in the background, vies for her attention with newcomer Abigail (Emma Stone), in a battle of wits that escalates to the point of no return.It's an absolute pleasure to watch a trio like Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone bounce off one another in The Favourite, each of them devilishly good in their respective roles. Weisz and Stone in particular revel in their character's battle for the attention of Colman's royal figure. Out of the three, I found myself enjoying Weisz's performance the most however, the beauty of a film like this with as strong performances as these, is that that could easily change with every viewing.There's some solid support on show in The Favourite as well, Nicholas Hoult's rather pompous Robert Harley proving to be a real snake in the grass if ever I've seen one. Hoult has always been an exciting young talent and working in a film like this will do no harm to his reputation.Yorgos Lanthimos has ventured in comedy before with The Lobster, with incredibly mixed results that had me very sceptical about this film. What I can say is that, while a few of the jokes went right over my head, there is a lot to enjoy in the screenplay from Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, the wit and venom firing at rapid rates throughout.With a strong screenplay and a string of fine performances on show, The Favourite is quite an intriguingly fun way to start 2019 at the cinema.",8,2,3,5 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," It's all been leading to this...
","Ten years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was birthed with Iron Man, a supremely confident film which resurrected a career and started a shared universe of unprecedented proportions. Eighteen films later and an impressive number of superheroes introduced on the roster so far, we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War, a film so hugely anticipated that even hiding under a rock wouldn't let you escape it. With relationships shattered after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers must team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put a stop to Thanos (Josh Brolin), a mad titan hell bent on collecting all the Infinity Stones and bringing balance to the universe.The Russo brothers were the ones handed the unenviable task of bringing together pretty much every single superhero introduced so far in the MCU and having them share the screen without the film becoming a complete mess. Having achieved such great things with Captain America: Civil War, there was nobody I'd rather have take on the challenge. Now with Avengers: Infinity War, they've managed to deliver a non-stop thrill ride that is well and truly worth the ten years of character and story building it took to get to this point.Due to the balancing act of reintroducing characters and the film's narrative, things do take a little amount of time to really get going however, it's very much a necessity and it makes for such a worthwhile second act as our heroes team up to take on Thanos. Thor coming across the Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange trying to tame Tony Stark's ego, both sets meeting for the first time, makes for an entertaining adventure and once again proves that these MCU films are at their best when these characters interactions are played out so well. When it comes to the action side of things, driven by superior visual effects and such ferocious scale, Infinity War is one of the craziest films I've ever laid my eyes upon. The team-ups that play out in this film are exciting enough but then the moments that the Russo brothers deliver with them take them to the next level. It's really expected in today's cinema to see such grand visual effects, particularly in action sequences, but what really stunned me was how incredible Thanos looked, the detail in his features making him so much more of an intimidating figure. More on that guy later. Infinity War features probably the most A-list cast of all time so you'd expect them all to get a major amount of screen time for this film to run smoothly. It's shared as equally as possible, some getting a bit more to do than others, and it's a tactic that pays off, both in terms of narrative and spectacle. Robert Downey Jr. has been synonymous with the role of Iron Man for the past ten years but it doesn't stop him from giving it his all here, the combination of his assurance and naivety as Iron Man making for a dangerous cog in the Avengers wheel as they suit up to take on Thanos. I could go through all the performances but Downey Jr.'s is the one out of the heroes that stood out for me.I mentioned how Thanos is brought to life through amazing visual effects earlier but none of it would be possible without Josh Brolin's motion-capture performance in the role. Thanos takes no time in showing just how much trouble the Avengers are in, his physical presence obviously giving him a bit of an advantage however, Brolin's voice work and facial expressions bring a whole new dimension to the character. Furthermore, Thanos is given plenty of screen time to delve into a bit of his backstory, adding an emotional weight and gravitas which in turn leads to him becoming one helluva villain, the best in the MCU by a mile.Avengers: Infinity War is event cinema at its finest, the balance of comedy and drama works wonders, as do these characters forced together to fight the true evil threatening the universe. There's plenty of crowd-pleasing moments as well as a fair share of crowd-shocking moments, the Russo brothers closing the film out rather brilliantly. Don't forget though, there's more to come when the Avengers return next year so, for now, it's time to take a deep breath and think about what you've just witnessed.",10,4,12,27 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's La La Land
","Quentin Tarantino loves cinema, there is absolutely no denying that. With that being said, there was probably no one better suited to making a film such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood than him, with its sun-soaked framing of Los Angeles and array of colourful characters serving as an ode to the Golden Age of Hollywood.It's 1969 and faded Hollywood actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), along with his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), find themselves struggling to find fame and stay relevant amidst the end of Hollywood's Golden Age.Plenty has been made of the narrative choices and how prominent a role Margot Robbie has to play in the film prior to its release but I feel these people have missed the idea of the film and just need something to post about to keep hits coming on their sites. Tarantino has made a love letter to an era of Hollywood that majorly inspired him, and Robbie's role, as with others throughout the film, have a small part to play in a much bigger tapestry. More on that later though.The main focus here is Dalton and Booth, both on their friendship and their desire to keep working amidst an ever-changing Hollywood landscape. It feels a little restrained for a Tarantino film however, that only makes it a more interesting and personal piece of work from the eccentric filmmaker. Because of that, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood becomes one of his most emotional films to date, the journey Dalton goes on in particular driving the film forward to one hell of a finale, bringing the violence you'd expect in a Tarantino film.The restraint shown in places doesn't mean this doesn't feel like a Tarantino film at all, the exquisite cinematography from Robert Richardson sweeping between Hollywood sets and lavish lifestyles. There is of course intricate details in the production design that Tarantino just wouldn't make a film without, as with the costume designs, and the choice of music for the soundtrack is so on-point that Hollywood in the late 60s really is brought to life in fantastic fashion.Coming to the performances, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is led by two great performances from two accomplished actors in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. There's a number of scenes where the two just hang out together and, thanks to their dynamic chemistry and well-written dialogue, I could have spent hours on end in their company. DiCaprio is utterly brilliant in the role of Dalton, a man so scared of being forgotten and left behind, while Pitt shines as Booth, both men having worked with Tarantino before so effectively.There's a whole host of supporting characters and cameos throughout, some coming in anecdotal flashbacks, that some may see as over-indulgence from Tarantino but I felt it kept the ball rolling on quite a long film. Margot Robbie has the most prominent appearance of all the supporting characters and, while her Sharon Tate is used very sparingly, Robbie certainly makes a lasting impression, her undeniable screen presence lighting up the film.It's by no means his best film however, Quentin Tarantino has made another film in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that will be regarded as a classic in the years to come. Some have said it's far too long for the story it's trying to tell but I'd happily spend more time in this world with these characters.",10,33,52,18 August 2019
Get Out," Believe the hype...
","Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.Black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) visit Rose's parents for the weekend, where they will meet Chris for the very first time. Staggered by their behaviour from the very off, Chris begins to think all is not right in the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener).I absolutely loved Get Out as both a psychological and satirical horror, Jordan Peele's imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker. Right from the opening sequence, which is one of the best openings to a horror I've seen, I knew this film was going to be special. It felt almost as if I was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut, Peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia.The writing is spot on as well, Peele's background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror. Peele has clearly made Get Out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes, wondering where the film will turn next, which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film. As well as being genuinely creepy, Get Out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve, leaving the audience in the palm of Peele's hand.Peele's confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through Toby Oliver's swift cinematography, akin to work seen in The Shining, and both Michael Abels haunting score and songs picked by Peele to accompany his twisted film.Coming to the performances, Get Out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as Chris Washington, impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows. Expect to see much more of Kaluuya in the future.Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as Rose's parents, who take an immediate interest in Chris' life, both past and present. Get Out gets its truly unsettling performances from Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson as Georgina and Walter, hired by Dean's father. They both have a stand-out scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to. Lil Rel Howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of Chris' best friend, Rod, who doesn't just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it.Get Out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and, as a directorial debut, has to go down as of the best I've seen from Jordan Peele. He's already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and, if they continue to be as good as his debut, I cannot wait.",10,89,184,9 March 2017
A Quiet Place," One of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.
","Horror has been flourishing in the past few years with a number of releases proving you can actually scare an audience if you put the time and effort into the craft of a film. John Krasinski, most famous for playing the role of Jim Halpert in The Office, brings us a new horror in the form of A Quiet Place, and the result is one of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.Evelyn and Lee Abbott (played by real life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski) live with their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), on a farm. They live every day in silence to survive the threat of creatures that hunt by sound.The simplicity of the concept makes A Quiet Place such a fascinating prospect but it's the execution that excels it to soaring heights. Krasinski has crafted a horror film that grabs you in a vice-like grip from the very first shot, not letting go until the end credits start to roll, honing in perfectly on the use of sound and silence for some of the most intense sequences in recent memory.The fear factor in A Quiet Place comes from the tension and suspense Krasinski develops throughout, a true standout sequence being when a heavily pregnant Evelyn finds herself evading a creature as she goes into labour. It's moments like this one that had me gripping the arms of my seat and holding my breath numerous times throughout. Coming to the performances, A Quiet Place possesses the rarest of the rare in horror films with a cast who all deliver great performances. Parents should always be protective of their children but the situation they find themselves in here adds another layer to that and Blunt and Krasinski excel in showing the desperation they face to keep their children safe. Child actors always make me feel a little cautious going into a film however, both are very good here, Simmonds in particular. As a deaf actress, Simmonds adds an authenticity to proceedings and her performance is one not to be overlooked.There were a few scenes I wish Krasinski had elaborated on more but those are just a few minor issues I had that can take a back seat to the ingenuity shown in the crafting of a horror film that has the makings of a classic. It's worth noting that the entire audience was in total silence throughout, a sign that this film is well and truly having the desired effect.",10,261,547,3 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Summer loving'... had me a blast
","Luca Guadagnino made quite an impression on me as a filmmaker with A Bigger Splash, a film that combined an engaging narrative with some fantastic performances. With his latest film, Call Me by Your Name, Guadagnino certainly has the potential to repeat the trick and deliver more of the same.When Oliver (Armie Hammer), a graduate student, arrives to stay with the family of his professor in northern Italy, he meets Elio (Timothée Chalamet), his professor's son. What follows is a summer full of music, food and romance that will forever change their lives.Rather impressively, Luca Guadagnino follows A Bigger Splash with just as an engaging film however, he shows a much softer hand when dealing with the sensual nature of a film such as Call Me by Your Name. It truly is a beautiful piece of cinema, Guadagnino's direction of the intimate coming-of-age narrative being a real triumph.There's some genuinely fantastic dialogue included in the screenplay written by Guadagnino, James Ivory and Walter Fasano. The subtlety of the comedy is great but it's the poignancy of the words when relationships come into play that will stay with the audience, particularly a moment shared between Elio and his father towards the end of the film. It's silently powerful stuff.Coming to the performances, Call Me by Your Name features two leads in Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer who share such a natural and fitting chemistry. It felt much like that shared between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in Carol, effortless and becoming much more impactful as a result. Chalamet in particular has a very bright future ahead of himself. There's also a fine performance from Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father to look out for, balancing the comedy and emotion expertly.I expect people to make comparisons between Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight given the nature of their subject matter however, I'd rather not see people try and play them off against one another because they both deserve such high praise. Being in the company of such a film is a major achievement for a film like Call Me by Your Name.",10,56,107,23 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The ship has well and truly sailed for Pirates of the Caribbean
","Pirates of the Caribbean has done very well for itself, considering it's a franchise that came about from the popularity of a theme park ride at Disneyland. Taking plenty of money at the box-office over the four films so far, the fifth film, Dead Men Tell No Tales or Salazar's Revenge here in the UK (annoyingly) has been unleashed in cinemas. Could it provide the franchise with a much needed energy boost after the underwhelming On Stranger Tides?When Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) escapes from the Devil's Triangle, he sets about getting revenge on Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the man who caused Salazar and his crew to perish and remain cursed. With the help of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), Jack Sparrow must search the seas for the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that gives whoever is in possession power over the seas.I don't really no why but I went into Salazar's Revenge with a sense of optimism that it would provide the franchise its best film since The Curse of the Black Pearl some fourteen years ago. Unfortunately the result is a film that feels as uninspired as the previous entry. I suppose the warning signs of franchise fatigue were there but this should have been a much better film than it turned out.Back when Pirates of the Caribbean began, it was a simple film that blew people away with how entertaining and fresh it all felt. As the franchise has gone on though, the films have become weighed down with too many plot points and a feeling of staleness that makes for a more dreary experience as a viewer. Where Salazar's Revenge makes its biggest mistake is with the narrative. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty simple story however, they try to chuck in subplots that just feel so forced that it doesn't allow the audience to connect emotionally with either the characters or the narrative properly. Decisions like that always feel to me as if they made them as they were making the film and would have been better left to remain as an idea.A major strength of the franchise has been the stellar visual effects and, while they are still mostly impressive here, there are certain points where it looks unfinished and cheap. Salazar himself just looks ghastly in comparison with the magnificent work on Davy Jones earlier in the franchise. They do aid the action sequences immensely mind, even if there is only one really imaginative sequence that comes right at the start of the film. Just a shame that they don't make the most of having zombie sharks and that the finale is really dull.One of the other major strengths of these films is the riveting score that has accompanied each and every film. That is no different in Salazar's Revenge as Geoff Zanelli composes a score that captures the swashbuckling essence of the film rather well. I will always hum along to the main theme as it plays over the end credits.Coming to the performances, Salazar's Revenge sees Johnny Depp once again lazily play the character that has done so much for his career. It doesn't help that Sparrow is now written as a man who just falls over and screams all of the time but Depp couldn't look more unenthused if he tried. I can't even say Geoffrey Rush was a highlight in this one because even he looks as if he's given up on the film. Javier Bardem makes a valiant effort to make it feel as if there is actually something at stake in this film with his villainous turn as Salazar however, it's nothing that will be remembered.I was actually surprised at how much I took to the new characters portrayed by Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. I haven't really seen much of either before but I found myself more interested in what their respective characters were getting up to. Fourteen years ago I would have said Jack Sparrow is a character I can't wait to see more but now I wouldn't mind if they got rid of him totally. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both return a full ten years after their last appearances as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Bloom getting a little more screen time whereas Knightley feels a little shoehorned in at the end, which feels a bit disrespectful seeing as she was one of the main characters of the original trilogy.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is luckily not the worst film of the franchise, an honour still held by On Stranger Tides. What it is though is a lacklustre effort that shows the world that the ship has well and truly sailed for this particular franchise.",4,18,38,26 May 2017
Hidden Figures," Inspirational stuff!
","The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union remains as one of the most fascinating events in human history, mainly due to the technological aspect of it all. As the title Hidden Figures suggests, there's much more to the whole story than just the technological aspect and I was unaware of it all.Hidden Figures tells the fascinating true story of a group of female African-American mathematicians, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), who played a major part in calculating vital data for NASA during the early years of the US space program.The feel-good factor of Hidden Figures is what makes it such an entertaining film, whether it be down to the performances or the screenplay, or even the music which features some original tracks by Pharrell Williams. The film focuses around the struggle three African-American women had in having their voices heard in a profession where the majority of workers were white males and the feel-good side of the film makes the film falter a bit in trying to get this struggle across. It's still quite hard to believe just how bad things were back then and I have to say the film feels a little guilty of glossing over these issues. With that in mind, the approach taken by Theodore Melfi makes for an infectious film that becomes incredibly hard to resist.The screenplay from Melfi and Allison Schroeder is one of the film's highlights, surprisingly funny and pacey enough to stop the film from dragging, serving both the inspirational story and the defiant characters incredibly well.Coming to the performances, Hidden Figures possesses a talented cast who all play their part in telling this story. Taraji P. Henson leads the main trio with a steely performance as Katherine Johnson, the woman with a brilliant calculator-like mind that helped NASA make giant leaps towards their goal. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae complete the trio and they both deliver wonderful performances in such different ways. Spencer has been getting all the award nominations but I couldn't help but feel Monae deserved them more as she has one of the best scenes of the film. It sounds odd to say but Hidden Figures played out like an educational film for me as I had no idea about the behind the scenes of the Space Race. Hidden Figures can stand proud as an important and inspirational film that teaches you must decide who you want to be and never let anybody tell you any different.",8,1,7,20 February 2017
1917," A truly great feat of war filmmaking.
","War is a horrible act, there is no escaping that. Films have depicted that for a number of years, many making sure they capture the true horror of war for all to see. With 1917, Sam Mendes delivers a war film like nothing I've ever seen before, throwing the audience right on the frontline with a truly immersive experience.Two young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.1917 is a feat of filmmaking within the war genre, filmed to look like one continuous take, and it may just be the best film from Sam Mendes yet. The long take can be quite gimmicky however, its use here aids the storytelling in such a way that you can't help but feel as if you're in the middle of the war yourself. You're there with the two young soldiers, whether it be cautiously crossing No Man's Land or running from enemy troops, up close and personal throughout, and it's just such a relentlessly thrilling film that left me breathless by the end.The camerawork in 1917 is utterly stunning, Roger Deakins proving once again just how much of a genius he really is. The closeness of it all lets us get to know just who these men are and what exactly is it they are fighting for, all while portraying just how suffocating war can be with some exhilarating yet anxiety inducing set-pieces. Accompany that with Thomas Newman's beautiful score and 1917 becomes an even more powerful beast, the soaring crescendo towards the end in particular hitting me with a wave of emotion.1917 may be technical marvel but it wouldn't be anything without the two lead performances, George MacKay in particular. Both he and Dean-Charles Chapman make this a story to really care about as they deliver performances of both bravery and fear, the latter making this quite a tough watch at times. Other than these two, 1917 is a who's who of major British talent making up the numbers, Mark Strong being the one I just know had to make an appearance.It's only January but I doubt many films will come close to topping 1917 in 2020, a true masterpiece that will no doubt be a future classic. I would certainly be happy with this walking away with Best Picture at the Academy Awards and for George MacKay to be getting a Best Actor nod for his great work here.",10,8,12,12 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Falters a little but still an enjoyable experience
","Having breathed new life into the Star Wars franchise with The Force Awakens back in 2015, a film that was an adrenaline rush of nostalgia combined with fresh new characters, Star Wars was well and truly back, and bigger than ever before. Opting to close the film with such a teasing cliffhanger of a final shot left the world waiting with baited breath for the continuation of the saga and with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the wait is finally over.As the Resistance prepares to continue the fight against the First Order, Rey (Daisy Ridley), having only just taken her first steps into the Jedi world, trains with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the ways of the Force, leading to secrets of the past being unearthed.As soon as the goosebump inducing moment of Star Wars filling the screen with John Williams' iconic score blaring out had passed, it was clear that this was going to be a very different Star Wars film from what had come before. The potential for this film was so high however, as it drew on, I couldn't help but feel that it's let down by an inconsistent tone that became very jarring.Rian Johnson has very much created a Star Wars film from his own vision, writing and directing probably the most unpredictable instalment of the saga yet. I admire Johnson for taking some risks but the film feels so far away from The Force Awakens that they almost don't feel connected at all. After the way we were introduced to new characters and storylines in the previous instalment, this continuation doesn't seem to live up to that standard.Don't get me wrong, The Last Jedi features some great Star Wars moments and Johnson has taken some of the character arcs in a very interesting direction, which makes the wait for Episode IX even more tantalising. While Star Wars films do tend to feature an element of comedy, The Last Jedi almost overuses the humour, particularly in moments it shouldn't, which leads to the aforementioned inconsistent tone that hampers the film. I didn't really think the Porgs were necessary at all but hey, whatever sells merchandise I guess right?As I've already said, The Last Jedi has some great crowd-pleasing moments, Johnson understanding what the audience wants to see for the most part, an incredibly tense showdown between a trio of characters in the middle act being one of the film's standout moments. He does opt to include some very bizarre moments mind, one of the weirdest Star Wars moments coming in the first act and a plot device that left me feeling cheated coming in the final act.As with the majority of the Star Wars films, there are some incredible visual effects on show in The Last Jedi, the dogfights in space being utterly exhilarating yet again while watching Rey and Kylo Ren wield their lightsabers in battle is made even better by the fight choreography that's executed to perfection. The Last Jedi also boasts yet another John Williams score that accompanies the action and characters tremendously well.Coming to the performances, The Last Jedi features an ensemble of performers who make the characters such a major success, a common trait throughout the Star Wars saga. The trio that really stood out for me though were Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Ridley and Driver have taken to being in such a major and important franchise like ducks to water, Ridley in particular, and the two of them share some memorable scenes together in The Last Jedi. Seeing Mark Hamill in the role of Luke Skywalker again was such a joy and he gives it his all here, the pain and anguish of his failures in the past coming to the fore through Hamill's performance. While I don't agree with everything Johnson did with these characters, I thought all three gave memorable performances.Carrie Fisher gets a much more prominent role in The Last Jedi, the regal presence of Leia being a most welcome one. I didn't really take to Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico mainly because her character just feels too forced into the narrative. John Boyega, who was such a major player in The Force Awakens feels as if he's sidelined here, as does Oscar Isaac, again. It's disappointing to see these two play in the shadows so much.A little muddled as an entry into the Star Wars saga, The Last Jedi is certainly an enjoyable cinematic experience, it just didn't hit the heights already reached in the saga previously. A number of questions remain unanswered so J. J. Abrams has a lot of work in tying up loose ends to close the trilogy with Episode IX. Even though I walked out of The Last Jedi a little disappointed, I cannot wait for the final instalment.",9,0,8,15 December 2017
Logan," Brutal and personal.
","Seventeen years and eight films after he first donned the iconic mutton chops and sharpened those adamantium claws, Hugh Jackman is back one last time in his most iconic role of Wolverine in Logan. With the ominous tagline 'His time has come' looming over the film, my hopes were that they'd be able to do both the character and Jackman justice after the two solo outings we've had so far have left a lot to be desired.The year is 2029 and there hasn't been a mutant born for twenty-five years. Attempting to hide from his life and legacy, Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives on the Mexican border providing care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart).With his powers dwindling, Logan is approached to help with Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant being pursued by dark forces. bringing everything he tried to put in the past right back to the fore.First thing that struck me about Logan was just how different a take on the character this was going to be. Sure, he's always had anger issues but we have never seen him in this state before, constant pain and deteriorating powers making him a shadow of his former self. Right from the off we are thrown into a scenario that perfectly sets the tone for the film about to unfold, it's subtly comical yet brutally violent, making me so glad we finally have an R rated Wolverine film.The violence isn't unnecessary either, supporting a more realistic portrayal of Logan taking down his enemies. It also helps the action sequences flow better, rather than having to cut away every time someone gets stabbed in the head the camera can linger a little longer on the mess Logan and X-23 leave in their wake, one long take in particular towards the end gloriously showing Wolverine at his devastating best. It's at this moment that I have to thank the success of Deadpool, which led to the studio giving James Mangold the chance to do an untamed version of this character, Mangold in full control of the reins mirroring Logan fulfilling his brutal potential.The difference in quality between The Wolverine, which Mangold also directed, and Logan is quite staggering really and you can certainly tell Mangold was in full control of the story this time round. The former descended into a typically over-the-top CGI-fest of a finale whereas Logan takes its time to build a study of this beaten down hero before climaxing with a heartfelt and personal finale that makes it much more of an involving film for the audience. The theme of parenthood has been explored a little with this character before, his relationship with Rogue in the first two X-Men films however, none of them have been quite like this, Mangold's homage to the old school Westerns playing out fascinatingly well as Logan plays out. The real dirt and grit of a Western etched with Logan's past is felt through John Mathieson's quite wonderful cinematography while the adventure of it all is encapsulated in Marco Beltrami's score.Coming to the performances, Logan features the best turn from Hugh Jackman in the role to date, and you can tell with his performance and promotion of the film that this is something he's always wanted to do with the character. Jackman's dedication to the role is admirable and I don't think he's ever done a bad job in any of the films, it's just that when a performance like this comes along in a film of this quality, it's hard not to put it above the rest. Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X, himself not in the best of places, and it's a very good and touching performance from a man who's also done a lot in making the X-Men films what they are. I found I had to get used to the pair of them swearing so much but when I did, the two are really quite funny, particularly together.The breakout performance from Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 is one of the most impressive ones we will see all year, offering an innocent yet vicious portrayal of such a powerful little girl. She speaks very few words, using her facial expressions more to convey her emotions and she rather impressively gives Jackman a run for his money when it comes to the action sequences. The rest of the supporting cast, most notably Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, make the most of their screen time, even if Holbrook does fall foul to the comic-book movie villain curse. This is Jackman's film though so focusing more on his last outing was always going to happen.Logan certainly does justice to both the character and Hugh Jackman himself with a film that steps away from the superhero norm and offers a personal and emotionally fuelled outing that certainly brings the violence and delivers one of the best comic-book films I've seen.",10,2,8,1 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time gets a worthy remake.
","Disney are full steam ahead with live action remakes of their beloved animated classics, with Pete's Dragon and The Jungle Book getting the treatment last year. This year however sees Disney take the biggest risk yet with a live action remake of Beauty and the Beast, which is widely thought of as one of the studio's best ever animated films and loved by so many of all ages around the world.Beauty and the Beast tells the tale of Belle (Emma Watson), a girl seen as strange by the rest of her fellow villagers but sought after by the arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans). When Belle learns of her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline), being held captive in a hidden castle, she takes his place, becoming the prisoner of Beast (Dan Stevens), a once handsome prince cursed by an enchantress for not seeing that true beauty lies within, before they fall in love with one another.As soon as Beauty and the Beast finished, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Not because it had finished and I couldn't wait to get out of there but because Disney had avoided tarnishing their animated classic and had actually made a very good film, much better than I was expecting anyway.Lavish in both its production and costume design, Beauty and the Beast very much looks the part of a live action Disney adaptation with gorgeous practical sets and colourful frocks aplenty. The visual effects, as expected these days, really are very good as well, bringing the film and its animated characters to life with great verve, particularly Lumiere, Cogsworth and Beast.The film has faced many people before release claiming it to be a pointless remake however, when they do as good a job as they do with this film then I fail to see where they are coming from. Bill Condon has made a film that clearly respects the animated version while adding new elements that don't do the film any harm at all. This is a very fun film as well, thanks to some high energy musical numbers, Gaston and Be Our Guest being my personal favourites, while I'm very glad to say the John Legend and Ariana Grande version of Beauty and the Beast does not accompany one of the film's most important moments, instead being rightfully sung by Mrs. Potts.Coming to the performances, Beauty and the Beast features a cast that all deliver commendable performances in both acting and singing departments. Emma Watson makes for a very good Belle, even if her over pronunciation of words does continue to irritate me and her singing really did take me by surprise. I was a bit skeptical to start with but as the film progressed, I felt more comfortable listening to her sing. Dan Stevens and Luke Evans can sing pretty damn well too, Evans doing it with suitable amounts of arrogance as Gaston. The real star of the show though is Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, who steals the show with a brilliant vocal performance that includes a brilliant rendition of Be Our Guest.So Beauty and the Beast is a very good time at the cinema that takes its place just behind The Jungle Book when it comes to the best live action Disney remakes. Oh, and the gay moment that was made into a big deal prior to its release, is nothing but a mountain out of a molehill. Bring on The Lion King and Mulan.",8,3,12,18 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Prepare to, once again, get hooked on a feeling
","Three years ago, Marvel Studios and James Gunn introduced us to the Guardians of the Galaxy, a superhero team of outcasts and misfits who resembled more of a dysfunctional family than a cohesive unit setting out to save the galaxy. It's safe to say the world fell in love with them right there and then, and now they're back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.With the Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), renowned as heroes and hired to defend the galaxy, it's not long before they find themselves on the run again. The trials and tribulations they face along the way pushes their relationships to new limits, all while Quill discovers the truth behind his parentage.While others moan that the MCU is becoming quite tiresome, I can't help but feel that it seems fresher than ever, particularly when they can break away to something as different as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. While it may not spring as much of a surprise on its audience as the first film this sequel doesn't try to be a carbon copy, exceeding any expectations I had going in.Going from one of Marvel Studios' biggest gambles to one of their most profitable properties is some achievement for Guardians of the Galaxy, and a lot of the success they've had has to go down to James Gunn. Gunn's work on the first film drew a lot of Star Wars comparisons with the whole space opera ideology and in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Gunn has made his Empire Strikes Back, with a strong sequel full of adventure, fractured relationships and a narrative that even comes with the father/son elements.The film is much funnier than its predecessor, the jokes coming thick and fast, with Drax and Baby Groot getting the lions share of them, and Gunn really does knock it out of the park with both the visual and verbal pop culture references. That doesn't mean the film's narrative is sacrificed in any shape or form mind, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 going on to become one of the more personal and emotional films within the MCU. One of the best things about the first film was the awesome soundtrack the film played out to. Like I've said already though, this isn't a carbon copy so they don't just pick random songs because they sound cool alongside an action sequence. The songs really do excel the film at times, Come A Little Bit Closer, Father and Son and The Chain being the stand-outs this time round. Oh, and Mr. Blue Sky deserves a special mention for playing over the best opening title sequences ever, and you'll find it hard to disagree when you see it for yourself.Coming to the performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the fine ensemble cast return along with the addition of some very welcome new cast members. Chris Pratt leads the cast with copious amounts of charisma as Peter Quill embarks on a journey into his parentage, Zoe Saldana really does hone in on the fierceness of Gamora whenever she feels like it, Dave Bautista is, once again, hilarious as Drax, his laugh being one of the most infectious you'll hear in any film and the stellar vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is one of the highlights of the film.Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan return as Yondu and Nebula respectively, getting more to sink their teeth into this time round and each of them provides the film with some of its more prevalent heartbeats. There's also the new additions to the cast that come in the shape of Kurt Russell as Ego, a cosmic being and Quill's father, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Ego's empathic assistant. Russell just oozes the same charisma as Pratt so no surprise they seem to go hand-in-hand as father and son, and Klementieff does a great job in selling the innocence of Mantis as well as showing fine comedic qualities, mainly in her scenes alongside Bautista.As expected with these big budget superhero films now, the visual effects look stunning and in the case of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, they play a major part in making these films feel so detached from the rest of the MCU. The vibrant colours add even more energy to the already electric action sequences, turning the film into even more of a thrilling ride in the process. I could honestly sit and type for hours on end regarding how much I loved Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but rather than do that, I'll just go and see the film again and again because this film has so much to give. I'm certainly hooked on a feeling again and I'm sure it won't be long before the rest of the world follows suit.",10,14,27,25 April 2017
The Shape of Water," It's a love story but not as we know it...
","Guillermo del Toro is a visionary filmmaker who has enchanted us over the years with films that centre around the fantasy and horror genre he has such a keen eye for. Whether it be the beautifully crafted Pan's Labyrinth or Pacific Rim, where the designs for the Kaiju were the stand-out, del Toro has blended such fantastical elements into a wide genre of films. His latest, The Shape of Water maintains such a bountiful filmmaking choice and then some.Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor working in top secret research facility in the 1960s. When she stumbles upon an amphibious creature being held captive for research, Elisa forms a unique bond with the creature, leading to an escape attempt and a love story quite unlike anything we've ever seen before.The Shape of Water is del Toro's first foray into a proper love story and the results are utterly spellbinding, his direction allowing the gentle nature of this relationship feel much more believable than if it was done with a heavy hand and his writing, along with Vanessa Taylor, offering the audience sheer escapism in romance, espionage and subtle comedy.The all-round craft of The Shape of Water really is something to behold; Paul D. Austerberry's intricate and gorgeously detailed production design providing such a wonderful backdrop, Dan Laustsen's cinematography beautifully encapsulating the bond between the lovers and Alexandre Desplat's majestic score accentuating the fantasy element to proceedings. Expect all three to be major contenders at the Academy Awards.Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water is full of such vastly different performances, all coming together to deliver such an immensely satisfying viewing experience. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa, spending the near entirety of the film evoking emotion through her body language and expressions, making her such a great character in the process. Richard Jenkins is delightful as Giles, Elisa's best friend, his comedic timing being put to great use here and Michael Shannon is expectedly great as Colonel Richard Strickland, the villain of the piece. The screen presence Shannon has is just ridiculous, lighting up the screen whenever he appears so it's good to see him collaborate with such a filmmaker as del Toro.The Shape of Water is a mesmerising tale of romance for the ages, Guillermo del Toro cementing his place in history as one of the most special filmmakers ever to have graced the silver screen with such a delicate masterpiece.",10,31,56,16 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," An ode to disaster
","The level of cult status that Tommy Wiseau's The Room has acquired over the years is one of those phenomenons I'd find hard to explain, having only seen it in full recently prior to the release of The Disaster Artist. It's literally one of the worst films I've ever seen but it's surrounded by this bizarre aura that makes it one of the most entertaining films you could ever watch, simply because of how bad it actually is. Based on the book of the same name, The Disaster Artist follows the friendship of the eccentric Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) and Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), both aspiring actors who embark on a personal journey together to make a film themselves. What they think could be their ticket to stardom ends up as one of the most notoriously bad films of all time in The Room.The idea of making a film about the making of one of the worst films going as a comedy driven biopic is a stroke of genius, particularly considering the talent involved. James Franco delivers riotous comedy in spades but this also works very well as a drama exploring the friendship between Wiseau and Sestero. I wasn't expecting the film to spend so much time outside of shooting The Room however, I'm glad it did as it gives an insight into their fascinatingly different characters and how they viewed success.The Disaster Artist is undoubtedly at its strongest when we see them shooting The Room, some of the scenes leaving me crying with laughter. The Room is full of unintentionally funny moments but watching James Franco try to deliver Wiseau's lines in his debut in front of the camera is a moment that will forever be one of the funniest in a film for me. The film's premiere is an incredibly touching moment, explaining why the film has become such a cult classic.Coming to the performances, The Disaster Artist features two great performances from James and Dave Franco, both playing off each other so well. James Franco literally becomes Wiseau it's actually quite scary at times, nailing the voice and mannerisms, while Dave captures the innocence of Sestero, a man led astray by the eccentric Wiseau, perfectly. There's fine support from the likes of Seth Rogen and Zac Efron too, while a whole host of cameos ensures the audience is kept entertained.The Disaster Artist is one of my favourite films of the year and having now seen both this and The Room, I'd happily go and watch a double feature at the Prince Charles Cinema as I'd imagine there'd be such a wild atmosphere. Let's get Tommy Wiseau to the Academy Awards!!",10,2,7,8 December 2017
Joker," Send in the clowns.
","Thanks to it premiering on the festival circuit and all of the recent discourse surrounding its content, Joker is a film that feels as if it has been out for ages when in fact it's only just been released this weekend. My anticipation for its release was already sky-high but had only been heightened by the media claiming it to be a dangerous film to release to the public and the rise in security presence at recent premiere screenings in America however, does the film even deserve all the discourse it's seen before its release?Having been disregarded by society, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire, descends into a life of crime and infamy.There's a deeply unsettling sense of impending violence that flows throughout Joker from start to finish, Arthur's descent towards a life of crime depicted in incredibly visceral fashion. It's a ticking time-bomb of a film that hones in on the mental state of its titular character and how he's viewed by society, Todd Phillips and Scott Silver not holding back in making Gotham a horrible place for Arthur to reside.The production design ensures Gotham feels very much a character playing a part in Arthur's downward spiral, as does Lawrence Sher's glum cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's minimal yet rather haunting score.Joker is elevated to great heights by a mesmerisingly magnetic lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who yet again showcases why he is arguably the best actor working today with a performance for the ages. It's such a devastatingly beautiful performance that's both hard to watch at times yet hard to take your eyes off, Phoenix surely the man to beat come awards season.He's certainly the main attraction on show in Joker but he's dealt some stellar support from the likes of Robert De Niro, embracing the cheesy flair of his character, and Zazie Beetz, offering Arthur a glimmer of hope in his otherwise downbeat life.Joker really is a stunning character study from Todd Phillips, unflinching in its approach and deeply unsettling in its execution, the performance from Joaquin Phoenix in particular making it a film that will certainly leave a lasting impression.",10,4,8,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It ends.
","The Losers Club have been waiting twenty-seven years but it's only been two years for us to find out what It has in store for them on his return to Derry. It Chapter Two is the concluding chapter to this particular adaption of Stephen King's novel, following It in 2017, and it certainly maintains the epic scale of the first film, which is a rarity in the horror genre.Twenty-seven years after defeating Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd), the Losers Club reunite in their hometown of Derry to relive the nightmare of their childhoods and put an end to it once and for all.It took a while for It Chapter Two to get going for me however, when it does, it is a vastly entertaining horror romp that may not be the scariest film ever made but, just like the first film, can be downright unsettling at times. It's the reuniting of the Losers Club that drags out the opening of the film however, it's a necessary evil that leads to quite a wild reunion scene inside a Chinese restaurant, certainly unsettling rather than scary.Once they're all together the film moves along at a pace that makes the 169 minute runtime absolutely fly by, jump scares and creepiness galore as the Losers try to work out how to defeat the evil that has been lurking over Derry for many years. There were some really effective scenes but I found the overuse of jump scares a little irritating, especially as they were so predictable, while the quiet build-up and eeriness of other scenes were much more appealing to me.Coming to the performances, It Chapter Two features a grown up Losers Club while also using the fantastic younger actors from the first film in flashback sequences. The coming-of-age aspect from the first film and the actors performing in it make it a better film for me but the adult cast assembled for Chapter Two do a fine job in closing out the epic story. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are two actors you know can deliver knock-out performances but it's Bill Hader here that really surprised me, his turn as Richie Tozier being the most interesting of the Losers and showcasing some great acting along the way. Of course, you can't get through these adaptations of It without mentioning Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's brilliant performance as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, not as prominent here as he was in the first film but just as effective when on camera.It Chapter Two is a film I can see growing on me with repeat viewings, a little like the first did, as there's so much to take in from it. I'm a big fan of the disturbing nature the film offers rather than the jump scares, and the cast really make this quite the film. The scale of it all across two films gives it that event cinema feel, which is something I'd like to see more in the horror genre.",8,5,8,8 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Blows its load too early but saved by some major monster action
","Kong: Skull Island serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse, following the monster hit that was Godzilla back in 2014. With an up and coming director at the helm, a mightily impressive cast in tow and, of course, the iconic Kong himself on full show, the ingredients were there for this to be another great monster film.When a team of explorers and soldiers venture to an unchartered island in the Pacific, they get more than they bargained for when they realise the island is home to an array of giant creatures, including the mythic Kong.Let's get the few negatives I had with Kong: Skull Island out of the way first. I wasn't particularly a massive fan of how they blew their load too early by showing Kong pretty much within the first fifteen minutes, losing any sense of awe that this iconic monster deserves. Compare it to the way Gareth Edwards built up to Godzilla's reveal and it's almost as if there's a total lack of respect for Kong.Then there are the human characters and the film's screenplay, both void of any real weight. The characters are about as bland as they come and they're matched by some truly uninspired performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, who really try their best with some awful dialogue. The most interesting character is Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, who holds a real grudge against Kong however, they miss a chance for Jackson to go fully off the rails and his tirade against Kong comes across as half-hearted. John C. Reilly was the performance most people were worried about in this film but because of how his character is written into the film and the fact he isn't just an annoying joke machine, he is one of the best things about the film.It's easy to say this is a film about Kong so we shouldn't really worry about the human characters. If we are supposed to care about what happens to these characters then there simply has to be something about them for us to give a damn about. Unfortunately, this is a similar problem that Godzilla faced.Kong: Skull Island may be found lacking in some departments but I can't deny that there is still a lot of fun to be had with this film. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' film moves along at such a blistering pace and he certainly shows he can deliver an action sequence. I mentioned that the film lacks a sense of awe, particularly with the film moving from giant beast to giant beast so swiftly, but Vogt-Roberts manages to make amends with the final two set-pieces of the film, the final fight between Kong and a 'skull crawler' being the film's stand-out moment. Kong himself looks fantastic, brought to life through a motion-capture performance from Terry Notary, as do the rest of the visual effects, and the decision to shoot on location in places like Hawaii and Vietnam rather than in a green-screen studio amplifies the great visual effects work on this film, as does Larry Fong's cinematography.I'd have to say Kong: Skull Island left me a little disappointed, even if it does deliver plenty of action and has a post credits scene that left me excited for the future of the MonsterVerse. It certainly made me understand why there was no 'King' included in the title.",7,1,3,12 March 2017
Parasite," A flawless masterpiece.
","Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing.",10,10,14,4 February 2020
Wonder Woman," The DCEU goes back to basics and it works wonders.
","As a character, Wonder Woman has been around since 1941, which makes it even more crazy to think that she has never had her own film released in cinemas. That is, until now. The fourth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which has been pretty lacklustre so far, Wonder Woman is a film that couldn't come at a more relevant time.When American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on the island of Themyscira, he meets Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian princess and trained warrior. Upon hearing of the horrors of World War I, Diana leaves her home to fight in the war to end all wars, where she realises her full potential and becomes Wonder Woman.The DCEU has certainly shown ambition in its short lifespan but each and every one of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were weighed down with either destruction porn, convoluted narratives or just plain old bad filmmaking. With Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins, who just so happens to be the first female to direct a big-budget superhero film, goes back to basics and it truly does work wonders for the DCEU.Jenkins hasn't made a film since Monster back in 2003, which is astonishing considering how good that film is, yet it feels as if she's been an avid filmmaker since then with just how confidently she unleashes the titular Wonder Woman upon the world. Delivering a basic yet inspiring origin story, Wonder Woman is a film that does justice to such an iconic character, ensuring she remains an empowering female character and role model.Wonder Woman really does feel like a classic adventure film, where the action sequences drive the film forward however, they do so without sacrificing the narrative. Diana's origin story from her younger years on Themyscira through to her realisation of how horrific mankind can be to one another through fighting in World War I makes for such impactful viewing, Allan Heinberg's screenplay making the audience feel empathy towards Diana.Heinberg also ensures that we are watching a film based on a comic book with some delightfully funny moments between the film's characters. Seriously, I was taken aback by just how funny Wonder Woman actually ended up being, considering how dark and serious most the DCEU has been previously. The action sequences, particularly the No Man's Land sequence, are so powerful and thrilling, Diana's emotions pouring out through the majority of them, making for a film the audience can connect with more.Coming to the performances, Wonder Woman features a lead performance from Gal Gadot that certainly blew away any skepticism I had about her going in to the film. A lot was made of her appearance in Batman v Superman however, now is the right time to properly judge her in the role and she does an amazing job as Wonder Woman. She's powerful when she has to be and wonderfully funny with a fish-out-of-water demeanour akin to the one seen in Thor. I was most impressed with how effectively Gadot displays the naivety and innocence of Diana when it comes to the war, one particular moment making for one of the more emotional moments in a superhero film of recent years.Chris Pine makes for a great partner for Gadot to share the screen with as Steve Trevor, who Pine plays with a bit of the cockiness we've seen him play Kirk in Star Trek with. The chemistry between the pair makes the love story that plays a major part in the narrative feel much more natural to watch. The rest of the cast, rather disappointingly, felt a little underwhelming, particularly Danny Huston as yet another forgettable villain of a superhero film, and Robin Wright, who gets nowhere near the amount of screen time I was hoping for.2017 has been a great year for superhero films so far and Wonder Woman ensures that the trend continues, Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins sharing a working relationship full of passion to deliver a fantastic adventure for such an important character. Wonder Woman is a massive step in the right direction for both the DCEU and women in film.",8,13,26,1 June 2017
Mother!," How not to get over writer's block by Darren Aronofsky
","Marmite films, the ones you'll either love or hate, are a rarity these days. Films that polarise audiences certainly have a place in the world, their subjectivity often leading to intense discussions regarding what exactly it is they represent. Darren Aronofsky's mother! had some striking promotional material, the poster featuring Jennifer Lawrence's Mother with her heart ripped from her chest being the one that stuck with me the most, and it reportedly divided audiences at the Venice Film Festival with half giving it a standing ovation and half booing it. For these reasons, I was definitely intrigued to see Aronofsky's latest.A couple's tranquil existence is disrupted and their relationship tested when a number of uninvited guests arrive at their home.For the first hour or so of mother!, it's safe to say I was fully invested in the mystery surrounding the narrative and characters of Darren Aronofsky's film. It's clear from the very first shot that this isn't going to be an easy film to sit through, the image of a burning woman certainly striking a chord but then completely juxtaposed within seconds as we begin to see the tranquil surroundings of Mother and Him, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem.As their peace is eventually disturbed by a string of strangers, who begin to arrive in their numbers, refusing to leave or acknowledge Mother's place as the homeowner, my intrigue grew more and more. The visions of Mother and the weird behaviour of both Him and their guests surely had to have a worthy pay off.I was wrong. Aronofsky's film takes a bizarre turn for its final act and it left me on the verge of hating this film. You'll struggle to see why mother! warrants an 18 certificate until the final act and, when you do see why, you might just be scratching your head like me. There are some very distressing moments put to film here so I warn you now, if you're easily offended, this might not be the film for you. It might be open to interpretation however, I just sat in my seat questioning what exactly had just happened before my eyes. Maybe mother! is a film that I would need to watch again to fully understand but right now, I'm not a fan.That's not to say I didn't appreciate anything about this film because there are some very good performances on show for a start. Jennifer Lawrence may have her haters but, for me, she's one of the best young actresses working today and she showcases her talent with a performance full of paranoia and vulnerability. Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer make for an extremely mysterious trio, each of them honing in on a behavioural trait to cause Lawrence's Mother to fret so much.Darren Aronofsky's mother! is a home invasion thriller the likes of which have never been seen before. The film may look gorgeous and feature some fine performances however, when the film decided to opt for the batshit crazy route for its final act, it lost any hope of me marking this as a modern classic.",4,13,23,17 September 2017
Life," Nothing new but something worth your time
","In 1979, Ridley Scott's Alien made such a quintessential impact on both the genres of horror and sci-fi, remaining to this day as the perfect example of how to blend the two so effectively. There have been many films that have taken inspiration from Scott's classic, the latest being Daniel Espinosa's Life, a sci-fi horror set a little closer to home.Aboard the International Space Station, a six-member crew perform the successful capture of a probe returning from Mars with a soil sample. Amongst the sample, the crew find the first proof of extraterrestrial life, which they begin to study. When the organism, named Calvin by people back on Earth, shows how far it'll go to survive, the crew realise they, as well as all life on Earth, are in serious danger.I have to say that I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Life overall, much more than I thought I would as a matter of fact. Yes, the film hardly reinvents the wheel when it comes to sci-fi horror, and it certainly borrows elements from other films of the same ilk however, Life deserves a chance for managing to keep me on the edge of my seat right up until the film cuts to the end credits.The film lacks originality in its story, a crew fighting for survival against an alien life form having been done so many times before, but the film is smart with the majority of its dialogue as well as knowing that it has to deliver characters that we are going to care about. Life definitely does so, taking the time to introduce us to the crew before the main event occurs.The film's visuals aid Espinosa in creating a tense and claustrophobic environment aboard the International Space Station, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography swiftly taking us from compartment to compartment, akin to Calvin's movement throughout the film. Speaking of Calvin, I thought the design and effects both played a major part in making me enjoy the film more, Calvin blending in with the surroundings rather than sticking out like a sore thumb.Coming to the performances, Life doesn't feature anything outstanding by any means. What it does feature is a cast you know you're going to get good performances out of, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. I was worried about Sony wanting to have Reynolds do his Deadpool gimmick, just in space, but thankfully they avoided that. Like I've said, Life hardly reinvents the wheel in any shape or form but I had plenty of fun watching this film unfold, a film that went up in my estimations with the ending they decided to go with. If you're looking for tense evening at the cinema and like a bit of gore in your horror, Life is definitely a film you might find some fulfilment from.",6,13,27,25 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," A ballet of bullets that leaves me thirsty for more
","Three years after we were first introduced to the character of John Wick in an action movie that blew audiences away and showed modern day actioners how to deliver stylish and comprehensible action sequences, he's back in John Wick: Chapter 2, and with him he's bringing plenty more action.Having been dragged out of retirement to exact revenge on a gang that killed his dog and stole his car, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) learns he must repay a debt before he can think about leaving the life he fought so hard to get out of in the first place.The trouble is, when you're such a legend in the criminal underworld, it's hard to make a return without going unnoticed, leading to a large bounty being put on Wick's head, leading to an onslaught of blood and bullets.John Wick: Chapter 2 takes the phrase 'Go big or go home' and drives it home with extreme amounts of bravado, Derek Kolstad's writing expanding the world of assassins established so well in the first film and Chad Stahelski's confident direction moving the film along at such a blistering pace.As with the first film, the highlight of this sequel is the action sequences, both choreographed to perfection and gorgeously shot by Dan Laustsen, seamlessly flowing from headshot to headshot. They're as brutal as they were in the first film, including a glorious kill involving a pencil that had the audience flinching that comes in one of the best movie montages of recent years. This is a serious film but there is certainly a sense of fun when it comes to some of the action sequences, whether it be the etiquette shown by the assassins when on continental grounds or a quite brilliant moment between John Wick and Common's Cassian during their chase through a subway station that had me in stitches. The score from Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard suitably accompanies the action sequences too, the finale in particular set to a more classical theme makes this feel like a ballet of bullets, each hitting their mark with the precision required for such a dance.Coming to the performances, we all know Keanu Reeves is not the greatest actor on the planet but the dedication he shows to a character that has given him such recognition is certainly commendable. I've seen footage of Reeves training for this shoot and his accuracy on the shooting range at such speed is scary to say the least and he well and truly brings it with him to the film, making John Wick such an efficient killing machine. I liked the supporting performances too; Laurence Fishburne in particular hamming it up to the max while both Common and Ruby Rose make for quite formidable enemies to Wick.With John Wick: Chapter 2, Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have collaborated again to deliver brutal action aplenty in a pulsating sequel that is worthy to follow the awesome original. Just wait for the final scene, if that doesn't get you excited for the potential of a third John Wick film, what the hell are you doing watching these films?!",8,3,8,19 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," Think this will be the new Marmite of the Alien franchise
","Remember before Prometheus was released back in 2012, when Ridley Scott was adamant that his then latest film was not going to have anything to do with the Alien film franchise? It was one of the most baffling denials to all as it was clear as day that it would tie in, we just didn't know how. It turned out that Prometheus posed more questions than it was able to answer and with Alien: Covenant, Scott has certainly not tried to hide the fact that he's going back to work on the franchise he helped lift off back in 1979.The Covenant, a colony ship carrying both crew and around two-thousand colonists on board, intercepts a mysterious transmission after a shockwave damages the ship. The crew learn the location of the transmission's source and decide to investigate the planet to see whether it would fit the profile for their colonial mission.Upon exploring what they see as an unchartered paradise, the crew soon find themselves up against a threat beyond their imagination, leading to a harrowing escape to make it back to the Covenant alive.One of the main tasks Ridley Scott had with making Alien: Covenant was trying to make a film that wasn't just a carbon copy of what had come before it. Scott does this by blending the ideas raised in Prometheus with the horror elements of his original Alien to create a bold new chapter that certainly raises more questions but leaves the door open rather intriguingly for at least another film in the franchise.Scott shocked us all with the chestburster scene in Alien and he finds a way to crank up the gore in Alien: Covenant, with some inventive new ways of the aliens exiting their respective hosts not for the faint hearted. He was never going to be able to create as atmospheric a film as Alien, the single location of that film playing a major part, but Scott shows some of his old form when creating a tense sequence, the initial facehugger attack being one of the most intense moments of the franchise, even though we know exactly what is coming.The film is slightly lacking in the character department when it comes to development, with only a few of them becoming more than just expendable alien food. With a large crew and a new alien running amok, I have to say it was rather enjoyable watching how each of them would meet their grisly end. It feels as if the characters take a bit of a back seat to the creation vs evolution ideas that the film raises which, while it may alienate some audience members, drew me right in. The lack of practical effects was a bit disappointing as there were certainly moments where they could have used them but instead they opted for CGI, which makes the creatures far less fearsome.Coming to the performances, Alien: Covenant does only possess one stand-out performer in Michael Fassbender, who plays both androids David, who we first met in Prometheus, and Walter, a member of the Covenant crew. Fassbender made David the most watchable character in Prometheus and he easily repeats the trick here with a dual performance that conflict one another, his line delivery as David in Alien: Covenant in particular is just so ice cold that he becomes quite a chilling character.Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride are just about the only remaining cast members who get a chance to show any character and they do so very well, McBride going on to surprise a number of people, including me, with such a straight performance as the pilot Tennessee. Look out for the easiest money James Franco will ever make as an actor with a very brief appearance early on in the film.While it is still a long way off the quality of both Alien and Aliens, I found Alien: Covenant to be a very welcome entry into the franchise. There's horror, action and plenty of gore for entertainment value while the continuance of the ideas raised in Prometheus means there is more to this film than people just running and hiding from an alien, the closing scene leaving me excited for where Ridley Scott can take the franchise next.",8,69,136,13 May 2017
