Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Captain Sparrow has lost his 'muchness'
","Well, it seems that IMDb limits these reviews to only a 1000 characters and there's just no way I can say ALL that needs to be said about this movie in that short of a review. I will say that if you're considering the IMAX 3D version, don't waste your money...if you -have- to see Pirates 4, just see the traditional theater version instead as the 3D effects are pretty much non-existent (at least with the IMAX version).The movie itself is also rather lacking...it's not a complete waste of time and there is -some- entertainment value there however this latest incarnation of Pirates is just really lacking compared with the past 3 movies...very bland to say the least (and that's about all I can write here...the least). There is some good action, the traditional special effects are up to par with the previous movies and even the story line seems plausible for a Pirates flick, but this one just lacks the punch of the previous three.If you're not a POTC fan, then you'll likely enjoy this movie to some degree but if you already enjoy the off-beat swashbuckling adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, then prepare to be disappointed with this one.
