Deepwater Horizon," Amazing, heart-wrenching, terrifyingly real film!
","Let me just say it bluntly. I sat there, I cried, nay sobbed, at 2 crucial points when I saw this film last night. What a mind-boggling, epic, powerful, personal, emotional, amazing performance by Mark Wahlberg (who I've met in person actually, he's a really great guy). His gut-wrenching, visceral depiction of the worst ecological disaster in history truly personalizes something that was so remote & distant for so many people. The full fury of the explosive fire, the sudden, overwhelming, animalistic drive to survive, and each raw, scraping fire-singed step towards the lifeboats are all nearly something you can nearly tangibly taste. The terror of the unknown, of being hit by debris at any moment, of dying, is projected into your very psyche, sweeping you along with the heroes and villains alike through each minute. Wow. I don't think I've ever had my heart beat up so thoroughly by a film that reduced me to an emotionally tearful wreck.",10,5,10,5 October 2016
