The Blair Witch Project," unique, but that's about it
","This movie had a lot of hype to live up to.  Worse than not living up to it's hype, however, is the fact that the movie doesn't live up to its own suspense level that it builds up as it goes.  There's nothing worse than a let down ending for a horror movie.There were moments in the movie where I thought it was going to go somewhere really terrifying; but in the end, it turns up that it's more like a haunted house, a little startling and scary while your experiencing it, but nothing to think about after it's over.The movie has a certain edge to it that is brought on by the manner of filming, and the looseness with the scripting, but those same points were also points of weakness at times.  It's interesting, up to a certain point, but there's a reason why most movies are not filmed and scripted so loosely.Bad dialog and shaky cameras can get pretty annoying.",5,0,2,9 October 2000
U-571," Historically inaccurate 'based on a true story'
","This is an OK movie, as far as entertainment value goes, but it has no relation to reality.  It does a nice job of making you feel like you're watching something that took place in the past, so I'd have to rate it highly on the clothing and props.There is a fair amount of psychological drama, in the moments where you know it's going to end up one way or the other... a fair amount of suspense.  But considering that it IS a movie about submarines, it would be hard to make a movie that you can sit through that contains submarines and no suspense.I'd say that overall, I'm just disgusted by movies that make Americans look like we all think that it's OK to say that a movie is based on reality, when it compiles different events into one story, and compiles different nation's soldiers (British, Australian, and US) into American soldiers.  It makes us look uneducated and overly self-worshiping.",5,1,3,9 October 2000
Dark City," Beautiful visuals, plot fell a little short.
","The cinematography is beautiful in this film.  It has a dark visual edge to it, and every scene has a vividness to it that reminds me of Technicolor. The plot line runs a little thin, as it amounts, in the end, to be little more than a Twilight Zone episode; but you know that from the start, and with the suspense building all along, it's hard not to get sucked into the plot, shallow though it is.There's a lot of very cool imagery in the film, both visually, and symbolically.  The psychological implications are great, for those of us that are philosophically/psychologically inclined.  With a little bit more of a creative twist to the plot, or maybe even just a little darker edge to the ending, I would have rated this one a classic.  As it is, I still highly recommend it.",7,0,1,9 October 2000
Man on the Moon," Either you get it, or you don't.
","There was a certain angle to Andy Kaufman's humor, just like any other comedian that stands out from the crowd.  The audience that likes that type of humor is not 'hip' to it, or 'in on the joke', we just happen to find that kind of thing funny.Much of the movie is devoted to getting into Kaufman's sense of humor, and its ties to his individuality and refusal to compromise.  He apparently really was one of the few entertainers who performed what he wanted to perform, and wasn't going to be a puppet to his popularity.If you ever laugh all by yourself, then you may 'get' his sense of humor. If you do, you will 'get' this movie, and find it hilarious in the sections where those who did not 'get it' found it uncomfortable and uneven. >Of course, if you liked Andy Kaufman, you are likely to like this film.  I'd say that the converse is true, too.  If you don't 'get it', try watching something without laugh tracks, and see if you know when to laugh.  Jim Carey does a good job of demonstrating that he can actually play a role other than roles that just rehash his old In Living Color comedy bits.
If you don't like stories that vary from the regular Hollywood plot lines, leave this one alone.  If you're curious, don't mind bypassing some social conventions, and have a healthy respect for the selective use of tact, check out Man on the Moon, there are some nice philosophical angles to it, not unlike American Beauty.  They share a common thread of not being palatable to the people that they make light of.One of the deeper messages of Man on the Moon is that we should all be able to make fun of ourselves, and have a good time in life.  Of course, to take that message out of the film, you have to agree with that message already.",9,0,0,9 October 2000
The Green Mile," Predictable
","At some point, not far enough into the movie, it was pretty clear to me what the outcome would be.  Maybe it was just me, but after the ending was clear to me, the movie just seemed to drone on, and dramatize on.  It seemed determined to take the long way around to the ending.Maybe I'm just unfortunate in having my idea of how it would end up be exactly what happened.  To me, it seemed like a lot of attempts to dramatize a thin plot, and put touches on it to make it seem profound.  Apparently, it worked for many people, unfortunately not for me.",6,3,6,10 October 2000
