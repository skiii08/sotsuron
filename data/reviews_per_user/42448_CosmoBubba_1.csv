The Blair Witch Project," Excellence!
","This film is one of the best horror films of all time.  The format in which THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was filmed created an eerie sense of realism, as did the terror etched on the faces of the three actors.  The realism was only added to by the actors using their real names.  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will unquestionably go down in the annals of movie history as one of the most believable films ever made.",7,1,2,17 August 1999
