Captain Phillips," Paul Greengrass has again delivered an epic cinematic experience dealing with contemporary issues
","Captain Phillips, for those of you who are aware of the American cargo ship hijacking incident occurred a few years ago, in 2009, the movie is the portrayal of a true story of the Captain, Richard Phillips' heroic guidance to lead his crew away from the hostile situation from the pirates. It's extremely rare to see a film with this scale and cast to deliver a message across of such sensitive contemporary topic.Let me start dissecting the film begin with the antagonists which play a brilliant roles in the story. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse, the 'captain' of the pirate motorboat, is simply stunning. His performance is an impeccable portrayal of Somali pirate who would hijack the cargo ship at any costs, even death which is the formidable spirit within this character which stands out the most amongst other pirates in the film. Nevertheless, the screenwriter Billy Ray has given so much complexity in the antagonists which become the crucial drive of the movie. Faysal Ahmed who plays Najee, is the fiercest and strongest of them all, a masculine type character who incessantly threatened to kill Captain Phillips and often irritated by the Captain's talking. Mahat Ali's role as Bilal is a sporadic pirate and the youngest of the pirates, seems indecisive and inexperience at times which has built interesting relationship with the captain. The character seems to be more compassionate and adopted less aggressive approach to the hostages which has established a vivid relationship with other characters.The confrontation between Hanks and the pirates intrigued by the negotiation of the ransom or robbery as it appeared so. The mind tricks he plays when the pirates' motorboat approaches the mother ship, the amount of control that Muse dictates to attain when he get on board, all of these details of the story is all unraveled in the film expertly. It's not often to see such movie with such abundant intensity and tension throughout the entire 134 minutes and it has given me a thrilling cinematic experience in the course of the film. I have always admired Hanks' work and the diversity in the roles he's played throughout his acting years. From Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Catch me if you can, to The Terminal, Hanks' has constantly found a way to exceeded audience's expectation and bring out the essence and complexity of the character. Playing the captain of MV Maersk Alabama is no exception, his acting inject realism to the protagonist which is vital to execute the film seamlessly as the film is based on a real story of a realistic hostage situation. Through the film, we understand that Richard Phillips play numerous roles in his life other than just the captain who is responsible for the operation of the cargo ship. Though his prominent role is the captain, he is also a father and a husband which might seem orthodox, yet it has again brought realism to the fate when someone's on the verge of dying and leaving people he cares about behind.It is noteworthy of the techniques deployed in the film, the use of shaky hand cameras which could be irritating and abusive in times. Yet, it is ingenious that Paul Greengrass decided to adopt such technique which ties in with this contemporary issue of American ships hijacked by African pirates. Such experimentation of cinematography is prodigious for the film; it's been filmed in a way to depict a sense of documentary film which allows audiences in. The use of camera has also given us a sense of the tightness of the space within the mother ship and the emergency lifeboat which pirates use to flee back in later phase of the film. One of the reason why I admire Paul Greengrass's films is the sense of the topic he choose to film yet bring a captivating and new cinematic experience to the audience. Greengrass has again unveiled his awareness of the contemporary issues dealing with the society and tie those ideas into the film brilliantly.",8,1,6,13 October 2013
Pacific Rim," Every child's dream came true! An exuberant performance!
","Usually, these blockbusters are merely eye popper in trailers and never live up with the expectation. I have to say I didn't think this would be the exception before I went to watch the robots combating the monsters from deep down the ocean. I also had a few questions in mind beforehand and the reasons depicted in the film is sensible for audience to fantasize how the two pilots control the robot 'Jaeger' with their simultaneous movement of the body. It's critical for the two pilots to have mutual understanding under the neural bridge technology to enable them to activate the impeccable 'Jaeger'.The movie succeeded to compel me right from the beginning when the protagonist – Raleigh Becket, played by Charlie Hunnam lost his fellow pilot who is also his brother during the battle with the sea monster which they called Kaiju. This scene shows how tough it is for the human race to clash against an invincible extraterrestrial force and the danger posed to be in a 'Jaeger'. The scene has well set up as the prologue of the story and briefly insinuates that the war is yet to come.One of the great thing about this movie is that every characters in the story have their highs and lows and you could sense their joy and agony throughout the movie. All the characters have a different story behind them which makes what they are and how they stride against the global doom. Rinko Kikuchi who plays Mako Mori is a Japanese girl adopted by the Marshall at adolescent when Japan was under attack. The character is sophisticated with love and hate throughout the film, the affection she shows toward her fellow partner Raleigh and her appreciation, respect to her foster parent Marshall Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba. Her rage and hope for vengeance grows as she lost her parents during childhood which cause her to trapped in the past and become a major concern for Stacker. Idris Elba has provided a powerful performance in the movie and the character is gradually unveiled, from a strict superior to a compassionate father who is willing to make sacrifice and devote himself to the public. The relationship between these major characters is complex which gives a lot more depth to the story.Without a doubt, one thing to take a note of is the flawless visual effect which is literally sublime in my point of view. The scene which is sited in Hong Kong is simply ravishing, the two forces collide in the dazzling cityscape crammed with skyscrapers, it has further amplify the effect and the colossal impact these alien force would have cause. You would sense that the apocalypse is actually coming and the world is in despair that it will come to an end.It's every child's dream to watch the gigantic robot wrestling against monsters from outer space, if you are a big fan of anime by any chance, you're going to love this movie. It's blatant that the movie has taken some reference from the anime comic book with the style of monster and robots appear in the film. The influences of the robot combat scenes from Tranzor Z, Gundam or Neon Genesis Evangelion is crucial in shaping this film. Guillermo del Toro has done a magnificent job to give audience an intoxicating encounter between the mankind and the alien monstrous creature. It's an action packed, exuberant performance overall and a blockbuster that is worth watching indeed!",7,6,9,29 July 2013
Man of Steel," Stereotype Zack Snyder film which had great potential
","Superman has to be treated differently in films as he is the greatest superhero of all. Unlike any other masked vigilante, there's no alter ego in superman which differentiate him from the man behind the cape and himself, he's born as Superman, the one who possesses great strength among other abilities which turn him to the savior of the World. He is the symbol of hope to the mankind. I could not hide my excitement when I first saw the trailer which was made out to be very sentimental and humane, it makes total sense to be made that way. I really anticipated that this would be the movie that Superman deserves after all.As everyone would have expected, superman is an action packed movie, particularly due to the fact that Zack Snyder is the director. However, with David Goyer working on the screenplay and Christopher Nolan as the producer, I really thought the two could have balance it out and make it a terrific piece with some interesting story behind it. When I first watched the opening scene, Snyder decided to bombard the screen with intense actions and visual effects which makes sense as it is visually engaging to the audience to jump right into Zack Snyder's world. The opening scene has profoundly depicted the catastrophic condition of Krypton and the main reason why Kal-El is shipped to the Earth. It is a triumphant commence of the film, then Snyder just completely sabotage the later phases filled with fast pace scenes which audience could barely manage to grapple the time frame of the incidents. The scenes only catch glimpses of how Clark is treated by the human and found hard to fit in with his hidden attributes. So he went on a conquest to find out his true identity with all the odd jobs around the world and what to do with his life, which I find fairly similar to the introduction of Batman in Batman begins. But the difference between the two is one has a clear sense of chronological order and easy for audience to digest while this film is more like a Momento style to put the story of Superman together which is totally unnecessary.Another thing which isn't needed is the constantly unstable, shaky camera filming the entire film. A movie in this scale is the least to expect to use a shaky camera which incessantly hurt your eye, finding it hard to concentrate during the film. This also makes it inconsistent with the computer effect scenes which the camera seems perfectly still, one footage is still then the next becomes excruciating to watch. Beside the techniques used in the film, a lot more work had to be done with the character development. Henry Cavill has done a decent job with the material he was given in my opinion, he has shown the humbleness yet superiority of the character and thrived to stand up for the salvation of human race. The casts of the movie is great, but I would have expected a lot more with the casts, Amy Adams did a great Lois Lane but I find it hard to understand the special connection between Clark Kent and Lois Lane throughout the entire film. The romance between Clark and Lois was something to emphasize in the previous Superman movies, but they seemed to fell in love with each other after seeing twice accordingly in this movie. The film is deprived of sentiment and relationship between characters which is supposed to be one of the key factors in any movies.But there's still some plus in the movie, the music by Hans Zimmer is truly remarkable and symbolic to Superman. It is what Superman soundtrack should sound like and it build up so much tension with the astonishing symphony. The soundtrack is iconic and helps to idolize the greatest superhero.Overall, the movie is not terrible, it's just that It had so much potential in it and it could have been a massive blockbuster that can't be forget for a while. It is a huge letdown which lacks of storyline and emotions that would have made the film so interesting. Instead, like any other Snyder's movies, actions drain audiences' eyes and brains out and it just go on scene after scene.",6,3,5,27 July 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Capturing the 'Quitenssence' of Life
","Ben Stiller's latest directing film was based on James Thurber's short story in 1939 depicting the illusive fantasy of Walter Mitty (who is a negative asset manager), trying to flee away from every day routine's confinement. Ted Hendricks (played by Adam Scott) played the obnoxious antagonist of the film while the company was facing a huge downsizing since its corporate takeover which made Life Magazine's coming issue as its last. Yet, the owner and photojournalist, Sean O'Connell urged insistently that negative 25 would be the cover of final print of last ever issue of Life magazine which seemed to be misplaced elsewhere. Mitty is enforced to live out of his fantasy to embark on a journey seeking for the missing photograph from the prominent photographer.Mitty who is introduced as an ordinary working class man, living a dull, unadventurous life who suffered from his 'zoned out' syndrome, fantasizing himself drawing into the most treacherous situations out of the orthodox life of his own. 'The common man' theme has already built a crucial connection with the audience, as Mitty often restrained himself as a stereotypical worker in the bureaucratic society nowadays who many may daydreamed and romanticized his own living into an idyllic fiction. Mitty reminded me of Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham in American Beauty, who is a depressed ordinary working class who had an eccentric affection for his daughter's friend. Mitty is in his 40's, in the pursuit of a companion on an online dating website and most notably that he was affectionate to his new colleague Cheryl Melhoff played by Kristen Wiig. Though this idea might seem a bit old school, Melhoff is critical drive to the story of how Mitty climb through the obstacles ahead of him. Kristen Wiig has the quality of modesty and elegance in her whom a good match with her role as the inspirational figure behind Walter's inner mindset.Throughout the film, Mitty moved from spots to spots to pursue for the treasurable negative 25 and ascent numerous struggles. Yet, his first real test intrigued me the most when he fumbled whether to proceed to the ship or not. The film decided to adopt an eminent song to convey the courage needed to achieve things. The introduction of David Bowie's 'Ground Control To Major Tom' was a stroke of genius as the song was about courage and taking a leap out of your comfort zone which fits in flawlessly with the scene when Mitty hurdled through his own struggles and got abroad of the drunken man's helicopter.After several tests and cruising across multiple nations, he eventually found Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn who was worth the wait even though the character wasn't a very prominent role yet, he was quintessential to the film. He elaborated the model 'Life Magazine' was known, going to desolate and hazardous locations and live dangerously to explore the unknowns. His role captured the essence of the film of how Mitty envisioned life he would daydreamed of.Though the plot is seemingly plain and deprived of sparkling moments in the film, production designer Jeff Mann has managed to capture the spectacular visual elements of the boundless terrain in Iceland, Greenland and the Himalayas. Some may argue that the film's meandering pace is beyond mainstream audiences' capability to captivate. Yet, audience has the aptitude to tune in and anticipate the ecstasy and surreal world Ben Stiller depicted. The film has its reward for the deprivation of dialogue in some sense as complementing the extraordinary scenery which is beyond words to capture.Overall, in spite of the lack of thrilling moments in the film, the film is revitalizing to watch as an embankment of a new year. 'Life is about courage and going into the unknown.' Encapsulated the notion of the film and bursting out all the positive energy in you while you watch it.",7,1,3,1 January 2014
Schindler's List," Holocaust vividly came alive
","As Nazi Germany invaded Poland, profit-driven businessman Oskar Schindler seized the opportunity to open enamelware factory using Jews as labor for the army. Schindler has progressively transformed into a complex character, from a man of greed and egoism to a humanized man with compassion.Throughout the entire film, shots of the massacre abruptly kicked in. Without any music to go along with it, nor any sort of cinematic effects has amplified the effect of horror and grieve. Spielberg was simply just let the event speaks for itself when the genocide occurred right in front of the eye of the audience. The picture was utterly disturbing which also vividly portray the shockingly cold scenes of the history. People being executed like a stack of meat like they were inanimate objects.One of the conversation between the protagonist Liam Neeson and the antagonist Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes was particularly impressive. It's left us questions regard to the differentiation between justice and power. In the film, Schindler said 'Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't.' He then proposed hypothetically what power truly means, when a man who has committed a crime was brought and interrogated by the emperor for his crime, then begged for mercy. The emperor had power over the criminal for the act and this is what Schindler thought was the true meaning of power. Conversely, the concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth was merely executing Jews under the cause of justice.Towards the ending of the film was immensely moving.When Schindler told the cold-blooded officers to return their home and their family after they had been following their orders to carried out such dehumanized acts.It's delivered us a message that people have multiple roles and behave differently under different circumstances. The change has occurred to Neeson's role is not something that I envisaged. After the war was finally called to an end, he thought he could have salvaged more refugee undercover by his factory. The remorse of Neeson was sentimentally executed and delivered a tremendous finishing to the movie.It is a film with historic significance with the highest regard and undeniably Steven Spielberg's best and truly earned the best picture prize.",9,28,47,29 March 2013
Invictus," An inspirational masterpiece by Clint Eastwood
","During Nelson Mandela's first year in charge as president of South Africa, South Africa was the host nation of The Rugby World Cup and he seized the chance to use rugby as a reconciliation tool for the injustice throughout the years between the whites and the blacks. I think this is a great theme as a political related movie as lots of other movies about political policies do not have the sparkles as it does in Invictus which flawlessly blended politics with sports.The beginning of the film was phenomenally done. The very first scene of the film was truly memorable, Nelson Mandela's vehicle went past a path which divide the whites and the blacks. It was a mixed feeling among the South Africans on Mandela took up the role as the president, the whites believed that things would change completely and things never went the things they were; while the blacks was liberated with the hope Mandela would bring, the triumph he would bring. Clint Eastwood vividly captured the skeptic of the society and that point was only the very beginning with unforeseen amount of struggles laying ahead. The dawn was only the herald of the day with so many unexpected may occur.The film had also done remarkably well on depicting the significance of the springbok as an emblem to the white South Africans. It was a revelation of the fidelity of whites' devotion to rugby. On the other hand, it was a symbol of the tragic occurrence at the Apartheid for the blacks which they wished to abandon and put it behind them. Hence, there was a clash between the two racial groups shared different codes of values. I think the opening was sensational with the way it construed the historical background, the political divide between two groups of people and most importantly it portrayed the wrath of the people towards Apartheid. Another tremendous scene of the film took place when a voluntary helper handed out clothes for the warmth of the children lived in poverty. Every child was ecstatic after been given out the clothes except one who received a South African jersey with the springbok badge on it, I could reminiscent the pain in them through that shot. It unveiled the hatred of the suffered towards the unequal treatment during the darkest hours in Apartheid.The movie came up with a happy ending which South Africa won the rugby World Cup as the host nation of the event. All the people over the nation were triumphant over the victory of this international historic event. But the most important thing of all is that it unify the two groups of people in conflict, the whites and the blacks who didn't get along with each other, a reconciliation was met between them. It was a great scene which captures the cheerfulness shared among everyone regardless of the age, gender, social class and race. I could felt it deep down in my heart that it was a great moment, it was a moment of change.I think highly of the amount of studies Eastwood had done. He has kept the film very real and accurate with the content such as how his fellow Africans calling him comrade and Madiba which established an intimate relationship between them. He has characterized Mandela as a forgiving figure who has already forgiven the people who locked him up into a intolerable cell room from the first moment he was released. The two key casts – Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon played exceptionally well, they both once again proved themselves as two of the best actors in their generation. They played well with their imitation of South African accent which makes the native people feel more nostalgic and indigenous Freeman to them. So overall, I am entreated by this movie with the new approach with such political based materials. It is truly inspirational for the people who have already seen this movie. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone as I do believe that it can change the way we feel the World we are living in and fully understood the historical shift behind the struggles South Africans had faced.",8,1,2,20 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Cheesy,overcrowded and without much surprise
","As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made.",7,88,188,19 July 2012
