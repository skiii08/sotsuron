The Avengers," Avengers Why Bother?
","I find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating. Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power.",2,11,23,18 February 2013
Shutter Island," Excellent film.
","I think this is just about as good as it gets within the psychological thriller genre. The whole cast are first rate and this has to be one of DiCaprio's best performances. Max Von Sydow is superb as always.The atmosphere is wonderful, Gothic and distinctly unsettling and the setting just perfect. The photography is beautiful and never over fanciful and the plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole two and a quarter hours, which is the sign of a great film. It is a return to the old fashioned thriller style, with relatively little in the way of special effects, which is one of its great strengths in my view. The detail is exceptional and not a frame is wasted. I can't say I like all of Martin Scorsese's work, but this is top stuff.",8,4,9,1 March 2010
Amadeus," Sheer brilliance.
","This is for me quite simply, the best movie ever made. The acting, photography, costumes, settings and screenplay are all top notch. Milos Forman brings the world of Mozart to life and all the characters are beautifully cast. I can't think of a single performance that wasn't spot on, which says a lot. F.Murray Abraham in particular gives arguably the greatest performance in movie history as Antonio Salieri. He manages wonderfully to convey the pathos and contradictions of his character, caught as he is between admiration and hatred for Mozart, between his humility and passion for music and his consuming envy of the foul mouthed little genius who outshines him. Practically every scene is a masterpiece. Add to that the music of Mozart, Salieri, Haydn and others and you have a recipe for sheer perfection. The proof of that is that it never loses its magic no matter how many times one sees it,which is the ultimate test of a great movie.",10,2,4,10 June 2006
Paranormal Activity," Disappointing.
","I'm afraid that this is one occasion when the hype surrounding a film did it a great disservice. All this business of 'don't watch it alone' and 'the scariest film ever' is so much tripe. I love good supernatural horror films - and I enjoyed Blair Witch and Cloverfield. This is not a patch on either. Personally I got fed up with all the screaming and door slamming and found the couple irritating. There are one or two half decent moments, but it really doesn't have enough to scare. A much better film of this kind - and one that is TRULY SCARY - is 'The Entity' with Barbara Hershey. When it comes to a house haunting by an invisible force, 'The Entity' is light years ahead of 'Paranormal Activity'. I can't believe they have actually made two sequels of this nonsense.",4,1,1,7 March 2011
The Descent," A scary ride.
","I think this is a great example of how films in the Horror/Suspense genre can be intelligently and originally handled. One of the most important aspects is the dynamics of the relationship between the six women and how their relationships are affected by their experiences in the caves. I think this is handled really well and adds another dimension to the film. The crawlers, or whatever they are, are plausible creatures and the director answers the obvious questions the viewer might have about them. I agree with other comments that The Descent grips the viewer from the very start and never lets up. It is exciting, disturbing and frightening in turns, though I did feel that the violence and gore could have been toned down a little without harming the tension or the quality of the film. Maybe it's just me, but I also thought that the ending was a little rushed, with two much happening suddenly in the last 15-20 minutes. I wasn't too happy with the way it ended either. I think small changes would have made a more effective conclusion; but that didn't spoil the overall impact of the film. It's the kind of film that hits hard and stays in the memory and I reckon most people will come out of the movie theatre feeling quite exhausted. I have to say that for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia it is a doubly scary ride!",8,2,6,13 June 2006
La Vie En Rose," Simply stunning.
","Certainly one of the best films I have seen in recent years, this is a wonderful portrait of an incredible woman. Everything about the film is first class from the costumes, to the photography, the script and especially the performances. Marion Cotillard is breathtaking and simply astonishing as Edith Piaf and does the 'Little Sparrow' justice. She has captured her mannerisms and movements and brings Piaf back to life and hopefully to new audiences. Given it's subject, this film could have been overwhelmingly sad and emotional, but the director doesn't let that happen and so Piaf's story, like her life, is ultimately a triumph of love and passion over tragedy and leaves one feeling surprisingly hopeful.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves movies, music and of course, Piaf herself.",9,0,1,5 August 2013
