Requiem for a Dream," The cinematography alone is worth the viewing
","Aronofsky is brilliant again. Like his previous film, Pi, aronofsky has the ability to get on film pure anguish, frustration, fear and most importantly pure obsession. everything about this story spelled gloom and dispair, and aronofsky so brilliantly brought that out, not just through the characters but through his vision for the photography.jared leto's character was so innocent and beguiling that even i believed his plans would eventually work.Marlon Wayans definitely transcended his 'family of origin' to prove that he is a fantastic dramatic actor and not just a comedic actor.
jennifer connelly's character was so pitiful. jennifer proved that she had the range to play such a character so believably.Of the many fantastic scenes with Ellen Burstyn, the scene where Ellen is walking up that sidewalk and the way it was photographed completely blew me away.the supporting cast, including Keith David as the sinister pimp and of course the party that he threw, blew me away to think that addicts will go so far for their obsession.I have only seen the 'NC-17 version' of this film. It is the version that I recommend. by the way this is not a good 'date' movie. especially if it is a first date :)",10,0,1,30 March 2002
Memento," Boring
","Not quite as boring Forest Gump, but about as boring as Lord of the Rings. Memento is a lame movie, that only the truly gullible could possibly like. How ridiculous to have a premise that the guy forgets everything, then has the ability to remember that he forgets. The people that liked this movie are probably the same people that started all of those dot com companies.",1,7,17,30 March 2002
Spider-Man," Great Special Effects, Stupid Story, Worse than Batman
","fell asleep twice. a waste of kirsten dunst's talent. it is true that I am not a comic book reader. Nor, am I under age 11, but grown adults that I respect saw this movie and recommended that I see the movie. When I told them I fell asleep they were shocked. As a side note I loved the X-Men movie and Waking Life.",4,0,0,28 May 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Live Action Cartoon
","Although I liked this movie a lot more than Memento, I still think this movie was boring. who cares if people fly around, it kind of made me think of 'amazon women on the moon', but at least in that movie, they didn't try to hide the string holding the planet. if it had been billed as a spoof on martial arts it would have been great, but as a serious movie it was a waste of my money. hollywood should be thankful most of the people that liked this movie don't think like i do.",3,1,2,30 March 2002
Men in Black II," Weak and Boring
","Including most of the intro and end credits, the actual movie only lasted 1hr and 21 minutes. Good thing since it was sooooooooo boring. I went out and immediately rented the original MIB so that I could get this horrible movie out of my brain. What a complete waste of my time and money.I did like the cartoon before the movie. I also liked the dog's stepped up part. but that was about it.This movie should have rated GB&S; Godawful Boring & Slow",2,1,2,4 July 2002
