Iron Man 3," Awesome, The best yet.
","I was amazingly surprised for how good the movie is, it combined adventure, comedy and suspense...and very well done. Robert Downey is so pretty, aging made wonders for him, or the photoshop... but really,he is awesome, the movie gets you connected from beginning to end, people did not stand up even during the credits in the end....I guess we all wanted more....loved it. I watched at the XD 3D movie theater, but XD is enough, don't need to be 3D. I love it when I see a sequel which I consider better than all the previous ones, means that the movie makers really took the audience seriously. Money well spent watching this movie in the movie theater.",10,7,20,29 April 2013
Prisoners," Excellent, Movie that ends but you still think about it.
","I love movies that despite myself being sleepy keeps me awake and on the edge for the whole time. This is that type of movie. Excellent. Both actors are great, the plot is fantastic. Worth watching for sure. It is in my list of preferred ones. This is a nice example of how actors can do multiple sequels and still do other movies without having its image imprinted to one type of movie. Hugh Jackman is able to go beyond his Volverine image and do a great job in this movie. I've never been a big fan of Jake Gyllenhal, but he really did a superb acting on this piece. He was the perfect match for his character. After watching the movie I had to read the whole plot story to make sure I did not miss anything. It has lots of talk statements, and it helps to pay close attention not to miss the details.",9,2,4,24 February 2014
American Made," The story itself is the best thing about the movie
","Tom Cruise does an excelent job as the actor for this movie. But really, knowing it is based on a real story, it is the best thing about it. After watching the movie it brings a real perspective about the influence of the US across its frontiers and how far the government goes in order to apply its interests. Also, the motto 'itÂ´s for your country' takes a total different meaning after watching American Made. Watching the movie was a very good surprise.",8,2,2,1 July 2019
