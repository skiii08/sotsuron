Raiders of the Lost Ark," Sneak Preview
","At the time this movie was first released, I saw a lot of movies. I pretty much saw every new release as it came out.So, I went to see Caveman (was I the only one who saw Caveman?) and it was billed with a Sneak Preview. The Sneak Preview was unnamed. If you can believe it, I sat through Caveman and made it to the Sneak Preview. I am glad I did. Raiders of the Lost Ark was the Sneak Preview and I was able to view the film before anyone even knew about it. It is a great movie with tons or drama, action, special effects and even Nazis. This movie has everything. It is a real treat.",10,5,7,14 August 2019
Aquaman," Not a good movie.
","The visual effects are stunning but that is the only good thing I can say about Aquaman.What is going on in this film? The plot, if there is one, is a mish-mash that is too hard to follow. It is one of those movies where too much is trying to be packed in.Let's go back to Aquaman as he was in the comics.",1,3,6,19 August 2019
The Terminator," A masterpiece.
",The Terminator captures the viewer from the start. The action is non-stop and the special effects are top notch. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been different if the technology for special effects was more advanced. It is still one of my favorite movies and one I watch over and over again.,10,2,5,12 August 2019
Predator," Truly an original concept.
",Too many movies are a rehash of other movies. They are predictable and eventually they become boring. This film is a truly original idea. Several sequels have tried to capitalize on this idea but they all miss the markThe movie begins with a team of expert mercenaries dispatched on a rescue mission. These guys are professionals and you do not want to mess with them. They get right to business to get the job done. All members of the team are bad-ass. That's when the movie makes a turn that you don't expect. These bad-ass mercenaries soon learn they are being hunted and they quickly learn they are over their heads in the situation they find themselves in. One by one they succumb to the Predator. Will anyone survive? You are left enthralled wondering what is going to happen next. No one walks out on this movieThere is great special effects and alot of action. Arnold is at the top of his game. This has got to be the best sci-fi action movie ever made.,10,2,4,13 August 2019
Predator," A real masterpiece.
","Dutch leads a team of mercenaries on a rescue mission. These guys are as tough as they come and they can handle anything. Then the plot takes a twist. Suddenly they are being hunted and the story is now survival. Who will survive, if anyone.The movie is a terrific mix of action, suspense and sci-fi. The acting is great and the special effects are top notch. Don't miss Predator.",10,0,1,12 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," See it in a theater.
","When this movie was first released, I had the good fortune to view it in a theater that used 70mm technology. It is was a truly memorable experience. If you get the chance to see this movie in a theater, go see it. While the movie is great on the small screen, the technology of the big screen theaters adds a lot to the viewing experience.",10,0,0,12 August 2019
A Night at the Roxbury," Okay, so I am strange.
",This is one of my favorite movies. It is a fun romp through the night club scene. The music is great and aptly applied throughout the movie. (buy or download the soundtrack). The jokes are sometimes subtle and dated but this is part of the fun. You may have to watch the movie several times to get all the jokes. Will you like this movie! No..... Yes!,10,4,4,10 August 2019
The Wedding Singer," A very charming movie.
","Drew Barrymore is so sweet in this film. I just love her. The plot is very simple and a true love story. Of course, love wins out in the endThe music is great and adds to the 80's theme of the movie. I know there will be no Oscars presented to this movie but it is a great 'feel good movie' and one you would want to enjoy with your sweetheart. Do not miss it.",10,3,3,14 August 2019
