500 Days of Summer," Good
","This film is a man named Tom and a woman named Summer spent with and experienced together in 500 days. It is form of diary and story goes from a meeting and a parting, a past and now mixing. You know, Summer is not a season. Summer is a woman whom Tom loved. To tell the truth, she thought they were special friends however he was not. As the result, she married with another man and said Tom they were not fate. But they are good relationship after breaking. It is very mixed feeling and thought the right moment about love.But it is comedy so just not serious. Of course we can watch with laughing. I recommend it! The famous actors and actresses appears in a film. You should watch it. One of the most exciting movies for me.",Null,0,0,4 September 2013

","This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.",Null,4,5,7 September 2013
