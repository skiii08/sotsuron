Source Code," A simple thriller with no mental stimulation
","I am not reviewing this, because I hated the movie so much, I am reviewing it for the sake of people like me, who were fooled into thinking that this one was somewhere on the level of Inception or any such similar movies, thus looking forward to a food and movie night and just ended up in bitter disappointment. If you are expecting a simple 'time travel' action thriller, you are partly gonna get your money's worth, but don't expect this one to be great and mind boggling. It's not a movie you ponder for days, it's a movie you forget in hours.It is my fault, since my last 2 viewings were Primer and The machinist (which is a stunning movie if interpreted right), so I had very high expectations....I did think that a 7.5 rating warranted it, but sadly not.The plot is predictable, the 'time travel' theories have no real depth, the ending is classic Hollywood, while the real shockers of this movie are the 2 actors. Not going to say which...you figure it out. I mean really shocking. In The machinist I was watching the amazing Christian Bale and in this one I was practically gritting my teeth together because of the acting...I heard someone comparing this to Inception. Please don't be fooled. Although Inception may be boring for some at some points, this one does not even get close. I mean come on...Inception had Leonardo in it...it's in another league, trust me. I usually agree with IMDb ratings, but this one really missed it. Don't get me wrong, it's an average action movie and lots of people, wanting just plain old fun, may end up liking it, but overall it's a movie you quickly forget.",5,1,4,18 June 2013
Gravity," Don't believe the hype...
","OK,so this movie receives 10 Oscar nominations, everyone rants about how good it is and that it leaves you awestruck after watching it. As a sci- fi enthusiast you go and see it...and...surprise...it's the Avatar effect. Through the roof CGI, which cost enough money to feed half of Africa, but that's about it. Cheap character development, absolutely no story, no back story, multiple situations which I am sure Nasa would say are all 1:100000000 to survive and Hollywood sequences in which the 'hero' always gets saved in the last hundredth of a second. It gets really boring really fast. Let's get the obvious out of the way: the CGI is amazing (although not better than Avatar). Everything is perfect and visually you really enjoy it. And for those of you who think that CGI makes a movie: yes, Avatar and Gravity are the best movies of all time...(for those of you who agree, you can stop reading this and just go watch the movie).The moment this movie begins it's just, I can't explain it any other word, SILLY. Three astronauts are making repairs on a satellite, while one of them floats around, jokes and sings with 'Houston', while happily using his 'gas' inside the suit to propel himself onwards (of course later he runs out of gas in a crucial situation - I guess NASA astronauts aren't really that smart...). The other astronaut is making repairs while being sick (?!) - usually you don't go out of the house when sick, but hey apparently 'Houston' approves of going into OUTER SPACE (again - ?!). So things start to go wrong: and after that the whole movie becomes a series of Hollywood 'they're not gonna make it but then they miraculously make it in the last second' situations. After the 3rd situation you start to get seriously bored. You wait for it to get good, but honestly it doesn't.There is no character development and you don't feel for the characters. You don't care if they die, because everything is so unreal and silly, that you just don't believe it. I will say the worst thing you can say about a movie: you know the whole time that it is a movie. When you watch Alien (1979), you know the alien is not real and that the chances of it existing are next to none, but you do feel scared, you feel anxiety...and that is what good film making is about. You don't experience such a feeling in Gravity (maybe a couple of minutes). Someone on the board said it right: this isn't actually a movie. No plot, no character development, everything just happens. It's more of a documentary. OK, I know that the whole movie is a metaphor and is representing the hero's struggle of coming to terms with a certain accident in her life, but there a couple of other such movies, which are sooo much better. This one just isn't believable.When I heard that it received 10 Oscar nominations, I seriously lost all the little respect I had left for the Oscars. I guess a realistic depiction of water drops in zero gravity is enough to be nominated for 10 Oscars in our time. Again, don't believe the hype.",4,6,12,22 January 2014
