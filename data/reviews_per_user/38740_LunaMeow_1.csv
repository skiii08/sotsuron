Casablanca," Possibly one of the greatest love stories ever.
","I think my favorite thing about this movie is that it doesn't have the typical, feel-good happy ending that so many romances do, yet it isn't really a sad ending either.  It's not what you expect from this sort of movie, and, while most people do know how it ends, you still find yourself hoping it changes each time you watch it.  And, each time, you're glad it didn't.",10,1,1,21 April 2002
