Alien 3," For this movie to score 10/10 you truly need to watch the special edition version!!!
","First up the theatrical release of alien 3 was rather crappy and a disgrace to the alien franchise and I would rate it 1/10!! What killed it was the use of CGI shots of the alien combined with the use of puppet shots and the rushed storyline explanation, when honestly the alien effects used should of been one or the other instead of trying to utilise the really primitive new style of CGI of the 90's trying to impress everyone with 3d technology while it was still in infant stages to prevent it looking quite pathetic!!! That said the theatrical releases storyline had promise but also was filled with holes caused by changing the story differently that the actual novel to cut the movie short and trying to cram it all into a normal feature length production which resulted in a completely flawed and overall hated movie and honestly it was my least favourite of the series!!! Let me say before I continue that the special edition still uses the flawed swap between alien effects but with that aside I will get to my point... when I saw the special edition of alien 3 i was extremely surprised and completely blown away and alien 3 special edition went from my least favourite to favorite instantly!! If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend doing so asap!!! It is a completely different movie with the identical storyline as the novel which alters parts removing a lot of the ridiculous parts and has a heap of new scenes added which competently fills in all the plot holes and answers alot of those questions you are left wondering about, it also extends the movies runtime just over an extra hour, which builds up the film's realisim, it's characters, emotions, quality, appeal and storyline to a truly aspiring masterpiece and a ultimately needed worthy part of the alien franchise!!! I've made a lot of my friends who hated the original alien 3 reluctantly watch the special edition and just like me and they have all loved it and come to the agreement of the same opinion I have of this movie and 90% of them now easily rate alien 3 special edition Thier favourite of the series just like me!! Who knows if you read my review and watch it you could too!!!! I hope this helps and makes a lot of alien fans feel a lot more releaved and happier about Thier beloved franchise!!!",10,2,2,9 January 2020
