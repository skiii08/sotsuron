Walk the Line," A bit cliché but fantastic none the less.
","I say cliché only because they probably stuck to the truth (the book) as much as possible and Johnny Cash's life probably was a bit of a cliché. You can see they went to the 'Ray' school of biographies (right down the brother dieing). Although I'll forgive that because it's true. Maybe having a sibling die when you are young turns you into a fabulous musician and really really rich when you got older. I'm glad no one told me that when my sister was a pain in the ass for 10 years :). I digress.If you love music, you'll love this movie. I'm not a big Johnny Cash fan. I like his music, but have purchased no CDs/albums of his. But I like movies about musicians (especially talented ones). This one is well done. Probably the reason I gave it a 9/10 was the fact that Joaquin and Reese actually sing. Reese is really a good singer and I see why she got the Oscar. But Joaquin was robbed by Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman didn't have to sing nor learn to play the guitar. I felt I was watching Johnny Cash. I didn't feel I was watching Capote, but Hoffman doing a Capote imitation. Joaquin is fabulous in this movie. To make my point I'll reference one scene (no spoiler). He's playing a song at an audition that the other members of his band have never heard. When it gets to the part where a lead guitar is needed he turns to his lead guitar and gives a look of 'dear god help me!!' that is priceless. That look alone made this movie for me.9/10 Own it on DVD. Watch it again and again.",9,0,0,11 April 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny yet the setups vs staged stuff was distracting.
","First of all I love mocumentaries (e.g. Spinal Tap, etc). This one is great in that it mixes in non-actors as real people reacting to the guys acting like he's from Kazakhstan. He does outrageous stuff and gets away with it because people think he a 'foreigner that doesn't know the customs'. I have to admit that I was rolling laughing at some of the stuff. Other stuff though fell flat. One thing that was distracting though was who were the suckers into thinking this guys is real and who are the actors acting a part. Spinal Tap didn't have this problem because you knew they were all actors. Spinal Tap didn't have the different kind of laughs you get when you watch real people confronted by this guys antics. I gave it a 7.0 and saw it at the $1 theater. I got my money's worth.",7,0,1,21 February 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Holy crap!
","This movie really shook me up. This is why I had to give it 10/10. Any movie that gets me thinking (even if it makes me feel bad) is a good one.This movie sucks you into the lives of these four souls as they are consumed by drugs (3 heroin, 1 speed). The quick cuts of cutting drugs, shooting, blood flowing through veins, pupils dilating is very powerful. The quick cuts get faster until things spiral totally out of control.I've know my share of junkies. This movie is if anything kind to the world of heroin use. The junkie in this movie are more together than the ones I knew (note the tense).When my sons are about 14 I'll show them this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a 'just say no' person. I'm a legalize all drugs and educate people. If we spent all the billions we spent on law enforcement on educating people we would have less junkies in this world. I have no doubt about that. This movie IS education.10/10. Made my skin crawl like the 'the Fly' 1986 did.",10,5,9,8 July 2004
Marie Antoinette," My God! Add some Drama! UGH! (No Spoilers)
","There are no spoilers in this review. Spoilers would mean that there was something to spoil. The trailer shows Marie living the life of royalty. Lather, rinse, repeat. Everyday is the same. They eat. They play. They Gossip. They suck! OK. I get it after 15-20 minutes of that. But like a little pink bunny, it keeps going on and on and on. I kept expecting Marie to shake things up. At one point she kind of does by clapping at an opera when you are not supposed to. Everyone does to. OK Change. I kept waiting and waiting. Yet nothing more happens. I'm sure it was realistic, but come on. You don't make movies about boring people! Don't make a movie about me unless you plan to dramatize the hell out of it. Then when you've sat and watched and watched and watched these rich snooty people go on and on you think 'OK the payoff is the revolution. We get to see these heads roll'. Sorry Charilie. That might have saved the movie. Instead we get to only see the boring parts of her life. Then it ends. UGH!",3,0,1,23 July 2010
In Bruges," Why haven't I heard of this movie??? WOW!
",So I'm flicking through the pay channels last night and came across this movie just after the credits rolled. I see Collin Farrel and go hey 'I like that actor I think I'll watch'. I was immediately grabbed by the surreal dialog that goes on. This screen play was a work of genius. I don't know who Martin McDonagh is but I will be looking for what else he does and see it. I'm not sure how to say it but it has the right mix of drama and comedy that had me staying up until 1AM on the week day (and I have 4 kids). The cast was awesome. Colin Farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being in Bruges. Brendan Gleeson plays the other hit man who loves Bruges and wants to tour the town. The banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours. Then half way through Ralph Fiennes pops up in the movie. Ralph Fiennes! The twists and turns this movie makes blew me away. 9/10 (I only did the 9 because I guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened),Null,2,5,23 July 2010
Star Trek," Well casted good flick
","I'm an old school trek fan. Reruns in the early 70s every day after school. I've seen'em all 100 times each. I loved the characters. JJ did a great job picking new people to fill these shoes (literally). Spock and Bones are played well like you would guess they were. Kirk's goofy mannerisms from the 60s are gone, but his recklessness remains (his strength). The plot's a little thin and contrived but effective in pulling together these characters. We all know no one dies of consequence (except the red shirt guys :)) since we know their future (or do we?). The plot has the smart move of allowing for the past to change. If this wasn't there then the outcome would be all too well known. The only things they could have left out were the silly Bones/Spock banter. That type of stuff could have waited for the next movie. Another thing would be the theft of the plot from Wrath of Khan. Twisted yes, but borrowed from on a lot of levels.9/10. Kirk's rise from cadet to captain was lame and should have taken longer. The villain was not the best. I doubt I could have come up with something better. It was worth the $5 I paid.",9,4,10,9 May 2009
Monster," Wow that's acting
","Charlize Theron did the best job acting I think I have ever seen. If I had seen this movie before the Oscars then the Best Female Actor award would have been a no brainer. I know the makeup job is half the illusion, but come on. She WAS this person. A great script and story didn't hurt but man can this woman act. Never did I think that this wasn't the character but the actor during the movie.That reason alone makes me give this movie a 10. Excellent. A must watch if you like art.I find art to be anything that movies me emotionally one way or another. I will have a hard time forgetting this movie.",10,0,0,14 July 2004
Madagascar," The kids liked it....mostly
","When I go to these movies I do not expect any entertainment for me. I just want the kids to enjoy themselves. These days they put all this stuff in for the adults that goes over the kids heads. Yes this makes it tolerable to sit through a kids movie, but the problem is the more of that stuff (e.g. Reference to 'American beauty', 'Planet of the Apes', etc) the kids don't get it and they get bored. They do put in stuff that adults like and kids like (e.g. the 'move it move it' song) which is the best part. This movie had about 30% adults stuff the kids won't get it. I don't know about your kids, but mine can't handle 2 minutes of movie where they don't get it. Nemo was the perfect balance. When they toss in a adult joke it didn't last more than a few seconds.I gave it a 7. I would have given it a 6, but my kids were singing the 'move it move it' song back to the car so I bump it to a 7.",7,0,0,31 August 2005
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A lot of people missed out on a great flick.
","The trailer for this movie had me thinking 'Lot's of CGI & no story' but the reverse is true. The CGI is there but not intrusive and I really liked the story. I know I like a movie when I care about the characters. I liked the brothers, I liked the female lead, I liked the dad. Jake G (too lazy to spell it) was way better as an action hero than I would have expected. He plays the orphan prince who has no throne aspirations down to a tee. The movie begins and end with his performance and he pulled it off swimmingly. The chemistry between Jake and female lead was well played and believable. The love between the brothers was critical to the story and I liked it. I took my two boys (11 and 8) and they loved it. I had to explain some the time travel stuff, but otherwise they followed along just fine.I didn't go see this when it first came out because the trailer made it look like a poor mans cross between 'The Mummy' and 'Indiana Jones'. This was better than the 'The Mummy' (which I liked). It's no 'Raiders of the lost ark', but it was worth the $2.50 I paid at the door.I hope it made money and there is a sequel with the main actors all reprising. I'd take my boys when it's $7.50 (although I'm sure I'd be disappointed...rarely do sequels measure up).9/10",9,2,5,23 July 2010
Superbad," I AM McLovin this movie
",The mix of surreal and real is the key to what makes this movie great. You take your average teen flick about the geeks of a high school during last days of their senior year trying to get laid before they head off to college. Yes a tried and true formula. It probably gets a few laughs. But this movie adds the weird and surreal twists into plot that makes the jokes a 100 times funnier. I couldn't guess where the movie was going and I didn't see the jokes coming. I laughed out load (LOL for real) about 30 times. The real strength of the movie is the three main characters. They all have the best dialog and the actors deliver it better than I bet the writers could have hoped for. This movie is now in my top five of comedies. 10/10. I'm McLovin it.,10,0,2,23 July 2010
Constantine," For those of you that want a CGI version of hell...
","I Tivo'ed this and watched it with the idea it was really bad. It was not that bad. In fact it was pretty good. Yes the CGI is eye candy. Yes Keanu delivers his bad attitude lines in cheesy form. Yes the plot is silly. But if you look past those set backs you'll find some chemistry between Keanu and Rachel. I liked them together and the whole 'I'm in it for myself...except now that I met you I do selfless things, ala Han Solo' thing has been done to death, but it works. I liked Keanu's character, bad boy, dammed to hell, trying to buy his way into heaven by banishing demons back to hell. That's new. I enjoy CGI when it's well done and relevant (liek here). 7/10 Not bad at all.",7,2,5,17 April 2007
Troy," Shell of a tale....
","Well Homer it's not. There is no way you can make a movie and not cut 80% of Homer tale. If you didn't the movie would be days long. But you don't have to change things around to make it shorter. This movie makes the war weeks (or less) long where it took 10 years, with all kinds of twists. Achilles doesn't ride in the horse (but I guess you can't kill Pitt off before the end). No reference to Odessus's 10 years to get home (yes it's another story, but a reference was expected). Cutting the gods completely out of the story was OK, yet I liked the story where they are involved. They could have shown Achilles being dipped in the river Styx except for his heal to explain his dying. But I'll take a 'This is how it really happened' take on the movie. It works OK.As for an action movie it's OK. I'm really getting sick of scenes that you know are CGI just because there is too much stuff (e.g. 1000 ships). The battle scenes are pretty good. It's no Gladiator though.The acting was all over the place. This is Pitt's worst yet. I think this is due more to the director than to Pitt himself (e.g. See 12 Monkeys). Eric Bana does a great Hector and Bloom turns in a pretty wimpy Paris. Peter O'Toole seemed he like should retire. He walked through the movie like he wanted to be somewhere else. Although I never would have guessed I'd see a movie with a Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole scene.On the whole it was a fun watch. 6/10 (+6 for the action -4 for Pitts acting). Those thought provoking stares into the sunset were really bad.",6,1,4,7 September 2005
Dead Poets Society," Best of the 'Private school' movies
","In Robin Williams first serious role he plays the teacher, father figure, big brother type to boys in a repressive school. The movie has many great elements and plot line. There are also many great acting jobs done by Williams (in more of a supportive role), Hawke, Leanord and especially Smith playing Mr. Perry. If it wasn't for his powerful performance as the overbearing controlling father this movie would not nearly have the impact it does. (It was so good, it was hard to see Smith in the comedic role of the father in 'That 70's show' nearly 9 years later). Great movie for 14-18 year-olds to watch with the family and spawn discussions about what you want to do with your life and living life the fullest. 'Carpe diem'. 10/10
(BTW 'The Emperor's Club (2002) is a lame turn table on this movie in that the teacher is trying to make them be the opposite. It's OK but pales in comparison).",10,0,1,9 June 2004
Lost in Translation," A look at life from different angles..
","On one hand you have the highly successful 'Bob Harris' (Murray) hating his time in Tokyo because he sold out ($2 million) and is making an ad for a Whiskey (something he would never do in the US).On the other hand you have 'Charlotte' (Scarlett Johansson) who is married to a highly successful photographer.Both are stuck in Japan and can't sleep. It seems like they can't sleep because of all the neon (at which they stare at through out the whole movie). The two are total opposites. Old/young, Male/female, 'somebody'/'nobody', 'married long time'/'married short time'.The movie works as we follow these two people and how unhappy they are with life and being in Japan. The tension lies in how well they get along and should not have a relationship. Both know it's a mistake as they grow closer. They seem to feel like if only they met a long time ago in a different situtation...Anyway the movie was funny at times and fun to watch (if not just for watching all the neon like the characters).Murray performance was good, but I don't see the Oscar nomination for it. He was much better in Groundhog's Day. He totally carried that movie. This one Scarlett Johansson carries with here soulful eyes and that feeling that she is REALLY unhappy.8/10",8,0,1,18 May 2004
The Alamo," Awful just Awful...
","*** Spoiler if you don't know your history ***The problem with telling historical events that everyone knows how it ends is EVERYONE KNOWS HOW IT ENDS. Now I was no major 'Titanic' lover, but at least we didn't know if the two main characters make it. We know everyone at the Alamo dies. So you need something else to make you watch until the end. How the characters die? Nope. I didn't care. Billy Bob Thorton tried his best with Davy Crocket, but even him I didn't care about either. There is no underlying story to care about. I found myself fast forwarding past the dragged out scenes between characters that I didn't care about. I fast forwarded until the part where everyone dies. The bit about what happens after was dragged out and then when it does happen it's 10-15 seconds. I won the DVD in a call in to a Radio Station. Figures I finally win something and it's this crap. They must have back stock piles of this DVD because it must not be selling. I see why.3/10 (If it wasn't for Billy bob Thorton it would be 1/10)",3,2,7,26 October 2004
The Machinist," Kafka meets Fight club in a 6th sense kind of way
","I liked this movie. The movie had a very faded out feel to it except for the guy Ivan in the red card. His car is vibrant red and the rest of the movie is bland in color. The surreal feeling of 'what's real and what's not' is prevalent in today's movies, but this had a real dark edge to it. The weight loss that Bale had to go through must have really eaten away not only at his body, but got him into character much better (if you look into the mirror and you don't recognize what you see it's got to be easier to believe it and act it). Bale gives a great performance of a guy that is going nuts from insomnia. You can almost feel the sleep drip off the guy. I gave this a 8/10 only because the plot is a twist on a trend these days on the 'what's real and what's not' thing. I'm getting a little sick of it. Bale's performance as a guy going over the edge and dwindling away was worth the 8$.",8,1,2,26 November 2004
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Physics
","OK I went into this one with low expectations. I've heard all the 'not a bond movie' reviews and was expecting a bad Borne movie. Well there is some truth to that. The action scenes are straight from the Borne movies in that they are annoyingly hard to follow (and don't follow much in the way of being believable). I'm a firm believer that this style of action scenes does not come from the desire of the director to make a more engaging scene, but that they are easier to film in tiny 1/4 second slices and then edit the hell out of it. Shake the camera a lot so to cover up the mistakes. When they did this in the Borne movies and the public loved it we all have to suffer from the imitations.As for the rest of the movie...it was great. I liked the introduction to the new SPECTRE (Quantum) and liked that aspect of the old Bond films. The villain was kind of crazy enough. I did like that his second (the guy with the little unusualness that all spy movies have) didn't wind up in usual fist fight with bond (this is not a spoiler).I didn't like the bad guys and I liked the good guys. Action scenes could have been done better (probably budget cuts). Acting was standard.8/10 Good cheap fun.",8,1,4,23 July 2010
The Butterfly Effect," I like movies that makes sense in the end.
",Every 2 or 3 movies out of a hundred you see a movie that doesn't go for the Hollywood ending. They play out the logical consequences and see where it takes the characters.If you accept the premise for this movie then you have to respect where they took it. I bet there was some lame producer out there fighting for some crap ending and not wanting to accept the ending they did in fact go with. As the movie plays out you see the consequences of the Evan actions. They make sense and are not far fetched. SO... if you buy the premise of the movie then you will have to buy the ending. It a perfect ending for movie that probably was tempted to go lame-ass and just stuck to it guns. 8/10 (It even invaded my dreams last night....cool huh).,8,1,3,14 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Never put 'vs.' in a title
",This movie is not bad (if you liked Predator and Alien flicks). If you didn't like those movies you won't like this one. This movie wan't all that bad. The plot is a basic SF plot. The characters are OK. I did like that you couldn't tell right away who lives and who dies. Usually this a given after 10 minutes. The pyramid was cool. The sacrifice room worked. The ending was good. This movie would have grossed 10 times as much and gotten a IMDb review of 6.5 or higher if they would have picked a different title. A vs P reminds people of 'Godzilla vs Smog monster' or 'The world vs the UFOs'. Never ever put vs. in a title of movie. 7/10 Much better than I expected.,7,1,4,7 September 2005
Batman Begins," I'm Batman man!
","When I first heard the title of this movie I went 'Oh brother! They are going to try and resurrect this dead corpse of a franchise!'. I was right and wrong. It was a dead franchise, but it has been not just reborn. That would imply the past has something to do with this. This is completely new. It's funny really. This is what the comic book 'The Dark Knight' is like. All anyone had to do was read the comic book. This movie was made by a comic reader. Not some person who grew up on Adam West. This person laughed at that stuff. He groaned at Tim Burtons noble try (which quickly sunk from cute to lame). This is way better than I could have hoped for.We see what makes Batman a bat man. We see how a billionaire Bruce Wayne would take this path. Not just for justice, not to fight bad guys, but to fight fear. We see how is trained. We see how builds his weapons. We see all and believe. Which is the best part about this movie. You actually can believe this could happen. This is one major flaw with having Michael Keaton play Batman. Christian Bale pulls this off wonderfully.I gave it a 9/10 only because the humor added was not needed.",9,0,1,19 September 2005
I Am Legend," I am bored
","I am Legend is entertaining but flawed. We all know the premise. He's the last immune person in New York to a deadly virus that kills 90% of the people and turns the 9% into hairless raving maniacs. Leaving the last 1% to be eaten by the 9%. He's military scientist that is working on cure for the virus that will return the people back to normal. Int he mean time he hunts deer with his German Shepard. The best parts are the tense moments where he has to stay in the light away from the crazies. The boring parts are when we get to see how he goes about his day. It just wasn't that interesting. The movie picks up after some bad things happen and then some good things. Just when it looks like it really might be getting good, we have an ending which I didn't care for. I felt it missed the mark. The crazies would have been better played by people rather than CGI characters. Oh well, it was OK for a DVD rental. 7/10",Null,0,0,23 July 2010
The Dark Knight," Great movie! Best of all time? Uh No.
","Don't get me wrong. I really liked this movie. It was intense, exciting, funny and down and dirty. It has it all. Great acting from Heath Ledger (of course he gets the best part to play, with the best lines). The rest of the characters are drone though (with the exception that Maggie Gyllenhaal. She gives some real depth to Rachel (one that Katie Holmes could only dream of doing). It fast paced, it has some really great scenes, great action and I was on the edge of my seat most of the way through. It reminded me a bit of the type of movie that 'The Fugitive' was. The only flaws are how all the story lines are tied together, the obvious CGI on Two-face (this was very distracting), ending was a bit anti-climatic and it was a little predictable. I saw it at a half full matinée for $5 and felt I got my money's worth. 9/10 To have this rank at the best movie of all time on IMDb? HA! No I think not. The Godfather is better, but The Godfather isn't the best either. I can name 20 movies better than the both of these. But a ranking is subjective. This one will come down.",9,1,5,23 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Poor editing takes a good book and crams in too many pieces...
","It must be unbearable to watch this movie without having read the book. There are pieces here and there that are in there without much explanation. If you read the book you know what it is, but you also know that half of those parts were left out only to confuse the viewer. It certainly looked like they had a movie that went on too long and did some bad cuts to get it in on time, only to make things too confusing. This is the 5th movie of 7 and the worst so far. I gave it a 7 because it is entertaining, but jumps around too much. It was like they had to hit a bunch of key points of the book with no flow. I also felt like they had to get stuff in for reference in the next two movies. What can you do. Too much book for the big screen and to many directors and editors crossing multiple movies. Too bad they didn't go the PeterJackson/LOTR route and let one crew do the whole thing. One vision, one story and consistency.",7,0,0,16 July 2007
The Last Samurai," Too bad some Hollywood executive couldn't fall on his pen.
","I liked this movie for the exact same reasons I liked 'Dances with Wolves'. It shows a culture destroyed by modern man. I could only give this movie a 8. Two reasons. 1) It was not original enough (The basic premise take from DWW. 2) The ending. I won't say why I didn't like it as I can't think of a way how to say it with out giving away the ending (I hate spoilers).I'm really turning into a Tom Cruise fan. I could not stand the movies he made from Taps to Top Gun. He seems to care about what he puts himself in now. Movies like Vanilla Sky and Born on the 4th of July I have really enjoyed. This movie is by far his best work. It's the only time I looked up at the screen and was seeing his character and not Tom Cruise. Ken Watanabe and Timothy Spall (Rock Star) do an excellent jobs also.The visuals in this movie are awesome. It has never crossed my mind to see Japan until this movie. The life of the Samurai is told and experienced.
When I come out of a movie feeling very different I usually give it a 9 or 10 (even if I'm feeling really crappy). I consider good art to evoke feelings. This movie got me in the 'Japanese' mindset. I like being transported to that place in my mind.The only flaws seemed to come before filming and after. The story is a different spin on DWW and the editing seems to be influenced by some Hollywood executive looking for the $. 8/10 Worth the price of admission.",8,0,1,22 March 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Great
","I love movies that move around in the time line of the story. In Tarantino's case it makes the movie better in that if you showed like the story happened you would not have half the elements that make this movie great.Following the conversations and how the movie plays out is gripping. The tension is always high. This is not your kick back and relax type of movie, but more of a on the edge of seat waiting to see what happens next.I can't believe I waited this long to see this flick.8/10",8,0,1,15 July 2004
The Da Vinci Code," I know it's a cliché but....the book was better.
","I read the book before I saw the movie and loved it. It's easy reading page turning pulp fiction. The fact that so many people take it seriously is amusing. The protesters I passed at the theater seriously need to spend time doing something more worth while.OK I'm agnostic, but I think Christ was right in almost everything he quoted in the bible. If he is the son of god or not is not going to be determined by a Hollywood movie. A lot of people believe it and that's not going to change.What I guess I liked about the book was I didn't know what it was about before I started reading it. Knowing what the 'Holy grail' is before seeing the movie probably took a lot of punch out of it for me. Also knowing the ending probably did too. BUT this has to be the least effort I've ever seen out of Tom Hanks. It seemed as though he's reading the lines off a teleprompter with ZERO emotion. Bland very bland. The movie followed the book almost too much. Thus my imagination is always better than what they can throw up on the screen. So I gave it a 7 only because I was entertained, although it did had a few eye rolling moments here and there. Plus there were quite a few filler scenes that could have been cut. But I paid $2 so I'm not complaining....",7,3,6,10 August 2006
Zombieland," Zombieland is quite possibly the right combination of cinematic excellence that produced a masterpiece for the ages.
","OK It's not Citizen Kane or Henry the 8th. But this is one fantastic movie. I'm not a zombie movie lover. 'dawn of the dead' hated it. 'night of the living dead' snooze. This is not so much a zombie movie but more a Apocalypse movie. The movie starts with and is narrated by Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus...each character call each other by their destination). Jesse is the reason this movie works. It all revolves around him. He plays the virgin geek who learns how to survive by his set of rules. He meets up with three others. Woody Harrelson is the gun toting blood thirsty zombie killer. Emma stone and Abigail Breslen play con artist sisters. Together the chemistry is great. What makes this movie great is the chemistry between these four actors. The plot doesn't go where you expect it to go and blow it. Above all this is a great comedy. It's well timed, unexpected and funny as hell, but still has a heart. 10/10.",10,0,1,5 August 2010
The Departed," Best movie I've seen in 20 years
","I caught this on DVD last night. The rest of the family was asleep while I sat in living room, slowly moving from chair to chair to get closer to the TV. This movie grabbed me and pulled me in hard. It had everything that I like in a movie. It had suspense, characters (that I care about and ones I hate), unpredictable, twists and a great ending.The movie basically is the story of two police officers coming out of the academy. One was sent there to be a spy for the mob (Damon), the other is recruited right away to be a mole in the mob for the cops DiCaprio). We watch as each reported to there boss's and tries to not get caught. Meanwhile a lot of people die around them (the departed).The suspense in this movie was so high I couldn't stand it. I sit here at work the next day and I'm amazed at how much I'm still thinking about it. The reason the suspense is great is two fold. One you feel like these characters (all of them) are in danger, real danger. Two you don't know what's going to happen next. All this makes for a great ride.I highly recommend this movie unless you don't like mob movies. This is very much a mob movie. 10/10 BTW DiCaprio got robbed for not getting an Oscar nomination. I really don't care for the guy, but he did a hell of a good job. Walberg deserved his nomination. Damon was good but played it a little too cold. Nicholson, Sheen and Baldwin were great stars willing to play their parts to the hilt as supporting actors. If Martin Scorsese had not gotten the Best Director then the Oscars would have lost ALL credibility.Good Day!",10,2,4,20 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A new 'Star Wars' movie...
","Not the two 'things' that preceded it.It's been 22 years since I saw a Star Wars movie. I felt like I did when I was a teen watching the first three episodes (4,5 and 6). I cared about what happened to these characters. I saw the 'dark side' and not some oooh 'sith guys'. Bad guys. Real bad guys. That's what Star Wars movies have in them...Bad guys. That is the real difference between this prequel and the previous ones. To feel that characters are in danger then need a real threat. This movie provides some. From the outside and from within.I won't go into detail (There is enough talk about the actual movie to choke a horse) but the movie was fun to watch even though you really know who lives and who dies and who goes where and what not. It's really how they all get there that is fun to watch. Which is why I thought George was making these prequels for. The first episodes could have been the scroll at the beginning of this episode and left it at that. But hey if anything they made this movie look so much the better.I gave it a 9/10 only because the turning to the dark side was not as dramatic as it really could have been. That was the 'punch' I was looking for. Still worth the price of admission (not a camp out...sheesh I'd only do that for Pink Floyd tickets :) BTW In December when the DVD comes out I will take 12-13 hours sometime and watch all 6 episodes back to back. They fit nicely together.",9,2,4,20 May 2005
Ray," Ray the...
","Ray the tragedy. Ray the musical genius. Ray the adulterer. Ray the great performer. Ray the Junkie. All these facets of this great innovator are explored and shown in an honest light. Jamie Foxx pulls off an impersonation that rivals (or even beats) Jim Carrey's 'Andy Hoffman'. It's not just that with the haircut and glasses he looked so much like Ray, it's the little mannerisms that he had down pat. The story follows two time lines. One time line from 1948 to 1965 and another from when Ray and his little brother were little until Ray leaves home to go to school. These are intermixed well and play off each other (much like the movie 'The Last Emperor'). Ray's genius at crafting music is a major part of the movie which I liked a lot. A lot of time biography's of musicians concentrate on how they handle the popularity and don't spend enough time show us the musician at work (e.g. 'The Doors'). Here we see how Ray crafts his songs and (as a musician myself) I'm in wonder and awe. The influence his mother had on him was shown is frank and honest manner. The heroin addiction was shown, but the movie did not center on it nor did it belittle it either. Across the board this was a terrific movie. There were a few flaws here and there with some supporting cast being stereotypical, but don't let minor flaws like that stop you from enjoying a great biography. 9/10",9,0,2,9 September 2005
Inception," Inception is very good...A masterpiece?...uh no.
","I went to Inception based on word of mouth that it was a real head scratcher. One person quoted 'If I told you the last 5 minutes of the movie it wouldn't be a spoiler' another 'when the lights come up you'll be staring at the screen going 'what just happened''. So I went into this movie ready to watch everything. I wanted to be outguessed. I didn't want to know where it was going. I wanted a ride.It turned out I liked this movie not for the reasons I went to it. I like many in the theater could guess the ending (at the very end there was laughter at my showing). This movie is great for the idea, the visuals (this movie could not have been made 15 years ago) and the acting.First the idea: Entering people's dreams. What is a dream and what is reality? Going down layers and layers. the best part of the movie is trying to keep straight what is happening and when. The last 45 minutes of the movie I had to almost draw a diagram in my head to keep it straight. This movie it not for your Transformers or Twilight crowd. this is a thinkers movie.The Visuals: The reality bending world of dreams was done so well that I didn't roll my eyes at the CGI. The CGI aided the story and didn't show off at all. Some time I knew in my head some stuff was CGI, but it was so well done that I thought they might not have used CGI for those parts. I knew they did, but you could not tell. Simply put you could go to this movie and not understand at all what happened and enjoy it for the mid bending visuals before your eyes.The acting: Leonardo Dicaprio is getting better and better every movie he makes. Even though he is one of the most well known actors in the world I was thinking of him as 'Cobb' they whole time. Tom cruise should just have all his characters called Tom. The supporting cast was top notch. All very well done.The downside: I hope the ending was not supposed to be a surprise because the audience I was with all laughed at the very end. We all knew what the end was...but I guess that's what one reviewer meant by 'I can tell you the last 5 minutes and it won't be a spoiler'. It wasn't.I gave this a 9 out of 10. Great movie. It's be a load of bull if it's not Best Picture. The only hit was I think the ending was supposed to be a surprise. It didn't matter that it wasn't.",9,1,4,23 July 2010
Despicable Me," Not perfect, but funny
","Despicable Me tells the story of Gru a master villain who just hasn't made a major splash. Some other major villain just did a big job and now he sets his sights even higher. In order to accomplish this he needs something his arch-enemy has and find the only way to get it is to employ 3 little orphans who can get inside his lair by selling cookies.The movie goes exactly where you think it will and some the jokes fall flat, but at its core is good feeling story of redemption and parental love. There is something for everyone in this. I took my wife and 4 kids (11,8,4 and 4) and everyone loved it. It's not perfect though. Some jokes just were not that funny to me (although a lot of people in the theatre were laughing at them). I also didn't see it in 3D and it looks like it would have been fun to watch in 3D. During the credits they add stuff just for the 3D that is over the top 3D. It looked like that would have been fun.I recommend it at a 8/10. Kid friendly. Grown up entertaining. Heartwarming. Exciting. Not bad for $5 on a Thursday.",8,4,7,16 July 2010
Bruce Almighty," Had potential, but in the end 2+2=4
","Setup: Bruce is whiner. He doesn't get his promotion. Boo hoo. Blames god. God say 'ok you be god' gee. Can we guess what happens next? I did. Only the detail varied. Very predictable plot. I gave it a 6/10 because the details can be funny, but when you know where the movie is going every step along the way it can't get much higher than 6/10. Now if something (anything) happened that I didn't expect, then it could have been a really really good movie. Oh well. If you like Jim Carry or 'Friends' then you will like the movie. If you like to be told a story that you don't know the ending, then wait for the cheap theaters or rental. I did laugh out loud once or twice.",6,0,1,14 July 2003
Identity," I got mixed emotions about this....
",Yes this is a good movie. The very end is little flawed (lame even). But the rest of the movie had me guessing (wrong too). I like any movie where I think I got figured out and I'm wrong. Multiple story lines continue and how they tie together make this a fun idea (if not a new bend on old ideas). I paid $1 on a Tuesday at a cheap theater and got my money's worth. Good rental. If your into creeping yourself out it's pretty good for that too. It can kind of get under your skin. 7/10,7,0,0,23 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first one..
","But that's not saying much. The first one was an OK TV episode. This was a good movie (not great). I liked the action and the story line held my interest only there were are a few problems. I like the more mutants the better, but when you get so many you pretty much can solve any problem with so many abilities flying around. Even the ending could have been shorten up by the kid who can freeze water. Good rental/cheap theater. 8/10",8,0,0,23 July 2003
Final Destination," Horror formula. The characters die one by one, but it's all in how they die.
",Yes this is another horror flick where the characters die one by one. At least it's not this person that can't die chase them with the cattle prod. They die because death is chasing them. The only thing that really 'creeped me out' about the movie was the plane crash. Having a fear of flying the crash scene at the beginning hit home and made me squirm.The only real flaw in the movie (aside from the horror formula used over and over again) is the fact that if death wanted to get you it could find ways other than elaborate ways it does in this movie. Death would just give them all heart attacks and be done with it. It's like the when death wants to go get an ice cream cone it buys a cow and milks it and makes cream then mines the minerals to build a refrigerator to turn it into ice cream. It's all to hokey. If they could have figured out a way to not have that plot hole I might have given it a 8. But that dropped it down to a 7.,7,0,1,21 February 2006
The Matrix," Ground breaking on multiple levels
","I saw the Matrix without seeing any trailers nor ideas about what the movie was about. This probably helped make this a top 20 movie all time for me. The special effects are great, but special effects are only great when they augment a great plot (see Star Wars I & II for examples of how $ spent on SE and none on the script make for a lot of eye candy and a crap movie). The acting in this movie is great even though Reeves doesn't have to do much but look confused (I guess it no much of a stretch). Any movie that gives explanation to things we often think about (e.g. Deja vu etc) I love. That there is a hidden works going on behind the scenes makes for great entertainment. IMHO.Too bad next movie only has the Special effects and no new guts.",10,0,1,3 July 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," About as good as the first
","The first movie left the plot of the book about half way through the movie. I only read about 1/4 of the second book, but it looks like they didn't follow much of it all. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The story picks up 2 years later and Jason and Marie are hiding out in India. Jason has been framed (like the book only it's a different murder) and also targeted for kill by the guy who framed him (I'm not sure why they decided to frame him and then kill him..). Anyway the movie takes off when he goes into Bourne mode and kicks but doing his super spy stuff (which is the best parts of the movie). The must have been problems shooting the chase scenes because the dam camera jumping all over the place was driving me nuts. Hey may say it's for dramatic effect, I say it's because if you don't shoot the scene well you can't be edit it into a dramatic one. I don't know. Anyway the plot was good and the character Pamela Landy reminds me of Harvey Keitel in Thelma and Louise. I suppose they will complete make a new plot for the next movie and call it the 'Bourne Ultimatum' and not follow any of the third book. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 8/10 (would have been 9/10 if the chase scenes were not so camera jumpy).",8,18,32,29 November 2004
Cinderella Man," Moving story that puts you in the depression...
",I never heard of Jim Braddock nor Max Baer which helps in the suspense of this movie. It's well played by Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger as a couple that lost everything in the stock market crash. Jim is desperate to keep the family together as the sensible thing to do is send the kids off to relatives until they can get back on their feet. Jim makes a promise to his oldest son that he will not let that happen. Having kids myself I could really relate to the fear of your family living on the street. The movie does a really good job in showing how bad it was to be able to work and yet have no work. With no way to take care of your family you feel the helplessness of the people. The boxing in the movie is a means to an end. This isn't Rocky. This movie has a lot more heart. IMHO.,8,1,1,10 July 2007
The Island," Logan runs around in a matrix.
","Nothing original here, but the action is good (sometimes over the top). Someone wanted to remake Logan's run, tossing in some political discussion of clones and add a dash for the matrix and you have 'The Island'. The movie is not all bad. Ewan carries the action hero OK. You'll have to turn off your disbelief radar for 2 hours, while the plot (can't happen), action (no one would survive any of it) and romance (inevitable) takes place. Looking past a couple groaner moments, and a few characters looking at each other like things needed to go unsaid (lame), it wasn't all that bad. I really went with it let all that slide and going for a rating of 8, except one scene that the characters could not have survived, but not only did they did without a scratch. I dropped it to a 7 just for that scene. OK DVD rental. Glad I didn't pay for it (HBO free weekend TiVo :).",7,1,2,11 April 2007
