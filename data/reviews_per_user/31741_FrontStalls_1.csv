"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Queer Dinkum Matey
","A romp across a disbelieving outback, this outragous adventure enchants through it's downright brazeness. Comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as Drama from Crisis. Perhaps a little too Queenie for some - I would love to have watched IN a cinema audience in the outback. Shockingly good",4,4,13,23 September 2001
