Walk the Line," Wow
","Wow. Finally, you can believe the reviews! This film is awesome. I did listen to Johnny Cash before I saw Walk The Line, and I knew generally about his life - but not in that much detail. When I watched the film though, it almost swallowed me up. It completely hypnostised me. It takes you into a world of music and drama that you will find difficult to tear yourself away from. When the credits started rolling I really did want to sit there again and watch it for a second time. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as Johnny Cash and I can't find a single floor in his performance. Then there is Reese Witherspoon, who again plays an unbelievably convincing role as June Carter. Both actors have a chemistry which makes the film that bit more wonderful. I very rarely watch a film and say 'My gosh, that was so good' at the end of it; but at the end of that I could only say praise about this truly excellent film. It's a shame that Johnny and June couldn't be around to see this amazing film of their lives - because they would be so proud of it. If you want to see a film that will touch your heart, and make you truly believe that Johnny Cash's music is the best of its type - just watch this film and you will fall him love with it. Brilliant movie, amazing actors - definitely a must see.",10,2,4,24 March 2006
Closer," Absolutely Awful
","There were a lot of reviews that said that Closer was an amazing film you would be crazy to miss it. Now that I have seen it though, I really couldn't have cared less if I had missed it. It was, as my summary says - absolutely awful. All it was, was swearing and talking about sex. May be good in some films but in this one - something just didn't work. The characters didn't really seem to have that much of a chemistry, and they were all of different ages - and I'm not saying in 'love' you should be of the same age, but it gave the film a strange look. I think this film would meet some peoples tastes - but it would also a lot of people at how bad it is. I am not normally this negative about films, and I can find something good to say about them ...unfortunately I can find anything with this film. If you're thinking of renting it, or buying it - whatever. Just don't! It will completely waste your evening.",1,0,1,24 March 2006
Children of Men," It's OK
","This film, basically, is alright. It's not great - but it's not awful either. As an actual film, it lags out a bit, at some points it sort of feels like it doesn't know where to go. As a concept though? It's amazing. What would happen if we were suddenly unable to have children? That's the positive of this film - it really makes you think about how the world would go into complete havoc if there were no more children to make the future. Clive Owen's character Theo doesn't seem like a hero, but he pulls it off - and seems genuine. One thing that I really did like about this film is that they didn't make it too modern. Normally if films are set in the future - even if they're only about 20 years in the future, everything will be stupidly modern. Everything will be clean and full of mind-blowing technology. This film however, keeps the British roots, and keeps it real. I think the biggest technological improvement was moving adverts on buses instead of still ones. It may sound odd - but it's nice to see that for once, a film that is set in the future isn't using fake technology to make it seem like it's set in 2027. This film is OK, it's not brilliant, and can be boring at times. But it will definitely make your mind boggle as to what would happen if there was no children for the future. 5 out of 10",5,8,33,23 September 2006
Hancock," Hancock is awesome.
","I saw Hancock at an advanced screening while I was in America so I went into it having seen hardly any trailers for it so didn't really know what to expect. I knew the general plot outline - a superhero who isn't happy with his powers.This film, in short, is absolutely fantastic. I was completely entertained from start to finish. The characters just seemed to gel together and it came across that they really enjoyed working together which obviously makes for a good film.I would advise anyone seeing this film to not really watch the trailers because they reveal parts of the plot that are better left not knowing about to be honest.But do go and see this film because you wont be disappointed.",10,6,13,3 July 2008
