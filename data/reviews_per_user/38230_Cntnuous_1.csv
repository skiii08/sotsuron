Antz," An animated Ayn Rand novel!
","An exceptional movie that reminds one of an Ayn Rand novel - especially Atlas Shrugged.  It's a story of the triumph of 'I' over the collective 'we'.  The unlikely hero is an ant named Z who isn't particularly good at anything other than dreaming and thinking...on his own.Philosophy aside, this movie should be well received by adults and children alike.  There's enough visual excitement to keep the kids in their seats and enough plot and dialogue to keep the adults interested.  Adults will be more prone to leave the film profoundly impacted, however.  The Libertarian party should take the opportunity to set up registration tables outside every theater playing Antz!On a technical note, this film doesn't look to be nearly as advanced as Pixar's upcoming 'A Bug's Life'.  While Antz' achievements are still dazzling, they are no where near as sophisticated as what Pixar is putting out.  Antz is a lesson in the color brown, while A Bug's Life looks to be a rainbow of incredibly fine detail.  But, honestly, this doesn't matter a whole heck of a lot - people see movies for the story.  These excellent characters could have been hand-drawn stick figures and the film would have still played well.",9,0,1,14 October 1998
