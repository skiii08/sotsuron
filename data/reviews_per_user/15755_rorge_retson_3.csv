Skyfall," Not impressed
","Don't understand the high ratings for this movie. I found Skyfall to be predictable, boring, and sad in its roteness. So many plot points come out of the need to cater to the ignorant and slow viewer, it is unbelievable that this was made in a post-Bourne Identity world. (The Bourne Trilogy - it will remain a trilogy to me as I refuse to see the most recent potboiler - should have shown Hollywood that viewers have brains and appreciate a plot that requires small leaps of faith... unfortunately, this film insults, rather than has faith in the viewer).Spoiler: For example, in the final sequence where Silva is looking for Bond, M, and Kincade, Finney's character uses a flashlight to find the chapel on Skyfall's property, when there is plenty of available light and no flashlight is needed. This makes it easy for Silva to find them when he is looking around to see if anyone has survived the blast. This was totally unnecessary. The writers could have easily just shown the chapel by itself, which would have been enough. These types of insults pepper the entire film. This should not have been a James Bond movie.",1,15,31,23 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne is Still a Trilogy
","Too long, too copycat, and had no business having Bourne in the title.This is a perfect example of a movie that shows the heart of Hollywood decision-makers for what it is - full of fear. It is sad that so much money is spent on redundancy rather than creativity.If this movie had its own title, its own storyline, its own everything - it could actually stand on its own merits. Instead, we have a franken-movie that attempts to graft onto a decent script these useless appendages and rotting leftovers from a dug up grave. Just plain sad.Matt Damon was smart enough to know when to call it quits on Jason Bourne, why couldn't Hollywood? Oh yeah, that's right - it's Hollywood. Let's ride this horse 'till it drops, then prop it up with two-by-fours and pretend like we're riding it some more.Bourne rode a motorcycle and did some tricks with it? Let's have this new guy ride a motorcycle, and do tricks with it too...only let's have THIS chase THREE TIMES as long as the other Bourne one - YEAH, THAT'LL MAKE IT BETTER!!! Bourne ran across rooftops? Let's have this guy run across rooftops too... because those are the only things we can do in action movies - motorcycle stunts and rooftop chases. I mean, what else is there in life and movies, right??? Pathetic.",3,0,2,12 January 2013
Unbroken," I'll never get that 2.5 hours back...
","The characters were okay, but they went through the same scenarios again, and again, and again, and again, and again...I had heard that Zamperini had a very interesting life after the war. Unfortunately, the movie ended on the tarmac upon his return to the U.S. Why? I must agree with the other posters - for a 2.5+ hour movie, I would have expected the whole story.... or at least more than half of it.The emotionality was there in Wantanabe, Zamperini, and several of his mates. I just grew tired of the same thing repeated over and over.It is interesting how the coal carrying sequence was so long... like how the viewers had to carry the movie all the way to the 137 minute mark...",2,2,3,21 June 2015
