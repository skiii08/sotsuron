The Avengers," Not the Best movie ever seen!
","I am really disappointed by IMDb! It cannot be that a movie is rated with 9+++ before it actually goes to the screen. I did not want to watch this movie when i saw the trailer. Unfortunately i read Reviews and got misled by this high rating on IMDb. I expected much but i got an average action movie. The movie was not entertaining by profoundness. It was an 2 1/2 hour orgy of visual fireworks. This may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants a story, good character description and most important a movie which is not completely foreseeable.IMDb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the Reviewers. I give 6 of 10 because the visual effects were great but thats not what defines a good movie.",6,3,8,6 June 2012
