The Blair Witch Project," Scary as Return of the Killer Tomatoes
","This movie is so bad that I thought I would die of boredom while I was watching it, It is about 90 min long but it felt like 5. People say that the people that don't like this movie have been brainwashed by high budget horror movies, but that isn't true this movie is just so bad. It is over acted and most of the shoots are so dark that you cant see what is going on or pointed at something that doesn't make any sense pointing at like a tent. And if you want something scary don't watch this movie get The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Misery, Carrie or The Lion King.I Rank This Movie zero of five stars thank you very much because like my friend Jay Sherman movie critic would say `It Stinks'",Null,1,2,29 January 2000
