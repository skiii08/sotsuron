Scarface," Definitely one of my top 10 flicks of all time
","Its one of the best gangster classics. Oliver Stone, Al Pacino and the master De Palma - what do you expect? Forget about the top notch thrilling scenes and focus on Pacino's and Robert Loggia's dialog! Its an Oscar movie but not the Hollywood style. Excellent direction, casting and story that is different than untouchables, Godfather or good fellas. Pacino's character can be compared to Frankenstein. A truthful, honest and brutal monster that you will sympathize with. Don't let any comments spoil the surprise; just watch it. It will knock out the white sand out of your Funky brains. A must see and own on DVD; not for tasteless KIDZ though!!! You know what I mean? Trust me.",10,0,1,28 December 2006
