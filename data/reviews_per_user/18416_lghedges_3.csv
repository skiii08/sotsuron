First Man," History at its Finest!
","I will keep this review short. If you aspire to go to space, reach Mars, travel the furthest from Earth, follow the steps of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Mike Collins, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise etc etc then you will love this movie and be inspired to keep on following your dream.If however you just want a good movie to keep you entertained then sadly this is not for you. You will get bored very quickly.Me personally: I loved this movie and think it shows just how far mankind can really go! Great artistic shots, great scenery, excellent acting (well, for most) and of course great directing! 10/10. Then again, I aspire to reach my dream.",10,25,57,11 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," There are issues but it's Star Wars
","There are issues with this movie don't get me wrong. But there are also great moments that outweigh these problems. Most fan theories were met and I guess this impacts a lot of people and makes the movie boring. But there's only so much Abrams could've done. I loved this movie because it reminded me of why I like star wars. The music was amazing and the non stop action was brilliant. But it took me back to when I was child playing with lightsabers in the back yard. I don't like star wars because it's an award winning movie series. I like it because it is fake. It is an escape and it allows us to live in a world of sci-fi dreams. Lazer swords, space ships, robots, and planets. George Lucas created a universe of escape and in this last movie, I found redemption. I found escape. For the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes I was in a dream world and it had my emotions all over the place. That is Star Wars.
I'm sorry most fans are upset because they're opinions on what should've happened weren't met. But we forgive the mistakes star wars makes because it gives us a dream world where we can all go back and be children at heart.JJ brought me home in this movie. The Rise of Skywalker is a Star Wars movie and I'm greatful for every bit of it.
Thank you for concluding my childhood",10,2,7,19 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," New Favorite Director
",This movie stole my heart and had everything in it I could have possibly wanted. It was funny and clever but was also mature enough that it was serious about the war themes. Taika Waititi wins best performance as the imaginary friend Adolf and best director and best writing. He is such a wonderful man I feel bad for not giving him any chances until now. JoJo Rabbit deserves such a high score it really does for so many reasons,10,8,18,22 December 2019
