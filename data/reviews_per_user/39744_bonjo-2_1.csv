Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People who complain miss the point.
","Many people have taken exception to the fact that this film is lighter and more kid-oriented than the first three. Jar Jar Binks IS an irritation, yes... But, don't forget: Four through Six were primarilly a coming-of-age story regarding what were basically teenage feelings about growing up. Is it a coincidence that when Luke finally comes into his own as a Jedi that the cute and childlike Ewoks enter the picture. Shades of parenting, perhaps?Episode One seems to have set the bar for the first series. That is, it is seemingly directed at younger children. And perhaps there might be an overall arc to the 'lead' character when considered in the whole of the series. That is, even though the lead changes, essentially the story being told is one of growing up, from early childhood (ep. 1), through teen angst and adventure (ep. 4), romance, dark discoveries, and discipline (ep. 5), through eventual maturity, responsibility, and acceptance (ep. 6). If this is the case, and it might not be, think of the wonderful nuggets of truth that await us all in 7 through 9!And even if I'm wrong, we all know that Jar Jar Binks is going to eventually die anyway. That's something to look forward to.",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
