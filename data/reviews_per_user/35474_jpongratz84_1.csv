Skyfall," Job well done Wilson and Broccoli
","This review might be a little lengthy, so let me give you the short version just in case you don't have the time: This was an excellent movie and if you are a fan of the franchise, once you see the ending you'll wish the next one would come out the following week.Before going to see this third movie, I went back and watched Casino Royale and Quantum, both of which I thought were good (both held true to the formula of some of the most classic Bond movies, despite exploring the character from a different angle).Casino Royale was James Bond's first 'outing' and when it was over I assumed that the character was fully introduced and as ready for action as he was in Dr. No. When Quantum came out, I realized that it would take more than one movie to fully sculpt the double-0 agent into the man that we all know. Skyfall brings in any missing element into action.We all know that Q is in this film (from the trailer). Any respect for Desmond Llewelyn is still there. The new character is excellent and holds true to the original. The Walther PPK is back, and so is the Aston Martin (she has a good amount of screen time)! Fans of the franchise will love Skyfall. It holds true to every aspect of the James Bond formula.I'm not sure if this is a spoiler (better safe than sorry) but let me just say that the ending of Skyfall could lead right into Dr. No and, despite the different actors and decades, we wouldn't miss a step! And even though the transition is seamless, the possibilities of future installments is endless!",9,5,14,14 November 2012
