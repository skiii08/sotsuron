The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Sad, Pathetic & Lame - Corporate Kleptocracy Money Grab
","Boring to point I got up and went to back of theater to check IMDb on my Tablet to see what was I missing. Obviously I was lacking somehow and must be missing something I figured with all the rage around this movie. What I found was it was not me but the movie just does not connect, has no draw and feels like just a corporate money scheme. I feel cheated, dirty, like a stupefied sucker and want to take a shower. I get better vibes from used car sales lots than this movie as well the industry of late.There were some good movies this year; but all that has come out pre- Holidays have been lame to terrible and I see a lot of movies. Maybe the 'Interview' had real potential compared to this tripe I have seen here and in other recent releases of movies.I watch a wide genre of movies and am open to diverse visual and story arts but this and the recent movies are so terrible literally. I am finding better more engaging shows on TV than what the theaters offer nowadays. Heck they can not be original and rehash same old stories; well okay that might be fine if the surpassed the originals and yet even special effects seem at best B movie compared to the epics of the 60's and such. Dang maybe they just need to go back to Spaghetti Westerns; at least they were entertaining somewhat....All I feel is fleeced; again by the movie industry and it is getting old. But all they seem to care about is cha-ching, cha-ching, cha- ching. Guess the 4th Quarter is more important than their long term outlook as a industry. More people are catching on and just say screw it and why theaters are more and more empty.We know the technology, actor resources and financial might of these studios more than ever and how they are refusing to do the real work it takes to put something out that is worthy out dollars. No wonder so many people seek other media sources over theater these days; with ticket cost outrageous, $2 in snacks costing $20 for stale muck, floors your feet stick to when walking and seating that needs a biohazard warning label. I have no idea why people are over the theater experience with such bad movies to boot!",3,20,28,22 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Excellent Movie - Life & Death Depending on Intellect vs,Societies Ignorance's Endangering Freedom from Tyranny
","Excellent Movie - Ignore the Few Bad Review's! One star ratings are from our lovely 'Foaming at The Mouth - Agenda Driven - Radical Right Wing - Evangelicals' who hate anything that has a gay person in it; much less exposing how horribly ignorant society was towards women as well. They still are deluded into thinking the 50's was all a 'Leave It To Beaver' paradise for all in society as they forget the atrocities to blacks, Italian's, gays, women, Jew's, disabled, Latinos (sure I missed many more who were abused by such mindsets they espouse then and even this day). As well the poverty and the openly embracing of hate and many more ignorance's that they clinch still to this day to. If they were not so dangerous and holding society back I would pity them, alas they are as big a threat as any fanatic is regardless of who or what they believe. So one star people keep your bigoted hate in your place of worship and in your petty party politics of control devising ways to abuse others you so endeavor so hard; we are moving forward with or without you in the USA.Movie has a solid cast of characters with great cinematography and well balanced story that keeps you interested in the film and its characters as it takes back to the WWII era in England and see the underlying efforts to win the war and unlikely people behind the scenes that made such happen.The movie was excellent in showing the bravery of unsung hero's and how the war was won through brains and how many went unnoted and even suffered scorn by those ignorant to their true selfless actions for the war effort. How our ignorance could of and likely cost us more death than was necessary because we judged by superficial bigoted means and not by character and persons abilities. Movie pointed out indirectly how even then, women were still seen as property with little say in their lives if they were to be of virtue and have any hope of social status. How that even in adulthood that they must blindly obey thy parents or have a husband to answer to and permiss them their very activities. How pre and during WWII women were limited career wise; regardless of talents and education. That is unless they were able to lie and deceive the gatekeepers of who could and could not succeed and prosper on their own merits; regardless of gender, skin color and sexual orientation.We also see how allowing society to sub-come to ignorant views and bigoted perceptions not only can destroy innocent people; but how such leaves upon society so many potential needless loss of life because such ignorance cost them the talent and skills another had to offer humanity. I wonder how much we have lost unknowingly do to the ignorant and bigoted people who demand and self proclaim they know what is best for everyone including others they know not and who preach freedom as long as the freedom is their liking and under their control.Movie has a great direct story and many underlying life lessons some to this day still refuse to accept and wish to drag society back into there 1st century thinking's! Well we will not allow you and your ignorance's are now in the open for all to see and judge by your actions and words of what and who you really are regardless of who you claim to follow or believe in.",10,2,7,16 January 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," What an Amazing Letdown - SAD! - Waist of My Time & Those with Me!
","Wow! What an amazing letdown. I can not believe anyone found this movie interesting or enjoyable. I have seen bad movies, can deal with bad movies as well, this movie is such a waste of time and so many tremendous resources wasted is mind numbing.I have no idea how it got Oscar. Not even worthy a pity party award. I got my money back on this movie. I have only done that once ever prior in my very long life.I would not see this moving if I was bored to death and it was free. Paint drying would hold more value than this waste of effort. Sad!",1,13,27,11 March 2015
Lucy," Fun & Interesting - Not the best but was worth the time!
","It was okay sci-fi that was plain enough for tweens, teens and adults seeking a simple sci-fi & shoot em up type genera that was easy to just sit and enjoy as is. Also there was enough for the more intellectually oriented to think about and contemplate some of the scientific fantasy sci-fi aspects as they as well enjoy the movie for what it is. Do not expect the movie to be based on solid proved current scientific understandings with its premises or how such events come to occur; that is why it is a sci-fi fantasy. Saw so many complaints in reviews here and other sites about it not being 100% scientifically correct etc. Tralala...Too often many adults seemingly lose imagination and become rigid as they get stuck on technicalities and are only able to relate to their understandings which often is what they find comfort in and/or seem to just seek to show they know better and basically fault find in a seeming sad attempt to prove their intellectual superiority instead just allowing the mind to stay flexible and enjoy such genres as is. There are many free documentaries and as well free college lectures widely available on the web if you are seeking such; this genre if for enjoyment by many demographics with varied interest and skill levels.Not being mentally locked in is why kids often make profound observations on things about a issue that have been right before us but we adults seemingly have missed or can not see. This is why kids often have uncharacteristic insights that we adults often miss because we have lost contact with our own imagination or ability to look at things from differing perspectives and points of view as we have failed in keeping and nourishing an open imagination into and throughout adulthood. Guess that is why many new ideas, technologies or re-purposed old technologies and as well many key scientific discoveries occur by young people, if child or adult. That is why we must keep open flexible minds, learn to listen and not just hear and be open to what youth notes and support their understanding without causing them to lose their imaginations and creativity. Easier said than done, I know.Just enjoy; it is a sci-fi movie which is for fun as well some thought provoking aspects if you so choose to allow such or wish such. This movie is not going to win a Oscar; but hey it was okay and not a total waste of time and many seemed to enjoy the movie in the audience I was in from what I observed.Thanks and lets be nice to each other; life is cruel enough without any help from us in making is more hurtful, of which we should know better anyway...",7,2,10,7 August 2014
