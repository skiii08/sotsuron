The Longest Yard," funny funny funny
","I saw this movie, and being a wrestling fan, and used the loud groans, and bone crunches, I loved every minute of this film. The ending was predictable...thats why I didn't give it a 10/10....but who cares... The cinema I saw it in with about 200 others loved it...laughed in all the right places, and cheered the 'Mean Machine'.Lighten up people...this is what escapism is all about. Sandler as a football pro..OK he's small..the subtitles were unnecessary with Dilip Singh (I hope Vinnie sees him and signs him) and Nellie, Goldberg, Austin and Nash (did they pay that man enough) were cool. I even forgave them for putting Burt Reynolds in the movie and pretending he could take the knocks..but then I like to be entertained and didn't take it all so seriously.",8,1,3,7 June 2005
