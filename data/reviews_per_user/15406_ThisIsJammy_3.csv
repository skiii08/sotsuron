10 Cloverfield Lane," Good writing with some topnotch performance and right amount of VFX.
","*This review does not contain any spoilers* Note: To fully understand the film better watch Cloverfield (2008) before you watch this.Interesting thriller that keeps you hooked and excited throughout the 1 hour 44 minutes run time. The 3 characters and there acting stands out and its actually those characters that keep the tension ticking each minute.Kudos to the director for not wasting a single minute right from the title card and to the end when the director name appears. The editor is surely the hero of the film and this kind of screenplay is exactly what you ask for.As said before the film looks terrific throughout but from the brave heart team, the last few minutes may leave you with some confused thoughts whether this film was how it was supposed to end. Leaving those thoughts to yourself I have nothing much to say, Hell yeah i am confused and I'm just jibber jabbering. :P PS: Don't ask suggestions from anyone or check some Wannabe reviewers review right before you watch the film. They may spoil the fun. Just go for it.",8,0,2,6 May 2016
Airlift," Masterpiece making leads to a epic film.
","I can vouch you that this film is surely the Indian version of 'Schindler's List'. *Proud me* The best thing about a film is 'The emotion in art'. No other form of art, be it books or paintings can shows the real emotions that films can do. When that art meets 'the best of history' the word 'epic' gets the right meaning and this film is one such epic.The film follows Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, as he carries out the evacuation of 170,000 Indians based in Kuwait , the Invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's Iraq and believe me, the movie follows NOTHING ELSE than the plot (Pun intended).Big salute to the director of the film Raja Krishna Menon for keeping the film damn straight from the start. There are no plot twists, there is no sudden unwanted songs and the director only focuses on the emotions in the plot, which indeed makes you love the film. With such directing talent in hand and running time just 125 minutes, my greed for more characters and deep characterization's's has no bounds.The Bollywood film industry is back to its old ways and with films like Bajirao Mastani, Neerja, Airlift and Fan, my love for the Hindi films has increased.",9,0,0,22 April 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool is freaking uber cool film!!
",The film was dame straight from the start of the promotions. All the film wanted to do is to entertain the bad ass audience from the start to the end of the film. Has it done it? Yes it does. Thanks to the promotion and advertisement team for giving us uber cool super mugs.Some may say the real hero of the film is its humour but believe me its not. The biggest hero of the film is its screenplay. The director exactly knew the pulse of the audience and did justice to it.Ryan Reynolds is of course the show stealer and Morena Baccarin looks gorgeous especially in the last 1 hour. Better don't go late to the show or leave the theater after the film ends because you are going to feel for it afterwards. Hoping to see more cool ass film making like this,8,6,18,14 February 2016
