Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Take the joke
","Its not Kazakhstan his making fun of. In the end of the movie its the U.S.A. In fact the movie sold best in Kazakhstan. Now when I read some reviews from Americans who did not like, understand I can see where Cohens coming from. People really need to calm down. The U.S.A exploits hundreds movies a year with dumb Eouropeans, just look at Euro trip, Beerfest, Boat trip etc and in to many films to mention there is a joke about them. What about the Russians that was a good wasn't it. I thought it was really funny and playing on funny and relevant ideas of Americans (and the rest of the world, but mainly U.S.A) idea on 'third wold countries'",9,1,7,22 May 2007
