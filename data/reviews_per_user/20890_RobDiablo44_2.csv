The Ring," The Suspension of Disbelief factor
","This movie depends on how much you're willing to let slide.  Lotta plot holes.  Lotta stuff that just 'don't make no sense'.  But on the plus side of the ledger, very creepy, very atmospheric, and some truly great scares (the first 1/2 hour will have the hairs on your arms standing on end). Will the scary stuff outweigh the 'huh?' factor?  You should check it out and see.  And I also think this one would be better in the theater (but I think that's the case with all scary movies.)6 out of 10 'seven days. . '",6,0,0,8 January 2003
Am√©lie," Almost too much to take in!
","I enjoyed this movie a great deal, but it was so visually stimulating that I found myself rushing to read the subtitles.  By the end, I was exhausted. Does this reflect badly on me?  I dunno.  Maybe I should learn French. Audrey Tautou was mesmerizing.  I wish she were my weasel.  In my opinion, an excellent movie for those who have never seen a foreign film before. Light, funny, and unpretentious.  7 out of 10 - 'Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's.'",9,1,4,13 February 2003
