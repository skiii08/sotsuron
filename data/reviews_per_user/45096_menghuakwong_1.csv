The New World," Long and Boring
","Well... I have waited since the first release date of The New World had been canceled to see the movie because from the trailer it looks way beautiful and sound pretty interesting ( I liked Pocahontas from Walt Disney a lot, I saw both parts of it.) Today, Jan 20th, I saw the movie and i was really upset. I love long movie (like King Kong, i love that one.) but The New World... i don't know, it just a pretty long and boring show of the story. The main idea of the story still works just fine but I don't really see a good pictures, but that is from my own perspective. I still encourage our friends to go and see the way the producer makes this movie (make up was OK IF there are some interesting actions were in the movie...). And, i know the soundtrack didn't work that good, it was really annoying at some parts of the movie. It was playing for too long and too loud, it just didn't fit well in the movie. He was way good at 'Titanic' but i don't know, close to perfect still not a perfect... i am not a musician but i just don't like the way it sounds in some parts of the movie, and again that is from my own perspective. To sum up, i was upset and disappointed because it was one of the big movies that was in my waiting to see list... i am sorry everyone...",3,3,9,20 January 2006
