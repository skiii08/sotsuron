Spartacus," Roman Slaves' Cry For Freedom Is Clearly Heard Through This Film
","In spite of some historical inaccuracies, the epic spectacle 'Spartacus' (1960) is a remarkable movie which should be rightly called late Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece (even though he practically disowned it). 
The cast members are excellent.  Kirk Douglas was perfectly cast as this historical slave revolt leader.  In fact, he was the right age.  (Spartacus was in his late 30's when he revolted while Douglas was about 45 when he made this film.)  Sir Lawrence Olivier is superb as the cocky and filthy-rich Roman politician Crassus.  Other players including Peter Ustinov, John Gavin (yes, Honorable John Gavin, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico) and Charles Laughton are equally magnificent in their respective roles.  The drama and emotion of this film moved me to tears.The last decisive battle scene between the slave army and Roman legions was magnificently staged. The extras playing the Roman legionnaires marched in formation so precisely, and the whole formation moved like a single organism.  The blinding flash, which was created when thousands of extras simultaneously pointed their shields toward the camera, was absolutely awe-inspiring.  Just before the two armies clashed, thousands of extras playing the Roman army quickly and precisely reorganized the formation to create skirmish lines.  This was a site to behold.   It must have been absolutely terrifying for the foes of Rome to watch the formations of these robot-like, super-precise Roman legionnaires charging toward them.  (No wonder the extras moved with such a precision.  The Roman soldiers were played by 8000 infantrymen from the Spanish Army.) The whole thing was so good it gave me goose bumps.Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, there are some almost mandatory historical inaccuracies:  1)  Roman historians recorded that Spartacus was sold as a slave as a punishment for deserting from the Roman army.  There is no record of his working in a Libyan mine.  According to Roman historian Plutarch, Spartacus was sold to a gladiator school run by a man named Lentulus Batiatus (played in the movie by Peter Ustinov). 2)  Spartacus apparently did not meet his wife at the gladiator school.  He was already married at the time he was sold as a slave, and his wife was also sold as a slave. 3)  Spartacus' slave army suffered greatly from an internal strife which eventually led to its defeat by Crassus' legions.  (This internal strife was not even mentioned in the movie.)  Spartacus and his followers within the slave army wanted to flee from Italy and disband the army outside the Roman territory so all the foreign slaves can return home.  Others wanted to remain in Italy and keep on looting. 4)  In the movie, Spartacus forbade his men from forcing Roman prisoners to fight as gladiators.  However, real Spartacus apparently made many Roman captives to fight in gladiator fights. 5) Both Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his brother Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, famous pro-plebian reformers, died decades before Spartacus' revolt.  The film is unclear as to whether the Charles Laughton character is Tiberius or his brother. 6) Crassus' last decisive campaign against Spartacus was more complex and time-consuming than what was portrayed in the movie.  It involved building dozens of miles of fortifications near the southern tip of Italy and decimation (i.e. execution of one in ten soldiers) of his own defeated legions for cowardice.  However, these historical inaccuracies did not lessen the value of this movie.  The cry for freedom by Spartacus and other slaves 2000 years ago can be clearly heard through this movie.  All lovers of Roman epic should see this movie!",Null,3,7,13 October 2001
Gettysburg," Not Perfect, But Excellent. I Recommend it.
","Over the last twenty to thirty years, movie studios have been reluctant to make history-based large epic films because they cost so much but are rarely successful financially.  In spite of this trend, in 1993 Turner Movie released 'Gettysburg,' a large-scale epic film depicting the decisive 1863 Civil War battle.  When I saw this film for the first time back in 1993, I thought that it is an excellent film although not perfect.   
The cast members were generally excellent.  Although some professional critics gave negative comments about Martin Sheen's portrayal of Gen. Robert E. Lee, I felt that Sheen did a great job of depicting this Civil War general.  I still clearly remember the nobility of Sheen's Lee when he answered his soldiers' cheer of  `Lee! Lee! Lee!' Tom Berenger, who is really at home playing gung-ho characters, superbly played Gen. Long-street, a large, tacit man.  Sam Shepherd played the forgotten hero of Gettysburg, Brigadier Gen. John Buford, quietly and convincingly.  Jeff Bridges was excellent as the dauntless scholar-soldier, Col. (later Major General) Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who won the skirmish on the Big Round Top which, some historians say, changed the entire course of the Battle of Gettysburg and ultimately the Civil War.  Bridges played this quiet ex-college professor, who immediately went back to teaching after the Civil War, so ef-fectively that I could feel this scholar-soldier's courage and strength through his performance. I was glad to see Buck Taylor, whom I have not seen for a long time.  (He was Newly O'Brien in the TV series 'Gun-smoke.')  Thanks to the great performance of the cast members, I was not once bored during the entire 4-hour duration of this very long film. 
The battle scenes were staged competently. Unlike many other films, this movie was not myopic in its portrayal of battle scenes.  Many other war movies look awfully myopic because the directors have to make a limited number of extras to look like tens of thousands of soldiers; therefore, they can rarely use the panoramic long shot.  However, for this film, the director assembled thousands of Civil War re-enacters and, therefore, could use many panoramic long shots.  For example, Pickett's charge (estimated to be 15,000 strong historically) absolutely came to life in this film.  I knew about this ill-fated charge since I was only about eight; nevertheless, until I saw this film, it was merely a vague description in pages of history books.  It was re-enacted magnificently in this film with approximately 5000 Civil-War re-enacters. There are many good points about the script.   I am happy to see that the creative minds behind this film cared about historical accuracies unlike many other Hollywood screenwriters.  This film was relatively faithful to the history and the book 'Killer Angels.'  (Although Michael Schaara's 'Killer Angels' is relatively accurate historically, the author did take some liberties with history--including some of the positions of the Union troops during the battle.)  Even though this movie was depicted largely from the point of view of some famous historical figures like Gen. Lee and Longstreet, many parts of this film was seen through the eyes of Col. Joshua Chamberlain, a historical character and a regular Joe who turned into a tiger when confronted by hundreds of screaming Confederates.  He is a sympathetic but heroic character whom an average moviegoer can easily relate to.  No screenwriter could have created a more ideal movie character than Col. Chamberlain, but he is a real human being who lived until just before World War I.  (This is a good lesson for many Hollywood writers who are known to frequently add unnecessary and boring fictional characters to historical epics. By adding fictional characters, the historical epic loses authenticity.  Moreover, there are usually no need to add fictional characters to history-based dramas.  Many of the historical figures--including Col. Chamberlain--are fascinating people, much more interesting than most of Hollywood's fictional characters.) 
Unfortunately, the script also has some Achilles' heels.  For some inexplicable reason, the screenwriters made many of the lines of the film's characters seem sermon-like and unnatural.  Take for instance, the conversation between Gen. Armistead and Lt. Colonel Freemantle just before Pickett's charge.  Armistead's lines were so stilted and unnatural.  He sounded more like a politician making a speech to a large audience or a preacher making a big Sunday sermon.  Because of the time constraint of a theatrical movie, many interesting subplots and story lines of the novel 'Killer Angels' were deleted from the film.  (For example, the meeting between Longstreet and a shadowy pro-Confederate spy or the scene in which Gen. Meade and his staff were having a sumptuous meal oblivious to his starving men.)   To portray many of these interesting story lines, Turner Movie should have made `Gettysburg' into a ten-hour TV mini-series. 
Although not perfect, 'Gettysburg' is a fine historical epic film.  I highly recommend this film.",9,0,1,29 October 2001
American Beauty," A Timeless Masterpiece Disguised As a Simple Satire
","Since the 1980's American movie audience has been inundated with mindless movies in which macho stars blow up dozens of buildings and machine-gun down hundreds of villains and their underlings.  However, I am glad to see that both critics and movie audience understood and greatly appreciated `American Beauty,' a recent movie which deeply explored the meaning of reality using methods employed by cinematic giants like Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa.'American Beauty' innocently and rather deceptively starts with a satirical portrayal of an 'average' American family (with commonplace problems like the parents' mid-life career frustrations and uneasy relationship with the rebellious teen-age daughter).  However, soon after the movie begins, the viewer is faced with a foreshadowing and suspense of an impending disaster. As the movie progresses, the 'average' family deteriorates into drug use, adultery and murder conspiracy, and the viewer begins to realize that the problem posed by this movie is not confined to the predicaments experienced by this 'average' family.  The real problem is with the fundamental flaw in the modern American value system--its social convention, morality and what is expected of an average member of the society.  Moreover, through the use of Fellinesque fantasy sequences, rich use of cinematic symbolism and cinematic warping of time and space, this movie even questions our perception of reality.  That is to say, the movie shows us alternative ways of perceiving reality and confronts us with the fact that reality (or the perception of reality) is wholly subservient to our psyche.
'American Beauty' is a rightful descendant of masterpieces like Kurosawa's `Rashomon' and Fellini's `8 ½,' which redefined the meaning of reality. This movie is a timeless masterpiece, and the critical and public acclaim showered on this movie is well-deserved.",Null,2,4,6 October 2001
Pearl Harbor," A Crowd-pleasing Melodrama But Definitely Not A Masterpiece
","Screenwriter Randall Wallace did it again.  In 1995, he sentimentalized, melodramatized and generally dumbed up the historical accounts about William Wallace and wrote a rather mediocre script for the movie 'Braveheart.'  He did it again for 'Pearl Harbor.' He twisted and warped well-documented historical accounts and ended up with a weak script, which has an annoyingly predictable story line.  Moreover, the film clumsily climaxed right in the middle and kept on dragging on and on after that.The only saving grace of this movie was its battle scenes.  Unlike many other phony Hollywood war movies, the technical consultants of the movie amazed me with a great attention to details.  Many of the replicas of Japanese naval planes were constructed with minute details.  Most of the Zeros, Vals and Kates were painted very accurately in light gray or greenish camouflage.  Some of the machine guns on these planes were constructed surprisingly accurately.  (There was a slight inaccuracy in painting some of the Zeros greenish.  Historically, all the Zeros, which participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, were painted light gray.)  Even though they were reproductions, the uniforms of the Japanese pilots (i.e. brown flight suits) and Japanese aircraft carrier crewmen (i.e. white outfits for enlisted men and black outfits for officers) were relatively accurate.
A scene of a meeting of Japanese naval staff in which several large models of U.S. battleships were placed in a pool was surprisingly accurate historically.  According to an account written by a former member of the Imperial Japanese Naval staff, such a meeting did indeed take place in late 1941 at a Japanese naval base.  During this meeting top members of Japanese naval staff and several admirals did indeed debate about the tactics of Pearl Harbor attack while experimenting with several models of U.S. warships, which were placed in a large pool.  However, I am not sure if Admiral Yamamoto himself participated in this meeting.
The attack scenes on Pearl Harbor were filmed excellently.  Even though the scenes in this movie were not as good as those in the 1970 movie `Tora, Tora, Tora,' the computer-generated animations were very well done.  Also, the panic, pain and carnage at Pearl Harbor were depicted very well.
Japanese-American actor Mako played Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto very well. Just like Mako, Yamamoto was a short unremarkable looking man.  In fact, Mako looked like the real Yamamoto more than late Toshiro Mifune, who played him in a 1976 war movie `Midway' and 1968 movie `Isoroku Yamamoto.' Another Japanese-American actor Cary Tagawa played Captain Genda very competently.
WARNING!!!  POSSIBLE SPOILER.  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ THIS, GO TO THE POINT MARKED WITH ******     Unfortunately, there were many really disappointing things about this movie.  The script of the film is very weak and clumsy.  For instance, the movie climaxed with the attack on Pearl Harbor which happened right about the middle.  The rest of the movie which led to the Doolittle's raid dragged on and on.  Moreover, why did the movie end with Doolittle's raid?  Even though this raid had some moral significance, this was a rather unsatisfactorily tame ending for this movie. Why didn't the director end this movie with the Battle of Midway, where the U.S. Navy did indeed spectacularly avenge the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor?   The director did not have to portray the entire Battle of Midway. He only had to show the crucial scene in which U.S. dive bombers attack and destroy three Japanese aircraft carriers.  That would have been a more satisfactory and spectacular ending to this movie.The movie's central story line about the love of Capt. McCawley, his best friend Capt. Walker and the beautiful nurse Stewart was rather cliché and highly predictable.  Similar story lines have been used by Hollywood dozens of times in the past.  The story was so predictable that I could foresee the outcome hours before the ending.  Couldn't Hollywood writers come up with something new?  Also, why did McCawley and Walker, who were fighter pilots, participate in Doolittle's raid, an attack by medium bombers?  I did not know that U.S. fighter pilots were cross-trained to fly bombers.
The scene of a meeting of top Japanese admirals and generals was so ridiculously portrayed that it became a laughing stock of some Japanese movie critics.  With Japanese soldiers dressed in crisp uniform standing next to a banner with the slogan `Service to Our Country' exquisitely written in large Chinese characters, this scene looked convincing, but only superficially.  Historically, no outdoor meeting like this ever took place. (In fact, top secret meetings anywhere in the world are rarely held outdoor due to security problems.  Almost all top secret meetings are held indoor in secure meeting rooms.)  Numerous meetings between top Japanese army and naval brasses did take place during 1940 and 1941.  But they all took place at secure meeting rooms within the Army and Naval Ministry buildings in Tokyo.Just like in many other Hollywood war movies, the enemy soldiers in this movie were total morons.  Japanese soldiers captured McCawley and Walker but failed to search them for weapons--a very elementary battlefield procedure. While several Japanese soldiers were pointing their rifles at both McCawley and Walker, McCawley suddenly pulled out a Colt pistol and killed all the Japanese soldiers.  Those mentally-retarded Japanese could not even hit McCawley once.  In Hollywood movies, all Japanese and German soldiers are clumsy morons.   If Japanese and Germans are so dumb, why did the U.S. lose so many men and women during WW II and spent almost four years to defeat them?   I cannot figure out.*******  This movie is neither a great masterpiece nor a total flop.  I agree with many people that `Tora, Tora, Tora' was a much better movie. `Pearl Harbor' was just a mediocre movie with good battle scenes and a very weak, cliché script.",5,0,1,2 March 2003
Mission: Impossible II," One Long Self-Indulgence in Narcissism
","Hey, Tom Cruise.  If you are reading this comment, I want to tell you that your recent movie 'Mission Impossible 2' STINKS.  Tom, you and your sidekick John Woo (who is reputed to be a very competent director) seem to lack any common sense.  In this movie, your character, Ethan Hunt, is virtually Superman himself.  He can shoot from a moving motorcycle and hit a target without any problem whatsoever.  He is a martial arts expert, better than Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme combined.  He is a great lady-killer, better than Casanova, Don Juan or James Bond. I was amazed that he did not fire laser beams from his eyes.  Ethan nonchalantly does super dangerous things just for the heck of it and succeeds without any problem whatsoever.  Tom, let me teach you common sense.  When a character is so absolutely perfect and super-duper cool, the character becomes very boring and tiring.  Moreover, after Ethan repeatedly puts himself in danger for no rational reason (maybe just for the fun of it), I became sick and tired of his self-indulgent, childish antics.  Even worse, Tom, why did this movie focus so much on your character?  It looked as if your character dominated all the major scenes in the movie.   I saw you so much in the movie that I couldn't stand seeing your face anymore. Tom, don't you know that the fun of any drama--be it a film or TV show--is in watching the interactions of different characters?  There is nothing more boring than looking at one face and listening to one person for hours and hours.  Moreover, because I saw you so much in this movie, I know what kind of person you are.  Your ego is so puffed up that you wanted yourself and nobody else to be acting in this film.  That is, you wanted all the other actors, even greats like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames, to be insignificant bit players.  I remember the old TV series 'Mission Impossible.'  Using the name 'Mission Impossible' as the title of this film is a total rip-off.  Your movie 'MI 2' is 'Mission Impossible' in name only.  Your movie has no relationship whatsoever to the TV series.  'MI 2' does not have the careful planning or the finesse of the TV series.  It is just one long self-indulgence to satisfy your own narcissism.  Many critics accuse your friend Sylvester Stallone of making narcissistic movies.  But compared to you, he is a paragon of modesty.  Tom, you are a peerless narcissist.  In the future, if you want to admire yourself, please do it in front of your own bathroom mirror.  Please do not make a movie for the sole purpose of indulging in self-admiration.  Your ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, once remarked that you love nobody but yourself.  Judging from the narcissism of 'MI 2,' you must be madly in love with yourself.",1,15,26,16 October 2001
Braveheart," A Good Movie Which Could Have Been Great
","Mel Gibson's movie 'Braveheart' is a nice crowd-pleaser.  The producer, director and screenwriters of this film had in their hands a perfect opportunity to make a GREAT timeless masterpiece.  The movie has a larger-than-life hero, heroic acts of numerous Scottish men, epic battles and an easy-to-hate foe.  (What more do you expect?) However, they ganged up on this great idea and reduced it merely to an above average movie.  I wonder what they were thinking.When making so-called `historical' epics, many Hollywood writers have a tendency to rewrite, warp,  sentimentalize, melodramatize and generally dumb up history.  In the process, the story lines often deviate from the real history so much that the movie is not historical anymore.  These screenwriters must think that an average moviegoer is too dumb to understand or appreciate the complexity and subtlety of history.  Randall Wallace, the screenwriter of this movie, did exactly that: grossly rewrote history, deprive the script of subtlety and generally dumbed up the script.
SLIGHT SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ IT, JUMP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. Many people have heavily criticized this movie for its gross historical inaccuracies.  I agree wholeheartedly.   Many aspects of William Wallace's life are shrouded in mystery. Until recently, most historians relied almost exclusively on the biographical poems about Wallace by the15th century Scottish minstrel Blind Harry as the primary source.  However, the movie's script grossly deviates even from what little modern historians know about William Wallace.  These are some examples:  1) Why was the Battle of Stirling Bridge portrayed without a bridge?  A small bridge played a crucial role in this English defeat.  2) Why was Wallace's atrocities committed in Northern England totally omitted from this movie?  Wallace and his men committed numerous acts of atrocities--including rape, pillage and massacre--after invading Northern England.  3) The movie omits the crucial role William Wallace's brothers played in William becoming one of the leaders of Scottish liberation movement.  4) The movie unfairly portrays Robert Bruce as a back stabber even though there is no extant historical evidence to indicate that Robert Bruce betrayed William Wallace.  There are many other examples of historical inaccuracies but are too numerous to be listed here.As many people have already commented, this movie lacks subtlety just like many other Hollywood movies.  Unlike the complexity of real life, most issues in this movie are conveniently all black and white.  For example, most characters are divided into all-bad villains and all-good heroes. Just like the Imperial forces in 'Star Wars,' the English are the totally evil villains while the Scots were bunch of fierce but virtuous freedom fighters. Edward Longshank, the English king, is portrayed as an evil and greedy tyrant similar to Darth Vader while Sir William Wallace is portrayed as a somewhat naive but virtuous freedom fighter similar to Luke Skywalker. The extant record shows that real history is not simple black and white like this.  Historically Edward Longshank was indeed a greedy and ambitious ruler, but he did show many instances of magnanimity and generosity.  As stated earlier, William Wallace was a flawed man. He was a fierce freedom fighter but committed numerous acts of atrocities.The scriptwriters must have thought that all moviegoers have to be reminded again and again ad nauseum that 'freedom is beautiful' and 'invasion and occupation of foreign nations are bad.'  I think we all got the message after the first or second time. But the movie seems to go on and on pounding into our heads the same message with the repeated portrayals of English brutality and victimization of the Scottish population.   If the screenwriters want to keep on stating the message after the first or second time, they should have done it more subtly from the third or fourth time.
There are some aspects of the movie which salvaged it from being a total failure.  Mel Gibson did an admirable job of playing William Wallace.  Even though he is about one foot too short to play William Wallace (Wallace was reputed to be almost seven feet tall ), Gibson tried and somewhat succeeded in recreating the charisma of this Scottish freedom fighter. It is too bad that Gibson created an indelible image in the mind of some of the moviegoers that he is a shoot-them-up, blow-them-away action star by playing Mad Max three times in the `Mad Max' series and Sgt. Martin Riggs four times in the 'Lethal Weapon' series.  However, he is a much, much more competent actor than action stars like Stallone, Schwarznegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.  In terms of acting talent he is closer to late Lord Lawrence Olivier than to these four amateurs who have the temerity to call themselves 'actor.'  Some people have commented that Mel Gibson focused too much attention on himself in this movie.  He did focus lots of attention on himself, but he is the star of this movie for crying out loud!  I think Mel Gibson focused attention on himself only to the extent of what is expected of the star of a movie.  However, the greatest acting accolade should go to Patrick McGoohan for his portrayal of the evil tyrant Edward Longshank.  He skillfully portrayed this evil but determined ruler.  This accomplished thespian's acting skill just awed me.  Only McGoohan's vast acting talent, which added depth to the character, salvaged Edward Longshank from being a one-dimensional 14th century version of Darth Vader.The novice director Mel Gibson did a very competent job of choreographing the battle scenes.  Unlike most of the 1950's and 1960's Hollywood epic movies, Gibson portrayed the battle scenes with realistic gore and brutality, the way battle scenes should be portrayed.
This is a good movie which greatly pleased the audience.  To be honest, I like this movie.  However, if the movie was made with a better characterization of various characters, subtlety of expression and better historical accuracies, it could have been a GREAT movie.",Null,3,6,3 November 2001
