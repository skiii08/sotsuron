The Benchwarmers," hella funny
","I expected this movie to be funny, but I didn't know it will be hilariously funny...oh, it was great!!! I would probably have been rolling on the floor laughing if I was not in the movie theatre...hehehe...Rob Schneider, Jon Heder, and David Spade are totally perfect for the role!!! I also have to mention that a testament to how much I enjoyed the movie is me liking Rob Schneider...hahaha...when I usually find him annoying. This movie made me like Jon Heder even more...man, he is awesomely cool. David Spade is also good in the movie, I think he was not too over the top, which I think he is most of the time. All in all, I just totally recommend this movie...it's a fantastic feel-good movie with a positive message!!! Nerds for Life!!!",8,7,16,6 April 2006
