The King's Speech," Boring movie!
","I thought it was completely different unsatisfactory in the treatment of their hands going in the first scene will put a marble treatment. It is a scene of marbles did not need after all. Ambiguous words is described in only a symptom but not born when I have talked to usually losing any stuttering. Is not enough variety to image. Unknown intent, but keen to get on the elevator scene also subtly laugh.I truly boring movie a good movie would be short!Can not feel empathy in that it relied on a lot of events happened or even that of big brother to become king or of conflict. Much to overcome in a certain sense we have to or mixed with a little training scene also show how to show it to be able to become a speech is not felt. I feel he has become somehow even to frigidity! Of disease here, but I will have another movie ... healing. Catharsis was the movie of the mystery is entirely enclosed within do not fit or to overcome a terrible and then go to the next scene the last minute rather than the depiction that was a terrible speech almost slipped.",3,3,16,1 May 2012
Bridesmaids," Best comedy film at this stage！！！
","Do not have to talk because there is no negative element in a perfect movie! Laughter from the first sex scene. The funny scenes to provoke the police car, great movie in the blockbuster movie is not experience. You throw sh○t at the boutique scene outside the imagination! In the scene of the airplane became so why start from their seats with excitement. Try impression was good also for some reason that's why! Although about three times a year, what does make the movie How do I complete this? ? ? Film is such a thing does not think there is a chance to watch it is to some extent along the royal road pattern is seen. Japanese film also has been proved that it can not do anything, even comedy. What was there I saw Well Shibuya. Guests were laughing to being average foreign country. Seen in the local hangover was not the way everyone laughed.",10,5,9,1 May 2012
