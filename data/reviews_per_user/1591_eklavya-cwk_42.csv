The Avengers," Amazing effects and fun fight but don't know why all this fuss
",Avengers is a movie that is must watch for everyone but still i don't get one thing.......why was all the plot so artificial.The fight sequence is beautiful and there are lot of awesome moments. I just wonder if such a technology was used properly. Until the end the whole system and everyone seems to be just acting to support some story which was terribly boring. none of the intelligent mind can grasp it positively. Everything was so much made up that it feels as if it was made just to maintain a length until the fight scenes can be filmed. Its terrible that the producer even invested in such a weak project. The effect with hulk are the main attraction. most of the characters in my opinion degraded their image as a superhero during UN-REQUIRED fight shots.For me this was a super enjoyable movie but i would love to see it using forward button. I declare it as a 'forward button' movie. its is watchable and interesting but it is like why why why all this that is you are doing...specially that man with one eye..limit of a grown up actor to do some insane artificial acting and bring disrespect.,6,2,5,4 May 2014
The Monuments Men," Historical event....flushed away by the film
",It was a historic event that george cloony set to present in this film but unfortunately this became a poor attempt.The dialogues or writing of interactions were so artificial and mundane that it felt as if there isn't much to watch. It was like all they just want to do is to tell you that this thing happened and then to avoid you getting bored they added unnecessary comedy which again was artificial. No doubt it has beautiful cinematography is a nice attempt but nothing was original.Art is essential and will be historic but one must always remember that its just an object. It will get washed up soon. More important if one enjoys art rather then getting attached to it. Movie was just shouting that they want to save the art but it again was not required.,5,0,0,22 May 2014
Ghost," something coming for everyone towards the film's end......take it
","A lot of drama and material has been put into it but there is nothing much sense-full in this movie except one thing that is revealed....thought not intentionally....but yes towards the end of the movie.The one thing that every religion talks about, that many ancient Indian Scriptures and books talk about and that has recently been taken again in one other movie ( famous though misleading to useless fantasy ) harry potter. So just if you wish to watch then GHOST movie can be seen but the real punch arrives towards the end. There is a line that tells us one of the biggest truth of this entire existence of matter and consciousness. Something that must be kept in mindIts amazing....., love inside, take it with you.",7,1,2,7 May 2014
Gravity," take a breath....with this film....let the breath out
","What is this universe......its not just some space time game but its a thing far more difficult to handle practically. This difficult at its basic form marks the pathway of Gravity. Few men game, this film will take u through the fantastic and stringent situations with a touch of spirituality. The river Ganga (ganges) , bhagawan Buddh , Jesus Christ in space-stations ask us about the presence of other reality.....beyond life and stuffs but not going flown into that it show the humans...lives, how they evolve , get guidance , suffer and succeed and all these things packed in a beautiful 3-d effects to make us feel that we stand on the Earth while our Earth stands nowhere. (so basically we are actually important but we are nothing actually)",10,3,6,4 March 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," This movie is a threat to my life....HELP!!!!!!!!!
","wHAT...wHAT....hOW CAN YOU JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A GREAT COMEDY?With this movie in my mind i NEED A DOCTOR...just saw holy grail and life of Brian.....and this is the worst thing i ever saw and did in my life, yES Sir.So now i am trying to talk, it is the time when we have started making fun of good in its best form and yeah why not, we think its just senseless and fool comedy movie and hence such jokes are cool.....I think hahaha the very presence haha of such type of movies is a threat to human beings. lET ME contROL mySELF. Hell i cant even talk now.This movie or movie or mevoi whatever you call it is amazing work of .... i am still laughing on how shamelessness attempt can be celebrated...or whatever you call it again. Such kind of films and the people loving them is a pure and serene indication that soon there will be a time when rapes, assaults and stuffs will be given a status of comedy ; today we have black and dark comedy....may be that will be categorized as 'HARD COMEDY'.So basically in our world of freedom , such movies cant be blamed and banned but (now folks this is alliteration, the figure of speech) when they receive high ratings and huge following i am sure that we are not on wrong path. The film is about losing your brain out of logic and dumping it buried. Think God movie like Ship of Theseus are there to elevate your intellect.",1,5,50,27 March 2014
Fight Club," Great movie yes! but its useless FOOL's GOLD
","Honestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema. Great film making style and plot. Direction and cast was good too.But here comes the boom.....this film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing.So while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating. The film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength, so far so good, but a dying patient can't be cured by hypnosis. It is a useless effort. Now our patient is dying, death is playing its game and his relatives around him....all those who loved the movie....thinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured. Now that's what i call FOOL's GOLD. Honestly again but i am not buying this stuff.",1,3,12,22 March 2014
Shakespeare in Love," Heart Opened Up ...... two hearts met each other
","Obviously this is a kind of movie that no one could love but at the same time academy can give it an Oscar. For sure there will be enormously few people out there who can love this movie and rest enormously huge population will find it stupid and awful. Any one who praise this movie will get a lot of opposition and disgust from rest of the huge majority.No doubt there is nothing in this movie, absolutely nothing, no Shakespeare, no action emotion, no entertainment, nothing. But this movie is one of the few that very small population can understand. They can understand that this is a useless movie except the one point, it is useless to watch and can't be recommended to anyone except for one point, that whenever one finds fulfillment, one finds what he desires, one finds out his second part, he can cross any limit and can work in a much better way. This second part is not his soul but his dreams, his physical requirement, and his natural lust, which can be anything usually like beauty, power, respect etc. This 'portrayal' or the depiction of situation when two finds their desire and what goes on with their emotions is extremely nice, sensual, beautiful, and lustfully shown. The lack of control, flowing away and oozing emotions, lust all are just great in this movie. Other then this portrayal of emotions, there is nothing else in this movie to watch. Some good actors have acted so foolishly and even some got Oscar nominations. I have no idea of this but the idea and concept laid in the movie is extra ordinary and special, it is not important but it is different.The biggest conclusion that this movie unintentionally points to is that the ultimate Freedom and ultimate Fulfilment provides Capability of any kind and immense Happiness. Each and everyone who is seeking for physical fulfillment is unconsciously trying to achieve that ultimate Fulfilment, just in wrong direction and at incorrect line and length.",9,0,0,5 July 2014
Rang De Basanti," what is righteousness in case of corruption of society?
","I am shocked to find that this movie has gathered so many negative reviews. This movie in my opinion is a clear demarcation of good and bad movies. Anyone who think it as a poor or average movie can certainly be discarded from giving his reviews. He just don't have proper life. Those outside the Indian subcontinental region if praise this film, we can be sure that they certainly have the best kind of life.This movie is a master piece, though may not be the greatest movie art, and is so nicely made that if you understand anything about corruption and sacrifice, if one has any feeling of love and life in his heart, i am sure Rang De Basanti will shiver and vibrate your every sense organ. Amazing cinematography, beautiful dialogues, relation development and music..yes the music is so great that it is just below the line of any best music that can be there from the only masters like Lata Mangeshkar and some few more. Films like this are not to be judged by fools or even by the great movie scholars, the geeks. This movie is the sentiment and suffering of a human in one or the other aspect of life. We suffer due to others often, due to corrupted systems, what goes on in our heart, how we tackle the problem or do we just try to escape from the situation. What efforts do we make to resolve the problem, how honestly we try for it or do we just keep blaming the system, while also pointing that in case our method is wrong, we are ready to accept it. We are the one who makes the system. Our one leg is lying in the future and other leg is lying in the past and thats why we are peeing on the present. Religion, politics, fun, friendship, project and emotions all are projected towards one single event, to rule out corruption or slavery and obtain complete freedom.I am really shocked that it didn't got any recognition. Pan' Labyrinth won bafta...really?? and no nomination in academy awards...these are the clear indication of the failing of these prestigious awards in recognizing the BEST. This is my longest review as i don't believe in just writing down a long epic but i am forced to review this movie in and out. The songs are just drilling, they will tear your heart and brain. This movie is one of the rare movies ever made that has the potential to charge us to change our self, to think for better, to think for others.Sure these are harsh words but listen up world, you are not fair. I have just one question to all the awards and criticisms ..... what do you think could have been better in this movie, and please justify yourself without fooling yourself.",10,1,4,6 April 2014
The Secret in Their Eyes," Intense, different , wish it was not so great
","The Secret in Their Eyes is a movie that won Oscar Award. I haven't yet seen other foreign language nominees of that year but i think they cant be much better than this one. It was different, intense in its human behavior and atmosphere.As it started i felt like not another typical movie-geecko movie that got Oscar but it was not so. Other than average carry-on story and normal acting, and it remained average for that during whole length with boring locations and cinematography but it features unusual ending and beautiful human behaviors displayed in various context. It has no strong point of 'look in the eyes' as its title suggest. Its just couldn't go that successfully with the hidden lie in the eye but other then that, it carves out few nice events like hidden liking and expressing it for each other, parting away, friendship, revenge and unusual revenge depicted powerfully by a single line 'tell him to talk to me'. This made it a special movie.",8,0,1,12 June 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Overrated but something extraordinary
","Pan's Labyrinth is must watch for everyone anyone. It is thrilling, amazing, beautiful and well-worked. It has got extraordinary art direction, cinematography and effects.The thing that lacks in this movie is the script. It feels as if somethings don't fit well like the rebel group and their action relation. May be it was the problem of shifting of vision and mind from fantasizing world back to the usual stuff or may be it was not worked well enough or even may be not filmed properly. It is not really a feel good movie and therefore its script can't be overlooked in its flaws. The acting portion feels to be tried to copy our General SS Han's Landa. But not to forget its a move to enjoy with family and get amazed by its beautiful fantasy- imaginative world.",6,2,7,12 June 2014
Chak de! India," chak de....my heart says yes go on!
","This film is a typical Bollywood style film. It is completely predictable, too over patriotic, extremely plain and a copy of 2004 movie Miracle. So overall, such a movie is a boring and dull Indian melodrama that is disappointing.Chak de India is a completely predictable, and let me ask if it is not a true event then why it would be even made, and isn't every true event is predictable after it has took place. The reason this film is predictable is that it is made so. It is over patriotic movie and too preachy. It is made to trigger more then 17.4% of world population that only exist in India, now patriotism is not a sin or boring and who says that preaching howsoever it is can't be done in movies and is reserved for preachers in churches, temples or God's jails. It is not just for one nation but for our own life. The zeal and luster of our life can be sharpened through patriotism. Now when this patriotism did worked on about 20% of world population...why not i accept this over patriotism. This is a simple and plain movie. Honestly i don't understand how this movie is plain and simple in front of Oscar nominated 'moneyball' which was so called very original direction. This movie is a copy of Miracle movie. Now the entire crew of Miracle must be congratulated for making a great movie that inspired many other movies which even went ahead of it. So no disgrace to Miracle but Chakde India is far more better to watch and assimilate. It is a typical Indian melodrama with nothing at all realistic. I would suggest to watch this movie as an animation where anything is possible and justified. One will be lucky to grasp the message that the movie preach and teach. This melodrama does its helping work on a huge amount of population, if you can't be helped in this way, you are free to find your own way. This film has its own way, you find yours and try to help others too.Now i will talk to human beings. A lot can be said about the movie but on its simplest and rough form, this movie is about unity and originality of intentions. Lot of people in the world thinks that they will do this and that, all noble works and hard works. But none of them have true intentions deep inside their brain and soul. Unity here indicates one world, one nation, one city, one family, oneself, now how often one is united with himself (yoga) and work together, the so called wish/desire of heart and brain, and many others. So Chakde India is not just a movie but its a water to the man in the desert to gain his all hopes and move on. A lot of preaching can be made but I find these two points significant about movie.",10,3,6,26 April 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," It changed my views about America
","Well yes sir...this is a movie worth noticing. A beautiful story and a immense drama. The story tell us about our society in metaphor.Everything was just great, it was a beautiful and significant screenplay. All characters and actors and director and set...just fitting at the right place. Jane Darwell was really seemingly person don't know why she didn't got Oscar or even nomination. Selfish and struggling people are there everywhere. So this movie is a comment on whats going on around due to negligence towards goodness.This movie changed my views about American people. Even though they seemed to be just all boasting rotten about themselves this film shows how to the ground, simple and loving Americans are. Its like nearly everyone every culture has got same problem but wherever there is innocence and simplicity, love and the lord will have its path. The knowledge found in Indian regions has got its glimpse in this film.It reminded me of all those beautiful Bollywood movies, and this marks that even Hollywood has its deep roots for society. The final dialogue says ' Fella ain't got a soul of his own, just..a little part of a big soul. The one big soul that belongs to everybody '.",10,1,2,23 March 2014
American Hustle," film feel okay with the life alike
","direction is amazing and screenplay is quite appreciable but not to the best limits.its a world of few people who are trying to do some amazing tasks in fraud and catching it and all these are executed nicely .... since its based on a true story there was not much scope to modify it beyond the limits but still ya it could have been a lot better. now i am no movie critic but to anyone who watch movie as an art will find that its not the perfect film but its a good entertainment.The film justify its name and put it to the state of hustle that the viewer feels 'interest development'.Being a black comedy its easy to induce a well Directed Acting but one particular character didn't seem to be 'directedly' acting but was in his natural tone and did a good job. to conclude, its an entertainment with good direction acting and screenplay",7,0,1,20 January 2014
Incendies," Fierce and vibrant.....enthralling and tearing.....soft and tender
","An absolute unexpected version of screenplay, incendies is one shocking movie which shows unthinkable and unexplored area of existence specially when someone is tangled and surrounded with hectic and killing religious, cultural, behavioral and moribund ideas encapsulating the freedom and when the bird flies out of his prison, he finds and remembers the past with love for hatred and pains.Acting was alright, location for shooting was great but the screenplay was totally new, and also it was encompassed with a bit weak links. Yet perfection is only a virtual reality, this movie is special for its final message. The love can't destroy the hatred but love will dissolve the hatred and therefore to love means to dissolve, past present and future.",8,0,4,14 October 2014
Nightcrawler," Its cruel, Its cold.....Its media !!!
","Nightcrawler is not a great movie but the damn performance of brutal coldness and the original screenplay is all the way up.Its a story of media, news reporters, news generators, money blinds, lonely and isolated lives aiming to develop at the cost of revenge with others, with people. Nothing much but a bit of exaggeration of truth. Started with a fine motion just like Drive movie, it moves on creating some situation and base at the same time luring over news channels. Next it just suddenly but cohesively turn to one incident and says a lot in that for which character development was done earlier.This movie is definitely must watch, everyone can see themselves in it. We at some time or other, for our benefit, without any hesitation exploit the situation, we are liars, without even caring for its consequences over self and over others.",8,1,2,6 February 2015
Warrior," A War Movie where each Warrior Won .........
","Directly to the point I was sure Warrior is going to be a typical war movie with usual audience rating it high. It was mostly unknown to me. Now I started watching it and yeah the usual stuff of typical dialogues and family problems. That was a bit boring but I thought it may get somewhere at least as good as the movie Drive.Soon the background music got deeper and enriching, covering up the whole yet unclear plot that kept me watching. Plot started to unfold and soon I found that yes there seems something that I should watch completely. Towards remaining 40 minutes I started to wonder over its amazing plot, webs of mutual relation and the warrior within each of them.I remember nearly every movie that has got nominated in Oscars but while watching I just couldn't remember this movie getting any nomination. I said to myself this man here, the father, Nick Nolte should have been at least nominated, may be academy had some annoyance with this movie. Then the whole movie got right on the track and started entertaining, clarifying, flying and emotionally satisfying. It showed each and every emotion in the way I can imagine and understand. The moment film ended, I checked about it on Google and found what I exactly hoped for, the father, Nick Nolte was nominated in the Oscar for best supporting actor category. It proved I was right in my observation, moreover one should not expect academy to give any more other Oscars to such kind of feel good melodrama.So the best points came out to be feel good movie where our all three competing warriors won. Nice and enjoyable emotional and plot layout, soothing background music, family drama and relations, and amazing acting performances. Each of the three characters were stone stiff distinguishable pillars of the movie with all the other characters with good dialogues provided greenery around them.",9,0,1,24 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Well and Enjoyable but a bit overrated.
","X-Men is a nice movie and one great sequel but i felt a lot of things lacking. Simple observation points were 1) Beautiful and new concept.......2) Highly inappropriate scientifically...... 3) Provides amazing thought on present, past, future and time...... 4) Dull and unorganized acting....... 5) Good effects though not extraordinary....... 6) Lot of characters were under-focused while some were quite properly presented.So in all its a movie to enjoy and appreciate but just not the great movie. But certainly when they have reached this stage of excellence, a bit more of efforts would have made it truly great.",8,0,1,2 June 2014
Spirited Away," Animation and its power.........beyond ordinary imaginaton
","Spirited away, what a weird movie, what a boring animation.....this is what dead body will call it because no one in his right mind can leave without appreciating something or the other of this movie. Extraordinary animation, brave and completely unique script, amazing characters and dialogues. Each and everything in this movie was perfect.I am surprised that such things are so common in the outside world. Spirited Away provides with a brilliant story in a non-physical world which becomes physical, but nothing of that is so good as compared to its killer animation. The transformation of figures, the expressions, ideas like one way train and what not. Its a fantasy world that will not just shiver and thrill your brain but whole back and spine will be quenched in mystery. Its better to watch this movie than to read about it. Very few movies have capacities of entertaining for whole length and this is one of it.",10,1,2,16 June 2014
The Princess Bride," Best senseless fun, sweet, enjoyable and should watch
","Right from the beginning the movie is captive. The kid and his grandfather both are cute and the firm base of the story. Each and everything is non-sense but it is a children-story and hence it must be the way it is.Characters were good and enjoyable, love story was cute as we wish and set design was apt. The best point in the movie is that it doesn't work too much to make it look realistic and the usual-ness present in the princess bride made it appreciable. The movie is must watch for anyone who wants some entertainment. But among all, the best thing the director did is to take out appropriate acting out of the kid who is listening to the story. It is sweet cute and fresh movie with few could have done better but ignoring them, its fun.",7,0,0,25 June 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Dazzling, Eventful and Amazing. Enjoy the 'nimaton travel the 'dventure.....
","I remember watching the first installment of the movie and it stuck with me. It can not cross the awesomeness of kung fu panda but kung fu panda can't cross the enthrallment of our dragon. This movie is extremely entertaining and enriching experience...the alliteration, yes. Something new and appealing after a long wait and dryness has arrived.This second installment carries on the saga of providing previous experiences with added fun and thrill on dragon ride. The animation is amazing, gaspingly beautiful as always added with a much richer story line. Just like potter, when there are more people involved for a single goal, it gives extraordinary shape to the story. Hiccup and Toothless took another step and entertained us brilliantly. Although there are some tiny tiny things which could have been better, one should not expect the artist will do everything for you, after all he is a human and has got his own brain and economy. I supply full 10/10 to this movie for being great and also for not spoiling the image of previous part as most of the other movies do.I wish to get a dragon to ride and fly the sky. Enjoy the movie with your family, get some time for it.",8,3,10,14 June 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," arey bhiya lawrence ...... cut it out !
","Lawrence of Arabia......an epic and a saga movie of a man in Arabia and those lot of things he does between Arabs and European powers. A huge cinema of a long duration as a memoir told in about 228 minutes (12 minutes less then 4 hours).Well well well, so far so good.....but let me 'inquire' whats all this fuss about. I mean why was this long and big movie created, won Oscar, and is rated very high? I found this film as a really monotonous, although not complete boring account, plain, colorless, eventfully eventless, dramatically hopeless, forlorn, woebegone, abject-ed journey, despairing account of events that were so so so artificial that such kind of artificiality may be considered as a new kind of film style by movie geeks (scholars).I will compare it with the title of the film I just found 'Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bridge of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2'.",4,8,20,20 April 2014
Frozen," the film trying to move ahead of.....
","Beautiful movie...sweet and musical songs...and love this is what make this a special movie. Congrats Academy to present it with Oscar.Now its the time to bring light to the point. The opportunities western films are giving to the thought beyond the rotten and more artificial stories and fantasies marks the recognition of new and more real things. It marks that the concept of love and reality that was recognized in the far ancient Indian subcontinental regions has now started getting recognized in the west. This is the film about love....the idea of the love that can control everything in its positive way. The traditional fairy tales that are great mustn't be carried everywhere. This is what the film marks through, no old fashioned but a more wide concept of love, a next step ahead. If you are ready to except the film in its style one will definitely feel difference.",10,4,13,11 March 2014
Room," Splash! A wake up call!......beyond the room....
","Room creates an impact as it starts with the mother and her son, within the confinement, that within a short time we are taken into their world. Not stressing much on the saddening prison-ed part, it quickly packs up and move into the reformation side of two soon up to happy ending.It remarkably acknowledges all the possible issues that should arise in various individual situation both are put into. One doesn't think of beyond because he has never experienced it, all the facts mentioned to him suddenly are fake and story for him. With time he realize the possibility of possibility.Satisfying performance of Brie and Jacob is worth noticing. The movie is courageous, powerful, questioning, emotional, agitating, disturbing and one of its kind",9,4,11,18 January 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Real beauty never asks for attention.....
","The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is an absolutely beautiful movie which is quite new and enjoyable.The problem with the movie is that the director, and write did't seemed to me worked much on story and its execution. Many moments became a bit boring and unlinked. Other then that, it was a nice time watching this movie and no doubt its a family movie.The best thing about the movie is its thought over thoughts. The title of the movie seems misleading but it can't be said to be inappropriate. I was expecting much more better thing but still it is an enjoyable movie.",6,0,0,28 May 2014
The Elephant Man," Shameless Exploitation or Courageous Attempt ?
","Who gains what and Gain gets to whom? The elephant man is a movie about a man back in 1800s lived on this earth as an example of 'different'. The movie is distinguishable and unique. It does feels like a brave attempt to make such a film, congrats to the director who is capable of having information over the elephant man, with amazingly balanced black and white photography, make-up and sets. No doubt it received 8 Oscar nominations.A heavily deformed figure man living a miserable life is taken care and shown the world of love. The doctor takes the elephant man from his selfish master, gains recognition and provides happy moments to his patient. A lot of human behaviors are crafted in the film. Good and bad, wise and evil, love and fear, compassion and hatred. At the same time it thinks about all the mentioned good things as to be for genuine or for selfish motives? In a way we find the whole movie struggling over an amalgam of intentions, good intention and evil intention. The very concept here now brings about the point, whether the director chose this topic and modified it for his purpose or was there some genuine reason for it.I can't say it was a 100% authentic, unbiased and unmodified depiction of the man. Even though it may be unethically exploited (i don't know), one can't ignore the question it rises about the society as to what it likes, prefers but needs to have.",8,0,1,18 June 2014
Pulp Fiction," What a great but useless attempt........
",Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one can't deny its grandeur.But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events.,5,8,16,27 March 2014
It's a Wonderful Life," swaying through the life alike
","the film is a significant contribution to the cinema, the art of depicting an idea which is a reality. Really life is wonderful and this is what we find out to be the motive of this drama. more like a cinema version of stage drama this film is a must watch......not (just) to appreciate it but also to remind our self in the bad time of life that how important everything and every life is, including our self in this space-time fabric . Its like a discussion to the basic ancient concepts we find from Indian subcontinental region and also from the recent book by Rhonda Byrne 'the secret'. it tells you that you are ... it tells me that i am the center of this universe and at the same time it also shows the importance of being good. even a single random act of kindness will trigger the sequential chain of good things to happen with others .....and if we think over it this chain finally ends on our self",10,1,5,20 January 2014
Whiplash," Beat the Drums!! Beat the Dumbs!! Beat the ... Four Five Six and BooM!!
","Whiplash, a movie with power and passion, arrogance and raid, drums and dragons. A beauty brought out by real, controlled, direct and enchanting acting by the both of them, J.K. Simmons, Miles Teller.To many of those who cares, the movie is misleading for its exaggerated scenes but if one can except them as a movie, fiction, he can not neglect the amount of environment he is put in. Its a flow of music, beats, dedication, romance, arrogance, hatred, negligence, shamelessness, cruelty, empowering, encompassing, surrendering and finally acceptance. The beats drag and rush, the story drag and rush, the behavior drag and rush, So is asked 'ARE YOU DRAGGING OR RUSHING'. The movie is non-technical but it binds you.The acting of a psycho and talented teacher added to that of a boastful dedicated talented aspirant to bring out the magical world which even if is unreal, seems cozy and cruel at the same time. Passion and path cross each other, teacher and student fight, flows blood, drum beats, music plays, Caravan-Whiplash, sound surrounds and the moment it was to end Boom!! ....He Cues Them .... and it ends.",9,0,2,10 February 2015
The Green Mile," a saga of evil around and paradox we find about goodness
","Green Mile is a film about the presence of dirt in our society........all things symbolic but tells about our responsibilities and warn our self about anything bad that we do. Now the cast and crew went to perfection, script adapted from Stephen King's writings , more then story the point that the film raises is gullible people who believe what they see, they believe what they have preconceptions about bad things and commit mistakes. There are four types of people here.....1)loving and nice (may look weird to our senses) 2)regular and respect goodness but don't go inside 3) arrogant, blind and foolish 4)bad cruel and detoured till they finish.

The Shawshank Redemption," Extremely over-rated but great movie!!
","So for a great movie i provide you with a simple and short review. This is a film worth a watch with amazing story-line, drama and performance. Morgan Freeman made it up as a cast.But i can not say that this is a best or even a better movie at all. It is a usually movie with a catchy, just and simple plot. This film is equipped with nice and beautiful plus emotional and interesting plot with amazing direction. So this is a movie that appeals nearly everyone, and that is why it is so over-rated but that should not mean it is a all time best movie. It is a simple and honest movie which is great but yes over-rated.",7,0,0,24 March 2014
Blade Runner," Vulgar, Stupid, Senseless, Reason-less.......just 5 minutes of specially effects
","R. Scott is a name quite familiar. Blade Runner is a movie made by him...yes. Now it is rated really high with a special attraction point to the experts as a movie with a lot of freedom to conclude what it mean and what are its secret things, also its a best dystopian sci-fi film made till date. Yes, I agree to everything but only for few micro-seconds, when by some quantum fluctuations and tunneling effect due to uncertainty principle I move out of my head and mind (to the hell).Lets see what has it got, the initial scenes were amazing and huge. They will make one feel that their is a grandeur that the movie is about to show them. And then everything happens ambiguously, means you can conclude whatever you can understand by the sequence taking place. A huge range of senseless events, unnecessary artificial emotion development, vulgarity and gross-ness at its majority are few speciality of Blade Runner. I couldn't understand anything because I am a dumb fool and the film is really great. I was feeling like sleeping and yawning during the last one and half hour, every second expecting something good is gonna arrive after all its rated 8.3 isn't it? so all intelligent minded good folks are recommended to watch this movie and rest try to avoid it and watch it just to complete your watch list.",6,7,21,20 May 2014
The Deer Hunter," Felt to be made with Oscar in mind
","The deer hunter was a beautiful movie in its true form but the problem that felt was that this film is a consequence of powerful seeming plot and nothing else.The plot is made to be felt natural and realistic but i wonder why does it felt so broken. Sudden switching of events, sudden casualties, unexplicit behaviour and useless behaviour. In my opinion, this was the great movie but the worst to win Oscar, although it was the only choice that year because there were no better films.The movie is certainly watchable but it lacks the real or powerfulness. A smart and catchy film i would call it made above average.",6,3,6,26 May 2014
The Truman Show," some docs out of the 'box'
","The Truman Show, this name is going to be historic forever, just because it is an attempt completely different, out of the box, unique. The moment you watch it, one is made to think 'can such ideas be really crafted in a motion picture?' The director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol must be specially praised for such a work.Now don't overlook Jim Carry, he is a master man as always with Ed Harris' intense performance. This movie may also remind one about the story of a frog in a well who thinks that the well is everything, the whole world. Not like that but being a comedy it shows what might happen with such a life entrapped yet unaware of anything. At the same time we see the desire of freedom and lusty minds who seeks entertainment. It questions as to what do we prefer, humanity or false entertainment at any cost for momentary escape from reality in our life.The film is certainly not preachy but makes one to think about various cobwebs that are and that may entrap us time to time. The thing that lacked in the movie are, as i felt, editing and cinematography. It was typical and simple. Some special things should have been done to provide complete impact to the viewer but i wonder if that would make the move more artificial. But still it could have been better in the part of sets and camera.",7,0,1,24 June 2014
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I am still out of my senses.....HELP!!!!
","wHAT...wHAT....dID YOU JUST SAID THIS IS A GREAT COMEDY?With this movie in my mind i am still not able to control myself...just saw holy grail and life of Brian.....and this is the worst thing i ever did in my life, and yeah, yES Sir.Lets start talking, i remember that punch of a girl called as witch was really funny and remarkable but for the rest.....I think hahaha the very presence haha of such type of movies is a threat to human beings. lET ME contROL mySELF. Hell i cant even talk now.This movie or movie or mevoi whatever you call it is amazing task of .... i am still laughing on how foolishness can be compared to non- senseness...or whatever you call it again. Such kind of films and the people loving them is a pure and serene indication that soon there will be a time when rapes, assaults and sex will be given a status of comedy ; today we have black and dark comedy....may be that will be categorized as 'HARD COMEDY'.So basically in our world of freedom , such movies cant be blamed or banned but when they receive high ratings and huge following i am sure that we are not on wrong path.",1,11,36,27 March 2014
Sin City," cool...this black and white crap is new but eeww
",what the problem with the people these days....sin city is a movie that is all new and different. But such movies are a clear cut wastage of time. they can not enhance any knowledge or idea for anyone.now such type of movies like sin city which can't help you develop are more like useless. 3/10 for its new style idea otherwise its just pitiful kind of movie. Feels like no country for old man concept in this world. how-so-ever good movies you make...craps will be there eternally.no country for thoughts......Sin City is a movie that can only glorify fools and dumbness. Watch it for a while but don't let it get in your brain.,8,1,3,4 May 2014
Her," learn here how to exploit and misuse concepts
","SO! Really this film is based on a great concept. As any other film this film has lots of flaws but thats not the reason this is a poor movie.WOW! First we think over what is good in it. The film uses a bit know concept but mostly its refreshing and considerable, so this is good about the movie. Amazing solo acting and voice performance by lead actors , and not to forget (just joking but) pretty catchy movie poster.BOOOO! Now comes the boom, all the wrong and ugliness of this movie. As i mentioned earlier, I found it as a misuse and exploitation of a nice 'could have been' story. Right from being a typical melodramatic romance story to the useless events occurring the whole time marks the lack of creativity of the makers. Everything you see (may entertain you if you call it entertainment) but wont give you a chance to explore the other possible dimensions that are significant. It feels...I said feels...... as if one who is jobless or unemployed or unoccupied in beauty of life somehow.. like 'I don't have any ambition or any wish to search for reality' can enjoy this film with a long praise but anyone with even a tiny amount of his life engaged in scientific thoughts will definitely discard the movie as good but useless attempt.HENCE! This movie will sure have just two polarities, one who loved it a lot and rest who hated it a lot. The point that I feel after watching this movie is that why we are giving importance to creepy romance and boring melodrama packed in the beautiful gift pack of interaction between natural and artificial intelligence.",2,3,6,20 March 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Well made but didn't enjoyed even 15 minutes...do you know why?
","because first of all it is all so much unofficially melodramatic that nothing interests me...added to shockingly abusive language made me disgust for it. When you use f* word in Goodfellas, it is justified but when.....Mr. Trainspotting maker used it to make his movie look realistic, I was sure its going to be one more typo from him. What interests the viewer is Mr. The Beach maker used or adapted a story which is feel good kind...so you can all enjoy your fantasies of getting success at the end, and nothing bad in that, at least it entertains.Then why did it got 'di Oscar'. the plain reason that the amazing movie 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' was not well connected with its end....according to the movie geeks. Rest other movies were pure Hollywood style porn and disgust which can't get Oscar what so ever. And i wonder where was 'The Dark Knight' in best pictures?? So, as Mr. buttons is out of the race, slumdog wins it. No doubt it is a nice enjoyable movie but only for western or westernized minds. The problem that i found with it was Mr. Danny Boyle tried to make it for world wide audience by mixing Hollywood style to bollywood, which unfortunately is not possible because of a huge cultural difference, lack of maturity in new ones, too filmy brains on one side and general requirements.The songs were good, new to the academy and audience, so i can't say it was any bad. In all this was a nicely directed, poorly adapted and dumbly acted, too average movie. One time watch at most.",6,2,3,7 July 2014
Back to the Future," Enjoyed yet Disappionted??
","It is extremely weird that i am disappointed by a movie that i enjoyed thoroughly. Back To The Future is a master piece concept which is also ful of fun but yet there was grossness and absence of 'extraordinary' in the script.I am sure the director never thought that this movie can be such a success and that is why he never paid much attention to make it overwhelmingly smart, appropriate and courageous. No doubt one can enjoy the trilogy and feel satisfied but i see a lot of doors left open untouched which if were cared, would have given the shape of metropolis to the grandeur. The movie is awesome but not beneficial or thought provocative. I rated it less for miss or less-using and then stabilizing the special concept which leaves no ground open in the viewers to allow something scientific and technically correct. Being a great person it becomes responsibility to take care of many aspects for others which i didn't find in this movie.The amazing points of the movie includes two characters, the guy and the scientist, the most fitting comic faces to let you understand that whatever you are going to watch is going to be enjoyable. Next is the memorable vehicle that can travel in time. Third is the amazing area and landscape used to avoid the time travel giving clumpsy look. That is something intelligent film making.",6,2,14,16 June 2014
High Fidelity," Laid script with cushioned dialogues over it........ready to lay and enjoy a love story.
","This movie is not greatest for me except that it has amazingly made and laid and portrayed and filmed story which was special. I was getting bored all the way cause such comedies are not my type but yet i could not move, i was stuck, not much to laugh but to appreciate the style, acting, dialogues and dialogue delivery. Its one of the movie that is standing right up in its genre with comedy, tragedy, melodrama a bit, and above all beautiful background music and few good soundtracks too.This one can never be hated, i wonder why was it not nominated for any Oscar or even acknowledged. But anyway it was a nice experience to watch this movie and smile all the time. My top 5 comedies...it can be at the fifth......my top 10 comedies...it must be tenth.",8,0,0,7 July 2014
V for Vendetta," root of evil is not man but idea
","This movie carries an extremely important, i guess one of the most important concepts for the present world. Except for its controversial use of two girls to bring out this concept, this movie is extraordinary. It must be noted that when some universal idea has to be conveyed or told, one must use some other similar universally excepted track.Some amazingly great ideas find their ways in this movie , including 'evil has no face', 'evil is just an idea in human', 'evil is not man but a thought tree'. Each and everything in the movie made it great, except it being struck to a fixed single idea freedom of homosexual. I wish they should have used something much proper. This shows the haste and a bit less thoughtfulness of the director.",5,3,5,12 June 2014
Furious 7," More Furious, more blasts.......memories of past ( hope Walker could last )
","Fast and Furious series has two sides that needs to be discussed, technicality and entertainment. While the former parts of the series were typical, fast and furious is growing to be a well developed and appreciated action sequence in forthcoming installments.Entertainment is the gripping part, its eventful, fast and holding, full of actions, stunts and drama. Just like its previous part, this part has put efforts in showing out new stunts, not to forget the loss suffered at Abu Dabi. It's about cars, speed, guns and bullets, bombs and missiles and a lot of bang-bang! A lot of effort is put on filming locations which were splendid. A realistic feeling is given where the sound of cars vanish when the camera is shooting from height and then we come back closer with vroom-vroom in its action, goes back again coming back to the cars. Although the things to be praised are limited, yet the movie serves you two hours of motion. Dialogues and attitude are same as previous ones, the official good bye to Paul Walker could have been better.Technically we know what this film is but even then the characters were not exposed that equally and properly-fitting which was much more better in the last movie. Rodriguez was undeveloped, Statham did good, Rock was under-used, in all there was absence of the connection of viewer with the characters in all.",8,1,3,2 April 2015
The Godfather," Well this is called a film.......but i hope
","The Godfather is a good script by Mario Puzo to be cast into a motion picture but its Francis Ford Coppola who really drilled the task. This movie marks a landmark in the history of films.Just to be short, i must say that such kind of cinematography, execution, acting, and atmosphere is unique in these series that is rare to be found anywhere else. A great story and amazingly huge drama sets off the viewer out of his movie making knowledge and put him into a different world of gangsters and revenge but still there is something that shines for comfort in their families.So well this is called a film.......but i hope such great films instead of showing what they showed, should show others love and life. I am saying this just because there is a huge amount of potential in such movies to do what they want to do.",10,0,1,27 March 2014
