Source Code," Surprisingly Effective and Emotional Film
","When I first saw trailers for Source Code, it didn't come off as anything noteworthy. It looked decent enough, and it's from Duncan Jones, the guy who gave us the fantastic Moon. But the concept seemed a little been-there, done-that. The thrills seemed like they could be light and even a bit dull. But, color me surprised to report that this is an unexpected film that does both the thrills and emotions right. Much like Moon, Jones manages to package this film with both a fascinating story and a very relatable and human protagonist.The plot is simple enough: Capt. Colter Stevens has just awoken on a train in someone else's body. He soon comes to learn that he must find out the identity of a terrorist bomber before a devastating attack is to take place. He only has 8 minutes to do so. With this plot, it could have been simple enough to create a thriller that chucks the humanity out the window. However, Jones does a great job of doing just the opposite. Jake Gyllenhaal very successfully injects a great deal of sympathy into his character and makes him relatable. Going beyond typical thriller trappings, the story does its job of digging deep down to find it's heart. In doing so, it balances the many thrilling moments with the more heartfelt ones, whether they be depressing or joyful ones. Even the going back and forth between train and pod is kept to a minimum, making it far more interesting.That isn't to say that there aren't faults. The film let's it's big secrets out too early, and this in a sense makes the consequences of our character seem less thrilling. At one point long before the end, you just kind of wait for the ending to come. The story about thwarting the bombing also seems to lose tension as it goes on, in part because of the lackluster villain at the center of it and how secondary it's handled. The ending certainly makes up for it by being very unexpected and focusing on the more important things. Nonetheless, a lot of tension is lost because of the lack of focus on the bombing aspects. Overall, Source Code is an unexpected thriller. These days, action thrillers all too commonly forget about the human qualities of their story. But, in Jones hands, he puts that heart right in. By the end of the film, you will have a smile on your face, reminded of just how enjoyable a film with an emotional punch can be.",8,1,4,1 April 2011
Skyfall," A very entertaining, somewhat poignant Bond film
","While I'm not an old school Bond fan like so many others who grew up with him, I have been a big fan of his recent Daniel Craig led efforts. Having grown up in the Brosnan era Bond, with his fairly cheesy rendition that contained all things Bond, but was more of the vanilla style Bond than anything else, Craig's rendition has been a welcome change. There has been a more emotional impact here, with Bond examined as a character and a human being, versus simply being the caricature of a super agent. A lot of people may take issue with this, as die hard fans may prefer a more fantasy oriented version of the character than one who is more realistic. But there is no doubt that Skyfall is a great film.In one sense this is even more a character study than any Bond film before it, though I won't suggest I have the knowledge of the series to say for sure. Here, we have a Bond that goes through some radical changes throughout the film. You could even call this a much more mature Die Another Day, with some of the same beats here as in that film. But this Bond film goes into territory that drives in a very different direction from even Casino Royale or Quantum. The relationship between Bond and M is heavily explored, and M herself is examined. Q is finally introduced in this one, and we get a wonderful turn from Ralph Fiennes, who adds to the fantastic cast. But what of the villain. You've most likely heard much about him, and yes, it's true, Silva is fantastic. He is wonderfully quirky and has all the elements of a great Bond villain, from his own secret lair to physical blemishes (thoughts of Bloefeld come to mind). But this is also a villain who is highly intelligent, with a bit of a psychotic streak and who is capable of matching Bond in his skills.But with all of this, this is still a Bond movie, and it may very well be the closest to an old Bond film than any of Craig's Bond films yet. Gadgets, even if small, become apart of the film, and there's even a small scene involving car gadgets. We also Bond who has gone a bit beyond his angry, gruff, and brutal personality into more of what we've come to expect of Bond. We see him getting more into the role of an experienced agent who acts cool and suave, maintaining a calm collection. And that famous wit that Bond is known for makes an obvious mark here. Yes, this is the bridge that will undoubtedly connect between what we've seen in these past three Bond films to the Bond that we have known and loved for 50 years. There's also plenty of action to be had, with the gorgeous cinematography lending itself greatly to almost every scene. The action here isn't as big as we've come to expect, with it happening in spurts and consisting mostly of chases, but it is none the less exciting and even with it's nearly two and a half hour running time, the film never feels slow. Die hard Bond aficionados may find this one too different from their tastes in Bond films to enjoy it, but for most of us who have enjoyed the new turn in the Bond universe, this is a fantastic movie. It goes beyond the typical Bond formula to give us something more. And it is every bit as enjoyable for it.",8,2,10,9 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Big, Stupid, Action Packed Zombie Movie
","Now, don't take my review title the wrong way. Big and stupid aren't necessarily bad things if you find that entertaining. I happen to find some big, stupid movies entertaining. This was one of em. Once again directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this film is the second best in the series right behind the first film (possibly even the best), if only because the action was so kick ass. The film once again picks up where we left off. Alice is still hunting down Umbrella, while Claire has gone off to find the source of the signal heard in Resident Evil: Extinction. However, not everything is as it seems, and it seems Umbrella still has a plan of action.At this point in the series, if you're expecting anything more than an action packed, dumb zombie film devoid of scares, you've either stopped watching the film or are fairly low in the intelligence department yourself. This film is full plot holes, questions, and coincidences. Overall, the film is pretty ho-hum. The story is straight forward and of little consequence, and the disappointing ending once again leaves the series open, doing away with the promise for the film series' finale. But, with all that said, I regret nothing. The action was highly entertaining, the acting was actually pretty good (as far as this series goes anyway), and the RE fan service will bring a smile to RE fans faces. The 3D is actually pretty good here, with some notably impressive effects, including a bunch of water effects. The shower room scene is simply fantastic in 3D. Anderson brings his Mortal Kombat A-game here with the action scenes being very well shot and a blast to watch. I won't lie and tell you that this film really goes any farther beyond that. For those that have seen ever RE movie in theaters, this is the film that we had hoped the sequel to the original would have been. Suffice to say, Anderson really is the only one who can handle it the way it should have been done after the first one. The music here is also fairly decent, with a nice soundtrack I will definitely have to track down. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it is pretty cool.Obviously, this film isn't a great one. It's the fourth film in a series that has degraded in quality over its course. Heck, it never really won anyone over to begin with. However, my expectations were pretty low to begin with. The prospect of Anderson returning, this being the final film in the series, and the impressive trailers all encouraged me to see this one final RE film. I can certainly say I wasn't disappointed, as I got just a little more than what I expected. I probably won't be seeing the film again (except maybe on TV), but, for what I saw, I can say that I don't regret seeing it in theater. And if you're going to watch the movie to begin with, you really do have to see it in 3D. It's surprisingly some of the best 3D I have seen yet (and no wonder, with them using Jim Cameron's 3D camera technology. No post conversion doo- doo here).",6,6,16,10 September 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," An Entertaining, If Unremarkable, Period Vampire Slayer
","Although I knew Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (from now shortened to Abe, Abraham or ALVH) was based on a novel, I've not read the novel. I have, however, heard good things. This is most likely not the novel the film was based on. A slick, action heavy vampire slayer movie that has more in common with Blade than Interview with a Vampire, like the novel, this re-imagines a history in which Abe Lincoln became a vengeance lusting, ax wielding vampire hunter, where vampires have a part in American History. The action is great, but sadly, everything else is mediocre. While the film presents some interesting ideas, the acting and plot are mostly ho-hum in favor of a rushed history lesson and speeding from one action piece to another.Timur is an odd choice for this film, but probably one of the most inspired. He has a way of creating slick action, and it's no different here. From his creative uses of slow motion to the interesting action set pieces, in particular the final one on a train and an inventive one through a stampede of horses, Timur flaunts his skills at creating over the top action and reveling in it. And for sure, the action is the best part. With demonstrations of martial skills with an ax and cinematography that thankfully gives us a great view of the action, you're in for a more creative action packed film than the usual vampire hunting affair.Sadly, beyond this, the majority of the film is mostly bogged down by historical details that are somewhat skimmed over and a plot that isn't all that interesting. Every character beyond Lincoln and his teacher, Henry, are mostly dull and cliché. Adam is the cliché, high class vampire villain with an air of superiority. Will is the token black guy, Abe's best friend since childhood and his eventual sidekick. Even the lovely Mary Winstead, who plays Mary Todd, is little more than eye candy (although, admittedly, she delivers one very solid, emotional scene that demonstrates her fantastic acting abilities). The script as well is as much to blame. There is a lot here that should be interesting, like the vampires involvement in the civil war. It's a fascinating idea, but it's rolled over in favor of watching Abe kick vampire butt.Now there have been a lot of complaints about this film having no humor, and quite frankly, I am glad it didn't. Yes, several things seem funny, but the fact that this is a straight forward film that takes it's vampire involvement serious is a good thing. Had this been as comical as it's title suggests, it would have been a lot worse than it is. But as it stands, it is a slightly more than mediocre film with some great action scenes. It's nothing to write home about, and I probably won't be renting it to watch it again, but it was a decent and entertaining way to kill a couple hours on a warm summer day.",6,11,23,22 June 2012
John Wick," Very Solid Action Film With A Great Turn By An Awesome Cast
","John Wick was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago. Coming out of nowhere, this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people, and for good reason. It boasted the promise of excellent action, with Keanu Reeves returning to form as the badass lead. And a badass he is. John Wick is the kind of action film we don't get these days, and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action film.First things first, John Wick isn't going to win any big awards. It doesn't really do anything new, even in terms of innovative action. None of the characters are fresh and the story isn't really that original. But none of that matters because it's so stylishly crafted, the acting, direction, and writing so smooth, and the world so well designed, that any action junkie can get behind this slick, heavily stylized, action packed romp. After a flashforward, the film details the current state of John Wick's life. His wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard. After her death, he receives one last gift from his wife, a puppy to help him keep from being alone. But it isn't long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife. With this taken from him, we find Wick falling back into his old life of assassination and violence. See, John Wick was once part of a world of criminals, assassins, and killers. And, according to the primary antagonist, he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey man.And it is here where the film picks up. Where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary, from the moment John Wick becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film, it's almost non-stop action. The biggest challenge the film had was setting up Keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film. But I can completely reassure you that Keanu is a complete badass here. While he still is not the fine, domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like Liam Neeson, he has the skills necessary to prove that you don't mess with John Wick. Whether it's playing up the role of a superman, capable of tackling a younger, equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury, or taking on a dozen men, all armed, in a matter of a few minutes, Keanu doesn't need to rage, pull out a booming voice, or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats. All he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease. If you don't believe Keanu is the feared killer he's trumped up to be at first, you will by the end of the film.What helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. As stuntmen, they clearly know their action. They eschew the typical, modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice, long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting. This offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills. Keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically, with his time spent in the Matrix and more recently Man of Tai Chi and Ronin 47. The directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up. It's authentic and completely badass. Supporting him are an array of actors, including Wilem Defoe as an old friend in the business, Adrienne Palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take John out, and Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen as father and son gangsters, the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against Wick. Nyquist is especially good, a villain that isn't completely evil, and even a bit likable, who we're immediately introduced to as someone who doesn't necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do. He's entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that, under different circumstances, might have actually been an ally to Wick. Action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years, with few theatrical releases and most being VOD. But John Wick is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action. For any action junkie, John Wick is an absolute must and I can only hope that this isn't the last time we'll see this Wick.",8,19,44,23 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Unexpected, But Fantastic
","I've been excited about this film since I first heard about it and loved what I had heard about the plot. So, now, Basterds is finally here and I love it. While it's not what I expected, I think that's a good thing. This is not the Kill Bill of WWII films that some might think it is. In fact, the Basterds aren't even in the movie for a good chunk of the time. However, there is so much juicy dialogue and tension in so many scenes, that you can't help but be fascinated by what's going on.I won't waste space by repeating the initial plot, but suffice to say, there is so much happening and so many characters that it constantly stays interesting. Everyone here, even Roth, are entertaining. I will say this is a Nazi revenge fantasy come true, as anyone who hates the Nazi's (and who doesn't) will most likely laugh at the inhumanity that is returned to them. Yes, it is also a funny movie, particularly Brad Pitt, who is wonderful, funny, and thoroughly entertaining as Aldo 'Apache' Reins (spelling?).But don't go in expecting a huge action adventure. The film has less action and more dialogue and drama. Some scenes drag on, but they are filled with suspense. And Tarantino is very successful in these scenes by bringing out the worst dread and SS officer could possibly bring out. There are even some big surprises in store, but I won't spoil that here. Suffice to say, anyone who ever wanted to see a Nazi get their head bashed in by a baseball bat should go see this film.",8,9,21,23 August 2009
Iron Man 2," A Worthy Follow Up To The First One
","When I finally saw Iron Man a time after it came out, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Initially, I was reserved as comic book films were kind of just coming into their own. But, with so many now producing high value entertainment, expectations going into Iron Man 2 were slightly elevated. While I don't hold this series as dear to heart as the Batman reboot films or Spider-Man, they are extremely entertaining and RDJ's Tony Stark is one of the best comic book heroes to grace the screen. Thankfully, IM2 proves to be both highly entertaining and a great next step from the first film.First, let me go through what didn't really work in the film. My biggest gripe, much like the first film, was there felt like kind of a lack of action. And when there was action, it didn't feel like there was enough. With the final battle scene aside, most of the action was short lived. They were some really well developed set pieces, but it felt like we were just being shown a sample. And it's too bad, because the Whiplash character is a pretty cool villain and War Machine makes a pretty awesome sidekick. Secondly, it felt like there was a little too much happening in the film. There has been some complaints about this pulling a Spiderman 3 and stuffing too much into it. And, it does suffer a bit. There's the Hammer storyline, the Vanko storyline, the SHIELD storyline, and this isn't even getting into all the personal stories involving Tony himself. It's just unfortunate, because so many of the stories don't get fully developed to their potential, a mistake that creates a bit of disconnect. With those being the biggest complaints, there is more good in the film than bad. The acting ranges from excellent to serviceable, but most of it is excellent. All the leads: RDJ, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, and Don Cheadle are fantastic. Don Cheadle actually does a better job here than Terrence Howard, as Cheadle seems to provide some challenge to Stark that really gave the relationship some umph. It should be noted that this film really demonstrates how RDJ is the perfect choice for Stark. He is endlessly entertaining and is at least 50% of why this movie is so great. He's consistently funny, shows great depth to a character that is egotistical and a little unbalanced, and proves once again why he has returned to having such a great career as an actor. The other actors are sufficient. Scarlette Johansen doesn't have a whole lot going on, showing up for a few small parts before a big action piece at the end, but she handles it naturally and shows she could even come into action pretty well. Gwyneth Paltrow provides a nice foil for RDJ as their dialog and scenes are just the right kind of bittersweet. Even director Favreau plays off some nice comic relief as personal aid Happy, who gets a bit more meat in this film. Speaking of Favreau, his directing here is once again spot on. He further turns Stark into someone of a complicated nature. He's self centered, sure, and he boasts and gloats in the spotlight, but he's also quite complicated. He's not exactly the hero type, but he is a hero, and that makes him one of the more intriguing Marvel heroes. The layers in the film aren't all bad either. There is a lot in the film about family, but it isn't completely shoved in your face. While it could have been easy to have Tony go into some very dark places and brood over his family, it is instead dealt with just enough to add that extra layer to Stark and touch on the element of the story. This is one of the few additional story elements that I truly enjoyed. The dialog here is also very well written, and it helps as it keeps the whole movie very entertaining. Because, as mentioned, there isn't a whole lot of action.What action there is, is fairly entertaining, if on the short side. Mickey Rourke here is way underused. He does a great job, and his character is very fascinating, but there isn't really enough of him. It felt like he could have come out like Dr. Octopus from Spider Man 2, a villain whom we could sympathize with and got to see plenty of. Sadly, there are so many antagonists here, that most of them interweave through each other and no one villain comes off as intriguing as they should be. The action falls into this line. Because of all the villains, the action plays light and interweaves in the story. We get short action scene in the beginning at Monaco, one in the middle between Iron Man and War Machine, and the climax. And while they all look fantastic, each scene feels like a preview or merely a taste. There isn't nearly enough of what we think we're going to get, and it is disappointing when the scene ends before we are ready for a conclusion. The problem here is my same gripe with the first film: the action never fulfills it's ambitious promise.But, don't let these facts keep you from the film. Much like Tropic Thunder, if there's any reason to see the film, it's for RDJ. Luckily, he's also the main character, so you see quite a bit of him. Also, it's quite lucky the film is actually well written (as was the first film). But beyond Downey Jr., this is quite an entertaining film and one that will truly kick off the summer film season.",8,1,3,8 May 2010
The Hunger Games," An Adaptation That Delivers
","There's hardly been a film I've seen in the past couple years that's been more anticipated than The Hunger Games. The beloved trilogy of novels has been in the works for the cinema for several years now and if you couldn't judge by the number of tickets in pre-sale, then just go online and search for the legions of fans eagerly awaiting this adaptation. With that said, this would have been an easy film to mess up. We've seen it with Twilight and Percy Jackson. Luckily, THG is more Harry Potter and less Twilight.For the uninitiated, The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic America renamed Panem, where The Capitol is home to the rich and powerful and lords over the 12 outer lying districts of Panem. Because of past transgressions, each of the districts is forced to give up a male and female between 12 and 18 to fight to the death in the titular Hunger Games.Where THG could have gone wrong, it mostly gets things right. The pacing is relentless, the characters are well acted, Katniss is a very strong heroine, and the film doesn't shy away from places it could. But let's delve into some of these. First, for fans, have no fear, this is the movie you'd hoped for. All of the truly important elements are translated well here, from the downplaying of the romantic angles to the action being brutal and justifying the source material. As a fan of the book myself, I am happy to say I was pleased. Of course, the soul of this is Jennifer Lawrence, who does Katniss justice. At times a strong, brave leader, and at others vulnerable, this is the kind of role model that should be painted in these films. In another review, she was compared to the main character of Twilight, and it's a just comparison. Katniss is a very well balanced human, done even better as embodied by Lawrence, who channels some of her academy-nominated role from Winter's Bone here. To call her inspired as the choice for Katniss is an understatement. Watching her, you'd think this was the role she was born to play.The rest of the cast fares well, though they seem to come and go in flashes. Josh Hutchinson is great as Peeta, standing his ground opposite Lawrence in a part that is almost equally as well played. The bigger stars here do their roles justice and are suitably entertaining, with Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch both stealing some of the show in their respective parts, which both add some humor to the film. Donald Sutherland also stands out, as he usually does, as the devious President Snow. He's a suitable villain and one that is actually expanded upon from the book, which is nice.The pacing is a bit of a double edged sword. The film does a good job of not lingering on anything. There's little melodrama here, and that makes for a good, fast paced, exciting film. At the same time, the film moves at such a pace, and provides us with so much info, there is rarely time to catch your breath. Even the early parts are so filled with information and detail, that you feel as though they don't quite reach the emotional peak you'd hope they would. We do get glimpses here and there, and it helps that Lawrence has such great range in here role that she gets the right emotions out. But it also feels as though characters are rushed through. Haymitch never quite comes across as the emotionally damaged character he should be, instead coming across as the necessary mentor/teacher figure. That isn't to say Harrelson plays him down, because he still does a great job. But the character just feels like it never quite goes to the places you might hope he would.However, the quibbles with the film are minor. It is, again, an exciting movie that translates well. The futuristic America designed by Suzanne Collins is fantastically realized and the games themselves are every bit as exciting as you'd hope. Fans won't be disappointed, and if you're not a fan, this movie should be a good way to turn you into one.",7,2,13,23 March 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A good Summer popcorn flick
","Prince of Persia has been one of the summer films I've been looking forward to since its first trailer impressed me. At the same time, I didn't expect much. After going through so many summer seasons with crappy blockbusters and over hyped garbage, I was kind of relieved to see a film that knew exactly what it was and didn't aim to be anything more. And it certainly turned out the way I expected: a fun popcorn flick that doesn't take itself too seriously. What truly shines here is the action, fairly obviously I think. The story is decent, though nothing to be impressed with, and most of it contains fairly serviceable production values. It helps that the acting is of fairly high caliber. Jake is fun to watch as the Prince. He plays up the action and one liners well and proves his value as a potential action adventure star if given the right material. Gemma is serviceable and looks great doing it. Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley are also great as supporting cast members, though their talents are definitely underplayed here, something that seems to be a continual pattern for Kingsley these days.Persia is also an interesting choice of environment. It lends some personality to the film. Although it's mostly historically inaccurate, a fantasized version of the real Persia, it's still an interesting environment for the adventure. Much like the Caribbeans added to Pirates adventure story, Persia adds that much more to this film. But, as I said, the action here is the real star and that's not too surprising. If you expect another Pirates, you'll be sorely mislead, but the film is definitely a lot of fun. The action is almost non stop and it's almost always big. The film recalls times when we didn't expect so much more from our films other than they be entertaining, and I enjoyed that aspect of Prince of Persia. It's a fun, old fashioned, swashbuckling adventure. For a popcorn flick, I couldn't ask for much more.",7,2,5,7 June 2010
Ted," Not The Perfect Comedy, But Pretty Damn Funny
","Ted has been on my list of comedies to watch since I started hearing about it. The idea is great and I do enjoy Seth MacFarlane's style of comedy. Sure enough, that is what Ted is. I've heard it be called a long episode of Family Guy, and while that isn't accurate, it does say a lot about the kind of humor Ted evokes. And I had a pretty good time with it.MacFarlane voices the titular character, best friend to Walberg's Jon. When Jon makes a wish as a kid for his teddy bear to come to life it does, becomes a sensation, and becomes Jon's best friend. If you were wondering how, exactly, the whole teddy bear come to life thing works in the real world sense, it does, and the history of Jon and Ted is told early in the film in a pretty damn funny narration. I will say that, while Ted may be a very interesting idea, and the whole notion of a raunchy teddy bear acting like a man-child is pretty funny in and of itself, Ted could easily have been replaced by a normal person, and the film would be as funny. It's Seth's writing and humor that shine here.MacFarlane has always done good voice work on Family Guy and American Dad, and it translates here pretty well. Ted is obviously the voice of Peter Griffin, and you can't shake that feeling, but Ted also comes into his own as a character. The idea of a raunchy, foul mouthed, man-child teddy bear faded on me pretty quick, which goes to show how well the film was done. Ted's interaction with people never feels weird or out of place. It comes naturally and everyone does a great job of interacting with him. Props to Mila Kunis and especially Mark Walberg, who once again proves that he can do great at comedy. This is a role uncommon for Mark, and where he was a funny guy in The Other Guys, he's even funnier here.MacFarlane proves fairly adept at taking to the camera for the first time and directing his actors. Nothing here is spectacular, I'd even say the film is fairly predictable, but the comedy is gold here. It doesn't hit with a continuous rhythm, but when it hits, it's laugh out loud funny. But, like I said, it's a lot of the usual MacFarlane humor, pulling out some odd pop-culture references here and there, making lingering jokes, and even some very odd, wtf moments. I did, a few times, raise my hands in a wtf gesture. Luckily, the film also has heart. Ted is a little bit too obvious as an object for Jon, who has trouble putting away childish things, but Ted and Jon's relationship shines as honest and natural. Even if Ted is a teddy bear, you still accept what he and Jon have.Ted certainly isn't a perfect comedy. A number of jokes fall flat if you don't get the pop references or are into some of the ongoing bits, like those involving Flash Gordon (although, I did find all the Flash Gordon stuff pretty amusing). The script also has a few issues being a bit cliché and staying too long on certain jokes. Much like Family Guy, some stuff here just isn't that funny or stays on too long. But, the majority of the film is funny. I certainly laughed out loud quite a bit. So, if you enjoy the MacFarlane brand of humor and find yourself at a loss for comedies this summer, Ted should entertain you quite a bit.",7,2,6,29 June 2012
Ready Player One," Great, nerdy fun in a great adventurous package
","I'm not going to lie, I may be a little biased here. I'm both a huge Spielberg fan and a huge fan of 80's retro, not to mention a massive nerd. So, this movie, as well as the book, were for me through and through. If you're not any of these things, you probably won't understand the love for this property, and if you're only one or two of these things, you probably won't like the property as much. But for me, this was the most fun with a film I've had this year and may have all year long.For those unfamiliar, Ready Player One is the geekiest of geek stories about a virtual world called the Oasis where the world spends much of it's time doing pretty much whatever they want. It's created has just died and he's left for the users of the Oasis an easter egg, hidden in the game, that when found will give them control over the Oasis as well as enough money to make them rich for life. After this egg is Wade Watts, aka Parzeval, and several of his friends, while the dastardly corporation IOI, led by evil corporate overlord Sorrento, try to get it to monetize the entire thing.The book this is based on was never an amazing classic in the way some speak about it. The story elements of it felt very fanfictiony and rote. Typical nerdy protagonist whose a regular, losery guy in real life is an amazeballs dude in the Oasis who becomes the hero, gets the girl, blah, blah, blah. The movie isn't too different.The cast is all fairly good in their roles, though most of them feel very plain and relatively dull as characters. Tye Sheridan, who is an excellent actor, makes for a decent, if unremarkably white bread, lead. Olivia Cooke is the badass vixen and love interest, also very typical, but also with great presence and chemistry with Tye. Stealing every scene they're in is Lena Waithe as Aech whose both funny and badass. Opposite them is Ben Mendelson as very typical corporate baddie Sorrento and the usually funny TJ Miller voicing digital mercenary I-R0k, who is in fact funny here. Mark Rylance shows up in flashbacks as, what amounts to, the most emotionally meaty role with Oasis creator Halliday. For arguments sake, you could say that he is the lead character and that the real journey is his, with the characters all being just the witnesses to his story.As you may be able to tell, there's a lot here that's fairly typical and cliche. That was true of the book too. But that's not really why people are here. It's not why people loved the book. And it is here that the movie actually excels in quality. Spielberg has crafted one of his best adventures in years and hasn't made something this fun in a long time. Though fans of the book may balk at the many, many changes made by Spielberg and novel-author-and-script-co-writer Ernest Cline, it's for the best as many of the events from the book wouldn't work as well on a visual level. And the movie looks absolutely amazing. The Oasis and it's avatars are a spectacle to behold and the action is fantastic. Other scenes, like one taking place in a very familiar and famous movie location, are fun, creative twists. While the real world scenes don't work quite as well, they still hold up with Spielberg's typically great attention to detail and world building.Some of these scenes, in particular an early race and the climactic battle, are worth the price alone. And the geeky references, not just to 80's pop culture, but geek pop culture in general, come like shots from a video game weapon. The audience I saw this with had a blast and would giggle with glee every time something familiar and awesomely nerdy would show up on screen. There are moments that nerds everywhere may not know they needed to see that show up and it's truly a sight to behold. Some people may not be able to appreciate a film as pure spectacle, and they are certainly entitled to that opinion, but for the rest of us, the man who invented the summer blockbuster returns with another winner yet again. This is a love letter to geek culture and wins based almost purely on being a fantastic ride.Ready Player One takes the blockbuster filmmaking bible to heart and delivers in spades on fun spectacle. I imagine Spielberg had a ton of fun with this and they could not have found a better director, someone who knows exactly what this film needed to succeed. It certainly won me over put my fears to rest as to whether it would be a good film or not. It won't be for everyone, but for anyone looking to just have a good time with the film, you can be rest assured too. This one's a winner.",8,2,9,26 March 2018
Shutter Island," Although Predictable, Nonetheless Just Shy Of Being A Masterpiece
","Whenever a Scorsese film comes along, it's something of an event. Always able to entertain while also creating thoughtful film, he has a way of crafting a film that few can mimic. Sure enough, Shutter Island is another of these films. Yes, it's psychological horror is predictable, but this doesn't deter from a great film about the horrors of dementia during a time period when crazy people were thought better left ignored than treated.This is certainly a different kind of film for Scorsese. While it has the same characterizations we're used to, characters who are products of their environments and must adapt, it also feel like Martin's take on psychological horror. And it works to great degree. There is plenty of suspense and the asylum itself is often times creepy, specifically Ward C. What shines most here is Leo DiCaprio's performance as the troubled Marshall Teddy Daniels. In a lesser actor, this role would have come across as too melodramatic and ridiculous. But here, we have a thoughtful character who comes off as believable. There is a scene at the end that even hits like a brick. While DiCaprio was once merely a teen idol actor showing glimpses of a great actor, this has cemented him as one of today's greatest actors. It might be hard to believe, but he certainly stands out as Teddy, something I can say about very few actors in recent films (Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds being the last one).Now, the film certainly has its issues. It feels like an old fashioned psychological horror, complete with hallucinations, literal closed doors we know we will eventually see opened, and obvious red herrings. The film doesn't feel very innovative and it even feels like it's taken a step backwards as far as film making goes. The ultimate truth, once it's revealed, also feels pretty obvious. Certainly, anyone who has seen these kinds of horror films will no doubt make a guess as to the truth and be correct. And, at first, it's a disappointment that the answers aren't less obvious. There are also some early issues with the music, as the overbearing score when they enter the compound, while foreshadowing the disturbing things to come, is so powerful it seems silly. However, the film is saved by the directing primarily, of which Scorsese once again shows why he is a master in Hollywood. The characters in the film are so well crafted and directed, that the message here becomes clear and even the films obvious twists shine in their displays of humanity. This is ultimately a film about the treatment of crazy people. Most would rather see them dead, a testament to the mindset of the time period, while a few would rather try to cure them. And this is what Scorsese does best. He explores the building blocks of our history, delving into areas of society we think we might know, but are ultimately shown anew. And Shutter Island is no different. This is a different take on a subject explored previously, but never like this. Shutter Island is a great film, yes, but it is because of its message, because of its take on its subject that makes it a worthwhile film.",8,2,7,19 February 2010
21 Jump Street," A Lot More Entertaining Than I Expected, Very Laugh Out Loud Funny
","I don't know if you'd say I was lucky enough, but I did get the chance to see this tonight in a special screening. It's the kind of movie I looked at while watching the trailers and asked 'Why?'. And seeing it at the screening for free is probably the only way I would go. But, to my surprise, the movie is pretty damn funny. Certainly it's a bit inexplicable in many areas. But if you forget a lot of the logic leaps, the situations are funny. The attempt to be different and poke fun at clichés is pretty obvious, but none the less there are many funny moments.As I said, there are issues with the logic of the film. Right off the bat we meet our two main characters, polar opposites in high school, Channing Tatum's character being the popular jock who makes fun of Jonah Hill's character, the dork. They're fairly clichéd as far as HS stereotypes go, but this actually feeds into the film later when we see those clichés destroyed by today's often indescribable cliques. Somehow, both of these guys end up as cops, something that initially seemed puzzling to me, since neither of them seem like they would want to be cops. But really, it's just an excuse to get on with the jokes, so it's easily overlooked. Soon, our fumbling duo is sent into high school as undercover cops to take down a new drug being passed around. Really, this story is nothing more than an excuse to make jokes about clichéd situations, but surprisingly the jokes are pretty funny. Clichés are definitely broken. The cool kids at school aren't jocks, but socially conscious teens who care about the environment. In fact, the entire social spectrum is flipped upside down.There are some fairly funny moments. Highlights include the visions induced by a high Jonah Hill and a highway chase in which nothing goes as expected. Sadly, the film isn't particularly memorable. It's funny enough, and the humor is well written, but the actors are what you'd expect them to be. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill here, and Channing Tatum, while surprisingly funny, is still Channing Tatum. My favorite is actually Ice Cube, who appears as the Lt. in charge of the Jump Street operation. He's funny as the angry chief, and they do in fact call this out, though it seems a bit forced. None the less, it's been a while since Ice Cube made an appearance, and he's pretty funny here. The rest of the cast is decent, though none really as memorable as Cube, or even Hill and Tatum for that matter.The writing is mostly to blame here. The story is weak, weak enough to bring a lot of the rest of the film down. The film requires a huge suspension of disbelief and you can't help but wonder if everyone in the film is an idiot for overlooking so many numerous coincidences. They sure do talk about how Tatum looks too old for high school, and yet not one person thinks that maybe he IS too old for high school? Other leaps in logic make you wonder how stupid the film can get, but again, it really isn't about the story, it's about the jokes. In fact, that's really the only reason that this is getting a 7. Even if I don't want to admit it, I did laugh quite a bit at this film. Tatum and Hill have great chemistry and the humor bounces between them very well. I AM fairly tired of Hill's comedy schtick, but combined with the poking fun of clichés and even at the film itself, it's a pretty consistently funny movie. Heck, there's even a cameo that almost makes it worthwhile, though I am sure you can probably guess what that is.With so many films coming out that really are nothing to write home about, 21 Jump Street isn't a bad way to kill time at the theater. It's certainly funnier than I expected. Not a great film, but a funny one and maybe worth your time.",7,11,24,1 March 2012
Warrior," The Rocky Of Our Generation
","Warrior is that rare, unexpected film that grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go. Sure, it's a tad cliché. It's beats are taken from most other fight movies about underdogs competing in a major fighting competition. However, it one ups the usual by presenting us with two men, brothers no less, who are both fighting for something worthy. This in turn creates one of the most memorable climactic fights of any sports fighting film ever. By far, this is the best film of it's kind since Rocky. Warrior is fairly typical of it's kind of film. Tommy is an ex-marine with both a heroic and shady past, as well as a bitterness for his family. These experiences have shaped him into a bitter and broken man who simply needs to fight. Brendan is a family man with financial woes and someone who also has troubles with his father, but wants to reconcile with his brother. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are fantastic in their respective roles and each is an equal contender to root for when it comes to their respective quests. Both have their fair share of issues with their pasts and their struggle to overcome their issues is channeled through their need to fight. When that time finally comes, the emotion behind the fights creates several powerful matches that are more than just entertaining fight scenes. It's through these two fine actors that we have such powerfully emotional fights. Nick Nolte is also noteworthy as the father, who receives both brother's scorn. It is hard to feel bad for the man after all you've learned about him, but one scene towards the end of the film leaves a feeling the gut that makes you pity him.All of the stuff before, however, leads up to one of the most emotionally satisfying fights in film history. Imagine the final struggle Rocky had to go through and multiply it by two. Now throw in some unpredictability and a ton of very personal emotion, and you have one incredible, climactic fight. I think it's no secret what fight this is, as the trailers have spoiled it, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't say. I will only leave you with the fact that it is incredible, brutal, and very well put together. This isn't simply a fight for a championship and a purse, it's a fight with decades of history, and one that both these characters very clearly needed to go through. Suffice to say, anyone with a love for Rocky will enjoy this one. It's also nice that both characters are likable and easy to root for, making it very unpredictable.My biggest worry was the technical aspect. Most fight films of this kind tend to have some questionable filming. Warrior, too, had some. The unfocused shot here, the close up there, but for the most part it's all good, and there are some brutal and powerful fight moments here. There are some technical things I might question, namely in editing decisions. We get the cliché training montage, this time with an attempt to creatively display it by playing both brother's training off each other. We have all the emotional beats coupled with heart-tugging music. It's PG-13, so it's not surprising that the film opted for some more cliché and obvious emotional moments, but it's still fairly predictable. My biggest pet peeve are the moments that seemed a little too easy. Tommy, while a very troubled young man, seems to have far too easy a time in the ring, and it's simply not believable. The fact that we're only really privy to a couple fights he has doesn't make it any easier to swallow, no matter how entertaining. Likewise, despite his UFC background, the fact that Brendan can so easily defeat a man that is touted as nearly invincible is far fetched. At the point in the film it happens, you already know he HAS to win, so the question is how, but the simple fact we know it has to happen is a tad over the top. Not to mention that the man is twice his size and probably younger than him in several years.However, these are all minor complaints. Is Warrior as typical sports film? By all standards yes. But it's one of the best made. It takes the typical formula and throws a gigantic monkey wrench into it. If you love these kinds of films, or even simply like them, you owe it to yourself to see Warrior, one of the best films of 2011.",Null,5,13,9 September 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not As Great As The First Two Films In Raimi's Series, But Still Good Fun
","I really want to give this a 6.5, but as we can only do straight numbers, I'll round up. I remember when I first saw Raimi's Spiderman. There were few films like it, a high flying, greatly produced comic book film that, even more than X-Men, created a legitimate tale about a teenager getting superpowers. It was like few films I had seen before and it really got the ball rolling on the superhero genre. Yes, there were films before it that did the superhero thing, but Spiderman was different. It had a certain feeling to it, a certain oomph those other films didn't have.Sadly, Amazing Spiderman doesn't have that. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a good film. Garfield delivers a great performance, as does the rest of the cast, and there are some nice additions here that even the original three films didn't have. But, that aforementioned oomph isn't there. Now, maybe we've just become so inundated with superhero films, maybe it's the shadowing of Avengers, or maybe it's because this film comes only a few years after the last Spiderman film, but there's something missing here. Where the first two films had a great spectacle and pizazz to them, Amazing Spiderman lacks that. Where there was a somewhat campy, somewhat cliché, somewhat fantasy-like performance to Maguire's performance, and the film overall for that matter, Amazing seems to play it fairly straight. Of course, they need to keep it fresh, so new factors are added, like the thankful choice of replacing Mary Jane with Parker's first real love, Gwen Stacy. There's also, obviously, some humor, because what is Spiderman without the humor. But the overall tone is so serious at times, that it becomes unintentionally funny.The film is also, I think, unintentionally bland. We don't actually see Spiderman for a good hour into the film, when Peter finally dons the trademark costume. I was continually looking at the time because the beginning just drags and drags, as if we've forgotten already from the first film who Peter Parker is and how he becomes Spiderman. I love Peter Parker's back story and his origin story is one of my favorites of any Marvel hero, but the Peter Parker here is just so normal that it's hard to find it all that interesting. Where Maguire's Parker was the animated, comic book geek, the kind I like to see in Peter Parker, here, he's just a loner who goes through a typical high school outcasts life.Now, I did give the film a 7, and so there are obviously good things about it. The Peter and Gwen story is good. Garfield and Stone are terrific, especially together, and Stone stands out as the near perfect superhero love interest, as she plays the part to her strengths being funny, sweet, vulnerable, as well as strong willed. In fact, pretty much the entire cast is good, including Rhys Ifans, who plays a similar villain to Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2. The action scenes are also quite entertaining. While they were good in the original series, the mix of special effects, camera movement, and focus are fantastic here. Though, I would still argue that Spiderman 2 has the best action of the entire series. This film, however, gives hope that the next installments in the series will prove to have even better action.Though Amazing Spiderman doesn't top the performance of the first two films, it is a lot of fun. It's not without flaws, but solid action and solid acting make it worthwhile.",7,1,4,4 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Fantastic, Exciting Adventure
","While I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.Before I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.That said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.While the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.While this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon.",8,295,533,10 December 2013
Bridesmaids," Absolutely Hilarious
","I'm going to tell you now that the advertising for this movie is weak. It comes off as some kind of chick flick, it's trailer gets a few chuckles out, but it really does not do the film justice. Bridesmaids will be the surprising film of the year and could very well even be the comedy of the year, topping films like The Hangover II and 30 Minutes Or Less. Yes, it's that funny. And I will tell you now, this is not the film you think it is.Bridesmaids is a fairly simple film that sees one unlucky lady being the maid of honor for her best friend while attempting to plan the wedding. All of this as her own life falls apart at her feet. Suffice to say, hilarity ensues. And it really does ensue. Surprisingly, despite what you might think, this is not a chick flick. It's got romcom elements to it, but it's like any other comedy, but with that rare all female cast. I can't remember the last time laughing this much during a movie. It helps that everything falls into place so well. Kristen Wiig is hilarious and this should be her star making film. She carries this with great talent and is at her most hilarious here, while still playing the emotional parts very well. There wasn't a single moment that brought me out of the film, and that is the sign of a film well done. Her surrounding cast does as great a job, with Melissa McCarthy being the standout as the token obnoxious groupie. Nearly all the scenes featuring her are laugh out loud funny.The writing also shines here as it's Apatowian comedy comes through. This is reminiscent of the early Apatow films, like 30 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The comedy lingers at some moments, and even shoots for being uncomfortable. The dress scene in particular is gross, but probably got the biggest laughs, as I could hear people in the theater barely containing themselves. But again, the film is a constant laugh riot. It certainly does have a very nice emotional backbone and that comes across well with a very relatable story that isn't so much about any kind of romance but rather someone who is losing their mind. You feel bad for Wiig's character, but not in a way that makes her sappy or over the top. Rather, it's a down to earth kind of falling apart that anyone could relate to. Much in the way that Knocked Up and Superbad worked for their relative stories, Bridesmaids is a rare comedy that has an all female cast, yet can appeal to anyone.I guess that's the biggest surprise here, that this is a film that can work for everyone. My audience was mostly female, but everyone was cracking up the entire time. So, don't let that fool you. Nor should you let the advertising fool you either. This is one hilarious film that you would be sorry to have missed.",9,44,83,13 May 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Here's a little story bout an ape named Ceasar
","Call me skeptical, but when I first heard about a prequel to the original Planet of the Apes, I kind of took it as a joke. It was another attempt to cash in on something long gone. Forget that Tim Burton did a terrible job attempting to revive the series. The simple fact of trying to create a prequel about apes taking over the world in our modern day was a bit hilarious. However, word of mouth had me deciding to check this one out. Glad I did, because this was one of the best surprises of a summer that has been full of them. But before that, forget that this relates to the earlier Planet series. While I haven't seen the original, this merely hints at those films. Instead, what we have is really a story about our main character, Ceasar, whose film this obviously is. This may very well be the biggest reason to check this film out. Andy Serkis is fantastic, essentially bringing the ape to life. However, credit must also be served to WETA, who have once again pushed what technology can do in terms of creating life. More than any actor in the film, Ceasar puts on displays of emotion like no other in the film. He is so well crafted that you instantly forget the fact that he isn't even a real ape. It's a new level of an actor being created. This is definitely his film and his story is a fantastic one.While the majority of the hard action comes at the end, there are plenty of wonderful scenes and shots that are loads of fun. Travelling with these apes is a blast and watching Ceasar grow and his interactions with the people around him creates a wonderful coming of age story that easily fits in with any other. Best of all is that nothing is too ridiculous. Sure, the idea of apes taking over the planet is ridiculous in and of itself, but nothing seems so far beyond reach that you can't suspend your disbelief for the film. I do have my gripes with this, but for this film in and of itself, it's a wonderful story about revolution, nature overtaking man, and above all the reasons for rising against oppression. And though Ceasar may eventually lead to mankind's downfall, you can't help but root for the guy after all that has transpired. This not to mention that the final scene is a fantastic bit of action that justifies everything before it, the big payoff as they say.That isn't to say I don't have my gripes. Unfortunately, in an effort to make Ceasar the star, the other actors are downplayed. They are either cliché or boring. Even Franco, who ends up playing second to Ceasar, is pretty boring. While I still dig the guy, this was not his big film, and he mostly just carries it along as the catalyst for what becomes Ceasars's show. The one bright bulb is John Lithgow, who plays the father part well and it is quite enjoyable seeing him in something this big. My other major gripe has to do with the overall premise. No matter how hard I try, and no matter how good the film may be, I still find it hard to believe that this lays the ground for a planetary takeover of apes. It's just not that believable and that is a problem as, coming out of the theater, I had to kind of shake my head. But, these are minor gripes compared to the what's good. Some fantastic cinematography and shots, a wonderful story, and Andy Serka's wonderful performance of Ceasar make this not only a wonderful summer surprise, but one of the best films of the summer.",Null,1,8,5 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Magnum Opus, A Tribute To Hollywood, About Hollywood Done As Only QT Could
","Quentin Tarantino has always demonstrated a strong love for the art of film making. It isn't just a love for the industry or the culture, but for the medium itself, the stories it tells, and the way in which it's done. His films are full of tiny Easter eggs, homages, and call backs to films of yesteryear that have, in a sense, defined his specific style. Some find this off putting, going so far as to criticize him for doing nothing but aping other auteurs. But, by and large, Tarantino is considered one of the defining indie filmmakers standing as a tentpole of cinematic artists. It seems, then, that he is past due for a film that truly defines him and what his work means, and it's hard to argue that this film isn't that. A loving tribute to, at least by appearances, Quentin's most beloved era of film making, this is maybe the quintessential Tarantino film, even if it doesn't exactly bear repeat viewings.More in line with something like Pulp Fiction, Once Upon A Time, taking place in 1969, follows actor Rick Dalton, as played by Leonardo DiCaprio, his stuntman and all around confidant Cliff Booth, as played by Brad Pitt, and to a somewhat lesser extent Sharon Tate, the famous real life actress killed by the Manson family in 1969 as played by Margot Robbie. Each actor brings their best here, with DiCaprio back to his somewhat emotionally vulnerable and slightly unhinged form, while Pitt plays off him as cool, with swagger to spare, aggression, and even some slight bursts of violence. Robbie, who is disconnected from the two for pretty much the entirety of the film, counters the two old timers seeing their time in Hollywood sunset as Sharon, a starlet who is still seeing Hollywood through rose colored lenses and smiles wide at herself on screen and basks in the glow of a budding career. Supporting all three is a wide cast of cameos and guest spots, many of which are Tarantino regulars, including Kurt Russell, Zoe Bell, and Michael Madsen, while a handful of new actors to Tarantinon's repertoire join in, like Timothy Olyphant, Al Pacino, and Dakota Fanning.When Tarantino says this is a love letter to Hollywood, it isn't simply that he wants to tell a story about Hollywood from this period. It's that he wants to recreate a Hollywood of yesterday. There are long swathes of time where we spend time travelling with our characters, taking in all of the old businesses that once lined the streets of Hollywood, or listening to the music of the era. This isn't just about Hollywood as a business, but as a culture, as a geographical point in Los Angeles. It's about the entirety of Hollywood and a point of time it existed in, as well as the transition to the next phase of Hollywood. Tarantino makes an interesting choice in choosing to focus, in part, on Sharon Tate, but when put up against Rick and Cliff, it makes sense. Rick and Cliff are the old timers coming to terms with their fading careers, with Rick especially having a difficult time dealing with the fact that he may very well be in the last throes of his spotlight. Conversely, Sharon, the young starlet begins her career at the entrance of a new time period. And while much has been made about the involvement of the Manson family in the film, in reality their inclusion feels more symbolic than a core part of the film. While the finale of the film is fairly crazy and maybe the most Tarantino-esque part of it, like reality in which the Manson family murders were considered a definitive end to 60's Hollywood and the beginning of New Hollywood, here they act as a thematic transition for our characters from one era of Hollywood to the next.While this is very much a Tarantino film, this is QT at his most thoughtful and contemplative. Perhaps he has put much of himself in the film, a film maker who has been making movies for nearly 30 years and is now planning to call it quits on big time movies. The film isn't littered with snappy dialogue, pop culture references, or even long bouts of dialogue exchange like we're used to. The pop culture exchanges typical of his movie seem to encompass the entire thing. We might normally see the Manson family become a one off gag. Here, it becomes an intrinsic part of the film. Make no mistake, the script is still excellent, as is the production itself, which gives us scenes from fake movies and TV shows that feel every bit like they belong in productions from the 50's and 60's. But it all feels like it's a much more natural and thoughtful part of the film than it is a gag thrown in for the sake of being in the film. These characters all feel real, like the kind of people Tarantino might look up to from a bygone era, rather than wanting to create for his own personal enjoyment. This isn't just Tarantino trying to entertain us, pay homage to scenes from movies, or have fun behind the camera. This is Tarantino trying to pay respect to the Hollywood he loves. As such, this feels like something more personal. Don't take that too seriously, though. This is still a very funny movie with plenty of fun inside.If QT were to truly say goodbye to film making today, this would feel like an appropriate farewell. He pours a lot of love in what we see on screen, and more so than maybe any film, this feels especially personal to him. It's a tribute to everything Hollywood during a time when Hollywood was to change radically. If Reservoir Dogs marks Tarantino's dramatic entrance into Hollywood as one of its best indie directors, Once Upon A Time may stand as the kind of exit that only Tarantino could make.",Null,3,7,27 July 2019
Drive," A Surprising, Subtle Indie Action FIlm
","It's often said that, in films, what is seen is more important than what is heard. No film this year has displayed this best than Drive, a film that is all about actions speaking louder than words. In this way, much of the film is out of the ordinary. We get a lot of scenery and quiet moments where characters show all their emotions through facial expression and body language. We also get what may very well be one of Ryan Goslings best performances as the anti-hero of the film. Here, he plays the unnamed Driver who is a Hollywood stuntman and mechanic by day, and getaway driver by night. However, our mostly quiet driver is also a man who is very honorable and with a good heart. So, when he sees his neighbor and her daughter are in trouble, he comes to their aid, only to find his charity backfiring and putting him in the path of danger. This film is definitely Gosling's film, and he plays it fantastically. The Driver is far from the usual anti-hero. While we don't really learn much about his past, we do learn quite a bit about him simply from the way he carries himself and how he treats those around him. He's kind, but also has a side that is violent and criminal. We can easily pick up on security issues he may possess, as well as a level of loneliness, but there is also a dangerous and fearless side which you wouldn't want to bring out. It's one of the most subtle performances I have seen in a long, long time and the Driver is one of the most well developed characters to come along without having to go into any back story or flashbacks. Beyond the character himself, and the rest of the cast which is fantastically fleshed out and as well developed, we have the city of LA, which becomes almost a character itself. The film has a very real portrayal of LA, with the car chases and action coming off as slightly more realistic than the typical action film. There's no ridiculous amounts of destruction, with all the action exploding onto the screen in moments that occur here and there, mostly in the second and third act. The city isn't shown in the typically grungy OR idealistic way: perpetually hopeless or completely endearing. This LA is more reminiscent of Michael Mann's Collateral, which painted it in a similar way. There seems to even be a relationship between the characters and the city that gives it an almost romantic appeal, the kind of love it/hate it relationship that only someone who has grown with the city could really experience. Drive is one of those brave films that is out of the ordinary. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a film that most people don't care much for. It's slow for the first half of the film and it's very quiet. Most of the action early on is subtle. Even when there is action, it comes in graphic spurts and a lot of the film is portrayed in an unconventional way. But for those who have longed for something different but powerful in it's filmmaking, this is the kind of film you've waited for. I dare say, it is one of the years best.",Null,2,8,16 September 2011
2012," All The Stops Have Been Pulled Out For The End Of The World
","Roland Emmerich, has, over the years, established himself as a king of disaster films. No matter what you think of his movies, there is no doubt that this man has put quite a bit of thought to what it would be like if the world came to an end...in several different ways. But if you thought his previous films, like Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow displayed a world falling apart, you haven't seen anything until you've seen 2012.Let's get this out of the way first: this film is exactly what you would expect it to be. Yes, there is a story, and it does have a few heart warming moments, but these moments and the story serve as fodder mostly for the massive action packed disaster scenes that plague the world. That's not to say it's bad. John Cusack is enjoyable, as are most of the cast. They don't serve up stellar performances, but they are certainly serviceable, and that goes a long way in film that puts most of the attention on L.A. falling apart, literally, and Yellowstone becoming a massive volcano.With that being said, this is the kind of film you expect in the summer. The special effects are massive, and this is a popcorn flick through and through. If you enjoyed Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow, you will certainly enjoy this film. Others looking to kill some time with a somewhat brainless film about destruction will enjoy the plethora of destructive scenes here. And Emmerich pulls out no stops here. Only a few are safe here as we either witness the destruction of many well known areas of the world, or get to see their after effects. Either way, everything here as far as disaster films go are upped. And nearly every disaster plays some part, from fires to tsunamis to earthquakes. The film boasts gorgeous cinematography as well, with some shots that are, dare I say, breathtaking.With that being said, don't expect anything more than pure entertainment here. It's certainly worth seeing in the theaters for it's scale and enormity, but the film does run a little long. Not that it takes too much of a pause to let you check your watch, but by the end of the film, you'll no doubt have. If you're expecting anything deeper than the entertainment the film provides, you'll be disappointed. But take it lightly, and enjoy it for what it is, and you will find a worthwhile time at the theater.",7,1,5,14 November 2009
The Lion King," A Fantastic Looking Retread Of The Original, Without The Magic That Made It So Wonderful
","I was just getting into my teen years when the original Lion King came out, but it was still something special for me. And I wasn't alone. It was a critical smash, one of the highest grossing animated films of all time, award winning, and considered one of the best animated films ever. In some circles, it is even considered Disney's greatest animated film ever. For me personally, it remains the pinnacle of Disney's animated vault. With the recent spate of Disney live action remakes of their Disney classics (the second one this year alone after Aladdin), it seems like this remake was inevitable. And while it may rekindle some nostalgia for others, while capturing the attention of kids who didn't get to see the original during it's prime, the film largely left me feeling the same way Aladdin did, wondering why this was necessary at all. It still has some quality points, this is Disney after all, but it feels so derivative of the original, I have to wonder what the point of a remake at all was.The story here is the same, almost scene for scene, so anyone who has seen the original will know what to expect going in. I will say, this may be one of Disney's best ever looking films. It begs the question of why you might call this live action at all, considering the film is almost 100% digital effects. And they are pretty spectacular. Disney has set a new standard for what can be done with photo realistic effects. It does create some immersion issues, which I will get to later, but as far as the films look, it's pretty spectacular when you consider how real it looks. Disney will almost assuredly go home with all the visual effects awards for this movie. The film also sounds great. The voice acting is top notch, the singing is excellent (minus some Seth Rogen singing....not a big fan), and the music is great (once again, minus some changes that left a bit to be desired, particularly the iconic Can You Feel The Love song). I think Disney will probably also find itself in some sound categories for this film. I also enjoyed much of the cinematography, which does an excellent job of pushing us through the African wilderness, sending us on exciting chases and adventures, from the ground up. It makes for a wild ride at times.Sadly, for all the great technical achievements, the film left me with the same feelings I had when I left Aladdin, or pretty much any other live action remake. There's no way to distance myself from the original, so it's impossible to see this film with fresh eyes. Part of the issue for me was what the realistic animal effects done here loses from the original. The film is so driven to give us realistic looking and acting animals, that a lot of the magic of the original is gone. We don't get the expressive characters we got from the original, who told their story and sold their emotion as much on how they looked as how they sounded and acted. I will admit Disney did an excellent job not making the animals look weird when talking or singing, but the grounded nature of the film does away with the imaginative singing numbers that drove the original. By comparison, these scenes feel ordinary and kind of dull. Especially disappointing is the centerpiece song, Can You Feel The Love, which feels short and rushed. The original film set this up so well, but here, it feels like Disney kind of forced it into the film. What this film largely shows me is that these movies were animated originally for a reason. Not simply because of the technological constraints, but because the imagination of the script, story, and characters demands the kinds of things that can only be shown through the medium of animation.While I applaud Disney's technical efforts, the film does little but reinforce what made the original such a timeless classic. While children of a new generation might find this film wonderful, it's hard to believe that same feeling of exhilaration is there. While the original animated Disney films because classics for their ability to bring our favorite stories to life, or bring us new ones for the ages, films like this, that are very nearly identical to their originals feel like the same old car with a new coat of paint. It makes one wonder if Disney is still interested in creating new classics, or if they are intent on remaking every original film into a pale imitation.",5,1,2,22 July 2019
Kick-Ass," Fantastic Fun, The True Beginning of the Summer Season
","Kick Ass is a film that has been hyped almost insurmountably. With fan praise, critical hype, and trailers that showed all kinds of fun, one wouldn't be mistaken to think this film might be over-hyped. But after seeing the film, one WOULD be mistaken to think this is anything but a great achievement for comic book films and summer blockbusters.By now, you should know the basic premise of Kick Ass: an average teenager decides to don a costume and become a superhero. There are no superpowers, no advanced martial arts training, and Kick Ass is no one man army. He's just a kid tired of no one doing anything about the bastards of the world. Helping him are Big Daddy and Hit Girl, two heroes who are highly trained and highly armed, and yes they kick a great deal of ass. Red Mist joins in on the fun halfway through. Together they aim to take down the big baddie of the film, the crime boss running most of NY.The film itself takes a standard formula for comic book films. There is the progression of becoming the hero: the training, the failures, the costume creation. The villain is introduced. There are a number of fights in between and a final battle that has probably the best action in the whole movie. However, what separates the film from others is both it's brutality and wit. This isn't as much of a fantasy film as say Spider-Man or Batman, where these guys parade around some fantasy version of their city and use it as a playground to take out fantastical villains. It's all grounded in reality. Several scenes are brutal, and even a bit gory, reminding you that this is all very much real. It doesn't feel all that exaggerated either. Although the conclusion is laughably over the top, most of the film is brutal enough that you feel what these characters are going through. Kick Ass' very first endeavor is a good example of this, when everything goes wrong and it lands him in the hospital for quite a long time. It's a reminder that this experience won't be like the others.It helps that the production is fantastic. All the actors do an excellent job in their respective parts. Aaron Johnson is perfect for the part as the seemingly nervous and nerdy Lizewski. There will no doubt be many comparisons to Peter Parker, as they share many similar qualities, but this one stands out because of his normalcy. As he explains in the film, he's no one special, and this makes him especially relatable. He's the normal guy who's simply fed up with being and seeing people get kicked around. The highlights of the film, however, are Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and Hit Girl, respectively. They steal the show, not just as their superhero alter ego's, but as a daughter and father. Their relationship is both a big part of the films humor and quite touching. As disturbed as one might be seeing how they are together, it's a sweet relationship that truly stands out. Mark Strong stands out as the mob boss villain. He could have played it over the top, but here he seems very fitting as he portrays an ugly villain that is quite suitable. My one issue is Christopher Plasse, who may be a bit oddly cast as Red Mist. While he does channel a little bit of his McLovin into the role, which seems to work, he seems a bit out of place, especially as the villains son.The rest of the production is admirable. The directing is quite well done and allows the fight scenes to actually be visible, thankfully, which is coupled with the editing, which is also excellent, the warehouse scene being a key highlight. The script is also highly enjoyable, with quite a bit of wit and humor with all the violence and drama. Kick Ass is an incredibly enjoyable film that sparks the new season of film. It stands as the first blockbuster and a testament to comic book films and what they can be. But above all, this is a fun film that brings memorable characters to the screen and should leave you smiling when it's all said and done.",9,4,14,21 April 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Very Underwhelming
","I felt the same about the first film and had higher expectations of the sequel. With the villains involved, I had higher hopes for a better, more action packed sequel. And there were things I appreciated. But for the most part, this sequel suffered from some disappointing sequelitis, the same kinds of things we've seen in numerous other comic book flick sequels. Suffice to say, while I wasn't too disappointed, with lowered expectations, it is sad to see this film fall short. But let's talk about what's good first.The best part of the film was easily the scenes between Garfield and Stone. Both actors are excellent in their roles and have fantastic chemistry together. When they share their scenes, their relationship is believable and it's something you can completely get behind. It's the one area of the film that Webb improves over the Raimi trilogy. There's also some decent action. The action involving Electro especially is great, with a fantastic display of special effects and an exciting sense of motion. However, unfortunately, this is where a lot of the good stuff ends. Much of the rest of the film ranges from mediocre to bad. Pretty much anything involving Harry Osborne is cringe worthy, particularly when he starts losing his sanity. While the action involving Electro is excellent, everything about the character seems to lack depth and interest. His plight isn't the least bit interesting, and his motivations feel flimsy. While he may be sympathetic in a sense, it's a cheap kind of sympathy. He feels like a villain who is there merely to be a villain for Spider-man, with little in the way of actually being a meaningful character. Paul Giamatti makes two very brief appearances, and his character feels like little more than a nod to a future film that will probably, hopefully be much better. The story itself isn't terribly interesting either. It's the same kind of inner conflict stuff we've seen in most other comic book films, but in particular, we've already crossed this territory. While Stone makes for a much better love interest as Gwen Stacy, it's still the same tried and true story of Peter Parker having to juggle his real life and his love for Gwen and his role as Spider-man and the danger that brings. I will give the film props for a twist at the end of the film that I think is a somewhat brave and unique thing to do in a comic book film, but it's one plot point in many other retreads that we've already seen. And the stuff involving Peter's parents still isn't all that interesting. It's a nice attempt to add changes to Peter's origin, but they're just not that interesting, which is too bad considering how much of Peter's inner struggle comes from that.This outing of Spider-man feels much like the first: uninteresting villains, needless changes to the origin story, action that, while decent, fails to be really memorable. The biggest problem here is that it feels like the middle part of a bigger story. We've seen this with films like Iron Man 2, but there is no backing here with a larger cinematic universe. Instead, we just have to hope and wait for a better Spider-man movie to come.",5,12,23,2 May 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A very solid and suspenseful mystery
","2010 has been a year full of misses at the cinema. I haven't seen too many films I would call memorable, and even fewer I would say have made my list of top films of the year. But allow me to add one to that list. Though it isn't a perfect film, this Swedish cinematic treat is great in its old fashioned ways and creates one of the coolest and most memorable characters of the year.The film is a murder mystery that starts in two different lives. We meet Mikel Blomkvist, a reporter who has just lost a court battle against a major company in an attempt to expose its corrupt CEO. We also meet Lisbeth, a punk-looking hacker who works as a researcher for a security firm and appears to be in some kind of legal trouble. After the initial court battle, Mikel is invited to an island by a powerful and wealthy retiree to help put to rest a 40-year old murder mystery. Along the way, Lisbeth and Mikel's lives become intertwined and together they attempt to finally solve the mystery.The film plays mostly as an old fashioned murder mystery, with Mikel sifting through clues and Lisbeth using her computer skills to scour for information. Both main characters are played very well, with Mikel being the very intrepid and determined reporter. He's quiet and somewhat reserved, but has a good head about his shoulders and is quite smart. While he is good, he is a bit ordinary and doesn't particularly stand out. This works in that he is relatable, but this also causes him to be overshadowed by the best character in the film, Lisbeth.From the first time we meet her, we are introduced to a character who is unusual but also very cool. She is unlike anyone else in the film and has a very good depth of emotion. Her appearance not with standing, this is a woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. Cross her, and you will find yourself in a world of hurt. This is evidenced twice early on, first when she is attacked at a subway by a group of young men and second when she seeks revenge on a superior (probably one of the more painful scenes in the movie). She certainly gets the most painful and powerful scenes of the film and shows many layers that make her one of the most interesting characters I have seen all year.The mystery itself is quite good. It's very involving and thankfully, very old fashioned. There isn't a whole lot of action here, but the movie presents enough of a mix of character development and suspense that you're never really bored with anything happening. Just when it seems like the film might slow down, it gets back apace with more of the mystery. There's also no wasted camera work here. You might half expect to find lingering shots or useless cinematography, but there's none of that here. I guess the least that can be said is that the film is wholly entertaining. The characters are never boring and the story is quite good with some very pleasant twists. It's not perfect. In particular, one sex scene seems a little out of place and Mikel and Lisbeth's relationship seemed a little forced, but these are minor complaints. I got over them quickly. This is a very entertaining film that I am proud to call one of my favorites for 2010.",8,3,6,7 July 2010
Brave," Another Great Pixar Film
","Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.Brave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.Pixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.While this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.Brave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.",8,97,176,22 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," An entertaining fare for the weekend
","When I first saw the previews for Clash, I wasn't terribly thrilled. I never saw the original, and don't have much interest in seeing it. Neither have I been too big into Greek mythology. While I always found it kind of fun and exciting, it's nothing I rush out to see. So, Clash seemed like the kind of film I would see if nothing better to do. Suffice to say, the trailers didn't exhibit a whole lot of excitement. But, fueled by a recent play of God of War III and some 300-style excitement thanks to Sparticus: Blood and Sand, my interest was more so peaked. And sure enough, Clash delivers about what you'd expect: a fairly entertaining affair that probably won't be remember far beyond the theater.The film doesn't waste much time with mythology lessons. It explains, very briefly, that the children of the Titans, the Greek gods headed by Zeus, used a powerful creature, The Kraken, to kill their parents. But much of the film is a tale about half man, half god Perseus who sets off to defeat the mighty beast, whom Hades is trying to use to bring down Zeus and steal his thrown. And, pretty much the entire film is driven by it's action scenes, with some fairly epic battles, most notably against giant scorpions and Medusa (the Medusa battle was particularly fun).Most actors do a wonderful job in their respective roles, with Liam Neeson playing Zeus, Ralph Fiennes mimicking his Voldemort role as Hades, and favorite new action hero Sam Worthington as Perseus. The lovely Gemma Arterton, an up and coming actress who can next be seen in Prince of Persia, also does a fine job as aid to Perseus, Io, although her role seems a bit wooden. The three aforementioned actors though are the most entertaining, with Fiennes' Hades and Neeson's Zeus demonstrating a good bit of their acing finesse. Worthington proves once again that he is an excellent action hero, with him being the new reluctant hero for our time. Unfortunately, I can't help but feel as if his typecasting might wear thin. Having to watch Sam do another role like this might be it for me. But for this film, it's suitable.The action is the primary reason to see this, and it is quite exciting. It's nothing that makes you go wow, but it is quite entertaining. There's enough interesting Greek mythology here for a good time at the theater and it's certainly not a waste of time. Unfortunately, that missing wow factor hinders the film. I doubt that this will be remembered much outside the theater. The special effects never really present anything we haven't seen. Even the epic Kraken, which is given quite possibly the most epic introduction ever, isn't all you think it would be cracked up to be (no pun intended....on second thought....). Nothing really pops here, and that's a real shame. With all sorts of great Greek mythology to pull from, it could have even been possible to pull off something as epic as was played in God of War III. Or perhaps that's asking to much. All in all, I can't complain too much. The film doesn't try to be much more than what it is. It also doesn't go much beyond one action scene after another. So, for what it was, I suppose I got what I expected. Which is nothing I can complain about at all. Better than being disappointed. Hopefully you enjoy the film as much, or even more, than I did.",5,15,29,2 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Proves you don't need millions of dollars to make a great film
","It makes me happy to see a film of this sort get such an audience. This is what a film should be about. Not huge effects. Not millions of dollars. Not big names and huge studio backing. It should be about effective film-making. And that's exactly what Paranormal Activity does right. What worked most effectively for me was the sense of dread that permeates throughout. The film has an incredible use of negative space. You constantly feel as thought something horrible is going to happen. Most of this occurs while the couple is sleeping. Unfortunately, the dread over shadows what DOES happen most of the time, which typically involves some minor incident involving a noise or a door. There are a few disturbing scenes involving some sleepwalking. But the majority of what makes the film so effective is the fact that nothing happens. That being said, the film loses its steam a bit when dealing with the 'real' issues, such as the couple bickering and such. It bothered me that the bf would continue to record despite the pleas of his gf. I would think any other dope would turn it off. It does add some drama to what is happening, but otherwise distracts. Certainly the use of a camcorder is effective, but the film quality was a little too good for me. Surprisingly, I think a less quality camera here would have been more effective, as the home made film quality would have been upped. Luckily, the film sticks to what works well here, and that is its minimalist approach. By not showing a whole lot, we get a whole lot of dread and creepiness. It's something the filmmakers seem to know very well and it definitely pays off.",8,1,3,30 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Visually Appealing, But With A Lackluster Plot
","Some will be disappointed by Burton's attempt at Wonderland, while others will simply be satisfied by it's simple charm and wondrous visuals. I am in the latter category. While others may have been taken in immensely by this rendition, I was not one who got terribly excited about the film. My expectations were somewhat low, as Burton hasn't quite delivered on a few of his more recent excursions. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertained I was with the film, particularly in the lead, someone new to me who I quite enjoyed. Certainly, it should come as no surprise that the new Alice looks great. There are a many wonderful things to see. I did, however, take issue with a few scenes that looked a little too animated. It made me wonder if this could have been a 3D animation as opposed to a live action that was quite heavy on the special fx. But, the problem evaporates quickly as the film progresses. Burton's typical goth style is in play here, with a Wonderland that is decaying from being abused by the Queen of Hearts. Adding to the visual scenery are several enjoyable characters, most notably Depp and Carter, playing the Madd Hatter and the Queen of Hearts respectively, but this world is full of wonderful characters, from the white rabbit to the march hare to tweedle dee and tweedle dumb. It's a great assortment of characters every bit as wonderful as one would remember them. Unfortunately, the film is not much more memorable than its performances and scenery. The plot is very much straight forward and all emotional cues are obvious and unmoving. There is a humanity here, but you simply don't care much. In fact, I found the Red Queen, despite her vicious, child like behavior, to be the most relatable. There is a certain sadness, though she is quite mad, and in a way you feel sorry for her. Most other characters, even Alice, are fairly ordinary and there's not a lot of gray to them. It's almost as if they are a little too likable for their own good. Which is a real shame, because Wonderland is such a wonderful place. This is certainly not a huge comeback for Burton. Just another in a long line of okay films that pale in comparison to his past days of Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood. Burton should really be doing more projects like those, where he added a touch of his own dark originality, even to an already told story. If he doesn't start treading some unfamiliar territory, his best days may just be behind him.",7,3,9,5 March 2010
Avatar," Worth Every Minute, Despite Flaws
","I'm not going to make this out to be one of the best films ever created or going to tell you that all the hype is complete BS. What I will say is that what James Cameron has done in creating Avatar is another step in the evolution of cinema and one hell of a ride. It's an exciting film that takes you to places no film has before. Like many have said, it's the closest you will come to going to another world and a journey well worth taking. But before that, let me get the negatives out of the way.Firstly, and this seems to be the main complaint, I think the film borrowed too heavily from the stereotype of the noble savage. It's all fine that there is a distinct good and evil between the natives of Pandora and the invading Earthlings, but the film is very cliché when it comes to it's display of the Na'vi. They are very reminiscent of both the Indians and Africans, right down to war cries and bows and arrows. Creating these humanoid aliens is fine, but if Cameron spent so long on this film, he could have at least been a little more creative in his creation of these Na'vi by drastically changing their culture and way of life from anything representative of earth. Still, I suppose people need something to relate to.To go with this is a story that is every bit as cliché as, say, Dances with Wolves or any other advanced-man-invades-tribal-man's-home story. This story is the same exact thing as any story about any historical invasion of a technologically inferior group of people, be it Indians, African tribes, Mayans and Incans, etc. Sure, it's taken to planetary heights, but it's still the same old universal tale, right down to the cliché fish-out-of-water hero, hardass military badguy, slimy corporate badguy, and heart-of-gold ally who wants to study and save the native people.That's my biggest gripe with this film. Instead of giving us a film that uses every story cliché about a group of people invading another, Cameron could have created an absolutely different and imaginary world. He could have created a unique story about that world and how vast and radical it is from our own. He could have created creatures that have never been thought of, indigenous people the likes of which we have never seen, and base a unique story around the uniqueness of this new and fascinating world. Instead, we get hybrids of animals from earth, and even hybrids of humanoid cat-creatures that we could call familiar. Hell, the Na'vi even kiss. Would alien's from another planet know what a kiss is? Possibly, I suppose, but it's a good example of a lost opportunity to really go in a very different a radical place with this film, one I would have liked to have seen.With that being said, I will say that Cameron is forgiven for all transgressions, because this film is all about Pandora.Every moment spend there (pretty much the entire film) is an absolute joy. It's exciting and had me smiling the entire time. It's like looking at a moving painting you can't watch enough of. There's a great deal of story involved, yes, but that story is deeply rooted into Pandora itself. And that is what saves this film. Cameron has created a world that we could only wish was our own and it will remain one of the greatest environments ever created for a film. Of course we all know about the amazing special effects. And they are 100% amazing. Nothing in this film feels unnatural, something Cameron has become a master at. You will believe that this could happen in the next 200 years.You may have also heard about the final 40 minutes. And everything you have heard is absolutely correct. This is one of the most exciting war scenes ever created for film. Cameron has directed one of, if not the, best action scenes in a film ever. It's like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Top Gun, The Loader scene from Aliens, and a ninja movie wrapped up in 40 minutes. It also contains one of the greatest one-on-one showdowns of any film. Simply put, if you see the film for anything, see it for this final 40 minutes. You may think that waiting 2 hours for this final battle wouldn't be worth it. You would be wrong. Firstly because the film isn't as dull as some have made it out to be. And secondly, it is just that good.Though some have said this won't revolutionize film, I would argue they are wrong. Though the story lacks as great of a script or plot as it could have, and though it doesn't take the whole alien thing far enough in my opinion, the graphics used in this film and the creation of Pandora have opened the door for the creation of anything in film. Any world can be created, any species can be realized. Cameron, who has created some of the greatest action and sci-fi of our time has created yet another phenomenal and important piece of sci-fi.",8,4,9,18 December 2009
Super 8," A Touching, Exciting Summer Blockbuster
","If there is any wonder about what Abrams is capable of in terms of being a filmmaker, Super 8 should sufficiently debunk this. While he is certainly a great producer, this is Abrams first original picture. But never fear, he succeeds again with a fine picture that will warm your heart and excite you.In case you are wondering what this whole thing is about, I will try to keep the plot as a minimum so as to save much of the surprise. Joe Lamb is helping his best buddy make a zombie film in the 1970's when they witness a horrendous train wreck. What follows are several days of unexplained activity that alters all their lives in exciting and frightening ways. Super 8 has been said to be reminiscent of all those old Amblin Spielberg films of the 80's, and it's not far off. There is a good mix of several films in here, including Stand By Me, ET, Close Encounters, and other classic films. Some will blow this off as nothing special, merely a nostalgic trip trying to replicate Spielberg. But in Abrams hands, this is a well crafted and very well directed film. The child actors here are some of the best most emotionally provocative that I have seen in a long, long time. Elle Fanning, in particular, is fantastic. All the children are, and it's something that has rarely been seen since Spielberg, who is arguably the best child director in the industry. But beyond the actors, the cinematography is also of note. Firstly, the train wreck is handled extremely well. It's both frightening and exciting and truly underscores the damage and effect that it will have on the town. And when the creature from within the train begins to wreak havoc, it's extremely effective. Though this is not a horror movie, horror film principles are applied in getting the most out of the tension of these scenes. Some reviews have called the sci-fi elements weak, but I would argue against that. There are issues, which I will get into later, but the scenes dealing with this creature before it's big reveal are nice and scary. These scenes are countered with even better drama. As stated, these child actors are fantastic, and that really makes the scenes in which the budding love story or family drama shines through. Of course, the film has it's issues, the reason it's an 8 and not higher. First of all, I took issue with some of the separation between the monster plot line and the plots involving the kids and their drama. It's almost like two films are being played out here, and while that may have been how the film initially started (as ideas for two different films coming together), it's kind of disheartening to see that they never truly figured out how to make the two interweave naturally. My second issue involves some story elements that seem like they could have been developed more, namely the father-son relationship between Joe and his father. His dad spends much of the time trying to figure out what's going on. We know there are issues there between Joe and his father, and one scene between the two showing this doesn't really encompass the true nature and effect of these problems. It would have also been nice to see more interaction between the two, but I won't spoil anything about why I think this. These are minor issues though for a film that is well crafted and truly enjoyable. Yes, the film is quite nostalgic. However, there are a great deal of touches Abrams puts in himself that make this his own film. For those who grew up on all those old Amblin films, this will warm your heart, and for those who didn't grow up on those, you'll have a chance to know what it felt like to see a film like ET for the first time. Simply put, call this film this generations ET or Stand By Me.",8,12,26,9 June 2011
3 Idiots," A Very Enjoyable, Feel Good Film
","As someone who has never seen a Bollywood film, and doesn't care much for them, I was skeptical about 3 Idiots. But, I had heard good things and decided to give it a shot. Luckily for me, it is a very enjoyable film. At times laugh out loud funny, at others deadly serious, it's one of those rare films that doesn't break the mold, but still manages to be fantastic.The film is primarily about three students who attend the prestigious ICE engineering school. One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan. While not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy. I suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey.",9,5,9,2 July 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," A very pleasant and entertaining film
","Dragon is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in the theater for a while. Full of viking/dragon action, some fantastic aerial scenes, and a bit of humor, Dragon is not only a pleasant film for kids but for adults too. The fact that it revolves around dragons also helps quite a bit, because otherwise I'm afraid it would be a bit too run of the mill.Nothing about the films setup is very surprising. It's your typical story about human being misunderstanding creatures and killing them because of such. No different really from other films dealing with the innate fear humans have and the effects of such fear. In this one, vikings are seemingly terrorized by dragons, until one of the vikings, Hiccup, injures one and begins to make friends with it. Yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. But, this is a case of the specifics separating this film from others. First of all, there are dragons, and everyone knows dragons are cool. Secondly, there are vikings, and who doesn't like a good viking story. Putting these two together is like mixing cheesecake and chocolate: it just works. But in all seriousness, it's a good combination that provides for some truly entertaining scenes involving lots of dragon riding.Now, if you're turned off by the fact that the story is mostly been there, done that safety work, then this may not be for you. I know everyone searches for originality, and this is probably about as unoriginal as an animation can get. But, if you can get over that fact, then you will probably also find this to be quite fun. I for one have no problem with something cliché, as long as all the pieces fit together and it's entertaining. And this was. My only real gripe with the film is the voice acting. It feels a bit phoned in, and I never really got any personality from the characters through their voices. The cast did decent, serviceable work, but it's nothing memorable, which is really a shame. Although, I will say that the choice of Gerard Butler was pretty good casting, if only because he definitely fits the part of the tough viking leader. The film is also quite technically sound, with some incredible scenes of flight. Most of the best parts are of Hiccup and his pet dragon flying around. Dragon may not be the most original animation on the market, but it fits together quite nicely. It's highly entertaining and the dragons are quite likable. It's also pleasant to see a film that doesn't shy away from some more mature content, particularly at the end. It's nice to see the studio not treating our children as if they were blind to the ill tidings of the world. Kids will like this, children will like this, and people in between may find it quite enjoyable too.",8,1,3,8 April 2010
Limitless," Surprisingly Exciting and Thought Provoking Film
","What if you could expand the limits of your mind? What if you could remember things you thought you had forgotten, understand the world in a matter of seconds and minutes? What if you could change the world with this gift? Limitless presents a fascinating theory in a film that's frantic, exciting, and crackling with creative energy. It's not perfect, but I am very surprised to find this film as endearing as it was. The film presents the concept of a drug that can unlock huge potential in anyone. A person who was once lazy and unmotivated becomes a dizzying ball of energy and inspiration. They become smart, sophisticate, and capable of learning anything they desire. As you might suspect, this happens to our main character, Eddie, who goes from mooch to millionaire practically overnight. Of course, like any drug, there are side effects and the film does a good job of portraying this new, fast paced life Eddie achieves through this wonder drug.More than anything, Limitless is a study in artificially achieving everything. It imagines a world where people can becomes smarter, more sophisticated, more ambitious, and more energetic without any of the work. It certainly seems harmless enough and it's a fantasy that is hard to argue with, but the films analysis of what if? is quite interesting. This is coupled with a top-notch performance from Cooper and some fantastic technical work makes this film a surprise. Cooper certainly does deliver a great performance, showing diversity as two people living in one mind separated by a chemical transformation. It's fun to watch Cooper, especially since he's somewhat different from the charming guy he tends to play (of which he is only charming half the time here). Just as well, the dizzying array of camera and editing effects that, at first come off as too flashy, but quickly show a great relationship with the story at hand. They do wear a little bit, but they fit the film quite well. Probably the best quality of the film is it's pacing. It's relentless. 30 minutes into the film and Eddie is already a major player. The film hardly slows down to take a breath before playing tug of war with Eddie. It makes the film very exciting and it hardly gives you time to think about anything you might dislike about what you just saw.There are issues here, however. Primarily, the second half takes a bit of a downturn. Things get a little too hectic and there are some unbelievable moments happening, particularly a certain scene in a park that features a fairly unbelievable turn of events. The ending also leaves a bit to be desired, with it ending a bit too Hollywood for me. Robert DeNiro is enjoyable, but once again, this is a role that is beneath him. Hard to accept DeNiro playing second to Cooper, but then it was hard to accept him playing second to Ben Stiller as well. Overall, I enjoyed Limitless. It was entertaining and thought provoking with a relentless pace. Not perfect, nor is it even really that great, but certainly enjoyable. I'd recommend a rental.",Null,0,2,19 July 2011
Thor," Entertaining Fantasy That Rarely Slows Down
","When I first started seeing trailers for Thor, I was fairly unimpressed. I worried that the fantasy elements would be treated poorly and that this was really just a cash in to set things up for The Avengers. However, good buzz about the film prompted me to see it, and sure enough, the buzz is right. This is an entertaining summer blockbuster that continues the trend of early summer films from Fast Five.A bit different from the other Marvel films, this one concerns a different take on the Norse myth where Thor is the brash, blood lusting, and proud son of Odin. He is soon sent to Earth and relinquished of his godly powers in order to be taught a lesson. However, forces conspire against him and his home, Asgard. Certainly, there is heavy tie in here with the rest of the Marvel universe of films, but the film establishes itself as something different. Where as most other Marvel films have been grounded in reality with all the flashiness and powers mixing with everyday life, Thor generally keeps the film's fantasy and reality separate. In fact, for once in a Marvel movie, people question how these things are happening. It is in this fantasy element that Thor separates itself. It's story is heavily invested in it's mythology, and that is a welcome change of pace. This is, for the most part, a fantasy film, with magic and powers and even the silly costumes.The film is led by some strong performances, most notably in the three main actors of Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and veteran thespian Hopkins. Each delivers strong, with Hemsworth and Hiddleston stealing the show and providing some very good drama and character growth. Natalie Portman and the rest of the supporting cast to a great job as well, with Portman acting her usual adorable self while appearing to have a lot of fun in the role, which helps make her performance that much more enjoyable. Branagh does an admirable job as a director here, showing a flair for the dramatic and making good use of the source material in it's scale and scope.There is surprisingly not as much action as I expected, but there is also a lot more humor than I anticipated, especially when Thor first comes to earth. My only major complaints against the film are it's seeming lack of focus and the romance angle. There doesn't seem to really be a straight focus here as the film shifts between several different groups doing things all at once. There is an overall quest of Thor to learn from his predicament, however, it really lacks a lead up to a climax. Even when Thor does head into the finale, it's underwhelming and it sort of just happens. The human drama and characterizations make up for some of this, but, none the less, it comes off as a bit of just passing through the motions. The second is the supposed romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character. It's simply not believable that Thor would just fall for the first beautiful woman he see when he gets to Earth. Her attraction to him is more understandable, but any actual love is hardly believable.These two things, however, as minor in the face of the grand spectacle. With great fx, great performances from the cast, and a snappy pace, this is a great way to start the summer blockbuster season and brings hope that rest of the Marvel films coming will follow suit and be just as good. Here's looking at you First Class and Cap. Am.",8,9,18,6 May 2011
Zombieland," Awesomely Funny and Action Packed
","It's been a long time since I have really enjoyed myself in the theaters. Sure, Inglorious Basterds was genius and District 9 was also quite good, but that's about all I can recall really enjoying this summer. Now with fall upon us, it's time to head into a new season of film and ramp up for the winter. Zombieland is a great start for the season. In fact, this is really just a summer movie that missed the deadline. It would have been one of the better films this summer, and is one of the better films I have seen as of late.In Zombieland, our focus is on Columbus, an almost neurotic shut-in, is trying to get home to Columbus, Ohio after zombies take over the world. He soon meets Tallahassee, who is simply trying to survive, and find a twinkie at that. The two hit the road, and we find ourselves on a zombie road trip that will have you laughing all along the way.The best thing about the film is that it is in equal parts action packed and funny. Well, probably mostly fun, but there is enough of both comedy and action here to satisfy. However, this is not gag based comedy, thank god, but rather based on it's characters, which is a relief for zombie films. Jessie Einsenberg is perfectly cast as Columbus, who seems afraid of the world at large, but is pretty much forced into it by the zombie situation. His narration, which could have been annoying, is actually quite funny from the very beginning. Just as funny are his rules, which continually pop up in comedic fashion to remind the viewer of their importance. Woody Harrelson is also quite funny as Tallahassee, whose mostly muscle for the film, but also provides quite a bit of comedy through his 'nut up or shut up' type of character. Completing the cast are Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Witchita and Little Rock, respectively, two young femme fatales who take our main characters for quite the spin.The comedy in zombieland lends itself more to today's style of humor in films, that sort of realistic and awkward humor that has been pervasive in any film starring Seth Rogan or Michael Cera. While it's not exactly that style of humor, the most funny moments are the most human ones. Tallahassee's quest for a twinkie, Columbus' neurosis, tearing up a souvenir shop, even Bill Murray's guest appearance. These are all some of the funniest things about the film. Sure, all the stuff involving the zombie's is fun and funny, but what really shines here are the characters, which keep from being typical, plywood staples of the zombie film. Many will probably compare this to Shaun of the Dead, and it's a justified comparison. This ranks right up there with Shaun and should be an instant zombie classic.",9,3,8,3 October 2009
12 Years a Slave," An Unflinching Look At Human Brutality Driven By Fantastic Performances
","The slavery of blacks in the US is one of the darkest periods of the history of the country. And yet, it's easy to forget that it not only is such an ingrained part of US history, one that helped build it's foundations, but a piece of history that lasted a long period of time. In fact, the issue is less than 200 years old, and according to history, that's not a long time. So, a film like 12 Years is a deep reminder of not only how far we have come along, but of who we once were and who we can yet again become. Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, we follow the man from the time he is kidnapped and forced into slavery. Based on the book of the same name, written by Northup himself, it's clear where the film eventually goes, but the journey is like little else in film that has dealt with the subject. No doubt this film will get much comparison to Tarantino's Django, which also dared to show slavery in a gloves off kind of way, but this is a film that deals with slavery in a much less entertaining or satisfactory fashion. Rather, the film is brutal and does not shy away from being ugly and emotionally charged. And while we may be quick to jump on this as being obvious and typical, it is anything but.Northup's story is unique enough as it is. He's one of a few kidnapped, freed slaves to ever regain freedom, but he also manages to give a personal account. As Northup, Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent. He handles the character with a great deal of emotional layer and considering the brutal and realistic nature of the film, it's hard to imagine many who could take on such a brave role. But even beyond this being just another film about slavery, McQueen goes the extra length to depict the film in such a fashion that we are almost forced to feel something. There's a scene about halfway through in which Northup is left roped up with only his tiptoes to keep him from hanging. During this scene, McQueen carries the image in a single shot for several minutes, what seems to stretch into an eternity, during which everything around Northup all but ignores him. Slaves go about their day, while the slave drivers don't budge an inch to help. As Ejiofor is obviously not choking here in real life, it is to his credit that we are convinced he is suffering for such an extended period of time. And the rest of the performance carries on as such.The other performers are also quite good, but a number of them are relegated to small appearances. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbacth, Paul Dano, and Brad Pitt all make brief appearances and are all excellent in their roles, but they are still brief and mostly one dimensional. Nothing new to a film about slavery. McQueen, however, manages to pump up the tension and emotion in the scenes by giving us an unfiltered look at slavery here. No punches are pulled. However, the runaway performance, by far, with the exception of Ejiofor, is Michael Fassbender, who plays Edwin Epps, a plantation owner who makes no qualms about driving his slaves and punishing them. He's cruel, and Fassbender truly makes him a monster of a man. Fassbender has gone on record for not wanting to push an Oscar nomination, and it's no wonder. Fassbender's Epps could be considered one of the great villains of the year for being such a despicable human being, but the fact that he is played to reality, as opposed to DiCaprio's more cartoonish Calvin Candy, makes him all the more frightening. When he engages with his slaves, you genuinely fear for their safety, and even their life. Another star here is the cinematography. There are some truly beautiful shots here, which can only help to remind you of just how ugly the topic of the film is. I did talk a bit about the long shots here before, but to elaborate, there are moments when the camera is content to focus on something. The film certainly doesn't come off as speeding along, and it lends to being thoughtful, even in just focusing on the emotional state of the characters. There is an interesting shot that focuses on Northup's emotionally drained face, and you grasp a lot in that single shot. All in one, we witness a man who is driven by deep sorrow and pain, and yet he has had his hope and spirit driven from him. Though it's evident he wants to cry, it's almost as if he has been completely defeated. 12 Years truly is the film people say it is and may very well be one of the most important films on slavery ever created. It's depiction is raw and unflinching and there is little choice but to confront the ugliest humanity has to offer. Not an easy film to watch, nor entertaining, it is none the less important and well made. Worth watching simply for it's powerful performances and take on the subject at hand.",9,5,11,2 November 2013
Inception," Anything Is Possible
","If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of. I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery. I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will.",10,16,32,16 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," One Of The Most Entertaining Movies Of The Holiday Season
","Robert Downey Jr. has, in recent years, made a reputation for himself and the movies he headlines. You can expect a few things from them. Firstly, they're probably going to be fun. This is evidenced by Tropic Thunder, and even more so, Iron Man. Secondly, there is a good amount of humor put into his roles. In this new version of the famous Baker Street detective, he continues his trend of blockbuster making roles as he serves up a joyous and often times funny portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.This time around, Holmes and Watson, played to a T by Jude Law, must tackle a seemingly supernatural case involving a resurrected Lord Blackwood back from the dead. The rest of the film is spent chasing the once deceased Lord and figuring out his next move. And it is quite a wild ride through London at that. The film succeeds in spades thanks largely to its perfectly cast leading men and a smart script that provides a fantastic maze of a story that has one guessing right up to the end, just as traditional Sherlock Holmes tales have done. Law and Downey Jr. work so perfectly together, it could be argued that this is the best couple of any movie in recent history. And what perfect casting. Jude Law, commonly known for more sophisticated, yet hard bitten, roles oozes such here with a Watson who is quite sophisticated and smart, but also displays a natural talent for fighting his way out of a physical confrontation. Likewise, Downey brings his usual mixture of crazy and cocky to it's most raw. It also helps that both characters are flawed in very realistic ways (Watson a compulsive gambler, Holmes an obsessive compulsive drinker), the way that the characters are often best done.Another very positive element is the mixture of elements between the story, character development, and action, all of which work superbly. The action is much more down to earth and far less CGI-ey that was once believed. The story, while many have said is uninteresting, still commands attention as it sets up a fine and inventive mystery. Above all, the character development creates two very fun and fascinating characters that are two of the most enjoyable of any film in recent memory.Sherlock Holmes isn't a perfect film. Far from it, Rachel McAdams is wasted here as a love interest and Mark Strong falls short of a worthy adversary for Downey Jr., whose Holmes is far more impressive than the lackluster Lord Blackwood. And some of the story seems a bit forced, as if elements were put it in simply to push the story through. However, these are not nearly enough to deter from what works in the film, and what works, works so well. Sherlock Holmes is definitely a great way to end 2009 in film.",8,1,3,28 December 2009
X-Men: First Class," Marvel Does It Again! Best X Yet!
","There are a few things that a summer blockbuster should be. First and foremost, they should be entertaining. Summer is all about being big and being fun. Secondly, they should be well made. Good acting, good direction, good script...films in general should have this, but a good summer film can back up it's special effects and action with quality filmmaking. And finally, they should focus more on the deeper things, like themes and humanity than their shallow action or comedy elements. First Class, much to my surprise, embodies all of these and creates a truly wonderful summer blockbuster.While many might be skeptical that the fifth X-men film would certainly be one of the worst, the fact is, it's probably the best. Where the other films tried to focus on the Marvel universe and the wow factor of the X-men and their powers, pleasing fanboys with wonderful visuals and nods here and there, First Class puts it's characters first. Sure, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but the focus on the characters first is a welcome change. In fact, it makes me think of the original X-men film, a film which is now more than ten years old. The quality of the filmmaking here is leagues beyond the original film. Here we have top notch performances, and while there is certainly no outranking Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen, the entire cast for First Class seems to work so very well. I can't remember enjoying the entire ensemble cast from the original trilogy as much as I did here. This is certainly thanks to Matthew Vaughn, who seems to do an extremely good job handling origin stories. Much like he did with Kick Ass, this film is well grounded, despite featuring a large number of mutant power-fueled action sequences.And that's the real trick here. The film strikes the perfect balance between action and drama. There is one scene in particular between Charles and Erik that is very touching and goes far beyond any scene from any of the previous X-Men films. The action is very fun too, and some of my favorites of these involve Banshee's combination of flight and super sonic super powers. Suffice to say, while this film could have simply been a great action film with great performances, in the same way Thor was, it goes beyond by adding a load of heart. There's even some nods to the original films, including an applause inducing cameo, that will have fans salivating. Suffice to say, I can't praise the film enough. It's certainly not without it's flaws. Kevin Bacon's performance, when in comparison to the others, is a little underwhelming. As others have said, he hams it up. And it's not even so bad, except that everyone else just plays their parts so well, his seems a little, as stated, underwhelming. Other parts seem to be thrown in without much to do, namely Darwin, who is barely on screen. But these are minor complaints, as this is a fantastic comic book film. While Marvel's lineup has come a long way, their films continue to get better and better. First Class is a large step in the right direction for the X-Men series of films. If they were to say they were giving the series a reboot, with this kind of quality, you would have no complaints from me.",8,8,15,3 June 2011
Toy Story 3," A Truly Excellent Sequel
","All truly great sequels have one thing that makes them work extremely well, and that one thing is progression. It's why Spider Man 2 and X-men 2 were better than their prequels. And this is exactly what works so well with Toy Story 3. The film manages to maintain it's previous level of humor and excitement, while presenting a new story that fits perfectly with a series that some of us have grown up with. Much like many of the children who have watched these films, our new Toy Story sees Andy all grown up and ready for college. And for Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang, that means that it's time to start moving on. Buzz isn't quite ready to give that life up yet, and he seems to be the only one that Andy is taking along. The rest of the gang eventually find themselves donated to a day care center, which turns out to be worse than the toys could have anticipated, and it's up to Woody to save the gang.In it's first hour, the film drags a bit. The jokes aren't quite as funny as they could be, as I didn't laugh quite as much as I laughed during the first two films. But the film is still highly entertaining, and this is one G rated film that everyone should be able to get behind. The story of Andy growing up and moving on is also a perfect direction for the film. It not only speaks of these characters, but it speaks of everyone involved, both behind the film and the audience. It's one final goodbye to our friends in what is probably one of the most successful animation franchises ever. And it's this theme of growing up, moving on, and starting over that carries the second half into perfection. There are moments in this second half that had me on the verge of tears, and I rarely ever cry at a movie. The plot beyond the themes is great, a homage to prison break movies, with the toys becoming prisoners of the day care center and the subsequent escape. And the new villain, Lotso, is a great sympathetic antagonist who is not without his reasons for who he is. The film is filled with entertaining set pieces, my particular favorite being a scene involving a tortilla that had me in tears of laughter. So, while the jokes are sometimes hit and miss (although mostly hit), there are times when the film is extremely funny. The voice work here is as good as ever and it's hard to believe that the actors have been away for so long, because it feels like they never left these characters. I almost feel like they sometimes just sit around with each other and do a Toy Story roundabout every once in a while. There isn't enough good praise that can be said about these characters. Sure, the film drags its feet a little and retreads previous territory, but these are very minor in the face of the glaringly excellent things it does so right. Where Iron Man 2 may be the summer's best blockbuster, this is the summer's first great film, and is everything we have been asking for from our movies since the start.",9,2,3,19 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Great Finale For A One Of A Kind Film Series
","Unlike so many 'Potterheads' out there, I can't call myself a die-hard fan of the series. Yes, I have enjoyed the films greatly, but I have never read a single book, nor have I devoted time to following every piece of Potter news. So, this review comes from someone who has enjoyed the films as a fan of movies. And this final chapter is truly an enjoyable spectacle that brings the series to a wonderful close.It's been a very long time following our trio, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine, but finally the time has come. Picking up right from the previous film, the three are on a quest to find all the remaining Horcrux, those objects that must be destroyed in order for Voldemort to be killed himself. Standing alone, this feels like half a film, so it certainly won't appeal to anyone who hasn't followed the series or at least seen Part 1. But considering the titan that this series has become in terms of films, it's safe to say that a good majority of film goers will be out to see this one and will quite enjoy it.Probably the best thing going for this film is that it is almost non- stop excitement. While it starts out a bit slow, it quickly picks up, delivering all the action and excitement that Part 1 brushed over to develop the heavy story. It's certainly the most action driven of any of the films and goes into some truly dark territory, at times looking like a war film. I was reminded of war films during several scenes in which Harry finds himself amidst a makeshift hospital or is crawling along the ground in what is essentially a battlefield. This is the darkest chapter of the series, and rightfully so. What started as a wonderfully magic driven film series delves into it's darkest of elements and reveals the raw nature of the adult world in the Harry Potter series. That primary elements being dealt with here is death, and it is constantly foreboding. For as long as I have watched these films, I have wanted the series to bring about that dreadful seriousness coupled with fantastic action, and this film delivers all of that.It helps that performances all around are fantastic, and the lead trio have certainly come a long ways. Throughout the series, they have managed to grow along with their characters, and they rightfully deliver the necessary chops that their characters need to. What were once children are now adults and they play their roles up well. Gone from this chapter is any of the angst from any previous film. Each character is faced with a simple fact: they may very well die. And some do. So, what remains is their battle for their lives and to defeat this great evil. It's a breath of fresh air, to finally be rid of so much of that teenage angst. Now, we finally get to have our epic climax, a great battle between good and evil. Ralph Fiennes is also of particular note, as he relishes the role of his evil Voldemort, providing a certain level of campiness that seems appropriate to the character. Alan Rickman is wonderful as usual, but finally breaks free from that brooding mold that had been crafted for so long. We get to see his wonderful acting skills put on display in full.Now, that isn't to say this is a perfect film. No doubt, many a fan will give this a perfect 10, but as a less connected viewer, I felt some elements were slightly too convenient, as if there were certain things that were rushed in the film. Considering this is the shortest film in the series, it seems like maybe a lot of conveniences could have been more developed if only to provide a bit of common sense. Just as well, there were certain elements that felt a bit underwhelming, including the final confrontation, which seemed to evaporate rather quickly when compared to what came before. The emotional elements are there, for sure, but the film never truly feels like it completely capitalizes on everything that has led up to the final moments. Then again, it's hard to imagine that it ever really could fully live up to what we would imagine the climax to be.Overall, however, this may very well be the best Harry Potter film. Well, this and Part 1. I still haven't decided. But it's a fun final ride. Filled with action, great acting and directing, and some very intense moments, if you've enjoyed any of the films before it, this is one finale you won't want to miss.",Null,0,1,15 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Surprisingly Good Movie That Surpasses It's Predecessor In Every Way
","I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan of the books, but I did enjoy Hunger Games, despite it's tweenie appeal. I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. Maybe it's the Battle Royale and Lord of the Flies fan in me. I did enjoy the first movie. It was a very well done adaptation. However, having read the entire trilogy, I feared that adapting the rest of the material would result in something similar to the books: terrible follow ups. As someone who takes the content of these books and the things that themes and stories they are trying to tell just a bit more seriously than the target age group might, I groaned and moaned throughout the novels, especially the last one. However, the film has done something I didn't think it could do: not suck.That's right, the movie does not suck. In fact, it's actually quite good. So good that it out does The Hunger Games in nearly every way, something that is quite the opposite of the novel. Where the original movie, while good, also came off feeling like it was feeding that tweenie audience it was aimed at, something about Catching Fire feels far more serious and far more mature. The film picks up right where we left off. Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, while the rest of the districts are showing signs of civil unrest due to Katniss defiance of The Capitol, that oppressive government regime that forces districts to send their children to die. To send a message to the districts that the capitol is still evil, they devise a new Hunger Games, this time forcing past victors back into the arena. Because what is a Hunger Games movie without the Hunger Games.The first film, at times, felt like it was doing too much to introduce us into this world. Everything felt like some kind of obvious plot detail. While I enjoyed the film, I often felt disconnected to it and the issues it tried to present. There was so much focus on details of the world and the games, that the presentation of the world seemed to take a back seat. Lawrence was the major saving grace, though even she wasn't perfect. All of this has changed. With the games essentially taking a secondary part in the film, there is a stronger emotional connection. It helps that all the actors involved are not only a bigger part of the film but seem to be more comfortable and are much more convincing in their roles. Where the characters of Effie and Haymitch and even Gale seemed purpose driven, with little more than a role to fill, here they feel more fleshed out. They have a greater impact and there is more of an emotional connection, from Haymitch's clear frustration between his contempt for the Capitol and his attempts to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, to Effie's attempt to keep everyone as a team and sure signs that she is struggling with the facts of Katniss and Peeta once again thrown into turmoil.The performances are the primary strength here. They do deliver on the emotion that is necessary to drive this story and don't feel like they are catering just to tweens, with the poorly written love triangle of the novel and the more trivial elements that are apart of the kind of writing that comes with novels aimed at tweens. Catching Fire feels like a serious movie with a serious story to tell. At it's heart is Jennifer Lawrence, who seems like a completely different person here. Since the original movie, as an actor, Lawrence has had several projects and has even won an Oscar. And so, it is no surprise that she feels like she is at an entirely different level. She seems more natural as Katniss and her acting is far more convincing. She comes off as someone who is not only conflicted, but scared. Even so, she remains strong and determined. Much like the first movie, as Katniss, she proves to be among the best of role models for young folk. But beyond the performances, everything just feels elevated. The story has a better focus on the growing revolution that is clearly starting. The themes are more apparent and focused on. Everything feels less obvious and more natural. Gone are introductions to this world and it's elements, replaced by a futuristic vision carried purely by it's story and characters. Even the games are better, with more exciting action, better effects, and better character interaction, helped by a cast of new characters as fellow tributes. I do seem to be gushing about the film, and it's not one I had expected to like nearly as much as I did, but I have to admit it: this was a very pleasant surprise. My fear now is that the next films won't live up to this sequel. But, I will give them more of the benefit of the doubt, considering how much this film blew me away as far as surpassing expectations. As I said in my review for the first film, fans will love this, and non-fans may also find themselves won over.",8,179,345,22 November 2013
Get Him to the Greek," Very very funny
","When I saw the trailers for Greek, they looked moderately funny. I hadn't seen Sarah Marshal, so I had no idea what that was all about. But, reviews were good and I thought, hey, what the heck. What I found was a very funny Apatow-filmish take on the rock n roll film. All the elements of a usual Apatow troop film are there: focus on unusual moments, sex drugs and gross out humor, friendship and some serious moments, and the breaking down of typical film trappings. Suffice to say, this is a great summer comedy.The film, as many know, charges Allen Green with getting washed up rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theater in LA for a 10th anniversary concert. As one would guess, things don't go accordingly, and a whole lot of comedy ensues. The film, more than anything, is essentially a rock pic. It's about the life of this rock star who has burned out his bulb and is attempting to put in a new one. And as Aldous Snow, Russel Brand is fantastic. He truly embodies this rock star and you feel he really IS this character. He boozes it up, drugs it up, sexes it up, and whatever other manner of things a rock star might abuse. He's a mess of a guy, and like so many famous people who have gone south, he's a complicated person who has let fame get the best of him. This is translated extremely well. Despite all the comedy, this is an excellent rock and roll biopic type film. Jonah Hill is great as the lead character with baggage of his own and he does what he does best here, although he plays a more awkward kind of character versus his geek-in- charge style that we're so accustomed too.Stealing the show, however, is Sean Combs, who plays Green's boss Sergio. Every scene he is in is hilarious and he is surprisingly funny. It was definitely pleasant to see him pull off such a funny role. The other supporting characters are great, doing a fine job of being very funny themselves. Most of the film falls into stages of comedy bits, and all are pretty damned hilarious. There's nothing here that's too ridiculous, which is nice. There is once scene that kind of makes you raise a brow, but it's just so damn funny, you forget how insane it is. And that's really the charm of the film. Everything about it is larger than life, yet believable. This is exactly why it perfectly molds both the rock star film and an Apatow comedy so perfectly. It's the kind of comedy you would expect it to be, while not knowing exactly what is going to happen. If you don't like these kinds of comedies, this one may not be for you. But if you've enjoyed other films like Sarah Marshal, Pineapple Express, and other Apatow troop films, you'll find Greek hilarious. I know I did.",8,69,130,5 June 2010
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fantastic Fun, A Reinvention Of The Spy Film Game For A Modern Age
","As a fan of the comic, I will say this, Kingsman actually manages to trump it's source material in many ways. Taking what we know about Spy films: the gadgets, the villain, the prestige, even the action, Kingsman gives us street level flair here by essentially reinventing the Bond formula and kicking it in the teeth. It's an exciting, action packed, and fun film that conforms to Matthew Vaughn's stylish take on the comic book film. Eggsy is a smart, talented young man living with his mom and her boyfriend in London with a penchant for trouble. With his dad having died when he was a child, Eggsy has lived a rough life dodging the law and local thugs. But when an old associate of his father's enters his life, he's given the opportunity to put his talents to good use and become part of an elite group of spies. What a blast. From beginning to end, this movie is entertaining. And this is mostly thanks to the actors rounded up here. Colin Firth brings his usual wonderful skills as an actor, but it's his combat skills that make him so entertaining. Essentially the old fashioned James Bond of the film, Firth is as suave as ever, but he also commits violence that goes unparalleled in the film. This is most demonstrated in one of the film's biggest set pieces, taking place at a southern church which was briefly shown in the trailer. He steals the show, but the surrounding performances are just as great. Taron Egerton, a stranger to the States, is excellent as Eggsy. While this could have been a character who came off as thuggish and criminal, Eggsy is actually quite sympathetic from early in the film. He's clearly smart and a guy who wants to protect his mom and see her have a better life. However, like so many these days, he feels burdened by his lot in life and it has turned him into a less than stellar citizen. His transformation from a troubled kid to a master spy is incredibly entertaining and combines the charm and sophistication of the typical spy film with the rough edge of a street level action film. Sam Jackson brings the ham as an unusual villain, Mark Strong plays one of the most entertaining characters in the film as the youngsters spy trainer, and Michael Caine appears as the head of Kingsman, bringing his usual mix of seasoned professionalism and sense of fun.As for the film itself, Matthew Vaughn does as good a job here as his previous comic book adaptations. He continues to demonstrate how to make a film fun, exciting, and hip without it being overly cheesy or appear to be trying too hard. He seems almost a perfect match up for Mark Millar's work, as he is able to almost perfectly convey Millar's mixture of rough edge, sense of fun, and intriguing bend of known tropes. In terms of breaking down a genre, this is similar to Kick Ass in that sense. The action is as superb as you would expect and we're always allowed to see it, with a lack of dizzying close ups and shaky cam, which is thankful. The climax is especially rousing and exciting, with plenty of varied action bits, from gun fights to a dual between Sofia Boutella's deadly, prosthetic leg wearing assassin and Eggsy. It's something of a surprise to find this film playing in a month usually reserved for films studios have little faith in. This is summer blockbuster material and fantastic entertainment.",8,4,10,5 February 2015
Fast Five," The Summer Begins Now!
","Well, color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed, it's always been big, loud, and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release, appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However, it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around, the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So, it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.Fast Five ditches the street racing that made it's name in favor for being a heist film. In this particular case, we pick up right from where we left off, with Dom being busted out of his prison bus. They then flee to Rio where they take on a heist that goes haywire and eventually leads to the penultimate heist of the film. In the meantime, ruthless Agent Hobbs, who specializes in tracking and capturing people, arrives to catch out trio of outlaws. The film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action. And in the action department, the film delivers tenfold. Far bigger, louder, and more exciting than any F&F film before it, action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosterone-laced mix of car and foot action.Now, don't get me wrong, this is still a F&F film. This means that the script is still pretty laughable and the acting leaves much to be desired. However, with that said, it's still a bit improved here. Vin Diesel still can't play up emotion very well, making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable. Paul Walker doesn't fair much better and, unfortunately, even as a main character takes a back seat to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. As action stars though, these three do a great job. In particular, the eventual confrontation between Diesel and Johnson is fantastic, with it being a brutal, WWE-esque rumble. The climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission. Though laughable, it's still an exciting, eye-popping scene that will leave you a little stupefied. Certainly, you have to suspend much of your disbelief with your film. If you can't do that, you'll just find this entire film laughable and of poor entertainment value. For those who can though, this is a very entertaining film. And for fans, you'll certainly enjoy the film, with a well rounded cast from throughout the entire series coming together to pull off the impossible. It's definitely surprising to see that the fifth film in the series is the best, but I suppose that it's merely the evolution of F&F. With enough money, talent, and by pulling out all the stops, the franchise has finally capitalized on the over-the-top aspects that they had always seemed to go for. Suffice to say, action fans with enough suspension of disbelief will enjoy this immensely.",8,109,165,29 April 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," One of the best, most original horror films in years
","The horror genre for me has been pretty mediocre for the past several years, and so I have pretty much ignored a lot of horror movies that have come out, with the exception of a few. However, after the buzz surrounding Cabin, I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough, Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want, from our favorite clichés to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say, every horror fan should go see this.I won't spoil the story, but to get into things a little, we focus on the age old tale of horror films: friends go to a remote cabin for some RnR and then the **** hits the fan. And when it does, it does so gleefully. It would be easy to blow this off as a simple parody, but it's not. I won't say how, but this is essentially a horror movie within a horror movie, and it's mostly dead serious. There's plenty of humor throughout, mostly due to Fran Krantz stoner character. And in fact, pretty much all the actors play there parts well. They are likable characters, even if they are cliché, but the clichés are part of the entire point. And in such areas, these characters are great. If you're worried about the horror aspect of the film, fear not, it delivers immensely. There are plenty of chilling scenes, though I wouldn't necessarily call them scary, and there is plenty of gore for the gorehounds, particularly at the end.To say much more would be to give away too much. I certainly had a few qualms about the film, but they were few and far between. And the less you know the better. I will only say that if you've been looking for good horror film, this is it. Whedon and Goddard have delivered in every way and their film will be remembered for some time in the same way Scream was remembered for shaking up the genre. This is similar, but different in oh so many ways. Go see this movie. It's the kind of film that comes out once in a blue moon.",9,269,510,13 April 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Better Than The Second Film, Not Quite The First Film
","The first Transformers film was an event for me. As a fan of the cartoon, I was excited to see it brought to life on the big screen. And seeing it was quite an event. I got the chance to see an early screening of it at Anime Expo in 2007 with about 3000 excited geeks and nerds. So, you can imagine, it was a lot of fun. Sadly, the energy in this series is not the same. Gone is the excitement carried by the discovery of CGI- fueled Transformers. Gone is the thrill of seeing Optimus for the first time or hearing the line Autobots, Roll Out. Without that thrill, one thing becomes glaringly obvious: the series just isn't that exciting any more.Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a terrible film. Good, well, that's debatable. The action is still very well done and Michael Bay is still probably the best choice of a director to do a Transformers film. He makes the action look great, and it certainly is great here. But, one could argue that this is the same film as the first, and that was probably done on purpose. We're made aware of some dark secret, reintroduced to Sam Whitwicky in his current life, and then things go wrong. And yes, it all ends in a spectacular battle in which an entire city becomes the battleground. What is highly noticeable is how long the film is. It drags in the middle and by the end, you are starting to notice that the film is really long. And it is, at 2.5 hours. There is certainly some entertainment value to be had. The action is spectacular, to use that word twice. The CGI effects are phenomenal, as they have continued to be for the series and the Transformers are as enjoyable as ever. Sam and Bumblebee's relationship is specifically enjoyable, as it was in the first film. Despite what many will say, Bay does have a certain way of pulling out even the tiniest bit of emotion from his films, and he succeeds here on the smallest scale. Certainly it's not a film to will find a deep connection with, but there's one there. But, as I stated, this is essentially the first film, minus the excitement of discovering the Transformers for the first time. So, if you enjoy these films as a sort of reunion with old friends, then you will like this one. While the second film was certainly a disaster, this is much better, with a simpler plot, decipherable action, and even a decent story. I, however, was fairly bored. There's some sprinkling of humor and decent action, but again, the film dragged quite a bit. Maybe I was just a bit tired when I saw it, but one thing a Transformers film shouldn't be is boring, and sadly, this one was. What I say to you is see it if you want some decent summer action. But if the idea of another Transformers film already has you rolling your eyes and yawning, I say skip it. You probably won't change your mind.",6,1,5,29 June 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Decent Revenge Flick, But Turn Your Brain Off
","I wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of revenge flicks, but I am a fan of the concept. Here we have a great concept: a man who loses his family and watches the man responsible for this get a minimal sentence for the crime, blames the justice system and takes revenge on them...while being imprisoned. I groaned when I knew what to expect, someone with another blow-hard message about justice in the U.S. Still, the fact the main character is imprisoned and still killing off people intrigued me. And for the most part, it is a pretty entertaining film. What makes this film particularly entertaining is its relentless pace. It's almost non-stop. Despite being predictable and the trailers giving away too much, there are several entertaining action scenes here. It help that Gerard Butler once again proves he's a charming action star. This is the kind of stuff he should be doing. Jaime Foxx on the other hand is less entertaining as a success-hungry lawyer.Unfortunately, as entertaining as the film is, much of it leaves something to be desired. The writing is mediocre and much of what happens during the action scenes is beyond unbelievable. I understand suspension of disbelief, and believe me I can probably perform such a thing more so than most people, but this film stretched it. And not just in the way the action scenes play out, but in the message of the film. Butler's character is so blood lusty by the end of the film, and Foxx's character seems to have had so little character growth, that you really don't care for any of these characters and their senses of justice. It's a good concept, but one that is DOA.This leads me to the two biggest problems in the film: the fact that there is no real protagonist and the ending. A film needs a protagonist of some sort, especially and action film. And, in a revenge film, we're supposed to support the character in their quest for vengeance. Here, it is almost impossible to care about Butler's character, as he has killed a number of innocent characters and essentially become the villain that we are supposed to hate. Likewise, by the end, Foxx seems to have learned nothing from the ordeal, or at least has not grown as a character in any satisfying way. And then there is the ending, which is so ridiculous one wonders how it can be acceptable. While the whole thing was kinda cool in a special fx kind of way, the message the film was trying to tell is shot right out the window. Way to go.Now, I realize there is quite a bit of criticism here, and that's only because, for such a preachy film you'd really have to be an anarchist to support its message. But the cat and mouse games in the film are actually well written and the quest for the truth is interesting enough to sustain interest. Sure, there are huge leaps of logic here (instead of transferring the man out of the city, they keep him imprisoned in it? ), but if you can suspend your belief for a while, there is some decent action here and even a little suspense. It's not a great movie by far, but if you want to kill some time with a fairly entertaining film, this should suffice as the new film of the week.",6,1,2,19 February 2010
