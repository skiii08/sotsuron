Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I almost fell asleep.
","This is an awful film. Not only is it poor in itself but it spoils theoriginal 3 films as well by reminding everybody of the flaws in themthat we had all forgotten about. Jar-Jar Binks has got to be theworst character in a film ever, and as for that boring Pod-racerscene it is well, boring. This film makes me wish even more forthe Lord of the Rings film, as Star Wars is a rip off of LotR in a lotof ways anyway.",1,0,1,14 December 2001
The Patriot," Another in the line of American self-love films
","Its all very well Americans saying that this film is not meant to be historically accurate, but there are people who are stupid enough to believe that this is a depiction of real events (see some of the comments on this page).The scene with the church building was awful and also the happy slave motif was extremely offensive. This is yet another film where America tries to show itself as a country that never does anything wrong and is always the best country at everything, see U-572, Independence Day etc.Soon we'll get a film that tries to say that nobody died in WWII other than Americans, or that any or all of Jesus, Shakespeare, Newton, Gallileo, God, were in fact American.",Null,1,3,13 January 2002
Titanic," There probably are longer films, but....
","Pre-iceburg this film is one of the most boring of all time, with a cheesy romantic plot. After the iceburg it gets more interesting but is still pretty dreadful. I particularly hated the awful song (you know which one I mean). It is also inexcusable that American script writers took one of the actual crew of the Titanic and turned him into a murderer. Why couldn't they have made up another character if they had to have a gun-wielding officer.",Null,2,3,24 January 2002
