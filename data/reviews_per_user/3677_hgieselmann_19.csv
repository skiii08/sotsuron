First Man," hits the nail, pleasant surprize
","I was pleasent surprized that this is no cliche tough guy action hero movie. a very nice contrapoint to the right stuff, great acting, specially of gosling and foy. much better direction than in lalaland. good pacing, i like the natural look and sound, though the atmos mix is a bit thin. definitely one of the best movies of 2018 and should have won more oscars. foy should have gotten at least a nomination. the real exploration is the one about the emotional rollercoaster of this project, and this is what the film does very good.",8,1,4,9 March 2019
The Irishman," just skip the first half with the cgi dinosaurs
","They just overdone it with the digital botox, especially on deniro in the first half of the film. I felt like I was watching some sort of jurrassic park. deniro and pacino only start to act and stop looking like some computer game avatars in the second half. pesci us just a shadow of himself.the script is rather bland, boring story watching grumpy old men. the characters dont open up to the audience, theres is always too much distance. boring dialogues without tension. women actually dont play any role.scorsese should have cut the first half and shorten the movie to 100 minutes, ir produce a mini series.",2,70,142,28 November 2019
The Hateful Eight," a bit uneven, but even a medicre Tarantino still quite good
","I think Tarantino made the best from the script he could. Great characters and great cinematography, though I would have liked Moricone to write more music. The decision to add additional songs wasn't that god. The pace is a bit uneven, as in Deathproof. The first half has a great build up. Sure its just talking, maybe a bit too long, but its a really nice introduction of the characters. Second part is like a bloody remake of reservoir dogs. Everyone shoots everyone and then all are creeping in their blood. Whats missing is this typical Tarantino twist. Sure we have the felatio and the surprise from beneath, but thats not enough for a 3 hours movie. It could have been better and Tarantino showed in his other movies that he can be more creative. This is a homage film. Off tarantinos 8 movies I would count this on place 6, just behind Jackie Brown and in front of reservoir dogs. Fans will like it and shall watch it on the big screen in cinema. Those who aren't into Tarantino might find it a bit boring.",7,0,7,4 February 2016
Gettysburg," a pathetic mess of a propaganda movie
","As Gettysburg tries to be very accurate on what happened on the battlefield when you look at the formations, historic weaponry, correct uniforms etc. it utterly fails to show the psychological 'cracks', the inconsistencies, the doubts that every participant in a war always has. Even when the men are exhausted and deadly wounded, there is always a general in this film with some heroic words that can keep the moral of the troops up. Under the utterly heroic tunes of the pathetic soundtrack you see thousands die, just to make a few hundred meters on some grassland hills. Nobody deserts, nobody goes crazy by the horrors. This is as glorifying as the Riefenstahl-Movies in the 30s.This might work for civil war romantics, but as a propaganda movie its a bad one. Its at least two hours too long, badly edited, it has no tight rhythm and only alternates between overlong large battlefield scenes and heroic speeches on both sides.So I think the only ones I would recommend this are film-buffs and historians, who are interested in how even badly made propaganda movies about the civil war get so much praise from their fans.",2,2,11,27 February 2018
Interstellar," Why Mr. should release a shorter Directors cut
","So I just watched Interstellar now for the second time on blu-ray, and I think I have an idea, why there is a big hole in the movie and how it could be avoided. On the extras of the bluray they don't stop pointing out how scientifically accurate interstellar is, but at one point they throw all logic over board, and I don't mean the trip in the black hole. Its just after they leave the worm hole and consider which planet they should visit first. They go for the one thats closest to the black hole and were time runs 60.000 times as slow as on earth. thats one hour in seven years. But if this is known to the crew, wouldn't everyone go for the other planets first, even if it would take months to get there? secondly if the time on the planet runs so slow, wouldn't the gravity be several magnitudes higher, so that nobody could walk around there? and would time go as nearly as slow in the capsule in the orbit as on the planets surface so the left behind crew couldn't grow old so quickly? My solution for this problem is, just cut out 15 minutes where they visit the water planet, re-film a short sequence in the capsule where they decide to go to the ice planet first and everyone is fine. The could explain that murph got old just by explaining that time slowed down for them when they passed the worm hole. By cutting out the water planet, Intestellar would lose its largest logic hole, would get a bit more focused pace and make it to the end credits in 150 minutes. another thing is the use of the imax camera. it produces magnificent pictures and the mobile version was even small enough to film inside cars. but why didn't they use it for the whole film? now we have the annoying switching from letterbox to imax and back. next time i would like to see a complete scifi flick in imax.",8,0,4,2 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," a mess without story and rythm
","This is just a bunch of remix film trailers, there is no story to follow, bland actors, confusing dialouges, its missing any thrill and you lose to care about any character after an hour or so.the constant changes of places is destroying any story arc, the evil emperor is missing, so the heroes have no counterpart. the whole cast is weak, c3po has the most personality, this tells a lot about how stiff the rest is. they should have received some razies.the sadest person is carrie fisher, her digital counterpart is plain and stiff, they should have let her rest in peace.in the end this ends up as the second worst of all star wars movies, only a bit above part VIII, but that was pure trash.",2,19,27,30 April 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," just poses and fake teeth
","What an overrated moviemr malek has the poses and the fake teeth, but he cant bring across the inner feelings of the rock divathe rest of the band are just statistsboring writing and direction, very conventional, missing the dramathe live aid reebactin just repeats the same camera movements over and over again, no convincing crowd simulationthe only good thing is the poster and the trailerif you wanna watch a goog music biopic, go and see born to be blue with ethan hawk as chat baker instead.",3,2,3,1 March 2019
The Revenant," An Odyssey thats far too long and too serious
","This is a tough one, I get it. Yes I already got that after 80 Minutes. But then the movie continues to repeat 'Hell, you've seen nothing yet', but it stalls on the same barbarian level where Decaprios body has to suffer ones more. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy Zombi-Flicks and splatter movies and I love tough westerns, but the Revenant would have been better if it wouldn't take itself so f***ing serious an Mr. Inarritu would have cut this down to 115 minutes. Its just like the doctor said in 'The Marathon man': This dent is dead, there is no need to torture it anymore, I have to drill a fresh one. The Revenant is trying too much to stay at 110 % pain until the end, so that I felt numb when it came to the final showdown. It has spectacular cinematography and a brilliant Tom Hardy, but less would have been so much more.",6,7,13,12 January 2016
Avengers: Endgame," cut out the first hour and the last half ...
",And youll have a decent action flick for teenagers. the rest is pathetic and boring. juts forgettable: very foreseeable plot and a finale that borows from an american football superbowl.,3,14,20,1 December 2019
The Favourite," lantimos devides the audience
","As you see in the reviews, this is a movie you love or hate, but its not something mediocre that tries to please everyone. i find this fantastic. if you wanna enjoy some nice easy comedy that pleases the mainstream, go and watch a movie with hugh grant. yes its disturbing (but not as disturbing as the lobster and killing of a sacred deer), yes its funny (if you laugh about monty python jokes, well its not monty python but has the same offensive disturbing dna).camera, costumes, coleman and direction are oscar worthy, but i doubt that it will win, because the academy is normaly too conservative for these kind of films. they prefer lalaland (which i found just boring mediocre)",9,4,6,31 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino lost his Rhythm and Soul
","I love Tarantino movies, but this is his worst (well maybe not as bad as Four Rooms, but I count that out). Why? Its not because some people complain about a 'conservative standpoint'. I dont think that Tarantino is putting the hippies into a bad view -- Manson was a racist, so showing his family as a strange bunch of people is fine.But what I was missing about the 2 Hours and 40 Minutes was the humor of the old Tarantino movies, I missed the rhythm of the scenes, the rhythm of the dialogues, the depth of the characters, the slow burning drama. Al Pacino and Bruce Dern are wasted. For two ours its a mess of scenes that lead to nowhere, only the final 20 minutes or so he heats up the pace with a nice surprising finale, but before that? Pit has two Tarantino-like very humorous scenes, one with Bruce Lee and another one feeding his dog, but the rest lacks chemistry.Maybe he tries to copy that B-Movies he adores so much, but I think this doesnt work out, because he is lacking the drama and the humor at the same time. Many scenes just lead to nothing, they dont built upon each other, like the one with the 8-year old girl. There is no Christoph Walz and no Samuel Jackson in here and Pit -- though he is trying -- cant replace them. DiCaprio is just a shadow of himself, he cant decide where his character wants to go. If you want to see a movie about Hollywood, watch Robert Altmanns The Player or Cronenbergs Maps to the Stars instead.",3,1,4,14 August 2019
1917," Call of Duty
","1917 is a hell of a ride and for shure the best cinematography of the year. Mendes keeps the pace over the whole film and the sound editing is also great.Esthetically 1917 reminds me a lot of a first person shooter where you always follow the protagonist, each scene seems scripted for maximum thrill. its a film ernst jÃ¼nger might have enjoyed.But when you compare 1917 to films like all quite on the western front, paths of glory or full metal jacket it lacks the portrait of the enemy as a human being. the germans are most of the time absent, and when the protagonists encounter them, they are sneaky, unthankful and -deserve- to die. shure in one of the last dialogs its said that war is meaningless, but what the viewer sees is a hero that survived the stahlgewitter. so its a good movie from the crafts, but it fails when you compare it to classics of anti-war-cinema, because in the end its all spectacle, non the less.",9,1,1,7 February 2020
La La Land," most overrated film of the year
","the camera work in some scenes is quite nice, but the rest is just la la. gosling and stone don't react to each other, there is no chemistry, the characters they portrait are only looking for their own careers. stone doesn't play a talented actress nor does goslings character have a real feel for good jazz. the script is bland, there is no drama, no fervor. the main title song is good, but the rest of the songs don't resonate, also there are too few dancing scenes to call this a real musical. stone is acting weak, she shows more or less only one face expression, this is not worth an Oscar, portman was much better as jackie. Im a fan of Ryan Gosling but he shouldn't have made this movie, it will not help his image and his career, the nomination for best actor was a joke, he can do much better, eg. in the road beyond the pines.",3,10,16,7 March 2017
Joker," a solo show for phoenix where King of Comedy meets V for Vendetta
","Ill make this short. Phoenix as absolutely oscar worthy. If you like this film, go watch taxi driver, king of comedy and v for vendetta. slight complaints: the film stays a bit too much on phoenix, 15 minutes could have been cut or used for telling a more sophisticated story about the social uprise and other characters involved. but this is a solo show of a narcist character (a poor mans trump if you so will). Very strong that warner and DC went down the road to decipher the wayne clan as a bourgeois parasite of society. It was about time to tell the story about social injustices and bring this theme into the superhero cinema. this is a film for people that hate superhero movies, a masterfull deconstruction.",9,1,1,9 October 2019
Marriage Story," gets messy fast
","Acted as a typical stageplay, driver and Johansson never touched me. The point why their characters want to divirce becomes more and more pointless. The lawyers are just cliches. better watch a woody allen movie from the 70s, he observed people much better.",4,0,5,21 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a spectacle, what a mess
","technically this one hell of a ride, but the story is a mess. It gives the figures not enough room to breathe, the disappointing actors can't help either. And the cameos of the old three, well they should have been retired. It seems that too many producers had their fingers in this and wanted to include everything and please everyone, but in the end they failed. Yes, Tie-Fighters and Light-Sabers are everywhere, but the film doesn't connect me to the motivations of the protagonists and antagonists (they are laughable). George Lucas wasn't so good in directing actors either, but at least he had some good actors (McGregor, Guinness, Portman) and he didn't need to repeat himself in cameos. Its a bad remix of episode 4 that lacks rhythm and soul. Next time they should focus on one story and not try to tell three at once.",3,11,16,20 December 2015
Life," much better than alien covenant
","after the bad reviews I didn't expect much. but this is surprisingly good. Its a good genre flick, the cast is above average, the effects are gory, pacing is good and the end is amusing.the 'bad decisions' many people complain about are really minor and there have been other horror movies with a worse script. for me the most unrealistic scene was when the astronauts could hear explosions outside of ISS in space. but hey, its a movie ;)when you compare life to alien covenant, this is the much better horror SciFi film. as it has suspense and alien covenant does not. So if you're into the genre give it a go. Recommended! (and stay away from alien covenant, which was the worst in years)",7,5,9,24 July 2017
Deadpool," more conservative than you might think
","yeah, deadpool, you think he is an anarcho punk with lots of cool jokes. well think again. the story in the film is quite lame. hero gets hurt by villain. hero seeks revenge. villain takes the girlfriend of the hero. hero saves her and the live prosper for the rest of their lives. this could come from Disney, so conservative is the plot. and the most funny jokes you've already seen in the trailer. and when the hero will heal himself every time, there is no place for suspense nor drama. the mediocre rap music cant help it eithernot as funny as 'super' or 'kick ass', and highly overrated. no good sidekicks or villains, boring and slow in the middle, expected much more.",4,11,22,9 June 2016
The Martian," A bit boring and predictable
","So Scott decided to make this some sort of lighter tone adventure comedy. Thats fine, but he plays its too much by the book. 20 Minutes in you know whats going to happen the rest of the film and it follows it script. For a comedy its not funny enough, for an adventure movie there is not enough thrill and for a thriller ther is not enough drama. The Mars environment is really nice and McGuyver would have been a good fit to the story. . Its a typical US American feel good movie. Not bad, but not spectacular or remarkable either. The 3D version must have nice visuals, but the BD was too much expensive for me. A rent would have done it.",7,0,3,4 February 2016
