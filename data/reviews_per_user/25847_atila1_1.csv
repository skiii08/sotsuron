Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Tasteless, shameless and FUNNY!
","I saw the movie at the Dutch premier last night and it was absolutely amazing! Parts are so vulgar, obnoxious, racist, funny and hilarious that it was a breath of fresh air :) Sacha Baron Cohen (important to know: he's Jewish) as Borat is anti-semitic beyond belief, he even asks a gun shop owner which gun is best to shoot a Jew with. More surprisingly, the owner suggest a few guns! He also gets under the skin of a group of feminists, has fun with a group of gay men (to a senator: 'you mean the man who offered to wash me and who put the rubber fist in my an*s is actually homosexual?!') He makes fun of every religion, minority and what not, while we, the audience, just sit there, flabbergasted and amazed and constantly laughing out loud! Go watch the movie, you'll be amazed!",9,3,11,13 October 2006
