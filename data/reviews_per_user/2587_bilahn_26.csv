Ghost," Hard not to like it.
","'Ghost' isn't very subtle, and similar themes have been done elsewhere with more depth, but I say just relax and enjoy.  The best reason is of course, Whoopi Goldberg, who is hilarious and as always, very good. As for the story and the characters' reactions  not being plausible, you really need to have a little imagination when you watch movies!  I give any movie credit for not being bad, since there are so many dreary movies out there, and Ghost is not bad.",7,11,12,18 February 2002
The Mummy," Surprisingly entertaining
","I thought this was a lot of fun. A light-hearted spoof of the old serials. Alternately gross and amusing, it's full great special effects, but still character driven.  Compared to the mess of most Hollywood 'remakes' this is pretty good. Good script keeps the action going.",8,0,0,11 August 1999
Crash," Pedantic and overdrawn - not worthy of Best Picture
","I will admit right off to my bias. I loved Brokeback, and have seen it several times. I am gay and wanted it to win. I would rather see a so-so movie about something I am interested in than an outstanding movie about something I am not. And I think most people (movie critics included, except Roger Ebert who has the unique ability to move outside his own biases, even if I frequently disagree with his conclusions) are pretty much the same way. I have sat thru some pretty mediocre movies just because there was a gay romance in it. But Brokeback Mountain is one of the very best gay subject movies I have ever seen, despite some notable flaws. With that said, I tired as hard as possible to be objective about Crash. But I found it to be heavy handed, contrived, and drawn in broad stereotypical strokes. It played like one of the better TV dramas. Actually, it seemed more like a diversity training film than a real movie: 'In this section we see how Asians are often perceived as....' or 'This is what African Americans have to deal with when confronted by city police...' We have heard it all before, it is not entertaining or fresh. I felt like i was being bludgeoned with the admonishment 'Racism! It's racism! Everything was so obvious and laden with artifice. It just didn't ring true or engaging for me at all. Just about every single line and plot point in this movie is racially motivated. Do these characters do anything else? After about a half hour of this I wanted to scream 'Make it Stop!' Certainly the issues raised in Crash are extremely important, but this movie is just overdone and without finesse.On the plus side, there is fine acting and some interesting characters, and the movie is well put together, although nothing struck me as being terribly out of the ordinary. Bottom line: Crash was boring!I can only conclude that the Academy was either homophobic, was suffering from Brokeback fatigue, wanted to reward a home town movie, or maybe resented being dictated to about who the winner should be. Also Oscar often parcels out the major awards to several of the leading most deserving movies. That certainly happened this year. Most likely reason: the heavy marketing strategy of the producers of Crash. It may not have occurred to everyone that not every Academy member sees every movie. It is almost like a political campaign. And i do think some of the more conservative members refused to see Brokeback Mountain. In the end, these awards don't mean a whole lot. I am not one to play the 'we were robbed' card, but when a movie has swept thru so many previous awards, and got such an overwhelming critical response (more than Crash), wins 3 Oscars, and then loses Best Picture, you have to wonder why.There may arguably be a few 'better' movies than Brokeback Mountain this year, but it should not have lost to Crash.",5,6,12,8 March 2006
Fargo," Terrific!
","I've only see one other Coen movie (Raising Arizona), which I thought was really dumb and boring, so I was surprised at how much I LOVED 'Fargo'.  The script was hilarious, the characters very entertaining, and its capture of Minnesota culture right on. The combination of grimness and humor, the juxtaposition of how different people's lives are, was just brilliant. Frances McDormand was just wonderful to watch. I have to wonder how people who have never lived in this part of the country react to this.  Knowing all the local references made it very amusing and recognizable.",10,0,1,9 December 1998
Armageddon," Mindless Entertainment is fine if done well, but this isn't.
","I am not so elitist that I can't enjoy a perfectly mindless entertainment once in a while, if it is done well. Something like 'Independence Day' is really not very good, but at least I wasn't bored. Armageddon is just that, a total bore. Feeble humor, incessant explosions and crashes that don't even make any sense, and are just an irritation. Ridiculous plot and characters, cheap sentiment. Truly the worst movie I have seen this year, suitable only for testosterone overloaded teenage boys.",Null,0,1,7 August 1998
"I, Robot"," Much better than average
","I Robot, from the same director as the amazing Dark City, is visually amazing, with a 'look' that is arresting and unique, even if quite similar to Spielberg's Minority Report. Furthermore, Will Smith is terrific, the perfect choice I believe, with his smarmy attitude, physicality, and considerable sex appeal. (Ok - he was very hot! And we get to see some of his amazing physique.) I agree with some comments that the script and characterization is not all one would hope and expect, but I feel it is good enough, that combined with the wonderful look of the movie and the presence of Will Smith, makes for a thought provoking and very entertaining 2 hours.  The opinions on this movie seem to be quite polarized. I tend to be very hard to please, but I give I Robot thumbs up.",8,0,0,18 July 2004
American Beauty," I shouldn't have waited
","I avoided American Beauty until now because 1. I usually am less enthusiastic about mass crowd pleasers (e.g. Sixth Sense) 2. I expected a loud cliche suburban melodrama or 3. Lolita II. I was wrong.This is a wonderful movie, perfectly written, stunningly acted and very well filmed. Yes this has all been said before, but American Beauty presents in a new unique way, and that is its strength. What I liked most was that the movie was rife with opportunities to degrade into histrionics and senimentality, yet  it never happens. Like Fargo, and The Graduate (tho not quite i that class), American Beauty has a lot to say about the craziness of this world we live in. It may not be 'uplifting', but it is all true. 
While I laughed thru much of the money, I was also continually disturbed. The charcacters are complexly drawn, and just when we think we know them, we find they are not so simple, nor so neatly drawn. THe next door teenage boy is particularly noteworthy in this respect. Is a psycho freak or a sympathetic character? The last ten minutes blew me away, I was fooled by what had become, to my surprise (tho it shouldn't have) a mystery story, and I left the theater with a feeling of great, bittersweet sorrow, that is still with me. The themes, what this movie has to say, are very relevant, at least to my life.
One of the best movies of the 90's.",9,0,0,29 February 2000
Dreamgirls," Everyone calm down!
","Dreamgirls is neither the knockout sensation the large majority are claiming, nor the disaster and failure that the rest declare.It is a very good enjoyable movie, with a lot of great scenes, superb performances and singing by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, certainly a decent realization of the show and then some.But it does lack depth and a certain cutting edge, and the rest of the performances are rather bland. We certainly don't get a real feel to Motown here. Most of all it is no way in the same class as Chicago, a flawless movie, but still way above the mediocre.I guess that comes to a B+ rating for me. Do we have to be so polarized in everything???",8,3,6,2 January 2007
54," Dull, flat
","Lousy movie. No plot, bad script. Fails to capture atmosphere of the seventies, didn't use songs well, totally flat. Some acting, but talents are wasted. Don't waste your money.",Null,0,1,8 September 1998
Aliens," Quite Good, but not of the caliber of the original.
","I have been long a fan of the orignal 'Alien', but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only 'alien' movie, I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set, exciting, and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great, and there are some real scary moments.But to say this is 'as good' or 'beter' than the original--that I cannot agree with.First of all, there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed, it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar, and indeed, the ending is basically the same idea, right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien, is faster pacing, more and bigger aliens, and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.But Aliens is basically a military shoot-em-up. The original, for all its comparative simplicity, is a much more subtle, deftly constructed, and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening, while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast, more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.
I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.Aliens is a darn good movie, but Alien is a sci-fi classic.",Null,15,20,9 April 2001
The Exorcist," Was never that good, and has aged very poorly
","I am in my 40s and love old movies, and am very dismayed when I see the reaction of younger people to great old movies. I went to see the Exorcist wondering why I couldn't remember the details very well, like I can other movies of that era. Its because it just is not that good a movie. The problem, as usual is the script, its not well written, much of the dialogue is about very little. The pacing of the film is unendurably slow. That can work, but you need much tighter direction and a better script.  There is very little tension, and the direction is flaccid. The opening Iraq scene is totally lifeless.Susan Sarandon has said that any scene does not advance the plot or comment on the characters or themes should be cut. This movie breaks that rule big time - it is full of dead space- people walking,nothing happening, uninteresting dialogue.There was a long list of music credits at the end, but it seemed to me most of the soundtract was almost inaudible, at least where I saw it.I think most of the reputation of this movie comes from Linda Blair's antics, which I guess were once shocking but now are nothing more than comedy. Similar movies of this era, like 'The Omen' and especially Rosemary's Baby, are much better written and still pack some punch.I wish I liked this movie more, I really do.",6,2,6,14 October 2000
City of God," Very Disappointed
","Based on the near universal praise from critics and viewers alike and my interest in Brazilian culture, not to mention the buzz about the cinematography, I was eager to see this film, despite my lack of interest in violence as entertainment.I was disappointed on all counts. City of God seemed very amateurish to me, and I am still trying to figure out what is so great about the camera work. Done in a cinema verite style, it never seemed to rise above someone walking around with a video camera. I suppose that is the point, but it was very slack and unintriguing to me.None of the characters really got under my skin, they were merely shrill and unpleasant, and not in a 'good' way.Most surprisingly, the hype about the violence is unfounded, and I am very sensitive to violence. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing, and depraved behavior, but it was presented in a way that oddly had little impact, let alone gore. I felt like I should have been utterly horrified by the scenes portrayed, yet it came across as not credible or realistic.City of God is certainly not a bad film, and it did have some moments of genuine truth and power, most notably in interactions with various girlfriends.My overall impression of the movie: - a noble and decent attempt at movie realism in that 'cinema verite' style that does not succeed due to the lack of skill of both the director and the actors. Yes, I hear many of the actors were amateurs - but it doesn't work here.Guess I am pretty much alone here - but I will admit that I don't like very many movies made in the last 15 years or so, although there are a distinct minority that I will watch over and over again such is their quality.",5,17,36,1 April 2006
Good Will Hunting," Embarrassing sentimentality and unappealing characters
","I know I'm against the grain on this one, but I truly hated this movie to the point where I almost walked out. I had absolutely no sympathy for the Matt Damon character. He's not mentally ill, rather he's a spoiled brat who needs a slap on the face. He treats everyone badly through his own self centeredness--the point is we are supposed to believe he has changed at the end. Not to give the ending away, but he's as self centered as ever as the movie closes, and that is what I found so annoying about the story. Indeed, everything in this movie was annoying from the downbeat girlfriend to the mawkish Robin Williams, who spouts some of the most embarrassing dialogue I've ever heard. Yes, I cried all five times I saw Titanic, but this left me totally cold!",5,3,5,6 August 1998
Moulin Rouge!," Great concept, but a failure.
","I am sorry to be among the few not liking this film, as I think the concept is absolutely terrific; this is a type of movie I am very disposed to like, and there certainly was a great deal of fantastic images going on in  this film, all of which have been duly commented upon elsewhere.But the film has no soul, no heart, no authenticity. It's a whirlwind and a frenetic pastiche, and completely failed to grab me emotionally. The love story left me completely unmoved. Was there a single word of French spoken in this movie? Nothing about this film said 'Paris' to me. I loved the idea of integrating modern songs into this setting, but with a few exceptions (most notably 'Like a Virgin' and 'Gaite Parisienne'),  the results were contrived, gimmicky and awkward.  This is a computer driven film, shallow and superficial, aimed at teenagers. Too bad, as there are some great moments, especcally the opening and closing credits!  Things could have been improved greatly by a much better leading lady. But Nicole Kidman is absolutely terrible in this film.  She exhibited, in my opinion,  absolutely no charisma or charm whatsoever, and can't sing. Her part was too important to ignore. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, is outstanding. Few of the supporting cast were particularly appealing to me either. 
Style over substance.",5,0,0,27 August 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great film that must be seen in a theater
","This is such a unique movie, relying almost totally on mood, abstraction and sensory experience rather than plot, that it can really only be properly experienced in a theater, preferably with a lot of other people. It is certainly one of the great movies and I have seen it many times. But it really falls flat on a TV screen. My wish has always been that more of what is in the Arthur C. Clarke novel could have been made more explicit in the film.  Sadly, with the many in your face SciFi films made since 1968, this is not a movie that is going to appeal to the majority of modern film audiences, but any film buff must see this.",10,2,5,17 August 1998
The Graduate," A signpost of an era
","I really think you had to have  lived the 60's to really appreciate the full meaning and character of this movie. At the time it came out, this movie had a tremendous impact on young people, and looking back it almost embodies that era. Yet seeing it again in the 90's it still has an indefinable quality. I don't know  anyone 40's and up  who doesn't remember first seeing 'The Graduate.' Yes, it deserves to be in the top ten.",10,1,2,11 September 1998
The Mummy Returns," Migraine inducing
","The Mummy, released in 1999, was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. A spoof of the old movie serials, it took the old classic and actually did something new and different with it. While no masterpiece, it had wit, fun character portrayals, and took its liesurly time in telling its story, using great special effects judiciously. It was really a movie to make you smile, yet ahead its share of 'horror' and gross outs. The Mummy Returns has little of any of this, and what it does have is completely buried in the relentless barrage of special effects and earsplitting noise. Never did I imagine they could a movie more loud and obnoxious than Armegeddon or The Matrix, but they have succeeded in doing so.  The visuals are often stunning, but there is too much, and too little of everything else. For all the action, this movie is very boring. There is a story, but its hard to even pay attention to it with all the sensory overload. Brendon Fraser himself pretty much drowns in the mess, and the Mummy himself, central and rather charming in the original, is a mere decoration here. And of course they add a kid to propel the story. The best I can say is he is not as obnoxious as most movie kids.Of course, since louder, brasher and faster seems to by synomomous with quality, audiences will love it. What really mystifies me is how some critics, who are supposedly sophisticated and knowledgeable about movies, can consider this superior to the original, or even more inexplicable, the critics who don't see the difference between the two, either liking both or not liking both. As for the criticism, 'Hey its just a fun movie - not Shakespeare' - well The Mummy wasn't Shakespeare either, it was mindless but fun. This was mindless and unpleasant.  This is nothing but a vehicle  to see what could be done with the mouse clicker.BIG THUMBS DOWN.",4,0,0,7 May 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Much ado about not much
","Being a Kubrick film, there is much that is fascinating here, the climatic central scene is amazing---but overall this is a big disappointment. Overly long, ponderous and often boring. The  ultimate import of what the characters had to say did not justify the amount of time it usually took to say it!  I was always waiting for something amazing to happen, but it all pretty much wound down without much to get excited about. There is plenty of (female) nudity, but the reports of incredible sex scenes are way over blown. (Not that really matters). Had the potential to be much more stunning that it was. Too bad.",6,0,0,17 July 1999
The Da Vinci Code," OK movie, what's the big fuss about?
","The audience reaction to this movie is so polarized, and the critical reaction to universally negative, that I had to go see it just to see where I would fall. My impression is that the book is a great page turner, albeit written at a 10th grade level. First of all, I have not read the book, so I found it a bit confusing. But it was a very handsomely made movie, fairly provocative, nothing really outstanding, but certainly not bad. I haven't a clue as to the total dislike of the movie by the critics, I have sat thru far worse. I imagine to someone who had read the book, and knew all the intricacies would find it a very good movie.My partner thought it was an excellent adaptation, though of course the book, as usual 'was better.' As for the religious controversy, I'll let the religious fight over that. In my view, anything that puts organized religion in the bad light it deserves is OK with me, even if the particulars of this story are 'fiction.' I can see why true believers might not be too thrilled with it. At least no one is getting killed over it.Overall if you liked the book, I think you will find the movie very well done and beautiful to look at. If you didn't like the book, you won't. For the rest of us, worth seeing at least. All this furor going on is, to me, a tempest in a teapot.",6,1,2,21 May 2006
Titanic," Rises above mediocre script to create a very moving experience
","Sure, the script was undistinguished. If it were not, this would be one of the true great movies of all time. As it is, the visual beauty of the movie, the wonderful score, the fine acting, and the very nature of the tragedy made this an unforgettable movie for me. Movies rarely can rise above a less than great script; the genius of Cameron is that in this case, he was able to do it. I am amazed that anyone could be so unemotional as to not cry as the end of this movie. While on my first viewing, I was indeed a little dismayed that this was not another 'Night to Remeber', all this was forgotten on my second viewing as I got swept away by it all.  And I can't imagine what other movie from the Best Picture nominees should have won over Titianic. Certinaly not the very overrated and dull LA Confidential, or the annoying and maudlin 'Good Will Hunting', or the charming, but lightweight 'Full Monty.'  Titanic got every award it deserved, and did not get the ones it didn't. 9 out of 10.",Null,1,1,4 August 1998
Enemy at the Gates," Mediocre and disappointing
","Once again we see that all the money in the world thrown into a movie can't make up for one good screenwriter. This is the biggest problem with 'Enemy at the Gates', the screenplay is poor and in no way memorable. Full of stock characters, dialogue and situations, it plays more like a high-budget school pageant then a truly gritty war drama. As much as I admire Jude Law, he is very miscast in the role. He has the face for the role, but he needs to dispense of his British accent and refined ways if we are to really beleive he is a Russian peasant. Joseph Fiennes' character is underdeveloped. The love story is merely an annoying distraction, tho that may just be my bias. I would prefer to see this as a 'buddy' picture or even more. The electricity generated between Fiennes and Law often suggest as much, and I would love to have seen the emotion between them developed more.
The battle scenes are entertaining and impressive, but more surreal than real. That could be great, but I don't think that was that the artistic intent here. Then there's the 'soul stirring' musical score. 'Sounds like Titanic.' I thought. Sure enough, music is by James Horner.Anyone who thinks this is a great war epic, hasn't seen many, but at least it wasn't dull. Indeed, the main reason I enjoyed Enemy at the Gates was for the mesmerizing beauty of the two male leads.  But it waste of their acting talents.",6,0,0,17 March 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Very disappointing.
","I expected a lot from a 'Dracula' directed by Coppola, but I didn't get it. The biggest  problem is that it lacks a strong cohesive and intersting narrative. Also, it is is diminshed by the usual one dimensional acting of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder.  The movie started out very intringuingly, and Gary Oldman as the vampire is fairly good, but the whole thing became increasingly unraveled with the passage of time. It wasn't at all scary, and although there were some great visual effects, a lot of it seemed cheep and cheesy.All in all, this Dracula was a bit of a bore.",6,1,2,17 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," I'll never understand it.....
","I am not surprised the mass market likes this very mediocre movie, but I can't understand the near universal critical acclaim a movie like this can get. I admit my own bias - I hate movies about smary kids to begin with, nor do I care for obvious sentimentality,  but trying to be objective, the problem, as usual  is the script. It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990). Are we really left with movies that go 'Boo.', (accompanied by the generic rumbling sound effect). Or are they only comparing movies to the other dismal offerings we get today (well,fair enough, perhaps). This movie was quite boring, and if I hadn't been nearly asleep thru most of it, I probably could have figured out the 'surprise.' Mainly I enjoyed the Philadelphia locales.",6,0,0,11 September 1999
The Matrix," AWFUL
","Go ahead and crucify me everyone, but I found this movie unbearably, loud, violent, unimaginative (how many morphs and person splits do I have to look at), and very boring. Unlike movies like Dark City and The Mummy which used very clever and enjoyable special effects in a relatively restrained fashion to serve a real story, with atmosphere, good acting and writing, this had people I could care less about, a story maybe I was too dumb to get, or maybe I had too much of a headache to be able to try. Without the aid of a computer, this movie would have nothing. Guess I am an old fogie at 35, this is nothing but a '.dot com' movie that I fear will be the wave of the future. I'm glad I will be dead by the time it becomes the norm.",4,2,5,27 March 2000
Braveheart," Quite impressive
","Finally saw Braveheart, on network TV, in this case for me, mercifully sanitized. It's siginificant that the movie was so good without my having to see all the gore, which I can not endure. This is a very fine movie, beautifully photographed, atmospheric and absorbing. As much as I dislike just about everything about Mel Gibson, I have to grant that he really pulled it off here.",9,1,2,13 September 1999
Evil Dead II," Not as good as I remembered it
","I remember thinking Evil Dead 2 was amazing back in the 80s when i saw it but re-watching it now it seems overshadowed by the later Army of Darkness, which is very similar in plot and intent but considerably more substantial, funny and clever, I think. If you have seen Army of Darkness, I think you may find Evil Dead 2 redundant. Both are basically satires of horror and not the least bit frightening! Bruce Campbell is an excellent physical comic actor, but he goes way beyond Evil Dead in Army of DarknessI am interested now in seeing the original Evil Dead which I understand is more of a straight horror movie.",6,4,9,27 July 2006
