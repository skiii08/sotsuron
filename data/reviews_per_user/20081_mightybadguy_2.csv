First Man," Silly Camera work from the school of JJ Camera Shake
","Well, I saw this film for free because of having friends in the editing industry so that was a plus! However as films go this missed the mark. A bit slow paced, overly melodramatic mid section, poor acting and that dreadfully overused camera-shake that just did not work. Sorry but I really would of felt ripped off had a paid for this film. 
Now this film has apparently garnered some controversy because due to leaving out many important references to the nationalist aspect of the mission. We all know why it was left out and that is to wash away any sense of American nationalistic feeling. One of the big differences in films today vs 30+ years ago is the lack of nationalism in films. Nationalism is something the Hollywood elite seems to despise and as such this film is no exception. To leave out the placement of the US flag on the moon was absolutely ridiculous. Why...because anyone growing up in that time can tell you the sense of pride as a people and a nation we had. These guys were national and world heros in every sense of the word. Everything back then had the US flag on it! Every moon landing LEGO set ( I still have mine) has a US flag to set. Having grown up where the Grumman plants were many of our parents worked there. My uncle and a number of my friends fathers worked on the Lem project. I used to get stickers and models given to me these people and they all had US flags on it! This was a very American project and a competition with the Soviets to see who would be the leader in space technology, the USA won that and we were very proud!! To leave that aspect of the film is historically and emotionally inaccurate of the project and of the time. Clearly this was THOUGHTFULLY left out to espouse more globalism over nationalism but unfortunately the film was poor regardless. I wonder of the producer/director of this film knows that much of the technology and management of the Apollo missions, Russian space missions and general rocket propulsion came from Germany and that the Apollo project was in part headed by Wernher Von Braun. 'Apollo program director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all' 
Hey Hollywood, many of us are really tired of the reboots, the poor casting, acting, silly CG, sequels and remakes. Modern films depict a dearth of creativity, perhaps due to lack of corporate risk taking or maybe constrained group thinking on the part of like minded politically correct drones.?? Whatever the reason please try to find your way back to making truly great and engrossing films on every level. This certainly was not it!",1,87,165,14 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This is really bad and things have gone too far!
","Extremely disappointing. The film had very little plot, essentially it could have been summed up in an half hour film. The battles we're lackluster; there was very little character development, and it just felt way too rushed. I think the feminists had their hands all over this one. The male lead characters were portrayed as disobedient and irrational hot heads which required powerful women to set them straight and save the day. Let's not forget to satisfy the activists by saving the space horses on a 45 minute sequence that lead to absolutely nowhere. More plot holes than Swiss cheese. Purposely created to see if this movie could win the 'who's politically correct' contest that has taken over Hollywood in regards to plot twists and surprises. Bottom line, this movie is terrible! I truly hope they fire this entire writing and directing team. Otherwise, i'm not seeing the next films. Star-Wars is dead, and I'm going to pretend none of this is cannon. Clearly Rian Johnson's only goal in the film was to subvert your expectations. Well, mission accomplished and it was disappointing!! 0 stars!",1,2,3,21 December 2017
