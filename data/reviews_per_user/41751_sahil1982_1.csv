Requiem for a Dream," Magnificent
","Disturbing as it is the portrayal of real life drug users, be it knowingly or unknowing, it just amazing. The story is well supported by some excellent music and the actors are just too good. A must see for all ppl who have or think of trying drugs to see what the effects could be.",9,0,1,23 January 2004
