Howl's Moving Castle," Great animation film!
","The production quality is first rate. I have seen Princess Mononoke in the theatre and Hauru has the same production style and quality. The background scenics are very moody and quite suitable to the environment that existed at that time. Definitely not your typical animation movie! Of course, the subject matter, too, is not your typical animation movie!The story is based on the 'dream' states we all have in animation. You can tell this as you view the movie - this one is from the heart and from real life. That's why it is so powerful and so accurate in its depiction of events and life at that time. The base story line is derived from a traditional Japanese storytelling method, which is why the events are told in the manner that they are in the film. Even though you know what the outcome will be at the start, this does not lessen its impact once you get there at the end of the film.",Null,0,1,26 January 2007
