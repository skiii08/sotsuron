Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Separates the eye-candy moviegoer from the artistic moviegoer
","First off I'd like to say I thought this installment was by far the more creative, and more enjoyable. Many people have criticized it for having drug on to long, and too much acting and not enough action. Well this clearly has separated us as moviegoers from the first installment.
In the first movie, QT fans, and a few people who just like to pick a random movie and watch it saw it first. They then reccomended it to all their friends, and before you knew it, everyone liked this movie, because it had something for everyone to like. For the action fan, it had plenty of that. For the art fan, scenes like the anime sequence, or the fight in the Japanese garden would more than pacify them. And for the fan of a great acting... I think refraining from talking about Uma's performance would be acceptable seeing as how not many people disagree when someone says that her acting in this was brilliant.But the second movie was a little different. Sure it had all the above elements, but it was lacking a great deal more in the action/eyecandy department. This movie can be compared to Pink Floyd's album 'Wish You Were Here' in that if you are the type of person that likes brilliant things, you can wait just a little bit longer for them to come out. They are both simply just a test of patience.Volume 2 has many brilliant points in it, such as the Superman dialogue, and the scene at the church, but they slow down a lot at these points, and the average moviegoer just says 'oh come on already,' but they dont really care about whats actually happening in these scenes, they care more about when the next time they are gonna see blood is. If you stop complaining and just open your ears, and eyes, you will see and hear some of the best acting and dialogue in a movie today.'But Daniel, thats not what I saw in the first one. and thats not what I came to see in this one. So where's the blood?!?!'My answer to you is, its all in the first one. If you are a Tarantino fan, or you are into a good movie, or if you care about what happens to the bride, then watch this one. But if all you care about is some blood and violence, then either rent Vol.1 again, or go pull one of the Halloween movies you have off the shelf and pop it in.-Daniel",10,0,1,18 April 2004
