Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Loses it's Credibility
","I remember seeing this film in theatres the day it came out. I am a huge Star Wars fan, not some weirdo who dresses up in SW costumes, but someone who truly holds a special place in their heart for the original three films. After seeing this movie back when it was released, I remember being utterly disappointed by it. I also couldn't think of another film that was single-handly ruined by one single character like this movie is. Yes, Jar Jar Binks has to be the worst character, not only in the Star Wars universe, but in any film ever! Trust me, he's that bad. He ruins the movie completely. And he's not even a minor character, he has more screen time than Obi-Wan and Darth Maul! Give me a break Lucas. This is really a kids movie, very childish in so many ways. I just bought the DVD's of the all three prequels the other day. They were on sale. I watched Phantom Menace last night and my thoughts are still the same. Every time a scene would become interesting it was quickly ruined by horrible dialogue or acting, or Jar Jar would walk in. Perhaps the most intense scene of the movie, the Darth Maul/Jedi fight, if absolutely ruined by cutting the scene back to Jar Jar stumbling around. This movie was the biggest letdown. Yes, I was expecting a lot, but this is a really bad movie on its own, not connected to the other three films. The SFX were the only thing worth noting with this horror show. George Lucas should be ashamed of himself. This movie has a terrible plot, horrible acting, even worse dialogue, and almost NO character development. Don't waste your time.",2,8,16,10 September 2009
American Beauty," One of my favorite films
","From the opening moments of the movie, we know Lester Burnham is going to die; we just do not know the specifics, nor do we realize how little the knowledge of his demise will detract from our enjoyment of the film leading up to this final act. Things appear to be perfectly fine in the Burnham household: Lester and Carolyn are both gainfully employed, have a large, beautiful house in suburbia, drive luxury automobiles and their healthy, robust teenaged daughter is a cheerleader on the high school squad. Yet, every seasoned film-goer knows to never trust appearances. Carolyn's career as a real estate agent isn't going well, so she's hoping that sleeping with the enormously successful real estate king will help rub off some of his fortune. Lester, on the other hand, doesn't have a career; he has a job. In fact, he has had the same job with the same employer for several years. The distinction between 'career' and 'job' is vitally important to those of us who merely have a 'job.' Sure, it might pay reasonably well, though not necessarily. A 'job,' however, is not something we envision ourselves doing for the rest of our lives and it is certainly not how we define ourselves. In fact, we would rather not respond when asked what we do for a living. It simply does not matter to us. What is worse, Lester does not have a sense of identity. 'That's okay. I wouldn't remember me either,' he responds when one of his wife's acquaintances mistakenly thinks they are meeting for the first time. Perhaps not many people can identify with this, though I certainly can. Lester and I are equally unremarkable, failing to make an impression on most people we meet. Maybe at one point in the past, or even still today deep down, we want to remain anonymous. It does have its advantages at times. It is often frustrating or embarrassing, however, and we realize this. Sometimes when people are indistinct, yet want to be noticed, they resort to drastic tactics. This is how murder sprees happen. But I digress. Rather than murder people, Lester nonetheless does take radical measures. With an unloving wife and a daughter who finds him an embarrassment, he chooses to quit everything in an effort to start over. In a quest to redefine himself, he returns to life the way it was before he was supposed to define himself. He was much more comfortable then. 'I want the job with the least amount of responsibility,' he tells the teenaged manager of the fast food restaurant at which he applies for a job. Few responsibilities, not accountable to anyone and no one accountable to him; hanging out, lifting weights and smoking pot; this is life the way it was meant to be. Unfortunately for Lester, the young man (Wes Bentley) supplying him with weed happens to have an authoritarian, unenlightened father (Chris Cooper) with a particularly strong homophobic streak. Some misunderstandings occur and trouble ensues. While this film might not appeal to all tastes, judging from the high ratings and overwhelmingly positive reviews that many people see much of themselves in the characters portrayed in this film. I know this is the case for me.",9,0,0,10 September 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Idiotic.
","It's hard to know which pejorative to open with to summarise this movie. Suffice to say that during the moments we were supposed to take seriously or be stunned by the choreographed action the people left and right of me were giggling, shaking their heads, or shielding their eyes with their hands. Sometimes all three things at once. And it's hard not to feel sorry for them: it's so embarrassing to have sit there and watch actors make fools of themselves. This movie is an excellent example of how it all goes wrong when you hire a director who doesn't premise his action scenes on real life, but on real life as portrayed in action movies. You basically get a double-dose of sickening unreality. Top five objectionable points: 1. During a hand-to-hand combat sequence, it apparently helps to leap into the air and rotate your body several times before planting a boot on your opponent's jaw. Ten times out of ten your opponent will not have ducked out of the way and despite having spun around several times for no reason, you will be able to land a perfectly accurate kick. Punching him may be quicker, but then the polaroids wouldn't look as exciting. 2. It's lazy. The movie makers have suited themselves at every turn and tossed any sense of reality out the window. Action movies were never meant to be true to life, but they knew where to stop before alienating their audience. This movie has no respect for its audience. 3. The film oozes the arrogant attitude of: 'Who cares about character development? The terrific action scenes will keep them happy'. Ahem. It's impossible to give a fig about the hero getting killed if you don't give a fig about the hero. So all suspense sequences instantly fail. 4. Leading on from that, the action sequences were *not* terrific. They were bombastic, self-satisfied and self-impressed. They looked ridiculous. You can tell the pivotal moment - you always see it replayed three times from different angles in slow motion. 5. The lovey-dovey scenes had about as much chemistry as an Arts exam. Thandie Newton has an annoying 'bloody' English accent and tries to look like one of the Corrs. Tom Cruise's slo-mo action moments could have been for a shampoo advert. Plus a plot that makes no sense, a villain who could equally have played a tax inspector, and not one - imagine - not one attempt at a one-liner. Take it from me: any movie that makes me want to get this off my chest to the tune of seven paragrpahs is not worth checking out.",7,0,1,5 September 2009
