Requiem for a Dream," a tragic journey
","This movie is a tragic journey. The writer is cruel with all the characters. It begins with an optimistic phrase of the mother: 'I know everything will be all-right' is like a dream that she hopes her son will get through his troubles, but she's about to discover that she will soon be overwhelmed by the same troubles. At the end, we see a mental and physically devastated Sarah, dreaming about her show on TV. It's so cruel. The direction, the performances, the edition and the music are spectacular. Very slow we see the disgrace growing in the life of the characters. The end is a supreme example of edition-story together for send a clear message, even an emotion: the fast cuts and scenes make you nauseas, while we see the four tragedies. Requiem for a Dream is a movie that should be seen at every school as a complete thesis about addiction and its consequences. One of my top10.",10,1,2,28 December 2002
