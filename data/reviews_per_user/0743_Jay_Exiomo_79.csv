The Benchwarmers," Ain't exactly All-Star material, but good enough for a few minutes off the sidelines
","Right upon seeing the trailers of the film, I have always thought that it would be another one of those Adam Sandler-produced films with Rob Schneider among the leads. It is; although to some extent, I found it entertaining, albeit not hilarious in a roll-on-the carpet sort of thing. As has always been said, it's good for a few laughs and that's far more than I can say for most comedies I've seen this year (although one can argue that it could be just because I was having a pretty bad morning). It's oodles of sophomoric gags and potty humor (as expected) but they managed to pull it off. The material is so ludicrous that on paper it's hard to see how enjoyable it can be, especially since you know how it's going to start, how the plot will be driven, and how's it going to end. But, so help me, I ended up liking the end product.The movie starts with nerdy Nelson playing baseball with his friends on a diamond when a team of bullies picks on them. Landscape artist Gus (Schneider) and newspaper boy Clark (Jon Heder), who happens to be nearby, chase the bullies away. Together with Richie (David Spade), the three of them play ball but soon, the bullies return demanding that they leave. Gus challenges them for the right to the field, and the three friends win. This impresses Nelson's father Mel (Jon Lovitz), a billionaire, and subsequently holds a single round-robin wherein their team, The Benchwarmers, will battle it out with all the little league teams in the county, for the right to a new multi-million baseball park he's built. Yeah, right.Granted, pratfalls aren't necessarily a constant source of humor. But somehow I had this perverse pleasure from watching Heder's clumsiness and Spade's deadpan humor during their training with Reggie Jackson himself, and the actual games. Heder's Clark character hits the same spaced-out note as he always does, but he's still pretty funny in a non-irritating way. Schneider is laid-back here, which goes against his usual style.The real surprise, however, is that a movie with such obviously low intentions would play its cards right with director Dennis Dugan and writers Allen Covert and Nick Swardson managing to keep the film from being a total frenzied hodgepodge of witless humor whose only purpose of being there is to stretch the running time. There's nothing groundbreaking about it nor it is something special that you should rush to see it in theaters. But I found it entertaining and I had no regrets seeing it. Then again, I was having a bad morning so I may be wrong.",6,0,0,31 May 2006
Angels & Demons," The Bernini Code
","A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by 'Angels & Demons', the follow-up to the ludicruous 'The Da Vinci Code', where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.Actually a prequel of 'The Da Vinci Code' novel, the events in 'Angels & Demons' is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.Lecturing and pontificating, 'Angels & Demons'' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist. Maybe Dan Brown has seen way too many classical art.",5,12,22,14 May 2009
Walk the Line," Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Cash!
","Johnny Cash gets the big screen treatment a year after Ray Charles. I must admit, though, that initially I had reservations about this film. Honestly now, I feel that it's very much the kind of film we're subjected to every now and then. You know, that based on a true to life story of someone who rose to top after being down that's bound to jerk the tears out of you.So somehow I entered the theater having the wrong expectations but went out getting a different impression. Yes, considering its Hollywood nature, it can be manipulative at times and it still has to follow a certain formula, but director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted,' 'Identity') manages to make 'Walk the Line' more than its narrative of a celebrity who stumbles and rises up again. It's a film featuring superb performances and some nice crooning.As I've said, 'Walk the Line' is the story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). It follows his childhood days in rural Arkansas, through his early music career, through his obsession with future wife June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and through his inevitable downfall.Of course, the thing with biopics is that if you've seen enough of the genre you'll presume you'll know how the story will unfold up until the credits and then you can figure out the theme of life-affirmation. But that's hardly fair with the point of the movie. The film is about the character of Cash and how his humanity has failed to cope with everything that's happened in his story. Mangold and his co-writer Gill Dennis brilliantly stayed faithful to the story of the man they were paying their respects to.'Walk the Line' is set in the post-World War II era, with culture in general and music in particular experiencing a great transition. It's underlined with a cinematography that borders on retrospective. There's one gorgeous shot during one of Cash and his band's performance which I think was done somewhat in high contrast, and it added a touch of sophistication and subtlety to the scene. It's this great use of technique that gives the film its emotional impact.Of course, no review of the film is ever complete without saying something about the performances of the leads. Honestly, I think this is Phoenix's best performance to date. His authentic portrayal of the legendary singer is complemented with great crooning and such a delicate tenderness. Witherspoon's performance gives soul to the film, and her understated voice is a joy to listen to. She proves how talented actor she is and that she's more than the roles she usually plays.In the end, I liked it. It's still formulaic, but not in the same vein as most of its predecessors have gone through. Fans of Cash may be glad to know that Mangold has brought them their idol's time of his life with a film filled with nice writing, brilliant direction, and great acting and singing.",8,4,6,1 February 2006
The Incredible Hulk," More blam, less blah
","I may be in the minority here, but I did like Ang Lee's take on 'Hulk'. I appreciated how it chose to be introspective and how it traded off much of the action for character study of a tortured individual. But I also know that such attempt, however earnest, seems more at home with art theaters and film festivals (or at least with late year releases) than with mainstream theaters in summer packed with audience looking for nothing more than a big popcorn movie. Thus, this immediate reboot of this Marvel comic book franchise.Now helmed by 'Transporter' director Louis Leterrier, 'The Incredible Hulk' completely ignores the existence of the 2003 film - heart, introspection and all - and goes for a more action-packed route. It's what fans are clamoring and the film delivers in that regard - it's definitely bigger, faster, and stronger.Edward Norton now plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who exposed himself to gamma rays during an experiment gone awry, and now turns into a rampaging green giant when angry or overexcited. Now he's on the lam because the father of his flame Betty Ross (a wooden Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt), wants what's inside of him to build a team of superhuman soldiers. When General Ross tracks Banner in a Brazilian shanty town, he sends eager test subject Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to chase Banner and bring him back. More colossal action scenes and nods to the Marvel Universe ensue.Despite the low risk approach and a pretty much straightforward plot line, 'The Incredible Hulk' has its merits. The film clocks in at less than two hours and for most of its running time, it manages to be entertaining. The CGI is serviceable and Edward Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, though with the script's lightweight treatment on his character, much of the inner conflict is gone and non-action scenes are more of obligatory fillers Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn are too eager to be done with. Incidentally Norton, who is reported to have done rewrites with the script, is unhappy with the final cut, but then...I'm not going to be hypocritical and say the absence of profound inward contemplation made the film less enjoyable. It does, to some degree, but all things considered, 'The Incredible Hulk' has everything a fan of the series could ask for a summer movie: more smashing and less talking.",7,2,5,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," So what is the 'rabbit's foot' anyway?
","'Mission: Impossible III,' the latest installment of the blockbuster movies which in turn were based from a TV series, is for those looking for a way to start off the summer season at the movies. Here is a movie filled with action and nothing more. There are the usual: Tom Cruise running and getting banged up, high degrees of improbability, explosions, gadgets, the whole shebang. Still, 'M:I:III' is a fast-paced thriller that manages to get hold of you for the 120-minute span of its running hour and never lets go.After retiring as Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team leader to lead a 'normal' life with his fianceé Julia (Michelle Monaghan), Ethan Hunt (Cruise) returns to the team to help recapture criminal arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has escaped from prison and is now making life difficult for the IMF. As for Hunt, his encounter with Davian has upped the ante for him: he not only has to save the world now, he also has to save the woman he loves. Cruise (either you love him or you hate him) still fits into his role well, and Hoffman, who has just won an Oscar for his portrayal of Truman Capote, also effectively displays a chilling seriousness to his villain role. The rest of the cast - Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Michelle Monaghan, etc. - all give nice performances.It's a given that this film would offer little in terms of intellect or depth in the script. Yet the way director J.J. Abrams and his co-writers injected humor and emotions, plus how its action scenes were superbly handled, save 'M:I:III' from becoming just another passable popcorn movie which is why I liked it. It is a film intended solely for the purpose of escapism and it achieves that purpose. Although there is a feeling that it could have been more, it easily surpasses the first two 'M:I' in an explosively stylish way.",8,282,432,3 May 2006
Marie Antoinette," Hollow sweetness
","Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' is, to some extent, the equivalent of having a plateful of fancy cake for the entrée. It's delectable up to a point, and then it's gastronomically exhausting and you're left craving for the real meal following an induced sugar rush.Based from Antonia Fraser's biographical account of the French Queen, the film follows Austrian princess Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), who at 14 is sent to France to marry the dauphin Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Detached from those around her and confused by her situation, Marie soon is thrust into a world of scandals, including one with King Louis XV's (Rip Torn) mistress, Madame du Barry (Asia Argento). Upon the king's death, her husband ascends to the throne and she soon goes on a shopping spree, subsequently becoming France's leading fashion icon, while the rest of the country is left to complain of this royal overindulgence. And rumors just grow more rampant. Like why she and King Louis XVI can't have a child, and her alleged affair with Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan).'Marie Antoinette' works well as a visual feast as it employs authentic subset of the Versailles environment fortified by the deluxe production design and glazed cinematography. Another intriguing aspect of the movie is its anachronistic soundtrack that blends 80s New Wave with Baroque music. It's a far-out approach to a period piece that might have turned off a whole lot and could have played a major part for the boos.Still the non-conformist style of film-making works as the film plays out as less than a history lesson or a social commentary than a testament of the director's apparent attraction to confused female characters thrown into isolation. The main problem of this film, though, is that ironically, while Coppola tries so hard to put the main character in a subjective light, the exposition leaves much to be desired emotionally. After the first hour, the movie drags and becomes hasty with less historical discourse. Ultimately, the film becomes anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Dunst perfectly captures both her title character's inanity and restraint. Likewise, Schwartzman achieves in providing an introverted awkwardness to the inert King Louis XVI. And in a cast dominated by underused characters, few barely stand out, like Argento, Torn, and Steve Coogan as th Austrian diplomat Count Mercy d'Argenteau.'Marie Antoinette' had the potentials of a great film if the main character had just been fully realized underneath the sweetness of it all. An occasional cake indulgence sounds good but too much of it just isn't enough.",5,0,0,1 November 2006
United 93," Taut drama that's as brilliant as it is disturbing
","There could hardly be a film more distressing to watch than Paul Greengrass' 'United 93,' the writer-director's cinematic cogitation on the grim events that unfolded in perhaps the bleakest day in America's history. It certainly isn't an easy subject for Greengrass to tackle, or for any filmmaker for that matter, especially considering the post-9/11 sensibilities of the audience. But the director of such films as 'Bloody Sunday' and 'The Bourne Supremacy' delivers the story of that day in a no-nonsense manner giving the film its brilliance, yet ironically also making it hard to bear.On September 11, 2001, four American commercial planes were hijacked as part of a coordinated terrorist attacks upon the United States. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York, and one hit the Pentagon. The fourth one, the United 93, crashed in southwest Pennsylvania, over a hundred miles off the target - Washington, D.C. - as passengers and members of the flight crew tried to fight the hijackers and regain control of the plane. Of course, in the end no one survived and it's what makes the film all the more harrowing.Greengrass' direction is virtually flawless. He paces the film in a way where amidst the constancy and familiarity prior to the events is a building of trepidation when the horrific events start to progress as soon as the cards are laid and all bets are off. It's heartbreaking as it develops, yet still holds our attention even if we already know the tragic fate that awaits. The director's trademark hand-held camera-work underlines the confusion and chaos that reverberates throughout the film, which is shot in a pseudo-documentary style. As he stages each act, he not only lets us see what happens; he brings us there and then. The scant use of music and the fluidity in presenting scenes from FAA headquarters, air traffic control in various cities, and from United 93 itself, contribute to the atmosphere enveloped in paranoia.The script has also taken the right approach in presenting its characters, for in matters such as this, ambiguity is more effective than providing absolutism. Greengrass generates sympathy for the doomed airplane passengers without a mawkishly sentimental effect. We know just enough of these people for them to remain ordinary in spite of the circumstance. Of course the decision to cast mostly unknown actors help in creating the tension. The cast members' subtle performance are genuinely gripping and as we delve into their characters' despondency, we sympathize with them. We feel their fears. By the time the end abruptly comes, so do we realize how fleeting life was for these people.'United 93' is an excellent film. It is more of the director's somber rumination of the events rather than a solid popcorn entertainment because this is definitely not an escapist fare. Neither will it be easy for a lot of viewers to warm up to the movie. It presents brutal facts only a willing mind can take but ultimately rewards those who see it with a provocative and rewarding experience.",10,3,7,5 July 2006
Deja Vu," Not so much a science lecture than an old-fashioned crime thriller
","'I don't know how a cellphone works but I know how to use it,' says Denzel Washington's character at some point in director Tony Scott's latest project - the thriller-slash-sci-fi film 'Deja Vu.' In a way, it mirrors much of the film's requirement for the audience's high level of suspension of disbelief; because as far as plausibility goes, Scott and screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio care less about the details of theoretical physics to make a scientifically sound premise than to provide a fresh twist on the cinematic staple car chase. This is still a Jerry Bruckheimer-funded movie, after all.The movie starts with various people, mostly members of the US Navy, boarding a New Orleans ferry. At this point the movie runs for a little over ten minutes without much dialog - only snippets of randomness showcasing a relatively muted Scott-style editing. However, a few moments after departure, the ferry explodes and ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) gathers enough evidence from the crime scene to rule out an accident. Moreover, the discovery of the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) near the crime scene virtually suggests foul play and leads Carlin to discover that he had previous contact with the victim although he can't remember it.FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) then enlists Carlin's help in investigating the case by introducing the latter to a device that enables them to look four days into the past, trying to obtain any information that might help in pinning down the suspect - in the process spying on Claire, and doing an unorthodox mad chase scene across the highways of New Orleans. (How unorthodox? Let's just say Carlin is chasing the past. Yeah, terrible pun. Sorry.) As with any films toying with space-time continuum, 'Deja Vu' suffers from plot holes resulting from the inherent paradox of the subject. But Scott and the writers wisely keep the proceedings lively by infusing the film with genuine tension and the fact that the audience isn't required much to mull on the specifics. Scott also exercises restraint in his usually artistic overindulgence and it results to a hearty old-fashioned crime thriller wedged somewhere in the pseudoscience mumbo jumbos.Washington, as usual, provides a solid presence for the film although his performance is a step down from the earlier 'Inside Man.' But his conviction for the case, along with some able support from Patton, makes it easier for the audience to go along with the story. Jim Caviezel as the villain, Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, and a bunch of others are merely drifting along, though.There were times when 'Deja Vu' felt a little too long even by Jerry Bruckheimer standards but overall it's a satisfying experience. Like Carlin, I couldn't care less about intrauniverse wormholes but I sure know how to appreciate it in what could be its most practical application this time and age: a decent device for putting a new twist to an otherwise standard crime thriller.",7,1,2,17 January 2007
Kung Fu Panda," He's more than a talking cute panda, seriously
","Outside the 'Shrek' franchise, Dreamworks Animation didn't really have much in the way of memorable animated films (even 'Shrek the Third' fell into the traps of mediocrity). And while its latest product 'Kung Fu Panda' doesn't introduce a groundbreaking chapter in the history of animation, this animated film directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson provides a solid entertaining hour and a half.Set in a fictional ancient China populated by animals, there's Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black), a die-hard kung fu aficionado who works in his father's (whose being a goose is never really explained) noodle shop. He dreams of one day seeing the temple head monk Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) crown one of kung fu master Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) apprentices - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Snake (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) - as the Dragon Warrior to stop prison escapee Tia Lung (Ian McShane) in his quest to lay waste their land in quest for greatness. A series of events lead to Po being chosen as the Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of the apprentices and the frustration of Shifu, who's now tasked to train Po to fight Tia Lung, which seems an impossible task considering the Panda can't even bend to see his toes.Where the story's headed is pretty much obvious with all the trappings of kung fu and sports movies. But its message doesn't come across as mawkishly sentimental and its humorous and light tone keep the proceedings fluid and at ease. The animation is competent and nicely rendered. Also, at 90 minutes, it also doesn't overstay its welcome.The voice cast is commendable, particularly with Black and Hoffman. Black perfectly provides a comedic geeky quality to kung fu-obsessed Po while Hoffman lends an authoritative facet to Shifu. Chan, Jolie, and Rogen don't have much speaking parts and are only there perhaps for the star value, since anyone else could have performed their parts.I would have to admit that I didn't expect much of 'Kung Fu Panda' since haven't we all had enough of animated talking animals. And maybe that worked for it since the film delivers the laughs and the cuteness in a much needed respite from a grueling work week.",8,2,3,7 June 2008
Star Trek," Gravity is too strong to resist
","Admittedly a newbie as far as the 'Star Trek' lore is concerned -- substantiated by an admission that my acquaintance with the iconic sci-fi is limited to the ubiquitous pop culture references ('Beam me up Scotty!') -- my accession to J.J. Abrams' re-imagining/re-boot/re-whatever of Gene Roddenberry's interstellar mythology is almost of a purely virginal viewpoint, a perspective that should supposedly raise eyebrows among Trekkies for the liberal interpretation done with this franchise restart. Nevertheless, in 'Star Trek', for all the acrimony to hardcore fans that it might stimulate, Abrams acutely goes for less than a self-conscious nod to its highly esteemed source than a crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster with a broader appeal, typified by its decision to bypass its predecessors' heady issues and moral dilemmas in favor of peachy visuals and aggressive storytelling, resulting to a spectacle that dazzles and a ride that only purists and the most churlish wouldn't cotton to.Years after the death of his father trying to save his starship's people, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) grows up to be a rash hotshot squandering his life away in the cornfields of Iowa, where he is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join Starfleet Academy and follow in his father's footsteps. This brings him face to face with Spock (Zachary Quinto), a smart-ass once bullied for his half-human, half-Vulcan bloodline and from here, it pretty much hovers around establishing the relationship between these two while readily introducing other characters into the fray: Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Scotty (a marvelously cast Simon Pegg).It's to Abrams and screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman's credit that the film zips along through gripping action scenes while still accomplishing to have its actors breath life to their roles, as embodied by Pine and Quinto's soulfully vulnerable rendition of their iconic characters, the same amalgam that has made the Abrams-directed 'Mission: Impossible III' and Abrams-produced TV shows 'Alias' and 'Lost' work. It's a thrill ride that eschews whatever social undertones its previous installments allegedly dearly hold on to, instead going through a candid space opera, a zippy galactic adventure that gravitates one in and makes it, well, futile to resist.",8,9,24,8 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Ship's in for a draining trip
","Disney struck gold three years ago when they first released 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,' which ended a long slump for films about pirates. So it's only a matter of time before sequels followed. And because the ship ain't broke, no major fixing was done. Everything from the first film was there: from the amusing one-liners to the excellent special effects here and there. And yes, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are all in a second go for a ride, including director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. In short, everything that made 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' a work of entertaining summer fun was there. Except for some.Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) are about to be married, but no sooner than the movie had begun when they are arrested and condemned to death by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). But Beckett offers a reprieve for Turner if he can give him Jack's compass (a compass that points to one's true desire).Meanwhile, Captain Jack is warned by 'Bootstrap Bill' Turner (Stellan Skarsgård) - Will's father - that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is set to settle a debt Jack owes the ruler of the sea and captain of the Flying Dutchman. Jack must find a way to pay his debt to avoid serving Davy Jones for a long time. So we have Will after Jack's compass, Jack after Davy Jones' heart hidden in a chest buried somewhere (hence the movie's title), Elizabeth after Will, Bootstrap Bill after the safety of his son, and former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) after Jack to reclaim his lost honor.Therein lies the movie's problem: it didn't quite work the second time around (for me at least, because as we all know, this film shattered a lot of box-office records in its first weekend run). The first one was thrilling, funny, and entertaining, albeit in a Jerry Bruckheimer-flick kind of way, which is turning your brains off. The sequel is still exciting, humorous, and entertaining. But unlike the first installment, 'Dead Man's Chest' lacks focus. The overstuffed storyline might have seemed reasonable in pitching the story before it's green-lit but it comes across as similarly confusing and confused. Verbinski isn't exactly a household name in terms of big movies, but his work in the first film (and in 'The Ring' to some extent) clearly shows he has a knack for escapist film-making by crafting the picture in a simplistic but enthralling enough manner that didn't hinder the characters, the action, or the adventure. It also seems that the scriptwriters tried to take everything in the first film and bloat it exponentially.Some of the action scenes seemed a little otiose and without neither reason nor rhyme, which stripped it off of a sense of urgency that made the first film thrilling in the first place. And granted that the special effects were of visual caliber my academic daydreams are made of, it feels like virtually every aspect of the original is rehashed and then geometrically pumping up every detail into something bigger. I'm actually a fan of the first film (not a big fan, but a fan nonetheless) but 'Dead Man's Chest' is just turgid in every sense of it. Only the still likable cast (Depp made a lot of college girls in the audience swoon) and the prevailing fact that Verbinski proves to be more effective at delivering pure popcorn flicks recently than the likes of Michael Bay and Rob Cohen keep this film barely afloat.'Dead Man's Chest' film has all the things that made 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' work, and yet the paradox of it all is that while it's crammed, it feels lacking in the end. Partly, of course, due to the blatant come-on for the third 'Pirates'. Still, this second ride's more exhausting than thrilling.",5,1,2,12 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Not perfect, but good enough to start a potential franchise
","I admit I have never read a single 'Narnia' novel (although I've read a few chapters of C.S. Lewis' 'Mere Christianity'), but I did get excited about 'The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe' getting its cinematic treatment considering the great awe I had for the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, of whom the author of the novel it was based on - J.R.R. Tolkien - was a good friend of Lewis.The first part of what could be a new installment in the fantasy genre tells the story of four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - who are brought far away from London to an old country house to escape the perils of World War II. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy stumbles upon a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an otherwise empty room. She hides inside only to realize she is transported to the perpetually snowing land of Narnia, a land where animals talk and the evil White Witch rules causing the winter spell.Soon, all four of them get to enter the land and they learn of Narnia's history: the great lion Aslan is the true guardian of the kingdom and has been absent for many years but is 'on the move again.' It is also prophesied that when four children are to take the throne, the witch's powers will fail.As I've said, I've never read the book and was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the movie, other than it was set in Narnia, that there was a lion, there was a witch, and there was a wardrobe. And from the plot summaries at the back of so many versions of the book, I also knew there were four children. But after watching it I'm now thinking of catching up on what I missed on my reading list during my childhood years. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' presents a variety of messages, both within the Christian context (which should be obvious) and the world in general.I don't know how much liberty was done with the book but I like the direction director and co-writer Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely took the audience on. Adamson has accomplished to retell a story that includes talking lions, beavers, foxes, fauns, centaurs and other fantastical creatures which could have been otherwise ineffective, and maybe even unintentionally funny. His experience with Donkey and Puss in Boots may have helped.Adamson succeeds in all this while the script provides it with humor. It is also filled with impressive visuals, peppered with good soundtrack. The film also boasts of first-rate CGI but unlike 'King Kong,' where CGI was used in an over-indulging fashion, Adamson uses it to perfection. Through all this, he works with a cast of mostly first-time actors, especially the children. The performance in particular by Georgie Henley as Lucy, is sweet but never cloying. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch provides menace to her character.I think it has enough charm and enough depth to stand quite well on it's own. I guess it depends on how the viewer will react to the thematic story beloved by many (unread by me) in this Disney interpretation. Perhaps a lot of people will be inclined to dismiss it, partly because the religious theme may turn them off, partly because they hate Disney, and partly because fantasy is just not their thing.While I would not say this movie is better than other fantasy films of the contemporary era, it certainly does bring a positive outlook for what's to come to the series or even to the whole genre. 'Lord of the Rings' has attained such great heights and even the 'Harry Potter' has elevated itself so much that, personally, this first installment of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' finds itself a little wanting. Still, it is well-made, and that says a lot for a first installment... that is, if it IS the first installment.",8,2,3,8 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Still cool but less solid the second time around
","Manny the woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Dennis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger embark on yet another journey in 'Ice Age: Meltdown, 'the sequel from the 2002 blockbuster by Blue Sky Studios and released by 20th Century Fox. This time, ice is melting and a great flood is threatening to drown all animals in the valley in three days, much to the delight of vultures who are keen on having a buffet with the bodies of those who will be unfortunate enough not to outlive it. The only way to survive is to get to an 'ark' at the other end of the valley. Along the way, they meet Ellie (Queen Latifah), perhaps the only other mammoth left aside from Manny, but unfortunately, thinks of herself as a possum, with her 'brothers' Crash and Eddie (Sean William Scott and Josh Peck... who's who, I don't know because I never got to track their names).'Ice Age: Meltdown' is, first and foremost, the inevitable sequel. And while it is still an enjoyable movie, it's very clearly more, or less (depending on how you would look at it), of the same. It still follows up from the first one, but all in all it feels that there wasn't enough material to hold a full-length movie that the character of Scrat has been given more screen time even if what he does trying to get his acorn doesn't advance the plot at all, albeit helping the film reach barely an hour and a half. While this movie still does manage to amuse from time to time, on the whole the plot feels more obligatory and jokes seem to be a little bit more blunt.That's not to say 'Ice Age: Meltdown' is a total waste because it does still have a few aces up its sleeve. Latifah brings a brilliant performance on her character Ellie, as are Scott and Peck on Ellie's two 'brothers.' And while much of the first two parts of the film lags, it builds up during the climax and from there never lets go. The animation looks quite excellent as well.It still has enough wit and laughs to support it most of the time but it's really much more of a standard film than the first one, and the animation genre in general doesn't reach new levels with this. Still, it's one of the better sequels there is, and it's a cool way to start the summer (in this side of the world, that is).",6,55,88,29 March 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Claws of fury
","Like its titular hero, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' goes by through its rote proceedings with such single-mindedness in removing any hint of mystery in a comic book character whose enigma is one of his selling points. Which is not to say that the first prospective summer blockbuster this year is the worst Marvel Comics-based film there is but, while sporadically diverting, it's a tepid and shallow rendition of the mutant team's most famous member.In a quick intro during the opening credit sequence, Wolverine a.k.a. James Howlett (Hugh Jackman) and half-brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) are seen fighting together at the American Civil War, the two World Wars, and the Vietnam War, where after Victor kills a superior officer, the two are sentenced to death through firing squad but due to their superhuman healing ability, the two are simply locked behind bars. This, however, gets the attention of William Stryker and recruits the two to Team X, a special ops team of mutants assembled to kill other mutants. Their latest killing spree in Nigeria, however, racks James' conscience and forces him to leave the team and take on a new life as a logger in the Canadian Rockies under the new alias Logan, and with new girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). But when Victor kills Kayla and Stryker has an offer too hard to resist, Logan sets out to become Wolverine and sets his sights on killing Victor.From here, Gavin Hood's ('Tsotsi', 'Rendition') comic book saga pretty much becomes a frustratingly one-trick origin story, predicated to repetitive - albeit stylish - action setpieces and obsessed with flaunting Jackman's naked body and metal claws, yet neither racking up significant impetus nor a sense of grandeur throughout the episodic script by 'The Kite Runner' scribe David Benioff. While all made mildly engaging by Jackman, Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, and Will.i.am, and the much-awaited feature film debut of Gambit (disappointingly brief as his appearance may be), 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' remains a predestined narrative, an inherent prequel problem that would have been fine had the means was as fetching as the ends.",5,4,13,30 April 2009
Brokeback Mountain," An emotionally powerful film
","Based on a short story by Annie Proulx, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a melancholic tale of two cowboys caught up in the arms of a forbidden love. Helmed by Ang Lee, it looms as the favorite to win the Academy for Best Picture and Best Director Awards.Also nominated for Best Actor is Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis Del Mar, a cowboy who finds work as a shepherd one summer up in the grandeur of Brokeback Mountain. Working with him is another cowboy and a would-be rodeo competitor Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and their relationship grows into something more, and henceforth the film covers the fragility and superficial happiness of the two as they go on with their marriages, divorces, and dealing with their families. Twice a year they go back to Brokeback Mountain to rekindle what was once their paradise, excusing themselves from the rest of society as going to a fishing trip.This is a very provocative and, in some ways, powerful film that eventually stays on not only for its unconventional premise but for the way Lee superbly handles it. His reflective style obviously works for films like this. Gustavo Santaolalla gives an evocative score, composed mainly of singular guitar strums, that underlines the lush dramatic qualities of the film.Still, the strength of the film mainly rests on its well-written characters, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal deliver brave performances while ably supporting them are a cast of actors that includes Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the cowboys' wives.I liked 'Brokeback Mountain' and appreciated it as a study of the emotions of the two main characters as they go on with the aspects of their feelings for each other. It's about reality told with much sophistication.",9,26,30,15 February 2006
Orphan," Esther wants to be different but they play it safe instead
","Like 'Joshua' in estrogen, 'Orphan' not only shares its similarity with George Ratliff's thriller via featuring a precociously villainous juvenile, but also because it stars Vera Farmiga as a mother at the receiving end of her child's diabolical manipulations. Jaume Collet-Serra crafts a mildly diverting hybrid of 'The Omen' and 'Swimfan' though the proneness of David Leslie Johnson's script to adhere to cheap horror conventions undercuts whatever interesting psychological thriller about a gradually imploding family that stirs underneath.Played with vicious adequacy by Isabelle Fuhrman, Esther is blissfully welcomed into the Coleman household in a snowy middle-of-nowhere house. Kate (Farmiga), a former alcoholic still reeling from the death of their unborn third child, and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a husband with loyalty issues regarding his wife, nevertheless wholeheartedly accepts Esther as part of their family. Their adopted daughter is gleefully cordial, paints cheery images, eager to learn the piano, and -- for a nine-year old Russian who has just spent a year in the US -- speaks very good English. The mantra 'too good to be true,' however is slowly evidenced, as the titular daughter starts to react violently to school bullies and casually drops the F-bomb as if it were a customary lexicon for people her age.Embodied by John's imperious refusal to see something is wrong with the things around him to the point of being laughable, 'Orphan' ultimately plays on overly familiar genre tunes that rely too much on foreseeable shock moments and questionable logic of its characters to deliver most of its scares. Collet-Serra, despite the obvious lack of faith that the material would provide the spooks without resorting so much to shock tactics, at least capably maintains an ominous aura that accompanies his villain's innocence largely through Fuhrman's calm, faux-Manichaean scowls and Oedipus cajolery, and Farmiga's gameness to provide her character with more depth than what it's actually called for. Yet despite being ultimately entertaining and having a potential to be more intelligent, it frustratingly pursues a well-trodden path with such earnestness. 'There's nothing wrong with being different,' remarks Esther early on. Strange, though, that 'Orphan' doesn't share the same belief.",7,2,3,29 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," Cold, calculated machination
","Like a mean killing machine, 'Terminator Salvation' racks up the action scenes with boisterous gusto, but when tasked to fill in the obligatory narrative, McG's post-apocalyptic saga of John Connor delivers as much heart as a hunk of clunking metal. The third sequel to James Cameron's technophobic sci-fi series goes washed in desaturated tones and gets cheerlessly monotonous as it finds itself full-speeding to 2018, further stretching the ontological paradox between Connor and his father Kyle Reese without any attempt to inject a shred of innovation to John Brancato and Michael Ferris' script.Fourteen years after the sinister Skynet has eradicated much of humanity in 2004, John (a grim scowling Christian Bale), now leading a group of survivors in their battle against man-killing machines, is bent on using a newly-discovered radio frequency that could shut down Skynet's San Francisco base, while hard-pressed to find Kyle (Anton Yelchin), the member of the resistance who will one day travel back in time to impregnate John's mother, Sarah Connor. Joining them is Marcus Wright (dull Sam Worthington), a convict set to die by lethal injection in 2003 but mysteriously reemerges in 2018 amidst the Armageddon.Certainly absorbed by Cameron's relentlessly action-packed mythology, McG garishly sprinkles the film with nods to its forbears and achieves it with wildly mixed results -- from Bale's painfully awkward 'I'll be back' to Yelchin's somewhat amusing 'Come with me if you want to live' -- that it isn't much of a homage as it is a mere pastiche of catchphrases and trademarks flimsily bound by slam bang action sequences. And stripped of the kind of humor that defined 'The Terminator,' 'T2,' and to a lesser extent, 'T3,' 'Terminator Salvation' essays in its place a supposed human drama defined by hollow ciphers and superficial drama. The whiz-bang extravaganza and imposing setpieces keep McG's venture into the mix from being a total bust, but just like its array of assembly-line machines, once it pauses from the action and delves into emotions, one can't help but have a feeling of cold, calculated machination.",6,1,3,27 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Third go's more exhausting than thrilling
","Capping a month of underachieving third installments, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' suffers the same problem as its immediate predecessor has: it's too long and overstuffed. It's visually arresting up to a certain point but one might get a case of blockbuster fatigue long before every subplot (and there are lots) has been resolved. It's essentially a sugar rush, initially appealing, and then exhausting, finally leaving one bloated and dazed.Picking up after the events of 'Dead Man's Chest', 'At World's End' begins with a crew composed of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) journeying into the World's End, where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has been held up after his encounter with the Kraken. Then together with Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) of Singapore and other pirates that comprise the Brethren of the Coast, they set the stage for a large scale battle with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who has been determined to eradicate piracy. With Jones' heart  and consequently his service  in tow, Beckett poses a threat to the pirates' survival. Jack and the others now have to go up against The Flying Dutchman, Jones' ship from which no ordinary ship stands a chance.While 'At World's End' does the job in terms of action scenes during the climax, it does so at the expense of its running time. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is confusing and it takes too long to get to its main point with gratuitously intricate plot lines that get the better of what should have been a straightforward escapist fare. By the time the film gets to the main course, the abundant starters have already more than filled one up.It doesn't help that much of the novelty and zing of the franchise is missing. Sure, Depp has still enough verve to deliver some of the film's limited amusing scenes but the film's myriad of characters constantly yanks one out of his character that eventually, one might wish there would be less of others and more of Captain Jack (not literally though, if you get the drift). There's also not much intimidating factor as far as villains go resulting to a lack of tension, and with so much turncoats going around it's hard to actually know who you're supposed to be rooting for.As far as spectacle is concerned, 'At World's End' succeeds. But it's too self-absorbed with its own mythology, cramming so many elements and achieving little. Fans of the franchise probably won't mind; but to everyone else, it's a sorry exercise of overindulgence.And, oh yeah, you might want to stick around after the credits for an extra scene that hints, well, another go for a ride.",5,18,37,23 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Three's a crowd
","If one were to go by the rumors that 'Spider-Man 3' would be the last installment involving director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire, then it's possible that Raimi wanted to cram as much elements into this film as possible before exiting the franchise (although judging from the local crowd turnout that fell in line as early as 8 am for the opening, I doubt Columbia will be putting the web-slinging hero to rest any time soon).The jam-packed third part of the series picks up after the events of 'Spider-Man 2' and Peter Parker (Maguire) has grown confident in juggling his life between being New York's beloved superhero and a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. Oh, and he's about to propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), too.But complications arise in various forms: Peter's best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still seething with anger over the death of his father (Willem Dafoe), which he attributes to Spider-Man; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a small-time crook who has been accidentally transformed into Sandman, has been found to be the real culprit for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben; and a mysterious black goo from space has landed into earth, eventually finding its way to Eddie Brock, who has his own reasons for wanting to kill Peter, and morphs him into Venom. As if Peter doesn't have his hands full of villains that would fill up three separate graphic novels, screenwriter Alvin Sargent gives Spider-Man yet another demon to conquer: his inability to empathize with MJ that results to a falling out in their relationship.Granted, the story lines are ultimately wrapped out nicely and the issue between Parker and Osborn is finally given a much-deserved closure; but not before a shaky set-up with far too many subplots that has no villain fully realized, resulting to a lack of an emotional core that has been the main attribute of 'Spider-Man 2'. Grace's Venom, the supposed iconic villain of Spider-Man, and Church's Sandman, ultimately come as less memorable than Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus whose personality - motivation-wise - comes as more natural and believable.But despite the narrative faults, Raimi finally builds enough momentum going into the climax that features a New York showdown among Spider-Man, Venom, Sandman, and the New Goblin. He also manages to keep a consistent impertinent tone throughout, adding a nice blend of humor and special effects into the action that escalates in terms of scope.While the massive anticipation that comes prior to it - partly due to the intense marketing campaign Columbia does, but mostly due to the high standards set by its predecessor - is perhaps its chief undoing, 'Spider-Man 3' is still a worthy entry into the franchise. It's certainly better than some comic-book movies that had come out previously. While it's not up to par as its predecessor, it's an adequate movie as far as summer blockbusters go, and it should satisfy fans and casual moviegoers alike.",6,1,5,1 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Not much good going on
","Films adapted from video games generally have received flak mainly for their inability to cater to a larger audience than a specified niche among the audience - mainly teenage boys who spend their free time in front of, eh, video games. It's always a case of you either you like it or you don't.Having said that, I enjoyed the first 'Resident Evil' (I was 17 then) and marginally liked 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' (I was 19): partly because I was someone who has had an on-off affair with role-playing games (RPGs), specifically with the PS2 console; but mostly because I understood that these kind of movies required no life-affirming morales, no intricate plot, no credible science to provide mental calisthenics. Just pure popcorn entertainment and an unabashed sense of escapism for them to work. Considering these aspects, it's not much to ask.But then comes 'Resident Evil: Extinction', a third-tier installment (apparently the year of thirds hasn't ended yet) that's so painfully unexciting, it's not just comparable to having to watch someone else play the game; it's like having to watch someone play the game using a walkthrough downloaded from some gaming forum. Everything's too perfunctory and the scare factor is conspicuously several notches lower.Here, Milla Jovovich returns as zombie butt-whooping Alice, five years after the first film, when the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus has escaped Racoon City and has set humankind into the brink of extinction. Together with a band of survivors that includes a sleepwalking cast of Ali Larter, Ashanti, Oded Fehr and, pity, Spencer Locke, they cross the desert to get to Alaska, which may be their final frontier.Writer Paul W.S. Anderson and director Russell Mulcahy doesn't provide the story with any interesting characters and their treatment of the material is so half-hearted you barely feel the plot as it advances from one point to another. Jovovich still provides a solid central figure but her ho-hum action scenes can't make up for an overall lackluster film.But really, when you're a 20-something male and the best thing you can find about a zombie movie is teen actress Spencer Locke, then there's really not much good going on.",2,10,20,26 September 2007
Zodiac," Natural apprehension
","'Zodiac' is a whodunnit thriller but not in the sense of conventional Hollywood film-making. In fact, the film is more a study of the intricacies of the whole police procedure, as chronicled by newspaper cartoonist-turned-writer Robert Graysmith, than a straightforward cat-and-mouse game.Based from Graysmith's two non-fiction books that detail his investigation of the eponymous serial killer, director David Fincher ('Fight Club,' 'Se7en') pretty much sets the mood of the film early on. Henceforth, the atmosphere in the film is created and sustained mainly by dialog. After a couple of murders in the late 60s, a series of ominous letters - including ciphers - is sent to the press, claiming responsibility for the murders. The writer introduces himself as Zodiac and up to now, no arrest was ever made, nor a conclusive proof was ever acquired as to who really committed the crimes.James Vanderbilt's screenplay actually consists of two parts resulting to an overlong long movie (almost three hours) and the lack of a solid central character at times works to the film's disadvantage; but Fincher is able to deliver a constant sense of tension to the viewer especially during the first part, dealing with Zodiac's supposed killing spree and the police investigation. The performances of the actors in general are also efficient. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Graysmith, effectively brings out a nice transition of his character from the subdued to a passionate individual while Robert Downey, Jr. is impressive in a role that seems tailor-fit for him.However, the film somewhat lags when it shifts focus past halfway through and decides to ditch neutrality for faithfulness to the source material. That Zodiac remained inactive during those years may have something to do from a structural perspective, but ultimately that keeps the film from having a more intensity of effect.As a result, I won't go as far as saying 'Zodiac' is Fincher's best work. But in that he delivers the requisite uneasiness and frustration amidst the dumbing down of most thrillers in general, the end effect is natural apprehension.",8,1,2,30 May 2007
The Prestige," Nolan's sleight of hand
","The first film of Christopher Nolan I saw was his remake of the 1997 Norwegian film 'Insomnia,' and I found it brilliant. Since then I've been hearing a lot of recommendations of his earlier work 'Memento' (which I have yet to find a copy of). I was also impressed by how Nolan maintained the grit while providing intellect to 'Batman Begins.' So it was but natural that along with Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed,' one of my most anticipated films this season is Nolan's 'The Prestige.' Based from the novel by Christopher Priest, 'The Prestige' is a film that tells the tale of two 19th century magicians - Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) - who are in constant hostility as they try to outdo each other's performance. It is 1878 and Borden is tried by a London court for the murder of Angier during one of the latter's performances. While awaiting his execution, Borden starts reading Angier's diary.Subsequently, the film proceeds in a series of flashbacks. Borden and Angier start out as assistants for a magician whose shows include the risky predicament escape: Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is tied and placed in a tank filled with water and while hidden from the audience's view, she must free herself from the ropes, and open the trick lock. But a mistake during one performance cost her life as she failed to slip her wrists out of the ropes and eventually drowned.With Angier believing that Borden is responsible for his wife's death, the two went on their separate ways and become magicians as well. Eventually, Borden becomes famous with his 'The Transported Man' act and Angier grows obsessed in finding out its secret. He sends his assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to work for Borden with the hope of gaining the knowledge behind Borden's trick but backfires as Olivia falls in love with Borden.Angier then enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), who reluctantly agrees to build a machine that is supposedly set to aid Angier in performing what could be his greatest trick. What ensues is a labyrinth of twists and sleights of hand that to go into details is far too complicated. Let it just be said that the world inhabited by the characters of 'The Prestige' is eerily dark and suggestive of the supernatural.I had high hopes prior to seeing this film as I've said, and although it wasn't as great as I expected coming from the director, I still find it to be interesting and agreeably diverting. Nolan and his brother/co-scriptwriter Jonathan has paced the film clearly and straightforward. The plot's details are relatively concealed and restrained at least a few minutes before the denouement, wherein anyone who's been closely paying attention will know the sleight of hand to be employed by the filmmakers for the film's final trick.The cast gives good performances despite their crudely written characters. From the exaggeratedly scrawny guy in 'The Machinist' to Bruce Wayne in 'Batman Begins,' Bale completely inhabits a different character in every film he's in, and he's always believable. Jackman possesses the strength and the determined fixation to lend credibility to his character's motives. Johansson doesn't have much to do here but she provides a feminine touch.'The Prestige' is finely crafted movie and a worthy addition to the director's resume. It suffers a bit from its tarrying on some parts and from its inclination to spell out so much justification from the characters, but these are compensated by the superior narrative style, good performances, and the opulent sets of the Victorian era. It may not be an outstanding achievement but Nolan is deft enough to make the film's illusions seem genuine.",6,0,2,25 October 2006
Cloverfield," A clever trick but nothing more
","And the monster is out of the bag.Thickly veiled in secrecy and fueled by the hype surrounding it, 'Cloverfield' is the result of 'Godzilla' and 'The Blair Witch Project' after having a one-night stand. Without saying much, the film revolves around a group of twenty-somethings who hold a farewell party for Japan-bound Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) when a monster attacks New York City.It's a great marketing ploy, actually, and the J.J. Abrams-produced film, directed by Matt Reeves, certainly looks interesting on paper. Written by Drew Goddard, a frequent collaborator with Abrams, the film unfolds through the perspective of a hand-held camcorder as recorded by someone, mostly by Hud Platt (T.J. Miller). The first few minutes is spent introducing us to Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) waking up one morning, accidentally recorded over with interviews of a bunch of other people we're going to hang out with as mayhem starts.I have no problems with the shaky camera nor the awkward camera angles. In fact, it helps with the realism and if only for those factors, plus the clever editing, the movie works. Still, the film doesn't present itself as anything more than a cheap catharsis for a post-9/11 New York. One is smacked in the middle of the events yet it doesn't generate the requisite urgency. There are few moments of genuine tension but those fragments never form into a consistently gripping product. You hang out with these people, but you never find the sympathy to care for them, when their motivation is anchored on manipulative gimmickry and their interaction fueled by amateur acting and a hackneyed script best suited for the emo populace.'Cloverfield' is a clever trick but nothing more. It's the big-screen treatment of a YouTube video, only here the gimmick is more conspicuous, and what usually lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes is stretched to 80 minutes or so.",6,11,22,29 January 2008
Knocked Up," Funny, raunchy, and witty
","Writer and director Judd Apatow's follow-up to 2005's 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' is, while not reaching the high earnestness of the film that basically launched Steve Carrell's leading man career, still a funny and affectionate movie.Here, Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a producer for E! who just got a promotion when the unexpected happens. He meets with Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), an indolent would-be internet businessman, in a bar. They get drunk, have sex, and before long she discovers she's pregnant.Lead stars Rogen and Heigl play their roles with spot-on effectiveness and aplomb. Rogen doesn't have the charisma of Carrell, nor is his character as lovable as the latter's Andy, but he provides enough likability and immaturity to his Ben that it's not a chore at all to invest on his character emotionally at the point the film requires the audience to do so. Heigl exudes the class and professionalism required of her character, and she shares a genuine chemistry with Rogen.All the while, Apatow's script and direction fill the film with plenty of raunchiness and wit. The comedy never fully resorts to mindless slapstick. The film does run a bit too long, but you might as well be amused you won't feel it. Besides, the movie overall feels sincere in addressing the issues it tackles it's easy not to feel dirty about it afterward.",8,0,1,17 October 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Slick but hollow
","After the grand heist and goofing off (well, mostly goofing off) in Europe, director Steven Soderbergh and the gang return to Las Vegas to plan yet another scheme of a slick looking production that rings hollow and without much payoff.Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) friend Reuben (Eliott Gould) suffers a heart attack after getting cut out of a hotel business deal with Willy Banks (Al Pacino), a notorious businessman in Sin City. To get even, Ocean, Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the other compadres team up with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to bring down Banks by bankrupting the hotel on its grand opening night.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, and 'Ocean's Thirteen' doesn't boast enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time. The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict supposed to be inherent to the setup. Not every actor's back in cool form, Pacino's character doesn't come off as amusing, and the overall interaction among the characters has become oozing with mere machismo and virtually no zing that all one is really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they actors play themselves out to a climax that this time around isn't as compelling as to be a carelessly made movie's saving grace.'Ocean's Thirteen' is a rough, substandard time waster that builds upon a thread towards the payoff, yet not accomplishing anything consequential upon getting there.",4,11,34,6 June 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," The devil wears a hollow epitome of obsessive materialism
","'The Devil Wears Prada' is one of those films based from a literary source where the primal idea is intriguing, but for someone whose thoughts function on a different wavelength, the execution leaves one dumbfounded. So there's Andrea 'Andy' Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a girl fresh from college, who lands an enviable job ('a million girls would kill for that') as assistant to Runway Magazine editor-in-chief - the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep in a radically distinctive role). Hoping to get serious work as a journalist, Andy believes one year of putting it up with her arrogant boss and snotty colleagues would instantly guarantee her a ticket to the job she truly wants.Okay, so I'm not into fashion. Fairly well. That being said, I don't think it should hinder me from thoroughly enjoying the film and saying I did if I really did. After an initial parallel opening sequence, the first few minutes of David Frankel's cinematic version of the novel written by Lauren Weisberger are invigorating, with an intriguing look at the world of fashion coupled with acerbic dialog.After that, however, the predictable storyline seems to drag, and frequent detours - such as the scenes involving Andy's boyfriend (Adiran Grenier) slow the film down. It doesn't help that the characters are such caricatures of their real-life counterparts (uhm, yeah, I've heard the comparisons between Streep's Miranda and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour) that any intellectual penetration into their character leads to a dead-end.Eventually what could have been a grand adaptation is reduced to a simplistically trite comment of the fashion world where at this point 'The Devil Wears Prada' fails to live to its promise. It's not so much that this film doesn't work for me for the reason that it's about a world I don't inhabit; rather, it's because it doesn't manage to bring light to its protagonist in a way that's worth remembering. There are a couple of standard and unspontaneous attempts, but nothing that manifests into something that would raise this film to a universal level where one can really relate to. Hathaway's Andrea can't cast off her selfish facade enough to give us a glimpse of the true extent of her character and her relationship angle with her boyfriend Nate is too conventional. On the other hand, Streep steals the show as Miranda, who is, simply put, outstanding. Yeah, some bosses can be quite the devil and Streep incarnates this role so fully.This chick lit-turned-chick flick should do well with those who have read the source material (I haven't) and enjoy the performance of Streep. Still, I can't help but feel unsatiated and mull over the fact that it could've been better. For all I care, the devil may wear Chanel and it will feel the same.",4,1,2,30 August 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Unrelenting action and gritty realism effectively punctuate a superb series
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' eagerly assumes its position as not just the best in the trilogy of super CIA assassin Jason Bourne's search for his identity, but it's also hands down the best action film of the year.Just as with the previous two installments, Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to trot around the globe as he attempts to weave snippets of his memory to determine his true identity and how he is what he is. But a covert operation will stop at nothing to make sure Bourne doesn't know the truth, and will go even as far as eliminating him altogether.Director Paul Greengrass ('The Bourne Supremacy,' 'United 93') brings once more to the screen what made the first two films successful - doses of action that never lets up. From the chase scenes in the Waterloo to the climactic car chase scenes in New York, the stunts, which have been one of the main selling points of the series, do not disappoint. Here is an unrelenting adrenalin rush with the auteur's trademark gritty naturalism - the apparent abhorrence for Steadicam, rapid cuts, and unorthodox framing of subjects.Damon brings believability to his character of the highly skilled but troubled Bourne. He provides the obligatory machismo that renders him believable as one who is capable of doing what he does, while not lacking the required emotional depth to provide the human drama of his persona. Returning cast members Julia Stiles and Joan Allen give a solid support for the main character, while newcomer David Strathairn as a CIA official works as the new chief villain, nicely stepping in the shoes vacated by Brian Cox from 'The Bourne Supremacy.' Ultimately, Bourne gets his answers and audiences will finally breathe a sigh of relief. Finally our hero gets what he's due. Yet there's that lingering disappointment that it may be the last we see of him.",9,0,1,15 August 2007
Watchmen," So close yet so distant
","As ambitious as it can be, Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen' may have faithfully transplanted its source material to the big screen with all due reverence, but the overlong and overstuffed result of an intense fascination for accurate cinematic replication strips the narrative of emotional depth to mitigate the inherent shortcomings bound to constantly recur in the cinematic version of the highly lauded (and supposedly 'unfilmable') graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Snyder's craftsmanship handsomely portrays the progression of the American society in relation to its captivation of costume-clad superheroes as exemplified by its nostalgia-tripping opening credit sequence, yet this same technical proficiency for highly stylized aesthetic, of which the director has a marked penchant for, never translates into an impelling force.The stilted consequence of Snyder's overwhelming mechanisms, however, largely benefits from a premier source material that functions as a deconstruction of the superhero mythos that, through its elaborate narrative techniques, provocatively reflects on the resolute inclination of mankind to topsy-turviness. In an alternate 1985, the antagonism between the US and USSR is running at an all-time high, and Richard Nixon, serving his fifth term as the US president while basking in his dubious victory in Vietnam, has declared all superhero activities illegal. Now reduced to a vigilante, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) discovers that the Comedian (James Dean Morgan), a former superhero and colleague, has been murdered, which eventually rejoins him with other former superheroes including Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), as they learn of a binding conspiracy that spells catastrophic results.Snyder's intricate sequence of events is a favorable, albeit patchy, estimate of the graphic novel's multi-parallel narrative structure that upholds dread for the inevitable self-destruction both for its corrupted protagonists and the world at large. Yet despite the almost verbatim adaptation, it's a cinematic abridgment that overall feels lethargic, highlighted to a detrimental effect by a protracted running time that jams as much material as theatrically possible. In part, it's because of its dispassionate characters that, save for Haley's monomaniacal turn as the inkblot-stained mask-wearing Rorschach, never conveys a sense of attachment; and in part, it's because of the sporadic slo-mo-induced action scenes that are less visually dynamic than in the director's previous works. It's ultimately a fanboy-pleasing replica that serves nothing else except perhaps to further provide more groundwork to the argument that the source is better than the adaptation.",6,4,11,5 March 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," Gore galore and nothing more
","Wes Craven's 1977 flick 'The Hills Have Eyes' has just been remade by Alexandre Aja and would certainly please the targeted audience. If you're looking for hardcore gore, this may work as the film is basically two hours of sadomasochistic viewing pleasure (minus thirty minutes for the character exposition). Else...Set in an abandoned area of New Mexico, a family on their way to San Diego gets stranded among the hills of the desert. With no contact to the rest of the world, they try to survive the dangers that lurk around them, including psychotic mutated cannibals. Uhm, basically that's all.Movies of this type don't really rely on plot and characters, so it's natural for the main characters to be stereotypes of various degrees - although to be fair, the script does generate genuine sympathy for the family. The cast also gives a decent performance, with Emilie de Ravine of 'Lost' prominently popping first into my mind. (I wonder why.) Aja, who also directed the French horror film 'High Tension', amps up the gore level here, drifting over the story at a faster pace, obviously to suit the attention span of its expected viewers. And of course, logic begins to lose its grip and falls off completely behind. Thereon, heads are pierced with picks, fingers are severed, body parts are eaten, and so on.Sure, ultimately we'll all view it subjectively and there are those who will drool over this kind of stuff. Personally, I find 'The Hills Have Eyes' not total crap, with building tension and occasional scares at some point. Still, in the end it's nothing fresh either, without breaking any new grounds and nothing much to offer to anyone else. From the slashing and skewering opening scenes down to the twist, the film becomes not just a remake, it also becomes an index of clichés of the genre it treads on.",4,5,9,5 April 2006
Knowing," Cage saves the day, barely
","Nicolas Cage's strong on screen charisma and genuineness makes the actor an archetypal lead for any film that requires saving the world from an impending apocalypse, and it's further evidenced in the otherwise disappointing 'Knowing.' Like an inelegant amalgam of an M. Night Shyamalan movie and a Fundamentalist direct-to-video, Alex Proyas' end-of-the-world sci-fi intriguingly pitches the idea of determinism-versus-randomness at the outset only to devolve into a cacophonous pile of genre clichés.MIT astrophysics professor and preacher's kid John Koestler (Cage) has long abandoned his faith since his wife died a year earlier, finding solace in his firmly held belief that everything is an arbitrary result of complex chemical and physical reactions. However, on the 50th anniversary of his son's (Chandler Canterbury) school, each student is given a piece of paper that was buried in the ground by a group of schoolchildren in 1959, wherein drawn are the future as they envision it. John's son receives Lucinda Embry's (Lara Robinson) paper scribbled with seemingly random numbers, but as John closely inspects it, he realizes that these numbers are the dates of the major tragedies to have happened in the last five decades, and three more are about to take place.As he has demonstrated most recently in 'I, Robot' Proyas is a proficient director of mood and visual exhibition, yet just as with the the Will Smith-starrer, 'Knowing''s promising ideas never translates into a lucid unit, tripping into a second act filled with heavy-handed religious undertones and a grab-bag of copiously borrowed scenes from its predecessors, culminating in an oh-so hackneyed Creationist tableau. 'Knowing''s overt portentousness dilutes whatever arresting display it has, though it's all made at least mildly tolerable by the charismatic Cage who finds himself the quintessential guardian of the world that how apt, then, he almost becomes the savior of a possibly absolute schlock.",5,5,12,25 March 2009
Wanted," It has style, Angelina Jolie, and not much else
","'Wanted' is that summer movie packaged solely for adrenaline-driven audiences. It's heavily stylish, it's violent and it stars Angelina Jolie. Too bad there's not much in the way of a good original story.James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office guy who has to deal with dwindling financial resources, a terrible boss, and a friend who steals his girlfriend when he's not looking. But all those pale when a problem presents itself as an assassin who seems bent to kill him. That's when Wesley meets Fox (Jolie), a mysterious woman who saves him in a pharmacy shootout and through a mad-dash chase in busy streets. He eventually learns of the Fraternity, a group of super assassins of which Fox is a member, and of which his dad was also a member, and that whoever killed his dad is out to kill him as well. Thus begins a training led by the Fraternity leader (Morgan Freeman) for Wesley to get back at the guy who apparently murdered his father.Based loosely on a comic book by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, 'Wanted' is a no-holds barred violent article that benefits from director Timur Bekmambetov's highly stylized vision. Bekmambetov, director of the visually assaulting but emotionally distant 'Night Watch' series, shifts to the fifth gear and rarely lets up although the director's combination of frenetic action and black humor is a case of hit-and-miss affair. But all sensory gratifications eventually wear down when the 'Matrix'-esque narrative and the twist seemed to be ripped from the screenplay pages of 'Star Wars' start to wear down.McAvoy makes a perfect case of a loser for his character at the start of the film and finds a believable spot for his character's eventual transformation. Jolie is hot, and really, is there any other reason for audience to care? Freeman brings his charismatic authoritarian figure but his character becomes more ludicrous as the film progresses, which is punctuated by an amusing expression by the actor towards the end.In the end, 'Wanted' brings to the table everything you expect from a summer action movie. It's stylish but it doesn't have enough substance to back it up to keep it from being truly memorable. As my companion said, 'It's not really a failure, but it doesn't really succeed either.'",6,3,10,29 June 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Falls flat if not for the 3D presentation
","Short on a compelling narrative and real characters, 'Monsters vs. Aliens' is nonetheless an adequately entertaining endeavor for Dreamworks Animation greatly enhanced by its three-dimensional presentation in selected theaters. Which is to say seeing its resplendent visuals in 3D (particularly in IMAX) will at least partially offset the flatness of the hyper-zippy story littered with pop-culture jokes and action sequences that, though fun while they last, comes across like a bucket of popcorn that doesn't leave an impression after it's over.Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is about to marry Derek (Paul Rudd), a self-absorbed weatherman whose dreams of getting an anchor job comes at the cost of having to shatter her dreams of having a honeymoon in Paris. On the day of their wedding, an alien substance-filled meteorite slams on her that renders her the size of a small building, prompting a secret government agency to rename her as 'Ginormica' and imprison her in a clandestine location along with other cryptozoological beings such as the Missing Link (Will Arnett), an anthrophomorphic cockroach (Hugh Laurie) and a dunderheaded yet well-meaninged gelatinous blob (Seth Rogen). But shortly, a nefarious tentacled alien (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth and the US government decides that the fate of the earth now lies in the hands of the monsters they have tried to hide from the general populace for the last 50 years.Obviously a throwback to the sci-fi horror movies from the '50s, directors Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman affectionately lend a frolicsome cheekiness to the whole proceedings with arresting visuals and some humorous one-liners pumped up by the occasional rock-and-roll (and even an 80s funk) soundtrack. But inasmuch as the film is a visual stunner, it's unfortunately diluted by an overly familiar story and a moral that sounds less a genuine didactic than a target demography-pandering afterthought, compressing it into an altogether unmemorable affair that dissipates as soon as the novelty of 3D wears off.",6,3,9,27 March 2009
Jarhead," Missing some elements to really hit its target
","Sam Mendes, director of 'American Beauty,' the critically acclaimed film that brought him an Academy Award for Best Director, brings to the big screen 'Jarhead,' a movie based on Andy 'Swoff' Swofford's war memoir, which is more or less the same kind of war film we've all seen before. In it, Swoff is played by 'Brokeback Mountain' co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and the film shows in its gritty language and sardonic humor the former sniper's recounts of how they live each day fighting boredom until they go to war.Upon his arrival at the Marine base, Swoff is assigned to C Company. There he meets his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), a member of the elite Marine unit, and Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), who picks him and Troy for sniper duty. Then commences Operation Desert Shield and over they fly to Saudi Arabia. Itching for some action and increasingly becoming bored creatures in the desert, Swoff narrates their long wait while suggesting some techniques 'for the marine to use in the avoidance of boredom and loneliness.' Basically the film's first part tackles the hell of a boot camp new recruits have to undergo. 'Swoff' recounts how he was conceived, how screwed-up his life is, and how he got in the military. In many ways it feels rushed that sometimes you would like it to maybe linger in some scenes and hear more from him and the others. Some parts of the script also don't hold up well and may seem tedious to more cynical members of the audience.The second part of the film is set in the desert. The problem here is the absence of genuine tension as the film avoids much of the battle and gore in lieu of a bunch of men finding whoever they are out in the scorching desert. But there's not enough depth, and the somewhat uneven pacing of Mendes in the movie's first part tantalizes the audience with only a bit of character background. There's little emotional connection, and there is virtually nothing for the audience to root for.'Jarhead' treads very much the same area its predecessors had and without a clear stand on the theme it tackles, it appears relatively banal. That's not to say it's a bad film per se. It is a middling film with good acting and good cinematography. But coming from a director with a pretty impressive resume, somehow one can't help but ask for more.",5,9,15,18 January 2006
Ratatouille," Oui, it's that good
","In a season virtually filled to the brim with disappointing follow-up installments, Pixar Animation Studios and director Brad Bird cook up yet another winner in 'Ratatouille,' a story of a rat named Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who hankers to hone his improbable talent of mixing the right ingredients to make a delightful fare. The members of his colony don't recognize his passion, if not entirely against it, especially his father (Brian Dennehy) who constantly reminds him that humans are dangerous. But as someone who looks up to the late Chef Gusteau, Remy believes what the celebrated culinary expert believes: anyone can cook.But an attempt to prove this to his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) causes him to separate from the other members of his colony, eventually ending up in Paris, and in Gusteau's once five-star restaurant. Now reduced to three stars, it's run by Chef Skinner (Ian Holm), a collusive restaurateur who plans to use Gusteau's prestigious name to sell mass-marketed frozen foods. A series of events bring Remy and Linguini, a bumbling garbage boy working at the restaurant, together. Driven by Remy's desire to cook and Linguini's desperate effort not to get fired after a kitchen mishap, the two team up to prepare the restaurant's new menu items that has the elites of Paris appreciating the restaurant again.Soon, Linguini gets all the credit Remy deserves and Remy's loyalty to his family members are questioned, eventually leading to some sort of a falling out between the two even as renowned food critic Anton Ego is set to do a review of the restaurant.'Ratatouille' is firstly a sight to behold (ah, Paris!) and praising Pixar for it seems as effective as calling a fast food restaurant unhealthy. It just is. What really sets the studio's projects apart from other films of its nature (I'm consciously trying to keep myself from labeling animation as a genre; you know, Brad Bird... ) is how their stories successfully embed genuine motivations to their characters while adding nice blend of drama and humor, without resorting to an overkill of pop culture references.I understand Disney's dilemma, though, in marketing this film. Save for the fact that it's an animated movie featuring a talking rat, Bird's follow-up to his equally laudable 'The Incredibles' is placed in such a sophisticated setting with a tad too many culinary jargon which younger audiences might not easily appreciate. In fact, it seems it might appeal to parents more than to their kids. But it's paced well, is thoroughly engaging, and the cast provides memorable voice performances that the movie overall is a, well, delicious experience. In the end, 'Ratatouille' is a visually pleasing, touching and humorous tale that further proves Pixar and Bird a formidable combination.",10,3,4,16 July 2007
Enchanted," That good old story with a modern twist
","Combining elements of modern day Manhattan with romanticized fairy tale settings, 'Enchanted' tells the story of Giselle (Adams), your typical Disney leading lady living in a cottage, singing with innocent creatures, awaiting the day she would meet her prince charming. He turns out to be Prince Edward (James Marsden), a dashing debonair who happens to be the stepson of the wicked witch Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). They meet, fall in love in a whim, and decide to marry the next day.Problem is, step-mom wouldn't allow anyone to take over her throne so she poses as an old woman and pushes a clueless Giselle into a well that transports to - ahem - our world, where her quixotic perspective sets her apart from everyone else. Her city misadventures eventually lead her to Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce lawyer separated from his wife and trying to raise his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) by himself.While awaiting to be rescued by her Prince Edward, Giselle bonds with father and daughter, with him teaching her a thing or two about dating, and her teaching him on the positive aspects of love.While obviously an attempt to satirize the genre it carved its name on, this Disney flick helmed by Kevin Lima does it in a way that's not in a mocking manner as Dreamworks animated films usually are. Rather, they are handled with affection that makes the fairy tale angle a rather sweet and funny affair. The interweaving elements of live-action and animation blend alright and don't feel unbalanced.Of course, you can say that this movie really belongs to Adams, who with her cheerful nature, makes it easy for one to feel for her character by providing depth and giving an additional dimension to Giselle. The supporting cast pale in comparison although they do have their moments, especially Sarandon who easily hams it up during a climactic event.'Enchanted' doesn't necessarily mark a return of the old fairy tale magic conspicuously absent in recent Disney films; but it has the charms and clever wit - not to mention star Amy Adams bubbly charisma - to win over audiences outside the target demographic.",8,106,117,21 November 2007
Quantum of Solace," Entertaining, though a considerable step-down follow-up
","James Bond doesn't need any introductions this time around. Never uttering the trademark 'Bond, James Bond' line, the Marc Forster-helmed 'Quantum of Solace' - the 22nd in the irrepressible franchise starring the British secret agent - quickly goes into the proceedings with a highly charged car chase scene across Italy, set roughly an hour after 2006's 'Casino Royale.' The whole article feels more Bourne than Bond, where revenge is what drives the dashing debonair played for the second time by Daniel Craig. For the uninitiated, Bond lost his love interest Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) in 'Casino Royale.' Now, he's hot on the heels of the primary suspect, pseudo-environmentalist Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) who is one of the heads behind the international terrorist organization Quantum. With him as he luxuriously globe-trots is Russian-Bolivian Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who has her own score to settle with Greene.But where the Bourne series and 'Casino Royale' succeed, 'Quantum of Solace does not... barely. With a protracted running time and too much ground to cover, it's all about the flash, the fights, and the chases. The wit and seduction that made the franchise reboot's work is sorely missing here and all Bond is left with is a monotonous character bordering the superhuman. Kurylenko is impressive as Bond's femme partner and serves as one of the movie's high points, along with the combined performances of the cast that includes Judi Dench as M and Jeffrey Wright as a CIA agent somehow inject the much needed life to all this gaudy proceedings.As it turns out, 'Quantum of Solace' still offer some entertaining moments, but overall it's a considerable step-down from its immediate predecessor.",6,2,4,4 November 2008
Twilight," Vamp angst
","Stephenie Meyer's insanely popular novel 'Twilight' hits the big screen, dividing moviegoers into a love or hate affair. It certainly finds its way into many fans of the novel, mainly because of the mere sight of its male lead Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Anyone from the outside looking in might find themselves simply watching an angst-ridden movie tailored for the YouTube generation with blunt metaphors on chastity and forbidden love.Introvert Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has just transferred from sunny Phoenix to the perpetually raining town of Forks, Washington in the middle of the semester. She does quickly bond with a group of teens, and later on with Edward, a mysterious handsome guy always hanging out with his foster brothers and sisters and wouldn't mingle with the rest of the school population.It turns out, he's a vampire, although not of the traditional sort: he does not get destroyed by the sun (he just glimmers in the sunshine), he doesn't hate garlic, does not get killed by being staked on a cross, he doesn't sleep in coffins and he casts reflections. But he craves blood, although because his family are 'vegetarians', they don't drink the blood of humans, only animals'. Still, he finds Bella's scent so attractive that he initially fights off his feelings for her until he realizes he can't and they carry on their relationship, which eventually endangers Bella's life from other 'non-vegetarian' vampires.Director Catherine Hardwicke ('thirteen', 'Lords of Dogtown', 'The Nativity Story'), working on Meliisa Rosenberg's ('Step Up') script, actually starts the film promising enough. Hardwicke's proficiency in making realistic interactions from the daily lives of teens is evident early on, and it's the part of the movie that works. Then things go downhill from there. The script gets confusing with too many characters, dialogs become ridiculously corny and the one-note performances of the leads can't fully support the weight of the middle part. The movie is barely - BARELY - saved by the action scenes in the climax but the visual effects are hampered by the film's relatively low budget.Without its ties to the novel, 'Twilight' would have been just another one of those low-budget movies (i.e. direct-to-video) that regularly make their way to screens in this part of the world. It certainly feels like it. But it doesn't necessarily mean it's abhorrent; it's just that one has to wonder what the fuss was all about.",5,4,10,30 November 2008
Cars," Nice ride
","As usual, you've gotta hand it to Pixar.In 'Cars,' their latest film, they show why they are still the cream of the crop when it comes to the field they revolutionized more than a decade ago. Well, yeah, it doesn't have the sophistication and cleverness of 'The Incredibles,' nor the universal appeal of both 'Toy Stories' and 'Finding Nemo.' And I have to admit that the idea of animated cars was the least riveting as far as Pixar film premises are concerned. But as with its predecessors, beneath those excellently rendered 3D images is the soul that sets Pixar apart from what has become of most animated films nowadays.Up-and-coming rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is about to win the prestigious Piston Cup. The championship ends with Lightning finishing in a tie with legendary 'The King' (Richard Petty), who is in his final race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton); thus, a tie-breaking race is set in California.But a road mishap leads Lightning to the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, a part of what was once Route 66, a place that once basked in glory, but has since been thrust into oblivion. There he meets an array of other cars - including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman!), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) - who teach him that 'life isn't about the destination but about the journey.' First of all, Pixar's animation is first-rate. It's that sort of greatness among their artists I can only geek about and dream of grasping while in my 3D animation classes. The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering (man, the reflections!). The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Even the old, vintage car models have that chic look that brings some of the essential charm of this film. There are lots to be admired on this film just for the brilliance in animation. But among those that stand out are the race itself, and when Doc Hudson gets to bring back his good old days. Somehow, it's like watching NASCAR on IMAX again, albeit minus the über-big screen and the 3-D effect.But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions. It still all boils down to the story and how it is told - the very essence of cinema. Granted, when it comes to the standards set by previous Pixar films, it isn't quite up there with it's predecessors; but considering how lofty the bar has reached and the mediocrity that has become of the genre in general, 'Cars' more than gets the job done.As for the voice cast, Wilson brings that sort of cockiness to the protagonist of the story and it fits with his smug humor. Larry the Cable Guy gives Mater an amusingly disoriented state without being irritatingly so. You can't help but care about him and arguably, he's the nicest member of the cast. Newman lends an authoritative quality to Doc Hudson. (During the end credits, there's an in-joke about John Ratzenberger, who has his voice featured in all Pixar films thus far.) However, ultimately, the cast is somewhat unmemorable and lacking in diversity. The rest of the voice talents are also underused. Keaton's Chick Hicks is a formulaic one-dimensional villain, which could have utilized his voice more with a little more motivation for the car's part. But then again, that may be beside the movie's point.All in all, 'Cars' is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside. When it comes to the basis of their appeal, it doesn't keep up with the rest of Pixar films which have sped up far ahead and this may yet be their first underachiever. But for what it is and what it achieves, it's a nice ride.",8,96,125,8 June 2006
Bolt," Canis familiaris
","Story-wise, there's nothing remarkably new about 'Bolt,' Walt Disney Animation's latest feature to hit the screens, but considering its patchy recent filmography, it's certainly a step to the right direction for the animation studio, now headed by Pixar-meister John Lasseter. While it's far below the sophisticated narratives and well-drawn characters of Pixar classics such as 'Toy Story,' 'The Incredibles' and this year's 'Wall-E,' 'Bolt' nevertheless charms its way to the screen with its eager-to-please lead character and diverting visuals.Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is the canine star of a TV show where he plays a superdog whose lifelong mission is to protect his 'person', Penny (Miley Cyrus), from the evil forces around them. Problem is, as the creators of the show fervently believe that the show's success lies mainly in its realism, they have gone to great lengths to lead Bolt into believing everything is real and everything seems to be going well.That is until a studio mishap has Bolt improbably shipped across the country from Hollywood to New York. With the help of Mittens (Susie Essman), an alley cat who strangely knows more about dog ways than Bolt himself, and Bolt-fanatic hamster Rhino (Mark Walton), he goes on a long cross-country tripping to find his way back to Penny.Byron Howard and Chris Williams direct a calculated script by Williams and Dan Fogelman where nothing is terribly special, especially if you're not a dog-loving tween girl (I do love dogs, though), though it has enough sensitivity (that's Lasseter working) up its sleeve for some unashamedly touching moments. And with its cheery visuals, lively characters and a breezy pace, it also has enough going for the adults as well as the kids. It's safe harmless stuff.",7,7,11,26 November 2008
The Number 23," Concept wasted
","What seemed to be initially an intriguingly good premise, as its trailers and posters show off, is never realized by the film itself which is incoherent and predictable. Jim Carrey works to the best of his acting range to make his character work, and director Joel Schumacher creates a brooding yet ultimately lackluster envelope of suspense.Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a dogcatcher who stumbles upon 'The Number 23,' an obscure novel written by an individual who became obsessed with the mentioned number. As he begins to read it, he realizes that the novel shares much connection with his past and that the number 23 seems to be less a random number than, uh, a governing universal entity. Like his birthday is on February 3 (2/3!), he and his wife met when they were 23, Kurt Cobain was born and died in years where each digit summed up would add to 23. You know, stuff hoax emails are made of.The film possesses some semblance of creativity, and with so much diabolical randomness going on in the movie, it's easy for one to think the story is far from simple. But the truth is, it isn't complicated at all - it's just to arbitrarily blathering. Partly because the film can't decide whether to take its subject with a heavy hand, or with a tongue planted on its cheek. Partly because it plods a lot without much going on. Mostly because it may be the Fernley Phillips' script, which proceeds to a final act that comes as a letdown after all the intensity that the first two acts had put forth.Overall, the film does have a few worthy amount of cheap suspense but the flaws far outweigh them. Viewing it seems to just add up to an ultimate disappointment.",4,14,44,21 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Makes for a fun ride even if it's not as ablaze as it could've been
","The string of superhero movies goes on and this time, it's Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider's turn to heat up the big screen.During the day, he's Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) - a stunt motorcyclist who once sold his soul to Mephisto (Peter Fonda) in exchange for a cure to his father's cancer. However, the contract involves Johnny transforming to a blazing skeleton by night in the presence of evil, bound to work for Mephisto in defeating Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the ambitious son of Mephisto who wants to make a hell out of the world - literally.Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the film has an introductory note for Johnny Blaze which clearly feels a lot like the filmmaker's previous Marvel project 'Daredevil.' The way it's presented does seem formulaic but it manages to decently portray the main character to the viewer. Cage also doesn't seem to be a good idea to play the role but as the film progressed, the more he managed to prove me wrong by doing a good job of combining a sense of grit and humor for his character.The characterizations of the supporting characters, however, were rather insipid. Eva Mendes as Roxie Simpson, Johnny's love interest, serves more like a perfunctory female touch to the film as her character has been devoted with so little concern. I'm tempted to say that the villains are too one-dimensional but they're demons, which may be the point.The movie overall is a decent way to spend a Valentine evening, although at times, the plot becomes a little confused. The fight scenes lack a sense of urgency, and the love angle feels too casual. But Cage gives a good performance and there are enough humorous moments to make for a somewhat fun if bumpy ride.",6,3,7,14 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," The franchise ends (?) not exactly with a bang
","Like a lot of others, I loved the X-Men as a kid (although my first orientation with 'em mutants weren't the comic books but the weekly animated show by Fox). And like a lot of others, I was disappointed when I learned Gambit wouldn't be in the third installment. But for 'X-Men: The Last Stand', the movie turned out quite well, although a bit disappointing. You do see the difference with the replacement of 'X-Men' and 'X-2' director Bryan Singer with director Brett Ratner and there are some VERY surprising (arguably questionable) twists. But it makes for a great popcorn entertainment and it got me and my friend talking about them mutants once again.PLOT DETAILS FOLLOW. In what could possibly the last installment in the franchise, a young mutant named Leech possesses the ability to nullify the powers of those mutants within a certain proximity around him. With this, Warren Worthington II developed a 'cure' that could permanently suppress mutant powers. His first subject would be his son, Warren Worthington III a.k.a. Angel (Ben Foster), but the latter backs out of the procedure at the last minute and eventually joins the X-Men.Meanwhile, a grief-stricken Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) returns to Alkali Lake where Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) supposedly died while trying to save the X-Men in a previous mission. He finds Jean alive, although he is killed by the Phoenix - Jean's alter-ego kept in check by Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) telepathic blocks.Phoenix joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with other renegade mutants as Magneto (Ian McKellen) wages a final war against humans and destroy the mutant 'cure.' The X-Men (what's left of them anyway), makes a final stand to fulfill what Professor X has dreamed all along - for humans and mutants to be united. PLOT DETAILS END HERE.As with previous X-Men installments, the film suffers from a slow start as each mutant must be introduced (e.g. their powers, a little of their back-story, some of their traits). It's a Garden of Eden for special effects, similar to what mostly comprises summer films nowadays, yet probably a hell for the screenwriters. The buildup to war fills up the second act almost entirely, and for what it's supposed to accomplish, it does well. Aside from regulars like Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry), there are a couple new mutants getting their chance to whop some butt, and that are fascinating to see on the big screen; including Angel, Kitty Pryde a.k.a. Shadowcat (Ellen Page), and Peter Rasputin a.k.a. Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). On the 'evil' side, there's Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and Juggernaut (Vinnie Marko) who's not actually a mutant in the comic books... but I'll stop there. This results in long expositions, which at 104 minutes may be a tad too long for some, but may be fine for those who know the source material fairly well.The main problem is that a lot of this is sub-par compared with the previous two 'X-Men,' especially with the second one. The main characters blur among the backdrops of the film's plot. I don't want to reveal lots of details about the film, but two characters who have significant roles in both the comic books and the first two films are now reduced mainly to 'pawns.' Jean Grey herself has little else to do either besides look like a woman in serious need of an exorcist. Jackman and Berry, along with McKellen, are on the forefront of this 'ensemble' film and they carry on with their characters nicely, especially for Berry who has her character Storm upped a notch.But what really matters is that I enjoyed the film - albeit not entirely. The acting and the special effects were pretty much on par as far as summer movies go, but it's how the material is handled that dampen the overall effect. Ratner has the task of filling in Singer's shoes after the latter left the project for 'Superman Returns' and the change is evident. It still did have some pretty scenes, and many of the special effects used to show each mutant's powers were spectacular. But where the first two had a smart script that mostly made sense, this one feels bloated, and has far too many mutants and subplots.In the end, 'The Last Stand' is not a disaster of a film as it's still fun to watch. It's not as emotionally effective or as intelligent as its predecessors, and it just kind of went overboard with how it dealt with some of the characters. It's not a terrible movie, not at all. It just falls a little short of the standard of what 'X-2' set up three years ago. And it just still has no Gambit. Bah.",6,7,15,24 May 2006
The Lives of Others," Multifaceted spy drama
","With The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen), debuting director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafts a simultaneously gripping and intelligent political drama about an agent for East Germany's secret police. Just as a Stasi agent finds himself irrevocably drawn into the lives of the couple he's spying on, so does Donnersmarck compel his viewers into an oh-so meticulously crafted piece set in pre-unified Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall's crumbling. Capt. Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Mühe with an eerie adeptness, is assigned to conduct a covert surveillance on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler initially carries out his task with such calculated efficiency, but gradually finds himself pulled into an emotional web that slowly peels away his impassive facade. In the same way, Donnersmarck lets The Lives of Others unfold into a beautifully structured story that's powerfully told and populated with richly defined characters. It's at once a chilling reminiscence of a recent part in German history and a touching portrait of the human social network.",10,1,2,21 August 2010
The Incredibles," Incredible in every sense of it!
","'The Incredibles' is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date. This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird ('The Iron Giant'). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, 'The Incredibles' is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. However, the aspect most evident in 'The Incredibles' that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a 'normal' mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. 'The Incredibles' may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this.",10,15,24,25 July 2005
Stardust," Star light, star bright
","Matthew Vaughn's film adaptation of the Neil Gaiman's novella 'Stardust' is a pleasant surprise in that I didn't know what to expect of it beforehand. For one, 'Mirrormask,' the other Gaiman material adapted to the big screen wasn't much of an experience worthy of its source. Also, the trailer didn't look at all exciting. But somehow, the lowered expectations helped in a genuinely satisfying experience.'Stardust' is set more than a century ago and tells the story of Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man from Wall, England, who sets out to the other side of a wall, to a magical kingdom, in search of the star that fell from the sky so that he can get the hand of Victoria (Sienna Miller) in marriage. It turns out that the star is not in the form of a piece of rock but of a young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes). And he's not alone as Lamia (michelle Pfeiffer), one of the three witch sisters, is also in pursuit of the star whose heart is said to be the key to immortality. Add in the fact that Yvaine has found a diamond necklace at the site where she fell, which is the object of desire of two king-wannabes, who now has to find Yvaine to retrieve the necklace.What ensues is an old-fashioned fantasy film that plays more as a fairy tale for grown-ups, which while never reaches the heights of last year's 'Pan's Labyrinth,' succeeds in presenting a dazzling imagination and wry humor that keep you engaged during its running time. The battalion of intersecting plot lines make for an overall uneven experience but co-writer/director Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman keep the proceedings lively with the script's banteringly amusing nature.Leads Cox and Danes generate genuine chemistry so much so that it's easy to categorize their pairing for a romantic comedy that all the more that calls to mind 'The Princess Bride.' The supporting cast that include Robert De Niro and Pfeiffer easily ham it up without going overboard.Overall, 'Stardust' is a magical experience. It may not be a definitive adaptation but it's definitely worth the two hours.",8,8,12,10 October 2007
Shrek the Third," This ogre is starting to lose his charms
","The phenomenal success of the Shrek franchise - particularly 'Shrek 2' - has prompted Dreamworks Animation to yet again squeeze out a story of an erstwhile happily ended tale and return to the screen once again with 'Shrek the Third', which brings back most of the original cast, and then some, for another round of jabs at fairy tales and pop culture.The Kingdom of Far Far Away is faced with another dilemma: King Harold (John Cleese) has just died and next in line to the throne is Shrek (Mike Myers), who doesn't want to have anything to do with ruling a kingdom. So he goes to search for Artie (Justin Timberlake), Fiona's cousin and the third in line to the throne, in Worcestershire (no kidding), a medieval high school where all students seem to have jumped out of a Hollywood teen flick. Meanwhile, Fiona is pregnant with Shrek as a reluctant father; and Prince Charming teams up with villains from various fairy tales in an effort to take over the kingdom.While, yes, it's considerably better than 'Happily N'Ever After', it's hard to define the movie as anything more than a disappointing mediocrity. It had the chance to be just as good as its predecessor, yet except for a few jokes, it doesn't generate consistent amusement or cleverness when it comes to delivering the laughs. Even with new characters that include Snow White (Amy Poehler), Cinderella (Amy Sedaris), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri), and Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) voiced by Saturday Night Live comedians, the film seems to have lost all sense of wit and humor that has made its first two predecessors a fun experience.As for the material itself, the narrative doesn't seem to have any real motivation or progression. It's merely stretching a premise into an hour-and-a-half end product that merely panders to the filmmakers' whims of extending a lucrative franchise that may be starting to run on fumes. It was easy to ride with these characters in the first film because the animated genre is incredibly trampled with clichés. But a joke can only be said so much before it starts to wear out. Here, directors Chris Miller and Raman Hui fail to give the characters any quality that would evoke sympathy, considering that the story falls flat and perfunctory.'Shrek the Third' might still appeal to younger audiences, but that's about it as far as recommendations go. Save for sporadic chuckles, the audience I watched it with were quiet throughout the film. It feels hastily assembled and thrown together slapdash, without any attention to what made the first two work, and Dreamworks should get a clue that the ogre is starting to overstay his welcome.",5,96,140,16 May 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The surfer deserves better
","In all its silliness and tongue-in-cheek disposition, the first 'Fantastic Four' movie wasn't really a landmark as far as comic book films go. But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.In 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,' the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to wed Susan Storm aka Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). However, an unknown cosmic entity is causing a screw-up in earth's natural phenomena, prompting the couple to postpone the wedding, and work with Johnny Storm aka Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm aka The thing (Michael Chiklis) to find out the cause of the mysterious occurrence. They soon come face to face with the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) and realize that the world's survival is hanging on the balance. In addition to this, Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returns and is intent on destroying the Fantastic Four.Granted, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' has a greater scale than its predecessor. But for all this, it's still very... middling. The title and the trailers suggest something of a grand battle between the eponymous characters but aside from the chase sequence involving the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer (which, by the way, has been shown numerous times in the teaser trailer), nothing much exciting still happens. Not even the team's rescue attempt in London. The quality of the special effects are inconsistent and all the visual polish expectedly goes to the Silver Surfer. (And while I personally don't think it's an issue, I imagine how some fans of the comic book might sneer at how the characters of Silver Surfer and Galactus were handled.) Instead, director Tim Story and screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost opt to flesh out the characters more but the end result feels less natural and more repetitive. Gruffudd does an okay job with Mr. Fantastic but there's really no feeling of chemistry between him and Alba, who manages to adequately portray a tough yet vulnerable character. In contrast, Evans and Chiklis continue to generate an easy rapport between them and the two get majority of the film's most amusing moments.'Rise of the Silver Surfer' barely does what it sets out to do. It fares a little better than its predecessor with a more serviceable story and a little more enjoyable action sequences. But taken on its own terms, the film doesn't present anything to its characters that has been done much better with other characters of their ilk. The movie is entertaining to some extent but in the end, it doesn't really rise to something special.",5,224,352,13 June 2007
Transformers," Nothing more than meets the eye but it doesn't have to be
","'Transformers' is so far the most fun I have as far as this year's Hollywood summer blockbusters are concerned. On one hand, it's not saying much considering the barrage of underwhelming 'three-quels' the past two months (plus the mediocre second installment of 'Fantastic Four'). But then again, there's just something sublime in seeing your childhood memories unraveling on the big screen: those hunks of metals transforming from pieces of automobiles to highly advanced metallic sentient, and vice versa.Sam Witwicky (current Hollywood it-guy Shia LaBeouf) has just got a new car, who actually turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee, an alien tasked to protect Sam, who is in a possession of something his great-great-grandfather owned, and which is vital to the Decepticons' plan of destroying humankind and conquering Earth. Meanwhile, as the US military led by Secretary of Defense Keller (John Voight) is scrambling to figure out who is trying to hack into their computer system and stealing classified files, Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) must evade the Decepticon Barricade as well as from the mysterious Agent Simmons (John Turturro) who claims himself from the government group Sector 7.It's nostalgia at its finest. Director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman work on this factor and the result is more of an adult-skewed film that zeros in on audience members weaned on a retrospective mode. Sure, it isn't high-brow art nor does it boast of an intricate plot, but come on, who expects that? While the script needed more coherence and focus (do summer blockbusters nowadays really have to have, like, three subplots per movie?), Bay's trademark acerbic humor and stylish perpetually-on-motion shots work most of the time, except during the climactic battle scenes where you wish the director would take a barbiturate or something, just to at least know who's fighting whom. The film has impressive CGI and the robots are quite stunning, more of stylized versions of their cartoon counterparts. LaBeouf provides a solid central human figure, ably backed up by Fox, Turturro, Anthony Anderson (as a computer hacker), and Kevin Dunn (as Sam's father).All in all it wasn't a definitive adaptation , but I have to admit it was fun to watch. Ultimately, it's nothing more than a Michael Bay-ified Saturday morning cartoon, but it really didn't have to be anything more than that. It may be empty calories but it was fun while it lasted and there were no regrets afterwards. The robots did their thing and it was a smash.",7,57,114,28 June 2007
World Trade Center," Shards of hope amidst the bleakness
","'World Trade Center' is different from the usual Oliver Stone film in that it's an article with a hushed apolitical tone. Here, Stone removes the usual sappiness of movies depicting heroism, pushes mawkishness to the sides, and tells a definitive story of two individuals who were among the victims of that fateful day.Whereas 'United 93' (the other 9/11 film released this year) featured mostly unknown actors, 'World Trade Center' stars Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as Port Authority cops John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, respectively. Called in to the World Trade Center without knowing what the emergency was, McLoghlin and Jimeno soon find themselves trapped when the Twin Towers eventually collapses. Both actors, coupled by the script by Andrea Berloff, successfully underplay the sensationalism while still maintaining the realistic urgency and heroism of the big picture.Stone is so determined to show the humanity of McLoughlin and Jimeno that his trademark themes take a backseat to the unfolding drama on the screen. Still it isn't without a few minor problems. Firstly, some parts slow down with a little too many narrative flashbacks. I'm not familiar with how much of these were real and how much were part of cinematic liberties, and indeed some of them are necessary for the characterizations of the leads but not all of it. But that's about it as far as quibbles are concerned.This is simply an intelligent solid film, a little loose with the details of the actual events but overall true to what its subject is all about.",7,1,4,18 October 2006
The Dark Knight," Dark and brooding thought-provoking tragedy
","'The Dark Knight' has got to be the darkest and most mature superhero movie to come to the big screen so far, tackling morality in such uncompromising manner that is at times haunting and often painful. With the burden of the obligatory backstory done with, director Christopher Nolan, and co-writer and brother Jonathan Nolan have more freedom to paint a larger picture of Batman (Christian Bale) and in the process, crafting a masterpiece; and I'm not one to use that word lightly here, as the film provides moviegoers with their share of summer escapism coupled with tragic foundations dealing with morality, heroism, sanity, and power.Since the end of the first installment, 'Batman Begins', the Caped Crusader has now risen to legendary status among the citizens of Gotham City, even spawning wannabe vigilantes in Batman costumes. But it's a case of love and hate for the hero as some people view Batman's acts as anything but heroic, including the members of several organized crime syndicates who are slowly but surely feeling the effects of Batman being around to clean up their acts. Add Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham City's new D.A., who decides to fight these criminals, together with police lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and it seems all is going well with Gotham City. That is, until a crazed sadist named Joker (Heath Ledger) comes and brings chaos to town. His only demand is for Batman to reveal his true identity or a life will be taken every time Batman doesn't.This version of Batman is in many ways superior and more brooding than Tim Burton's version, which for a while, became the definitive big screen adaptation of the Caped Crusader. Here, Batman is as vulnerable as anyone and the darkness permeates everywhere, from the setting to the characters themselves. Bale, who reprises his role as Batman and his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne, owns the role, adding a certain level of depth to what could have been yet another standard comic book superhero by providing a believable aspect of Batman's fallibility.Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes (arguably the weakest link in the first film), brings more intelligence to the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's former flame. Actually, everyone in the supporting cast does well, especially Eckhart who brings charisma to his role as Harvey Dent who starts out as a character full of hope and it's hard not to care for him even as he eventually descends into tragic madness.Of course, no review of this film will ever be complete without mentioning the Joker, as played by the late Heath Ledger, both because no Batman series is complete without facing his arch nemesis, and because this has to be Ledger's best acting turn and it's unfortunate it's also his last. His turn as the Joker is a far more intelligent, sinister and twisted, without going over-the-top as did Jack Nicholson in the 1989 installment.Still, anyone who comes in not for all the existential quandaries and gritty drama but simply for the action won't walk away disappointed. Nolan has placed enough adrenaline-pumping fight scenes, car chases, and explosions which mostly rely more on organic camera-work. A couple of scenes during the climax involving choices are done with little traces of predictability it adds up to the overall tension of the film.In a period where comic book superheroes are turning to a more mature route to the big screen, 'The Dark Knight' presents a multi-faceted thought-provoking superhero tale that accomplishes more than what it's set to do. Coming from a Marvel Comics fan, I have to say that Nolan's version of one of DC Comics' most recognizable characters is by far the best rendition of the genre. Forget about it being one of the better sequels to come out; it's one of the best movies I've seen.",10,5,11,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Gone is the magic
","'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' the fifth installment based from J.K. Rowling's wildly popular series of a young wizard's adventures in the magical school of Hogwarts, feel much more an obligatory splice between its predecessors and the impending eventuality. For fans who have loyally followed the series, it's temporarily stopping an itch before the final book comes out. But for anyone else, the film is an emotionally inept and borderline drab for most of its running time as the narrative feels crammed just as to cover all bases before going to the final two films.Prior to his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his bullying cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) have been attacked by Dementors in a subway prompting Harry to use a spell in front of a Muggle to expel the dark soul-sucking creatures. This places him in trouble with the Ministry of Magic, which forbids such practice, and would have been expelled by the tribunal from Hogwarts if not for the intervention of school headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).Still, even after being cleared of the offense, the Head of the Minister Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe Harry and Dumbledore's claims that the Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned. He instead installs the sweet-talking pink-loving Professor Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new Defense against the Dark Arts instructor, whose fascist-style of running the school has led a group of students to form 'Dumbledore's Army.' Led by the trio of Harry, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the underground rebels plan to put up an army that would fight the one Voldemort is forming.To their credit, director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg succeed in giving the film a dark tone that signals the young hero's transition to adulthood. The performances, as usual, are competent and the cinematography contribute to a menacing atmosphere all throughout.Yet despite all the polished trappings, there's no sense of magic. While Goldenberg, whose screen writing credentials include the brooding 2003 version of 'Peter Pan,' manages to consistently translate the angst required of the film's characters, Yates fails to impart consistent pacing throughout and bring out the requisite emotion from the film for the viewer to connect with its characters. As a result, everything feels less genuine drama than a mere anchor for subsequent Potter films.While fans may be pleased with this end product that coincides with the source material's seventh and perhaps final installment, anyone else probably won't be held spellbound.",5,0,0,14 July 2007
Blood Diamond," A good find if a little rough around the edges
","If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film 'Blood Diamond' - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.'Blood Diamond' is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme. Well, yes, it got me into thinking at times that it could have been better but during the parts that work, it got me engaged nonetheless.",7,6,10,8 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Austen's girls
","Ah, 'Pride & Prejudice.' Jane Austen's timeless tale of courtship and marriage during the time bridging the late 18th and early 19th century has just found another film version for itself. Keira Knightley is Elizabeth, the second of the five Bennet sisters, and a girl possessed with sharp wit. Her mother, Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethlyn), is determined to see that she and her sisters - eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike); reclusive Mary (Talulah Riley); and the two youngest daughters who are too naive and frivolous for their own right, Catherine (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone) - are married to wealthy gents. That's because there's not a son to become heir of the Bennet family's estate, so Mr. Bennet's (Donald Sutherland) cousin Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander), a clergyman, will inherit it upon the former's death.The movie begins with the bachelor Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) taking shelter in a house near the Bennets, and Mrs. Bennet is convinced that one of her daughters must be his wife. With him is the snobbish Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), whom Elizabeth hasn't a good first impression with. Then Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) arrives, believing that as the heir to their property, he must wed one of the Bennet girls.Director Joe Wright proves with this endearing film that it's hard to resist one of the most famous novels of Jane Austen, and probably one of the greatest novels of all time. He has the fine touch for translating the story freely and believably, making the events as real and as natural despite it being set more than a hundred years ago. It's humored-nature is filled with warm and poignant scenes that are handled with such sensibility, and the theme of marriage is presented with such finesse that reflects that of the novelist herself.Knightley has proved her versatility as an actress but has never been better than she is here as Elizabeth. With her captivating British looks and personality, she is charming, and she fits her character's personality well. There's a genuine truth about her that makes her likable and even the most cynical members of the audience should easily connect to her. In fact, I am not surprised with her nomination for an Oscar for her performance here, although with this year's competition I don't think she's going to win it (I'm guessing Reese Witherspoon will).As Mr. Darcy, MacFayden gets to develop his character during the progression of the film and and does it nicely. The supporting cast turns in noteworthy performances too, particularly Pike, Sutherland, Blethlyn, Hollander, Woods, and Malone. I must also mention Judi Dench, who is also nominated this year by the Academy for Best Actress for her performance in 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' but that's another film and I haven't watched it yet. She convincingly brings the pride and domineering side to Lady Catherine De Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy.'Pride & Prejudice' is a delightful movie that should satisfy fans of the novel. Not only does it contain a great performance by Knightley, it's a well-crafted reincarnation of a piece of literature through the eyes of its director.",8,0,0,1 March 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A movie so good to be erased from memory
","I really liked the idea of 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' although, unfortunately, I haven't yet seen other works of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. The premise of memory erasure/loss may have been done many times before, but what transpires in this film is an excellent idea, a great insight into the human essence of memory and emotions. The direction of Michael Gondry and the script themselves are great and the film is even more amazing when coupled with great acting from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.Joel Barish (Carrey) discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet), has undergone an experimental procedure of the Lacuna Corporation headed by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for a long time to get their relationship working fluidly. Joel sets for revenge and decides to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine.At this point the film alternately takes place between reality and within Joel's mind as he follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced. However, once the process starts, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine, so he starts smuggling her away into other areas of his memory where she doesn't belong and that causes some changes about his memories as well.Most stories about love try to present a good story and, for all their faults, always have decent intentions. But if the ultimate aim is the human essence of love, then a lot of these films failed. 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' does not fail in this regard, and it is justified by the touched feeling I got from watching it.Charlie Kaufman is a sterling writer, if this be the basis for that. The direction is, as Michael Gondry has shown here, flawless and the music perfectly matches the camera flow and character movement. From its haunting introduction to the ebbing and flowing of the memory scenes, the cinematography and the music are so in tune with each other in giving the movie its brand of eccentricity.Despite the somber tone of the movie, Carrey doesn't seem out of place here. Actually he is still a lot of fun to watch. His acting perfectly captures Joel being lost between reality and imagination - subtly shifting from the material world that is stored in his memory to vignettes of abstractions while trying to save Clementine from the process of having her erased permanently. Winslet has the natural beauty and charm as Clementine. The supporting cast of Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst all impress, too.Essentially, this movie offers one of the most stunningly inventive and intuitive glimpses at the human emotional nature and its resistance of fate that I have seen - a stunning portrayal of grief forged of a failed relationship and the abrupt ending of it. If this film is about anything, it is about someone about to go under, grabbing at the only life preserver a person can ever see - one's memories.As I've said, the direction and acting extend this beyond mediocrity to excellence, the main actors especially allowing the many moments of reminiscing to speak for themselves. The mind is strength itself, and it is shown through the flashbacks and tweaks at reality. It is human mind and emotion depiction at its finest and that rarest of things - a movie so good to be erased from memory.",10,0,1,3 September 2005
Drag Me to Hell," Hell hath no fury like Raimi in adrenaline
","Trammed by 'Spider-Man 3''s excessive heft, Sam Raimi returns to basics in 'Drag Me to Hell', placing him back into the slapstick horror department that defined his early film-making career. Unsurprisingly, his latest horror-comedy, as it turns out, functions pretty much in the same vein as his 'The Evil Dead' series, employing a straightforward supernatural tale to peddle in as much ridiculously over-the-top pulp and madcap cattiness as its R-13 (the local rating) would allow. Devoid of the ungainly qualities of his last superhero project, Raimi pulls no punches this time around in dealing out cartoonish nastiness and the verve he brings forth proves to be amusingly contagious.Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer whose amiable nature proves to be one of the greatest hindrances in finally bagging that much-coveted assistant manager position, a position that requires decisiveness according to her boss (David Paymer). So when Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Rayver), a scraggly woman with grayish fingernails and sharp crooked teeth, comes at her desk asking for an extension for her home loan, she denies the request despite the old woman's subsequent begging, in an attempt to impress her boss. Poor Christine, as Mrs. Ganush turns out to be a gypsy, unleashing a curse on Christine that torments her for three days before a goat-demon, well, drags her to hell.The craziness that stems from this, taking off from a hilariously drawn-out altercation between Christine and Mrs. Ganush in a parking lot, comes at such a breakneck pace yet the frenetic onslaught from one comic-horror scheme to another is handled wonderfully by Raimi, who consistently keeps this camp spookfest's tension high. 'Drag Me to Hell' piles on the 'Gotcha!' scares like it's going out of fashion, yet the cranked-up effectiveness that Raimi composes makes those delightful jump-out-of-your-seat experience -- punctuated by Lohman's face being the ground zero of icky filth and body orifice projectile -- amusingly deserved.",9,0,1,2 June 2009
Up," Buoyed dreams
","Typical of Pixar's adeptness in conveying stories, the first few minutes of 'Up' pack more wallop than a whole two-hour tearjerker could, as it charts Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) and childhood friend Ellie through the decades, from their role-playing days as intrepid travelers to their marriage, and eventually, Ellie's death. Pete Docter's animated tale is an elegant combination of humor and pathos that perfectly captures the rush brought about by adventure, the uplifting quality of friendship, and -- at once a reminder of Disney's 'Bambi' and Pixar's refusal to compromise its narratives -- the pain of losing someone. It's a profundity that's both delicate and penetrating.78-year old Carl and his wife Ellie had kept a scrapbook of their planned adventures and always dreamed of going to the fictional Paradise Falls in Venezuela, where their childhood hero, the adventurer Muntz (Christopher Plummer), has famously traveled. For some reasons, the expedition doesn't materialize and Ellie soon dies, leaving Carl alone in the house, with the latter about to go to predatory land developers. Inadvertently bringing along the pudgy Wilderness Scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), Carl decides to fulfill Ellie's wish as he ties thousands of balloons to his house and floats to South America.Advertised as Pixar's first foray into 3D, 'Up''s candy-colored palette and graceful portraits of Carl's house floating in the sky benefit from the additional visual depth, though the increasingly silly travails of Carl and his slapdash tour is filled with buoyant energy that keeps it from resting entirely on the technology's novelty. Centering on the theme of one's continual search for purpose, Carl learns of how holding to the past keeps him from reaching his destination and from setting off to new adventures, a moral that Docter fortunately doesn't overplay, but rather is represented in splendid visual metaphors. It may be too easy to call it an elevation to animation but there's no escaping the fact that, for all its jaunty adventures and affectionate regard to relationship, 'Up' -- pardon the obvious description -- doesn't let down.",9,2,4,20 August 2009
Departures," Death is not the end
","Fixating itself on the pretext of death as a strong stigma to the Japanese rather than on the necrophiliac titillation possessed by those outside this particular societal circle, 'Departures' approaches this issue with credible poignancy made more relevant when seen as a mitigation by director Yojiro Takita and screenwriter Kundo Koyama to a prevailing Eastern taboo. Although slightly undercut by an ultimately predictable script, Japan's Oscar-winning entry for this year's foreign-language film category is thoughtfully expressive, portraying a morbidly incriminating profession with dignified grace.Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) is a cellist for a symphony orchestra which disbands after a performance for failing to gather audiences. Having no job, he and his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) move to his hometown in his deceased mother's house where, upon answering a help-wanted ad he mistakes for a travel agency, he ends up as 'encoffiner'-in-training, helping his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) perform a set of ceremonial rites for the dead before cremation. Aware of the social demonizing of such job, he lies to his wife about it until she learns of it anyway and pleads that he finds a 'normal job,' an appeal he finds tough when he increasingly develops a meticulous fondness for his work.Takita's charming and ultimately touching apologetic on mortality charts the disorderliness arising from an individual's social circle while he pursues his sense of purpose, with the titular itinerary suggesting more than the moribund ritual the film's protagonist is subjected to. Thus, it also becomes a plaintive meditation on Daigo's spiritual and moral development as he attends to the various abandonment issues that haunt him (a father who ran off when he was young and a wife that stigmatizes him for his newly found 'filthy' career). Ultimately, 'Departures' is as much a story of atonement as it is about dealing with mortality; that in order to fully embrace one's existence, it is necessary to cope with death -- both literally and figuratively -- while nurturing the bonds that exist among those who still live.",9,25,33,12 July 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Much ado about blah
","I won't get much into the theological and historical aspects of either the novel or the film 'The Da Vinci Code' because basically, I'd just ramble and would end nowhere. But one thing's clear: the tremendous calls for boycott and banning of the film in our country, the Philippines, isn't really necessary as the film version barely makes the claims of the book any more credible.With Dan Brown's best-selling novel becoming a worldwide phenomenon, tremendous expectations abound, so it seems natural for director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to feel a great pressure to transfer a faithful adaptation to the big screen. They did remain faithful, but as with other book-to-film adaptations, you can only include so much and still leave a lot lying on the cutting room floor. This film is essentially a crash course of the novel where everything feels so rushed and we don't really care about the characters. I have read the novel almost two years ago (and subsequently, I've read two books that try to refute the 'lies' fabricated by Dan Brown). I found the book pedestrian at best, nonetheless a real page-turner. The movie is a three-hour dull exposition that not even the chase scenes can't manage to save.You probably know the plot as much as anyone else, but here goes: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Religious Symbology professor who is called upon by the French police after the curator of the Louvre has been murdered, leaving with him clues to centuries-old secrets supposedly hidden by Leonardo Da Vinci in some of his works. These messages are said to be so powerful it can shake the foundations of Christianity. Together with a French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), they try to figure out the clues while running from the French police across the streets of France to the Rosslyn Chapel to the Westminster Abbey.The film certainly tantalizes us with an intriguing beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first see the murder at the Louvre. Soon after we meet Langdon and he's called while signing books (in the novel, he was called in his hotel in the dead of the night). He's then thrust into a labyrinthine of puzzles and clues, into Goldsman's soggy exposition that never really trying to flesh out any of the characters for the sake of fitting as much subplots of the book as possible. It might have worked as a miniseries or, heck, even as a two-part movie. But here, the pacing of the story is very uneven.After their pairing for the Academy Award-winning film 'A Beautiful Mind,' many were waiting for Howard and Goldsman to bring a sense of thrill to the story. 'The Da Vinci Code' contains flat, yet likable characters and a rich palette of lush, inventive puzzles. Unfortunately, the film lacks that edge. It's missing the thrilling elements of Brown's novel. Howard does weave some memorable scenes, but the sum is much less than each individual part.The film does end by asking one important question about faith that somehow was never addressed in the book. Unfortunately the film overall lacks depth to fully substantiate its thesis. There isn't really an emotional thrust to the mystery because we don't know enough about the leads. It lacks a solid foundation altogether. The screenplay spends so much time in placing the characters from one puzzle to puzzle with not much excitement and too much arbitrary exposition to say (though it does seem fun to see Ian McKellen do that lecture). The chase scenes aren't adrenaline-pumping either. And then we're given with grainy flashbacks of the early Christians, the Knights Templar, etc. The novel has all the pages to expound on that; the movie has just two and a half hours.Despite that, I don't think it would diminish the anticipation for the film. I saw this film a couple of nights ago in Thailand and the theater was fully-packed (most of them were Europeans). 'The Da Vinci Code' is sure to be an altogether different experience, especially if one has read the book. And those who are not willing to 'compromise' their faith for the movie's worth may not be enticed the same way as those who are. Then again, in the greater scheme of things, there's no need for a boycott. Whatever controversial message the film tries to say, it does so unconvincingly.",5,41,80,20 May 2006
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," JB and KG go to rock and roll museum
","It's as simple as saying that if you like a heavy dose of Jack Black in particular and Tenacious D in general, you might have a lot in store for you in 'Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny.' A group in the audience I watched the film with was agreeing in hilarity. Else...Admittedly I have yet to see a single episode of the 'Tenacious D' TV series (the closest possible occurrence is if the local cable channel Jack TV lands a deal with HBO but it seems unlikely) although I've seen Jack Black enough to say that his mannerisms and style of humor are usually hit-and-miss, and 'The Pick of Destiny' (directed by Liam Lynch) falls just about somewhere in the middle.Here, Black is - eh - JB, an aspiring rock artist who once ran away from his hometown of Kickapoo, Missouri as a young child and reaches Hollywood, Los Angeles several years later in his mid-thirties. Here, he meets KG (Kyle Gass, the other member of the eponymous band), whom he forms the band Tenacious D with. Together, they embark on a road trip to The Museum of Rock and Roll in Sacramento in search of the legendary guitar pick made from the devil's tooth, which they believe is the secret to their musical career's success.Less 'School of Rock' than 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,' 'The Pick of Destiny' feels like a stoner comedy that's mostly running on fumes as basically, it simply involves a string of gags involving c**k push-ups and a psychedelic Jack Black doing an ala-Happy Pap-Pap song number with Sasquatch. A few of which work (I especially liked Tim Robbins' cameo), but they are far outweighed by those that don't, resulting in several dragging moments. If you're into the band's music, you might have a rocking time (pardon the pun... couldn't resist) as there are oodles to be had here, but that's as far as recommendations go. If you're not a fan or aren't into gritty and foul-mouthed humor, you might not get as much amusement as you're supposed to.Simply put, if you believe there's enough reason for you to warrant this movie a shot, who knows, you may find yourself enjoying it. Personally, it's not that bad of a film. But heck, neither by a long shot it's the best motion picture ever.",5,1,3,13 December 2006
The Departed," A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley
","Director Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed', a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller 'Internal Affairs', goes without saying as perhaps his best work since 'Goodfellas.' Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives.Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's 'muse', fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga.Scriptwriter William Monahan ('Kingdom of Heaven') retains much of the structure of 'Internal Affairs' but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be.At its core, 'The Departed' is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, 'The Departed' is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory.",10,158,287,4 October 2006
Glory Road," Formulaic but still scores
","In 1966, a coach of a girl's basketball team comes to Texas Western College and recruits seven black players to lead them to the top.Right from the trailers and the posters, you probably know how 'Glory Road' is gonna go: an underdog NCAA basketball team must face great odds to win the championship. It's a sports movie based from true events (read: based) with a Hollywood tag plastered over its forehead that features reluctant heroes overcoming their problems and giving it all for the game. Nonetheless, the movie achieves more than that. While this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Disney movie plot is typical (remember the Titans?), the underlying socio-political theme effectively presents the ills of racism - a problem with no easy way out of (ask Paul Haggis). The key characters of the game are dealing with discrimination and the only way they can get back is to win. Of course, a little research told me that some of the details about the real events were changed for cinematic purposes. It's completely fine by me as long as the end product justifies the means. And boy it does. The performances are also good. Josh Lucas gives a terrific performance as Don Haskins, the head coach of the team that featured the first all-black starting lineup in US NCAA history.'Glory Road' is a formulaic yet an enjoyable film. It's a movie that gives itself away as soon as one character says 'I want to play, Coach!' Still it has charm and excitement that comes from seeing it for what it is. It's predictable, yeah, but it's not much different from seeing a replay of a game where your favorite team won.",7,36,44,22 March 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Oh wow, the pyramids and Petra!
","Making the first 'Transformers' like the apogee of restraint in comparison, 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' finds its titular robots joining forces with more Autobots and battling more Decepticons in an ever so disorienting and boisterous fight -- if the Autobots really cared about the earth, why not bring the fight to outer space and reduce human collateral damage? -- while confusing Sam Witwicky with Mutt Williams as Shia LeBouf races across the Middle Eastern desert looking for ancient clues to save Earth from impending doom. No one would make a case of the first 'Transformers' to be a masterpiece by the strictest sense of the word, but whereas novelty and a candidly faux-retro approach fueled its success, Michael Bay's follow-up to the wildly successful cinematic spin-off to a popular toy line is, while not without its share of beguiling moments, an incessant revelry of excesses, fervently continuing the director's fetishitic shots of men and women wielding arms and highly stylized yet emotionally inept whack at human drama.Picking up two years after its predecessor left off, the Autobots have teamed up with the American and British military in combating the remaining Decepticons on Earth who successfully revive Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) from the depths of the sea. Sam (LeBouf) is now off to college, but not before inadvertently bringing himself deeper into the ongoing war between the Transformers, and eventually finds himself scurrying past the ancient sites of Egypt and Jordan (oooh, Petra!) to look for the Matrix which will supposedly bring a dead Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) back to life and destroy an age-old enemy in the process.Plunging at a breakneck pace such that characterization and human interest are obligatorily phoned in though never delved into (not that Bay and scriptwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Ehren Kruger care), 'Revenge of the Fallen' pointlessly barrels through the plotting not unlike its hulking metallic warriors without regard to narrative dynamics to support its cacophonous setpieces or to give more structural reason for its wanderlust-inducing locales. Bay, though at least soft-pedaling with the usual racial stereotypes, still fails miserably in callous mayhem and, less glaringly, in making his human characters more relevant, that under the pretense he's interested in fleshing them out, merely paints his latest would-be summer blockbuster with so much burnish that -- including the product placements and his veneration to Megan Fox's sexily tanned curves -- 'Revenge of the Fallen' functions not unlike this month's glossy lad mag.",5,17,37,23 June 2009
The Holiday," Bloated sweetness and predictability
","'The Holiday' is a contrived romantic comedy from from writer/director Nancy Meyers marked by an inability to resist an excessive gratification of whims that leaves a cloying and puffy feeling afterwards. And while the cast boasts of Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black in the leads, the film oddly lacks enough charm to be either truly romantic or funny.Amanda (Diaz) is a movie advertiser from Hollywood while Iris (Winslet) is a journalist from Surrey, England. Both are reeling from post-breakup aches so they find each other online and do a house swap for the holidays. It ultimately sets the stage for Amanda to meet Iris' brother Graham (Law), while Iris herself befriends a screenwriter Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) and film composer Miles (Black) during her healing process.Running for a little over two hours, the film does feel too long. Which wouldn't matter if it justified its length with content. Here, the plot is devoid of surprises and the dichotomy of the film makes for an uneven experience.The arc on Diaz and Law is uncomfortably gooey and borderline absurd, which while benefits from a more dynamic progression of the story, suffers from failure to evoke sympathy of the character's plights (why of course I forgot, she can't cry!) and gawky editing.It's a stark contrast to the warm and tender feeling of Iris' half of the narrative. But Winslet and Black are mismatched. Even if a straitjacketed Black has a more subdued acting here, he comes off as bland and the chemistry between him and Winslet is nonexistent to the point that it's easier to root for her and Arthur. Pity, too, that Meyers seem more interested in Amanda and Graham as they are given more screen time that the events in LA are reduced to mere fillers.'The Holiday' is apparently a two-in-one romantic comedy which could have worked better had Meyers focused on a single storyline rather than jumping across the Atlantic Ocean every now and then. As it is, this one feels drawn out, with only a few good moments scattered somewhere in between, and may be even less enjoyable for the estrogen-challenged.",5,1,4,7 February 2007
30 Days of Night," Starts good enough, sets along the way
","'30 Days of Night' has an intriguing title and an intriguing premise - that of bloodthirsty vampires roaming a little Alaskan town where the sun won't rise during a 30-day stretch. And director David Slade, working on a script by Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson, from the graphic novel of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, manages to build tension early in the film with this discourse.Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) is a sheriff investigating a series of strange crimes in the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, such as the burning of stolen cellphones and butchering of sleigh dogs. His estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) is in town for a fire inspection but missed her flight out just before the town is set for a month-long winter without the sun. Soon, they find themselves in the midst of a violent frenzy of hungry vampires.As said before, it all starts promising enough. But then the film takes a disappointing turn somewhere along the way. The tension dissipates when Slade focuses on the handful of survivors as they try to survive the 30 days until the sun finally begins to rise. The plot becomes barely non-existent. Granted, it would be rather harsh to expect of a more intricate storyline for a film of this nature; but there's neither a sense of urgency nor a sense of sympathy for the characters as in, say, Zack Snyder's reworking of 'Dawn of the Dead.' And unfortunately, a bulk of the film is intent on focusing on them. The vampires can repetitively snarl only so much before they start to lose their intimidating factor.The only time the film regains its emotional bearing is towards the end, with a beautiful shot of Eben and Stella against a backdrop of a rising sun. But it would have to take a long time to get there.",5,2,4,31 October 2007
Hancock," Smith is still charming in a wasted good premise
","'Hancock' is a confused production. It has an intriguing premise in that the highly charismatic Will Smith plays a reluctant superhero whom everyone hates - and he hates everyone - for the damages he cause every time he comes to the rescue. But the lead actor's charm is wasted in a material that doesn't know what to do with its setup and essentially scrambles to decide what to do next, ending up as a generic summer movie that had the potential to effectively satirize other movies of its genre.Smith plays John Hancock, a perennial drunkard who feels obligated to help the people of Los Angeles from their troubles. Problem is, no one likes him - and he retaliates by not liking them either, throwing off vulgarities that never seem offensive either because Smith is saying them, or because of the PG-13 rating.He meets public-relations specialist Ray Embry (Jason Bateman) after rescuing the latter from certain death in a railway. In return, Ray takes it upon himself to have Hancock transform into someone people will actually look forward to seeing, and this involves doing time in jail. His wife Mary (Charlize Theron) hates the idea and would rather have Hancock stay out of their lives.Then director Peter Berg, and writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan hit a wall. The dark comedy turns into a conventional superhero movie thereon, with subpar CGI and a messy narrative to boot. The exposition is hurriedly done and Hancock's backstory is covered in such a flimsy manner to give way to more summer movie orthodoxy, and a twist that has been telegraphed right from the setup.Smith is always fun to watch and he'll always be a crowd pleaser, even in this film which reduces his character's edge to mere banality. Which is unfortunate, because underneath all the trapping lies a more substantial promise.",5,2,6,3 July 2008
WALL·E," Seriously, Pixar can do no wrong
","In the distant future, the Earth has been an inhabitable wasteland and humans are now living in artificial environments in space and left to clean the trash are waste disposal robots named WALL·E. Almost 700 years later - 2815 to be exact - only one WALL·E (voice created by the film's sound designer Ben Burtt) remains functional and it begins to show signs of sentience and emotions, longing for someone to share a romantic touch with.Enter EVE (Elissa Knight), a feminine-like probing unit sent to Earth by Axiom, one of the human cargoes in space. WALL·E falls in love with Eve, and this sets for an adventure in space.Much has been said about how the film lacks dialog for the first hour and relies solely on gestures and emotions shown by the robots. It's also grimmer than previous Pixar films and save for a cockroach, WALL·E does a Will Smith in the first few minutes of the film, interacting with no one but his environment. Sounds like a turnoff especially for the little ones but director Andrew Stanton shows enough resourcefulness to use what's on screen to produce a more emotionally resonant and believable spark (pardon the pun) between the two robots than most real-life actors could ever dream of grasping.Serving also as some sort of a cautionary tale about human's role in preserving our environment, the film does so in a subtle and amusing manner without resorting to the mawkish approach that's prevalent in other otherwise well-meaning-ed films. As usual of Pixar, the quality of animation is superb, which is, really, just a cherry on top of the cake.Inasmuch as I hate to sound like a fanboy who will throw superlatives on just about anything Pixar churns out, I have to say that the geniuses behind the animation studio have done it again - create a movie that's not only magnificent to look at, but with a soul as well to back it up.",10,6,11,19 August 2008
Step Up," Same old dance moves
","You really can't fault 'Step Up' with at least having its heart in the right place even if its trite dramatic elements overbear it as a whole. Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is serving a 200-hour community service for the Maryland School of Arts after getting caught trashing some of the school's props during a late-night vandalism. Soon, in a twist of events, he finds himself teamed up with Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), a ballet dancer in her senior year, for the school's showcase wherein lie their futures.Directed by choreographer Anne Fletcher and written by Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg, 'Step Up' is weaved to the formula of cookie-cutter dance movies that's a dime a dozen nowadays. Overstuffed with too many plot lines and directed without much fluidity, the film doesn't break new grounds or usher anything that hasn't been shown in, say, 'Take the Lead.' The actors can only do so much but they can't step up from a movie full of stock characters and typical subplots. Troubled guy who's capable of doing something great. Girl unbelievably dating a guy who doesn't deserve her. Black Americans who sulk at social prejudice. Mother who 'wants the best' for her child but can't see that what her child does is what's the best for her.The chemistry between Tatum and Dewan is as active as that of a helium with a neon. Tatum is so stoic in mumbling his lines. As for Dewan, while she is no high-caliber actress, she has a rather effervescent presence that translate prettily on the celluloid.Perhaps what would have made 'Step Up' a much more compelling film was if it paid more attention to the area it's tackling and making it more innovative. There's nary a persuasive composition (or at least none that I can remember) as most of the choreography consists of body shakes, lifts, turns and pirouettes. A standing ovation has never felt more conspicuously staged.As it is, 'Step Up' ends up as just another familiar piece that stocks on its shallow characters, their clichéd episodes, and the diaphanous ending Hollywood constantly obligates.",5,1,3,20 September 2006
Iron Man," Downey owns this solid, if uncreative, origin story
","The summer blockbuster season has indeed come and 'Iron Man' is a fine film that provides a solid diversion through the course of its running time - at least for the first hour. But it's always good to see Robert Downey Jr. and it goes without saying that, despite equally impressive performances from the supporting cast, he owns this movie.Based from yet another Marvel comic book superhero, Downey is Tony Stark, a genius billionaire industrialist who has amassed his great fortune by developing weapons for the US military. On a trip to Afghanistan he is captured by terrorists, is held hostage and forced to build a weapon for his captors. He instead secretly builds a power armor that would help him escape and keep him alive from a shrapnel that has been embedded in his heart.He escapes and upon his return to America, he develops a more advanced suit, giving him superhuman strength, capable of flying and firing missiles among others, whereupon he is dubbed as the Iron Man.While the movie begins interestingly with glimpses of Stark's confused character, it stalls during the second part where the uncreative riffs of an origin movie seems like obligatory parts director Jon Favreau and the screenwriters are too eager to be done with. Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's PA Pepper Potts is charming, but Paltrow doesn't exactly have chemistry with Stark. Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes is slightly underused and one wishes there would be more of him in case a few more sequels are underway.As for the obligatory villain, a bald and bearded Jeff Bridges effectively plays an otherwise drab villain on Stark's teacher and business partner Obadiah Stane. There's no depth in his character and he's about as cartoonish as a villain can get, so to speak. The climactic battle between him and Iron Man isn't that exciting either.Retconned to modern times, it's not just about some teenager with personal vendetta to deal with; it's about a man riddled with guilt and a global issue to deal with. It's just disappointing that Favreau would bypass Stark's conflicts for the obvious and less trappings of a summer blockbuster.Still for the most part, the movie's entertaining. There's some great CGI, some humor all around - mostly from Downey - and a couple of action sequences that are better handled than the climactic one. Plus it's pretty easy to cheer for the hero even if for most of the time he's battling enemies who have no chance of winning.So while 'Iron Man' isn't a lock on achieving an A-list status in terms of superhero movies, it gets its job done and leaves one hoping it earns enough at the box office so we'll get to see more of Downey as the eponymous superhero, and crossing our fingers it will be better now the conventional part's done with.",8,10,21,29 April 2008
Casino Royale," Royale flush
","Since his inception by Ian Fleming in 1952 and his first cinematic personification by Sean Connery in 1962, debonair British spy James Bond has become a contemporary icon. With now over a score of film installments, plus dozens of less-than-successful copycats and handful of spoofs, the pop culture-oriented public have since felt quite pleasurable excitement to this magnetic character.However, as the film franchise continually expanded, it grew more and more formulaic and showed less than impressive results. While the Lee Tamahori-helmed 'Die Another Day' had its moments, it suffered from failing to realize what the series is all about, focusing on too much mindless CGI-driven action rather than working on the old-fashioned charms of its lead character. Then Pierce Brosnan drops his license to kill and a relatively obscure actor in Daniel Craig is introduced, complete with those prejudicial criticisms and jokes (yeah, 'James Blond', sheesh). By then, the outcome of the newest film from the 007 franchise was hanging on the edge.Fortunately, just as with a glitched computer system that's got a tad too many running processes, director Martin Campbell ('Goldeneye') and scriptwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and (Hollywood It-Boy) Paul Haggis reboot the franchise in brilliant form with 'Casino Royale' (based from Fleming's first Bond novel with the same name), reinitializing Bond back to his early days shortly after obtaining his double-O status. There's still enough action scenes but this Bond movie's less interested in the action than the actor. Consequently, there's more traditional trappings and less pseudo-technology.Starting with a brief prologue shot in black-and-white and a retro-ish opening credit sequence, the film immediately proceeds to a mad chase scene across Madagascar between Bond (Craig) and a bomb-maker which ends up in a disaster. Reprimanded by M (Judi Dench) for his recklessness, Bond takes matters into his own and heads to Bahamas where he sees a possible lead in terrorism treasurer Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Eventually this leads him to Casino Royale in Montenegro where he crashes a high-stakes poker game with hopes of making the terrorism investments go bad while being paired with the sultry Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) as a secret agent for the British treasury.Of course, much of the film's gist lies in its lead actor. And yes, Craig is excellent as Bond, exuding charismatic strength and emotional depth during the quieter scenes while providing an effective masculine drive when his character is in his element. Bond has absolutely never been well-played since Sean Connery yet perhaps only the first time given depth by a serious portrayal with little trace (if any) of the cartoonish qualities. He's ably supported by equally effective performances of Dame Dench, Mikkelsen, and Jeffrey Wright as a CIA detective. No Q and Miss Moneypenny, though.As for the trademark Bond girls, Bond gets jiggy with two of them here - Solange (Caterina Munro) and Vesper (Green). Of the two, it is Green who gets more screen time in which she brings a highly intellectual charm coupled with just the right amount of fragility. Her chemistry with Craig, though, is a bit too enhanced by the script's romantic angle that veers dangerously close to getting the better of the movie's overall dynamism.That said, the film drags towards the end with a little over two hours worth of running time. The climactic showdown in the canals of Venice also arrives a little too late and as such, feels less exciting than it could've been. But in the end, Craig and the filmmakers give enough reason for one to overlook such faults. Through their recreation of the legendary role, the cards are mostly played right with a film that wisely goes back to the basics.",8,8,18,15 November 2006
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Flawed visually resplendent melodrama
","Almost a decade after the release of 'Elizabeth,' director Shekhar Capur and star Cate Blanchett return in 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age,' a film which loosely bases its plot from the life of Queen Elizabeth I of England during her 27th year of reign.After vowing a life of celibacy, Elizaveth is now pressured into marrying by her adviser, Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), in an effort. One of her suitors is Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who returns from an expedition to the New World and swoons the Virgin Queen with tales of having named an island after her. Meanwhile, King Philip II of Spain prepares to launch a holy war against England and her Protestant queen.Visually the film is an eye candy - Remi Adefarasin's shots are nicely composed, and the production design are nothing short of remarkable. But the film is replete with subplots suffering from an uneven script and pacing that the film ultimately becomes a forgettable melodramatic affair. Blanchett delivers a solid performance and is virtually the lone bright spot, while the likes of Owen, Rush, and Abby Cornish as the queen's principal lady-in-waiting fail to impart a commanding presence.What results is a film of deluxe design but lacking the emotional force to be truly involving. And the liberal use of history probably won't win additional affection for this queen either.",5,3,6,12 December 2007
Beowulf," It's all about the sensory overload
","The success of '300' and 'Apocalypto' no doubt have set the stage for violent setpieces set during ancient history, where visual resplendence that cater to testosterone-bearing members of the audience are preferred to a richer narrative. The latest in line is Robert Zemeckis' 'Beowulf'.Ray Wintstone plays the eponymous character, who travels the high seas to answer the call of the drunk King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins): to slay the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), who has been terrorizing the town of Heorot. Beowulf does so but incurs the wrath of the demon's mother (Angelina Jolie), who in turns seduces him into a curse that befell generations of leaders.Written for the screen by fantasy novel/comic book whiz Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary ('Pulp Fiction'), the film employs the same motion-capture 3-D animation he used in 'Polar Express'. Consequently, this retelling of an Old English epic is no doubt a sensory overload. The renderings are photorealistic, and the fight scenes are exhilarating. But at the course of its length, it all becomes tiresome with its source's themes relegated to the backseat in order for Zemeckis to suit it to modern viewers.The same can be said of Zack Snyder's and Mel Gibson's previously mentioned works; but whereas those films managed to keep the viewer engaged through its action scenes, 'Beowulf' doesn't. And in all its visual splendor, 'Beowulf' also lacks stronger characters that would elevate it to the level of the film's technical breakthroughs. It's at once exhilarating yet exhausting.The climactic battle scene (which in itself is an incentive to see the movie in IMAX) punctuates a two-hour exposition that lacks a thematic depth. It's not unlike one of those extended cutscenes in RPGs that seem to go on forever and ever, making you wonder when gameplay would start again.",5,26,54,14 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Retro popcorn movie that works
","'Live Free or Die Hard' (or simply 'Die hard 4.0' as released locally) used to be what summer escapism is about before CGI took over and film marketers targeted younger audiences more. Len Wiseman, director of the two 'Underworld' films, in all his fashionable tendencies and mannerisms, seems an awkward choice to helm a movie that's geared on nostalgia. Still, Bruce Willis still brings a commanding presence as John McClane even as the ridiculous action scenes and stunts satisfy.Willis gets into the wrong place at the wrong time after 12 years as McClane when the FBI orders him to bring in computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) for questioning after someone hacked into the organization's computer systems. But something more is at stake, because the real threat lies in the hands of Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a vengeful computer expert, who uses the flaws of the US' system to his advantage. To make matters worse, Gabriel takes McClane's daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.Despite the silliness of the plot and the preposterous stunts, everything comes natural in the sense that it takes not much to suspend disbelief. The motivation is well-defined and the idea to blend retrospection with modern day technology works. Expertly shot and paced, McClane is also supported by solid performances from Olyphant, Long, Winstead and Maggie Q. Kevin Smith does well in a small role.'Die Hard 4.0' is smart enough not to take itself seriously and it gets you going for McClane even when he improbably dodges from the bullets and outrageously walk away from all those crashes and falls with just scratches. It's a summer popcorn movie that delivers - it's bloated, it's silly and it's fun.",7,1,3,4 July 2007
Munich," Über Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' depicts the events starting from the assassination of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Mossad worker Avner (Eric Bana) is called to lead a group of five - getaway man Steve (new Bond Daniel Craig), cleanup man Carl (Ciarán Hinds), forger Hans (Hanns Zischler), and bomb maker Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) - and avenge the massacre by hunting down and killing those behind the Black September attack. Aiding them from tracking the terrorists who have scattered across Europe and the Middle East is an informant named Louis, even as they find themselves targeted of assassination.What is vengeance's worth? When is it going to end? In every war, those questions are easily generated yet hardly answered. That is, in essence, what Spielberg's latest film is about. Through its building of tension, Spielberg presents the themes of truths and paranoia through a group of hired killers, who, find themselves hunted as well. Sure there were controversies but that's enough about it.The film itself is a visual delight. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, a staple of Spielberg films, sets most of the film in a dreamy setting with warm tones and low contrast (I am reminded of my 'sunsoft' filter), while the score of John Williams, another Spielberg favorite, works superbly in many scenes as well. It's not the best film of the director, though, as there were times the movie feels slow and lags at times. But the portrayal of every murder and assassination especially during the tense opening scene, and the flashbacks showing the brutal killings of the athletes, is altogether stunning. It is this force and soul that carries the film.The actors portraying the members of the group are superb, Ayelet Zorer is brilliant as the Avner's wife, and Mathieu Amalric brings a sense of fear to his character Louis. The movie, however, obviously belongs to Bana. The former Hulk brilliantly showcases his emotional intensity and almost every scene works with Bana on screen.'Munich' is a gripping film that portrays the morality of the event in an unobtrusive way. It isn't perfect but you have to give it to Spielberg for having the guts to film it, and doing it in a way only he probably can.",9,3,5,8 February 2006
300," The glory that is Greece
","It's probably been told more than enough by now but '300' is a wild visual feast that should appeal to anyone who knows what they're in for. Adapted by director Zack Snyder from Frank Miller's graphic novel about The Battle of Thermopylae, the movie's a frenetic composite of stylish atmospherics, larger-than-life characters with equivocal motives, and brash - even poetic - dialog. Anyone who's found pleasure in Robert Rodriguez' cinematic translation of Miller's 'Sin City' and Snyder's reworking of George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' will most likely find this an incredible visual interpretation for the testosterone-driven. It's bombarded with habitual skepticism and extraordinary bloodbath, but all that works to the film's advantage eventually.'300' tells the story of the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerald Butler) and his 300 men who dealt a massive blow to the numerically superior army of Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) before coming to their demise. From a narrative standpoint, there's nothing much as Snyder and the screenwriters favor the mythology of the context more than factual accuracy. Style triumphs over substance, so to speak, and here characterization and nuance are thrown off the window. As such, it should be pointed out that this is not a movie for everyone, but if you're one who gets a kick out of action and atmosphere, then this is one to enamor.It's basically turgid film-making that achieves what it's set to do, because from a technical standpoint, '300' is a regal buffet, filled with the sort of desaturated colors blended with blue screen background that lends to the film's ethereal look, capturing the look of its source material and giving the film its energetic pace that rarely pauses for a break once it gains momentum. '300' is a movie about valor and heroism and it raises an angry crimson atmosphere that matches well with its epic theme.All of the actors, none of them big-name stars, do a pretty good job and seem to be at home with their portrayals even if they aren't required much to stretch their thespic skills with hardly fleshed-out characters. Nevertheless, as the king and leader of the Spartan army, Butler gives a passionate and forceful performance that conjures a credible character. Dominic West and David Wenham are the more familiar faces in the members of the Spartan army but both depict their roles subtly in such a way they blend seamlessly with the rest of the warriors. Lena Heady as Leonidas' wife provides a strong feminine balance to Butler's vigorousness.'300' obviously has its sights on audiences weaned on extravagant visuals and visceral thirst. Honestly, there's a feeling that it could have been more but Snyder seems content not to go anywhere near Rodriguez' tier as he simply promotes the technical over the dramatic aspects of the film. But given the epicurean eye candy in this lush production, it's really not necessary to ask for something more than an unabashed spectacle.",8,2,7,7 March 2007
Click," Could have used a lot less sugar and cheese
","I'm not exactly a fan of Adam Sandler. I've first seen him in 'Waterboy' more than eight years ago when I was in high school, and he just weirded me out so much, although I must admit his nonsensical low-brow movies do elicit chuckles here and there when I'm caught off-guard. 'Click' is no exception, as it has several funny moments involving a remote control that controls EVERYTHING that has to do with him.Michael Newman (Sandler) is an architect who is so concerned about getting a promotion from his boss (David Hasselhoff) that he has taken his family for granted (yep, it takes a lot of swallowing how one can take for granted a wife that looks like Kate Beckinsale). After a stressful day that was capped by a trouble finding the remote for the TV, he heads to Bed Bath & Beyond to find a universal remote control that he thinks would simplify his already complicated life. He meets Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him a literal universal remote control that can rewind, fast-forward, pause, skip a chapter of his life, change his skin's hue, modify an aspect ratio of his boss, change the audio language... whatever.And for the first hour or so, it is indeed a wonderful life with a heavy dose of trademark Sandler humor. It's here where the movie is the most fun, with Micahel making a punching bag out of his boss, impressing his wife by vividly recalling the details of their first kiss, and going back to the time he was born (even literally going in his mother's womb... ugh). Sandler's dopey-faced and self-depreciating humor work very well when the script lets it.Unfortunately, it all comes undone when the inevitable comes to pass with Michael realizing that having total control with one's life isn't as appealing as it might sound. This is the part where it seems unsure of itself. Director Frank Coraci and screenwriters Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe concocts a saccharine second act that's all too cloying and hokey. The resolution has Michael undergo a character transformation that lets him realize how much he's missing his family, which - while maybe a noble intention - disentangles all the credits out of the proceedings. Suddenly it feels as if we are seeing an Ashton Kutcher cautionary sci-fi rather than an Adam Sandler comedy, and the film runs off-course.Particularly I didn't like the final act that employs a deus ex machina, which obviously seems to make the ending more acceptable and that the main character has still all the time in the world to make up to his parents, his wife and his kids. But what it really suggests is that the writers didn't believe the audience would get the story's morals and instead spoon-feeds us with the basic lessons. At one point, I hoped the film would tackle the deeper implications of its premise but that probably wouldn't appeal to its target crowd. Then at least they could've gone for all-out fun.As for Walken, he has some appearances as the weird guy who gave Michael the remote, but most are unimpressive. Beckinsale is heavily underused but Morty's right: she sure does look hot.'Click' often seems unaware of whether it's an Adam Sandler comedy or a morality play. The comedy works out fine but the moral angle just doesn't. A large part of it is derived from simplistic problems with simplistic solutions and when the film gets down to it, that's where it's least successful.",5,3,6,9 August 2006
Happy Feet," Dance of the penguins
","After marching to stardom last year via the hit documentary 'March of the Penguins,' the fat birds in tuxedo - or at least their pixelated versions - are back on the big screen with the Aussie film 'Happy Feet,' joining this year's battalion of computer-animated features that rival Noah's ark for the number of animals included. But with such dazzling visual elements (oh yes, I'm in total awe), catchy songs and an earnest story, director George Miller's ('Babe: Pig in the City') Antarctic adventure stand out from an otherwise overly saturated film genre that has had recently become a hit-or-miss affair.'Happy Feet' is built around the premise that each emperor penguin must have his own 'heartsong.' Taught from childhood, each penguin is expected to find within him/her the song essential to finding a lifelong mate and having children. Enter Mumble (younger one voiced by E.G. Daily, and older one voiced by Elijah Wood), a young emperor penguin who finds himself a stranger to his own kind because he can't sing, although he's unusually gifted in tap dancing. This, much to the dismay of his parents - Memphis (Hugh Jackman in his nth movie this year) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).Soon, fish supply in the south pole is dwindling and the penguins are starving. Noah (Hugo Weaving), an elder of the penguin colony, blames Mumble and his strange talents for the curse and exiles him. Convinced that 'alien' beings are responsible for the food shortage, Mumble sets on a journey to have a diplomatic affair with them regarding their predicament. Along with him is a group of adelie penguins, their appointed leader Ramón (Robin Williams...) and a know-it-all spiritual teacher penguin, Lovelace (... and Robin Williams).The animation is amazingly done with photo-realistic environments. Also, while the characters are not overall distinctive and memorable, it's compensated by their adorable nature (cute yet not all-too-cloying) and good voice performances. Robin Williams, in particular, steals every scene he's in - which is a lot, since he does two personalities here. It's clear he's having fun, and so are we.Ah, but if only the film stayed on track. Towards the end, the scriptwriters decide to do an Al Gore and impart an environmental advocacy campaign, which is in itself a noble idea. But here, it feels as a misapplied digression and taking all merits into account, it's something that hedges the film from what it should achieve.Still, in a time where the boundaries of animation has very much expanded to the point that it has become mostly tedious, 'Happy Feet' manages to enchant the viewer not only through its breathtaking visuals, but also through its charming characters and the overall innocence of the film. It's right up near 'Cars' (I haven't seen 'Flushed Away' yet) and that's surely one thing to be happy about.",7,2,6,22 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Jai Ho!
","Slumdog Millionaire is the schmaltz that Hollywood is known for. But credit Danny Boyle, characteristic visual artist he is, for delivering an earnest crowd-pleasing melodrama that unabashedly embraces its characters' oh-so heartfelt triumphs against adversities and cynicism, and hits the right notes in the process. Ditching complicated narratives that usually take the better of his films' characters, Boyle's film (co-directed by Loveleen Tandan) entrenches itself in its glorification of love, friendship, and destiny (or perhaps karma), composing them and their cacophonous Indian backdrop in cross-processed film colors, slanted camera angles, and fiercely rapid editing. Brimming with joy and sentimentality, Simon Beaufoyt's script (from Vikas Swarup's bestselling book Q&A) narrates through a fractured timeline the saga of Jamal (Dev Patel), an 18-year old Indian boy who despite having raised in the slums and having no formal education, manages to get to the final round of the local edition of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Such feat catches the attention of local police who, believing he is cheating, interrogate, torture, and mock him; and to whom he calmly explains every momentous detail in his life - diving in a pile of poo to have an autographed picture of his favorite Bollywood actor, watching his mom die in the hands of anti-Muslim rioters, his misadventures with older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) etc -- that ties into his knowledge of the questions' answers, as well as why he joined the contest in the first place -- to meet the girl he loved since childhood: Latika (Frieda Pinto). Slumdog Millionaire is absolutely predicated to the notion that the staunch devotion one has to achieving something and the unwavering love for someone is ultimately rewarded by destiny -- or any Higher Being for that matter -- a concept not lost on Boyle, who relentlessly surrounds his characters with the festive environment of their country as they circuitously find their ways into reconnecting with each other, capped by the Bollywood-style musical number in the end. It's an unabashedly romantic fairytale, and Boyle's eye for beautiful images and proficiency for crisp storytelling enhance a tale where well-meaninged people are rightfully rewarded in beautifully mysterious ways.",8,0,2,16 February 2010
The Simpsons Movie," Springfield finally hits the big screen
","'The Simpsons Movie' won't have fans who have waited 18 years for this big-screen treatment of the long-running animated TV show to be made disappointed - after all these years, it's still funny and effectively satirical. And for the uninitiated who are willing to see it either out of curiosity, or just because they want to subject themselves to some silliness and chuckling, the movie has loads as well. Just be ready for some Bart d***.In 'The Simpsons Movie,' the water supply of Springfield is getting more toxic due to high levels of waste dumped into the lake. This prompts Lisa Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) to start an environmental awareness campaign together with Colin (a new guy in the neighborhood that has an Irish environmentalist/guitarist father). Eventually the people of Springfield decide to help in cleaning up the lake. Meanwhile Bart Simpson (Nancy Cartwright) has some sort of a falling out with Homer (Dan Castellaneta) after a game of dare with his dad goes wrong, compounded by the fact that a pig saved from getting butchered has gotten more favorable with his father, building the pig even a pig crap silo, leading Bart to look for a father figure across the yard in the Flanders.Soon Marge Simpson (Julie Kavner) convinces Homer to get rid of the silo but to make it to a free donut giveaway, Homer decides to save time and simply dump the silo in the lake which proves to be the last straw as the lake becomes so polluted it mutates an animal who gets in contact with the water, calling the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA, under US President Schwarzenegger's orders, quarantine the town of Springfield inside a large glass dome, and the Simpsons, upon the townspeople's discovery of Homer's involvement in the crisis, find themselves under the angry eyes of the whole Springfield.Director David Silverman and his army of co-writers give a movie with frivolous gags, slapstick humor and hilarious sentimentality that should satisfy long-time fans, and perhaps make new ones out of the rest. While some jokes tend to be less funny than others, one should still have a fun time watching the kind of humor and irreverence one can expect.Simply put, if you're a fan, you probably have made your mind up in seeing this movie; chances are you won't be disappointed. If you are simply up to find what the hype is about, you'll find yourself a good hour and a half of entertainment.",8,1,6,25 July 2007
V for Vendetta," Shades of reality
","Watching 'V for Vendetta', I cannot help but juxtapose it with the political issues going in this country today. It is a film sourced from a material with a strong and intriguing message, although the execution lacks depth to make it more than a popcorn movie.Based from the graphic novel written by Alan Moore (who I read refused to associate himself with this) and illustrated by David Lloyd, the film is set in a futuristic Britain where there is a totalitarian government run by an extremist right-wing, employing a Big Brother-like system of monitoring, after political unrest and mysterious viral outbreaks had taken their toll. V (Hugo Weaving under a Guy Fawkes mask) is the mysterious terrorist who is intent on bringing down this government.He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman caught walking outside after the curfew has been put to effect and is about to be 'punished' by police agents known as the Fingermen. Shortly after, he takes her to his lair and sets up an elaborate plan to free the people of England from their government that should culminate on the 5th of November.First time director James McTeigue puts on a visual spectacle on screen but fails to elicit strong performances from the cast. Maybe it's not entirely his fault. As written and co-produced by the Wachowski brothers, the film has that 'Matrix' feel into it, with some of V's lines reminding me particularly of Agent Smith that even beneath those mask, Weaving is so recognizable and gives an effective performance. But V, as well as Portman's character Evey, although likable, are weakened by a shallow and half-baked treatment of the story.The action scenes manage to save the movie from the oblivious depths of mediocrity, if only to a certain amount of degree. The best part comes near the ending but it's not long and exciting enough to warrant the earlier parts of it.'V for Vendetta' does have its moments but they are few and far between. It is visually striking but just as previous film adaptations of Alan Moore's graphic novels ('Constantine', 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'), something went lacking upon reaching the silver screen.",5,10,23,15 March 2006
