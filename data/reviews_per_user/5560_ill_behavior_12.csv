Scarface," Pacino eats the world
","Great film.DePalma has a talent, maybe, for capturing the essence of the Eighties in many of his films, they are sealed in a capsule of crap clothes and crapper disco music, and this is no exeption (except for some of the suits).He is considered a post-modern director for his all style and no substance filmmaking, but I think Scarface has a heartbeat and is more complex than it appears.For a start, it's great entertainment, and believe it or not, rather realistic in it's depiction of evil and greed and what they do to the human psyche. Of course, the seed already has to be there, and as Pacino shows, Montana is hungry. He's a big fish wannabe, and his climb to the top of the pile is what you'd imagine a young Jimmy Cagney to have been like had there been a prelude to White Heat.Insanely quotable, Pacino has recently been voted number one greatest actor of all time in some dodgy poll, well, I don't believe you can measure one kind of genius against another, but if it came down to it, it's performances like this that hold him up as The Daddy. He eats not only his world, but the damn scenery aswell, and even the great supporting cast can't take this film away from him; the fact that everyone seems scared of him doesn't appear to be put on.Also it has one of the best endings to a movie, ever.",9,0,1,10 May 2003
12 Angry Men," Truly Excellent
","1 room.12 great actors.1 cracking script.0 big budget special effects.Need I say more? Well I will anyway.A simple message of communication, we can work anything out if we talk it over, and that decisions made from the heart are clouded with our own prejudices and emotions. It's a great film, one that requires an attention span of longer than five minutes. It gives us the bare facts and sticks us in the claustrophobic little room with the men, we become one of the jury.  Satisfying closure, and no need of a sequel, although I hear the remake is quite good. Whatever, just go watch it.",10,1,2,12 May 2003
Duck Soup," Sublime, I liked this movie
","What can you say about the Marx brothers that hasn't already been said? Not much, so go rent/buy this classic. Showed it to a couple of friends whose idea of comedy seems to be the sickening teen-comedies and awful sitcoms that pollute our screens today, they didn't like it. Seems it's not the flavour anymore. No, go back to basics, this is genuine class, you can't teach this, how to deliver lines as well as slapstick that doesn't involve special effects or things blowing up.I'm not telling you what's funny, or what's not, as everyone has their own tastes, but to be honest, if you appreciate class, and you know film, you'll love this little cracker.",9,0,0,19 May 2003
The Machinist," Twisted, intelligent film which takes two viewings to properly appreciate
","There should really be two reviews for this film, one for the plot, and one for the subliminal images and ideas which pervade the story the second time you watch it. I loathe using spoilers and see them as detrimental to the point of a review but to talk about a film like this they would be hard to avoid.I will concentrate instead on the need for this film to be watched a second time, I really cannot underestimate the difference a second viewing makes, it really is like watching a different film. Odd lines like 'Trevor! I need a hand!' take on completely new meaning, scenes such as Christian Bale's Trevor screaming at people who may be plotting against him are simply terrifying when watched with different context.Brad Anderson excels himself packing the film full of literary references and images, the acting is fantastic, I don't know whether Bale was nominated for any awards, but he should have been and he should have swept the board, becoming so immersed in the character he inspires fear and revulsion as well as pity and empathy, an absolute masterclass.The first time I saw the film I came away thinking it was a clever psychological thriller. The second time I saw it, having sat through the Route 666 scene, I came away with the distinct feeling that this was a horror film, I was shocked at how my perceptions had changed. The aforementioned scene will probably go overlooked, but is possibly one of the single most disturbing scenes I have ever sat through. Skin-crawling, and we don't need over-the-top violence to shock us when film-making is this clever.I'd urge everyone to watch it, wait awhile, then watch it again, there aren't many films I re-watch unless for a specific reason, this should be mandatory for everyone.",9,2,3,23 July 2006
The Fast and the Furious," Pointless
","The kind of film we will look back on in ten years time, and hopefully burn.Terrible acting, I even thought the fabled action scenes were pure toss.It had no soul, no balls, no nothing, just a blank slate in my brain where I zoned out of my body for an hour and a bit, went into the dead zone and surfaced again when the credits rolled.Mindless action movies are fun, I dont doubt this. This film isnt, just a group of people who said 'hey, I know how we can get rich and famous quite quickly, heres what we do...remake this little-known car film and sell our souls and good names to the Dark Lord himself'.Pure sweaty balls. Dont be fooled by the hype, watch this tripe at your peril.",Null,0,1,24 November 2002
Days of Thunder," Top Gun in a car
","They had no script, it was made up as they shot the film, a fact you can see from many characters looking at pieces of paper cleverly placed around scenes (notably those shot in the pit-lane) so they can remember the dialogue.The film is bad, it's the repeated formula of the Cruise films which gets me and annoys me. If you've seen Top Gun, and lets face it, who hasn't, there's really no need to waste your time on this trash.Bruckheimer has a lot to answer for. Everything seems to be made of cardboard, including the actors, the film is so bad it made Nicole Kidman fall in love with Tom Cruise. Also, it's the 80's, it looks garish and cheap, and it is, at the risk of ending this review with a poor car joke, I'd advise even the dumbest of you to steer clear.",1,11,25,31 January 2005
School of Rock," Black Rocks. Hard
","Jack Black vehicle sees the great man munch his way through scenery, characters and all before him.A one-man show, this is such an uplifting film. No great surprises or huge twists, the story plays out that Black sees an opportunity to earn some money by pretending to be his house mate, he becomes a substitute teacher, and all hell breaks loose as he teaches the kids all about rock n' roll.A good history lesson for all those watching, it probably had older audience members wistfully remembering about 'back in the day', its great to see true rock get appreciation in movies.Mike White's script is enough, and he passes okay as Black's friend, but it's Black and his performance which makes the thing so damn enjoyable, really, if you need something to cheer you up or put a smile on your face, stick this on, it rocks.",8,1,2,1 February 2005
Donnie Brasco," Clever, Funny, Sad, Good Movie *spoiler*
","It's a film with the 'awww' factor. I never thought I'd describe a film I liked with the catch-all phrase I hate 'touching drama', but this is exactly what it is.Acting is excellent, but then you shouldn't expect to question Pacino and Depp. I hope they make more films together, as their chemistry is great as a twisted 'father and son' odd couple.Few memorable sequences, including a restaurant scene which ends bloodily, and Pacino slumped in an armchair with a tracksuit on, looking old and tired and sad. His character is kind of ironic, as he thinks he's Movie Pacino, a mafia bigwig, when in actual fact his place in the Mob is quite minimal. Depp plays his role with ambiguity, and at the end I felt his character seemed to have his heart removed, and I think he felt internally sad at bringing down Pacino, as it didn't really mean an awful lot. I remember a lot of silence, and the film stayed with me for quite a while.Good dialogue, good direction, and altogether a worthwhile experience.",8,0,0,12 May 2003
Big Fish," Unimpressed
","Many people have said how great they found this film, personally it didn't really do it for me.I thought it was quite sickly actually. Plus points for the special effects; Tim Burton rarely disappoints in that area, but what got me was the obvious way it tried to toy with the viewers emotions, it tried too hard to upset me, and at the end I didn't care, I knew it was manipulating the viewer and I didn't fall for it's narrative tricks. But this isn't about how clever I am, rather, how superficial I found the acting and the writing to be. There were too many clich√©d characters, and I suppose that is partly the point of tall tales, but I found it boring.It's definitely not for everyone, it left me cold and wet. Rather like a big fish.",6,8,13,9 December 2005
Space Jam," Just Plug It
","It's hard not to see this as one long advertisement for Nike, and to many is a step over the line as far as product placement, its the example they will use in the future as the film that went too far.It gained a mark for one or two funny lines, but then maybe I expected them coming from my childhood cartoon heroes, if it had been unfunny then I would show no forgiveness, but as it is I'm pretty cynical as to what the film is bringing to us so it does no harm. I can imagine the number of children wanting expensive sneakers rose highly after witnessing the film, although the number of children wanting to punch Michael Jordan for horrendous acting and the comedy timing of a wombat should have been higher.Redeemable only for a huuuuuuuuge dunk by Elmer Fudd or Porky Pig, which is a classic moment in movie history. Maybe.",3,2,8,8 December 2004

Goodfellas," Cinematic perfection (minor spoilers)
","This film shows us a life lived to the excess. The tone of the film suggests more a study of social behavior than outright gangster film, I have even heard it being classed as a modern day noir, whatever, it's brilliant.The acting is amazing, the cinematography is top bracket, the music is heavenly (in it's depiction of Hell). Scorcese was born to make this movie, it's impossible to study it the first few times you watch because it sweeps you up and dumps you down at the end. It leaves you breathless. There is brutal violence, drug use, and colourful language, but there's no use complaining because this is the mafia, these are bad people, what do you expect? Told in flashback it is based on the story of Henry Hill, a boy who grows up dreaming of making it in the Mafia, he works his way into the higher ranks of the organised crime syndicate and through a stunning series of set pieces his coke-addled paranoia shows us his downfall and eventual fate. There are various voice-overs to give the action a sense of perspective, but there are so many things going on it's best just to let it flow.De Niro and Pesci are at the top of their game, and the supporting cast give this film a weight unmatched by many. As examples of perfection of the art of film-making go, not many texts can match Goodfellas, it's utterly enthralling.",10,12,24,7 December 2004
