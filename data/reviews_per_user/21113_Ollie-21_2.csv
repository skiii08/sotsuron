Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Remember: It's only one third of the story......
","Despite all the crap I heard about TPM, I managed to keep an open mind during the movie.  Waiting in line for 11 hours was an experience in itself, so even though the movie isn't the perfect cinematic creation ever, it was worth every minute.  The 19th of May will be a day to remember for a long time.  As for the story line of the movie itself, it was weak.  I say so because anybody would say the same thing if they were 1/3 of the way through a movie and was cut off.  Remember, we can enjoy parts 4, 5 and 6 because we remember them as a TRILOGY.  So all those who say Episode I is a disgrace to Star Wars may be excused due to their IGNORANCE!  To all the rest of you, get in line, enjoy the effects but remember that it is only an introduction to an entire trilogy.  As for the characters, Anakin got on my nerves more than Jar Jar (Yippee!), but they're both there to appeal to the kiddies in the audience.  That can be overlooked by the older folk, especially with the numerous, breathtaking panoramic scenes.  Computer effects have never looked so realistic(realistic, yet fantastic).  I can't wait for Episode II!",7,0,0,20 May 1999
The Matrix," Let Down
","Maybe I'm missing something.  I thought that this movie was visually incredible, but the story REALLY let me down.  I think that it is a pity that such a great set-up leads to a blow-em-up finish.  It would have been nice if this film's story-line would have captured my interest as much as the effects.  All in all, worth seeing, but if you are the type that likes a thick plot that comes together at the end, prepare for disappointment.",6,0,1,3 April 1999
