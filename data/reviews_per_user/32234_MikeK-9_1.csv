The Blair Witch Project," overhyped, but ending stays with you
","I wish I had not read or heard any of the hype regarding this movie. Unfortunately I knew beforehand how all the creepy stuff was done during the body of the movie (the noises, rocks, etc.), so whenever it happened I knew it was only the directors doing it.  I didn't know about the ending and I still think about it 4 days later.  I agree with those who write that if you are expecting a slasher movie or a Scream type movie then don't bother: You'll find it boring.  I liked the interaction of the characters so the middle of the movie wasn't bad for me.  And that last image of Mike still has me thinking about it. What I don't agree with is this belief that an opinion about a movie is either right or wrong.  For those who think that people who (gasp) didn't like the movie are idiots or unimaginative, the same can be said for you. Have you ever seen a movie that everyone else likes but you?  Does that make you an idiot?  No it just means you have a different opinion.  I also have been seeing reviews which the reviewer gives BWP a good review because its an 'indy' film or that the budget was only (dollar amount).  Personally when I watch a film the LAST thing I think about is if its made with a huge budget by the major Hollywood players.  Maybe someone who thinks that way can explain it to me.",Null,1,1,11 August 1999
