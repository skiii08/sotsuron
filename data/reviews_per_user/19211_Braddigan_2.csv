Black Swan," Deflowering the repressed
","Darren Aronofsky is no stranger to the psychological thriller, a sub- genre Black Swan fits in comfortably. Like Aronofsky's first film, Pi, Black Swan depicts an internal struggle between selves, the grappling for equilibrium, and the external manifestations of mental disintegration. However it is more dramatic and more transparent. No shock-value gimmicks here. The sufficiently clever viewer (not necessarily me) can vaguely project the trajectory of the film from early on. As 'The Gentleman' and stage director, played by Vincent Cassel, says by way of describing Swan Lake: 'Everybody knows the story...'Nonetheless, Black Swan is far from predictable. Suffused with tension and suspense, Aronofsky massages fear and apportions violence and beauty in equal measure. Natalie Portman, apparently a life-long dancer, provides a stunning performance as actress and ballerina. She is enchanting and convincing: she seems like a real pro to amateur eyes. Similarly, Mila Kunis and the rest are stellar dancers and unendingly lovely. Cassel provides a subtle turn as the devious and brilliant theater director. Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder's characters are tragic and forsaken souls with just the right amount of darkness, threat, and suffering.There is a lot to Black Swan. It is symbolically rich and provides all kinds of food for thought for psychological analysis. It's also just good drama, with strong characterization and performances. To top it all off, the soundtrack, at turns pulsating menace and sweeping to salvation, and the claustrophobic, person-centered cinematography make the viewer feel the repression, passion, and fear at every turn. Aronofsky has shown that the psychological thriller is still fertile ground for imaginative, but accessible film-making.",9,7,15,13 December 2010
Atonement," Visually stunning but convoluted; not academy-award worthy, but worth a watch
","No rhymes, no embellishments, no adjectives... just kidding...This film is a chick flick, which I insist is not a pejorative. That is not surprising, but it is one of the reasons I didn't adore this film. It is suffused with the kind of hopeless romanticism that I find, unfortunately, incredible. Some reasons why the kind of 'love' displayed is plausible in this case: the impending great war, the ww1 environment, human nature's tendency to translate desire into love. Still, it will always be a mystery why people rationalize, or should I say excuse, sex with love? It's not necessary, nor is it realistic. It is however a fixture of the dramatic, romantic chick flick. Apparently, people find it beautiful. Nicely portrayed in this film, but not necessarily appreciated.Frankly, the most beautiful thing in this movie - no, not Keira Knightly's sprightly, elfin body - is its photography. The cinematography is excellent. Varied, unorthodox, meticulous, it is delightful and masterful. The scenes of war and Dunkirk are particularly haunting.Additionally, the pacing and sequence of the film are stupendous... stupendous. They are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, there is some amount of repetition, or should I say redundancy. The film could have been pared down. At 123 minutes, it is not excessively long, but for what was presented, it is a bit overdone and over-complicated. Additionally, it could have benefited from more characterization. The dialogue is smart and tight, but slightly sparse, especially for the minor characters.The story, of course, is one we have heard before. It is cherished, and treated wonderfully in this presentation. Acting is very fine, though I will never really fall for the histrionics of the semi-human Knightly. All in all, a very nice and even slightly philosophical and provocative movie. Who would have thought a chick flick could be so ambitious?",7,0,1,4 January 2008
