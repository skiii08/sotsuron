The Blair Witch Project," don't waste your money
","I don't get it.  I've heard the hype, I've seen the box office numbers, I've read the reviews...so what is all the fuss about?  Was this supposed to be a horror movie?  I wasn't scared at any point during this movie.  It didn't really seem like the actors were either - even the female character's screams seem manufactured and sometimes over the top.The only thing this movie excelled at was giving me motion sickness and a migraine headache.  Save your money and go rent a real horror movie like Halloween, Scream or The Shining.",Null,0,1,19 August 1999
