Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," huge misunderstanding (?)
","I have seen the movie a few weeks ago, and i've just read a lot of the comments here... i see that a lot of you people think that this movie is anti-semitic. you've got it all wrong,sorry. Cohen is presenting us a fool and naive -and i don't know what else- character, who thinks that the so nice Jewish couple has turned into bugs and try to poison him with a sandwich, so he bribes them with money to leave him alone... come on guys? Cohen (who, by the way is a Jew himself) is obviously m a k i n g f u n o f anti semitism, or at least he is trying to... he wants to show how unreasonable the hate or fear of the Jews is... I agree with that, cause i don't have anything against Jews or Americans or kazakhs or anyone for all that matters. But i do think that Cohen should leave this job for someone who is not a Jew, (so it would be less of a propaganda) or at least, for someone with the basic sense of humor...i don't think that the view of Borat making a fool of himself(at most times) or making fool of others(at some times), with gags based on ,e.g, the nudity of his over sized partner is funny in any way... how much did this movie cost, i wonder? ten bucks? a hundred? a million? i do not know. all i know is how much better would this world be if all this money could be invested on something else, like the help of hungry, sick , orphan kids dying every day around the world, instead of being wasted in the making of such garbage...",Null,8,13,28 November 2006
