Lucky Number Slevin," The Usual Suspects it isn't
","This is a pretty well done, stylish little McGuffin movie.It seems strangely 10 years late, as it clearly aspires to The Usual Suspects(1995) and the wave of look a likes that followed it in the mid nineties.The acting is OK; Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are never bad, although this one will not go down in history as one of their finer achievements. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett is adequate. For strange reasons I've never been that taken by Lucy Liu and Lucky Number Slevin doesn't change things for me. Seeing her trying to do Grace Kelly in Rear window just isn't convincing.As for the plot, the talk is witty and the surprise twist sadly not that surprising. Expect to be mildly and harmlessly entertained for almost 2 hours Â– nothing more.",7,11,21,13 October 2006
Batman Returns," Possibly the best screen version of a comic ever.
","This pitchblack screen version of the batman figure is simply as perfect as it gets.First of all the winter Gotham in which the movie takes place, is a stunningly beautiful, dark and gothic place, a precise interpretation of the best of the batman graphic novels, and perhaps simply the best scenery that Tim Burton so far has produced (even counting Sleepy Hollow). Second -the story line, often accused of being far to black, to me is pure perfection. Never has the dubiousness of the batman figure been better put to light, and the dark corrupt world in which he lives, is to me the essence of the batman myth. After all we are taking about a man who has dedicated his whole life to the vengeance of something that happened to him as an 8 year old. If people want batman to be light family entertainment, they can go watch the 60`s tv-series ('quick robin get the shark spray'). Third, the acting is sublime, Michael Keaton (normally not a favorit of mine) plays him with an intensity that makes Val Kilmer and George Clooney look like something out of the above mentioned shows. The rest of the cast is equally perfect, what makes the difference from the later films is that this cast actually bothers to act, not just make caricatures.",10,1,2,28 December 2000
