E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My 4th favorite film of all time
","This heartwarming little film about an interplanetary friendship is, to this day, the only movie that really moves me to tears. Every shot is heartbreakingly uncynical as Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas and a then 6-year -old Drew Barrymore try to save a well-meaning little alien from government study. Absolutely sweet in every way. An unforgettable film.",10,1,2,10 September 1998
Casablanca," My 2nd favorite film of all time!
","There is a not one wrong element in this beautiful WWII romance; everything is right. The script crackles with quotable lines; the classic song 'As Time Goes By' lovingly serenades every frame; delicious characters populate every moment. Humphrey Bogart's bar owner cynic is hilarious and pathetic today as he was 55 years ago. Claude Rains's ambiguous little policeman is a delightful caricature. And Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty is to this day is unsurpassed, lights up every frame with her luminous presence. Definitely one for the library!",10,1,1,10 September 1998
Brokeback Mountain," Bad Love
","Brokeback Mountain is almost like 'Boys Don't Cry' with the genders reversed. Both movies demonstrate, beautifully, the irony of a land in which the most sociologically restricting of areas are often the ones with the most wide open of spaces. Here is the love story of two men who cannot be in love with each other, and not just because society doesn't allow it; they can barely say aloud what they are. The second half of the film slows down the momentum and gets a tad episodic, but the overall effect is extraordinary. Ang Lee has been cinema's foremost chronicler of repressed emotions for the past decade, but never before has he allowed those emotions to explode and resonate with the clarity and force that they do here.",8,10,15,11 December 2005
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's best movie
","I didn't feel that way at first, but in retrospect I really do think it's his best movie. The plot is secondary to the visuals, but it's done well. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give thoughtful, romantic performances as a detective from New York City and the beautiful villager he falls for while investigating a series of gruesome murders the town believes is being executed by a faceless spectre riding on a horse. Whilst everything he knows as a scientist falls down around him, his love for her and her faith in him remain constant. And this is not the innocent Sleepy Hollow of Washington Irving's tale-- this is a farmtown overflowing with adultery, witchcraft, and murder. 	And THEN, there are the visuals. The film is filled with images that are vintage Burton: Ichabod (Depp) puts on investigating glasses, and the left lens is twice the size of the right; the staggering Tree of the Dead, whose branches twist in grotesque angles and stream with blood; and the Horseman himself, who lops off heads cleanly and with precision, has a decidedly otherwordly style. 	Overall, this is a gorgeous film brimming over with high comedy and winning romance. The identity of the person in cahoots with the Horseman is no big surprise, but getting there is the fun in this.",7,0,0,28 November 1999
Fargo," My 3rd favorite film of all time!
","This delicious blend of dark drama and light comedy follows the hilarious investigation of a kidnapping scheme gone wrong. The incomparable Frances McDormand gives a brilliant performance as a sweet, incompetent, pregnant sheriff and William H. Macy is equally good as a family man whose kidnapping scheme is falling apart and is making him implode. The screenplay is see-it-to-believe-it funny, the direction great and the cinematography perfect. Those miles of snow will be forever etched in my heart.",10,0,1,10 September 1998
54," Pretty good
","The details of the club aren't as excessive as I expected but it's still pretty good. The acting (with the exception of Mike Myers, who never comes off as anything but a hopeless drunk) is very good. Ryan Phillippe is really charismatic, Salma Hayek is touching and Neve Campbell and Breckin Meyer are impressive in wasted roles. Still, it leaves u wanting more...",5,0,0,23 September 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 2000's best film was not made in America
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a visually stunning, overwhelmingly powerful achievement that dwarfs any other film made in the year of 2000. Its combination of dazzling fight scenes and early-Hollywood style romance eclipses anything else this year. This is a film of epic proportions, without the oppressive running time of your usual epic film (this clocks in only at 2 hours and 8 minutes). The performances of the film's lead actors are so heartfelt that subtitles aren't even necessary -- the characters' thoughts and feelings are evident on their faces. And the fight scenes are a brilliant display of pyrotechnic imagery like no other film previously. Maybe Ang Lee will finally get the recognition he deserves come Oscar time.",10,0,0,6 February 2001
Schindler's List," My favorite film of all time!!!
","An absolutely brilliant rendering of life during the Holocaust; Steven Spielberg's powerful direction shows you just what Hollywood is capable. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give towering performances as the title character and a frightening Nazi commandant, respectively and Ben Kingsley is just as impressive in a quieter role. John Williams's wrenching score and Janusz Kaminski's excellent photography complement the writing and directing of this incomparable drama, in my opinion, the finest film ever created. May Spielberg live in glory for showing the world what horror lived behind those textbooks and what strength can emerge from that horror!",10,9,20,10 September 1998
Jerry Maguire," This was so good!
","A touching comedy about the way people feel about each other from one minute to the next. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is good in an Oscar-winning turn, but Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger are even better. I can't believe they didn't win. Dorothy's little kid is so adorable.",8,2,4,31 January 1999
Total Recall," Terrific science fiction
","Total Recall is a totally unique film with wild visuals, good acting and a better story. The film's plot keeps twisting and turning in ways that are entertaining without getting rid of logic, which puts second-rate wannabes like The Matrix in their place. This, like the Alien saga is science fiction at its most inventive.",8,0,1,10 April 2000
Pulp Fiction," Really good
","A genuinely original thriller that seems to tap into our psyche and knows how we talk. All the situations seem real enough. The acting is great (Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman, in particular) but the movie seems to have no point. If you want to see a GREAT movie on the same subject, see Fargo. It probes deeper into morality and desperation and is also a lot funnier.",10,0,0,19 November 1998
Scream 2," Not bad.
","The first one was brilliant but its material is easy to repeat and it's originality runs out quickly. Given that, this was as good a sequel as they could have made, although the media references stopped about halfway through. Great performances from the survivors (Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy, especially) and the newcomers (Elise Neal and Jerry O'Connell are very charming). If you aren't tense during the cop car scene, you should have your pulse checked.",7,0,0,10 September 1998
Scream," My 5th favorite film of all time!
","This sexy, funny, scary slasher movie spoof is a representation of my generation. Taut, tense direction from Wes Craven and a hilarious pop -culture savvy script build a fantastic roller coaster ride about real kids brought up on the horror movies we were and what they would do if they were trapped in those cliches. Strong performances from the entire cast, particularly the four leads: Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox. Don't watch this alone!",10,0,0,10 September 1998
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My 8th favorite film of all time!
","This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!",10,3,4,10 September 1998
