Skyfall," 00My
","Before I say anything, there are some minor spoilers here...Right, Skyfall. Bond movies are rarely compared with other spy movies, like Bourne or Tinker Tailor. If we're honest, we compare them with other Bond movies - because Bond is the longest running movie franchise of all time and there's nothing else quite like it. Skyfall, thankfully, is one of Bond's finer moments. Fittingly for his fiftieth anniversary, this film felt like a celebration of the character. He wasn't upstaged by the cars, the women or the villain (though the villain was a cut above the rest...). This was a BOND movie in every way.I was curious to see whether director Sam Mendes' claims that he had taken inspiration from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy were in any way noticeable. And I have to say in my opinion, there was a Nolan-esq feel in parts. Silva, for example, had a very subtle Joker-y nature which made him one of the best and most memorable Bond villains of recent... well, decades. Though the film was clearly a sequel, there were familiar elements that smacked more of a re-imagining for the 21st Century - namely the new Quartermaster and Miss Moneypenny.The film itself isn't perfect. I'd heard not a bad word said about Skyfall before I saw it, but I have to admit up until two thirds of the way through the film, I couldn't help but wonder what all the fuss was about. Not that it was in any way awful. It just didn't WOW me like I'd expected.That is until the final act. Bravely set entirely in Britain, the last third of the film was thoroughly entertaining with it's back-to-basics approach and tense build-up. It turned the film completely on it's head - from a mildly enjoyable Bond film to a deeply engrossing thriller. It also broke the mould and left us all psyched up for the next one - kind of like Batman Begins...A fantastic return to form and one of the few must sees of 2012.",8,3,10,1 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas is just like you and I
","Let's face it. We're angry. We're angry because the bearded one who blessed our childhood with adventure and action figures decided enough was enough. Looking out over his empire/ranch, the bearded one stretched out his hand and said 'And lo! It is time you kids learnt about relationships, politics and stuff.' So yes, we're angry. We want our toys back.But can we really be angry with George? Most kids that play with action figures get to a point where they like to pit them against each other in a fight to the death. Or hurl them off something high. Or strap them to a firework a la Sid from Toy Story. (Despite what Pixar want you to think, Sid is not evil. He's you and I... you know it's true...) Or they build a Lego house and smash the tiny little plastic yellow faces out of it. They do this because kids that like Star Wars have an appetite for destruction. If they didn't, they'd watch Star Trek Voyager.So how are we any different from George? He created a stunning trilogy in Episodes IV, V and VI. Not the most well-written I agree, but one of the most fun! Then he made the prequels, and smashed the stuffing out the legacy and reputation he had made for himself. Because he could. Because he's rich and they're HIS toys! I watched this film at the cinema about 10 years ago. I had convinced myself it was better than Episode I. Until I watched it again last week on the telly and decided it was in my top five worst films of all time. It made me balk and shake my fist. Deep down though, I wonder whether I'd have done the same thing if they were MY toys.But yeah, this film is awful. In every way.",1,2,6,23 October 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Monkey Python and the Flying Serkis
","This stands out from a somewhat disappointing 'Summer of 2011' as an excellent popcorn shifter.I certainly wasn't won over by the trailers for this, with the nasty odour of Burton's 2001 addition to the franchise still lingering in our memories. But after being persuaded to give it a go, it has to be the best film I've seen this year. It's hard not to connect with Ceasar (played by King Kong himself, the brilliant Andy Serkis) and it's very easy to forgive the occasional dropping of the CGI ball. If it wasn't for Serkis' performance, I'd say this film would pan.Which leads me onto to my only disappointment from the film: humans. James Franco and Freida Pinto played annoyingly wooden characters and were entirely unconvincing as scientists and vets respectively. Veteran actors John Lithgow and Brian Cox held their own, but were wasted in minor roles. And Tom Felton was definitely the wrong choice for the hateful monkey bully. He's spent the past decade bullying The Boy Who Lived and his merry wizards, only to set be loose on a animal shelter full of apes?! Perhaps an interesting twist would be to put a 'nice boy' in that role, like Zac Efron or (insert Glee cast member here). At least then we wouldn't have necessarily seen it coming.But I'm just being picky. The CGI was more-or-less excellent, the build-up to the action was a steady pace, and the action itself was well worth the wait. And the apes steal the show, and deserve many bananas.Oh and the 'PS. By the way everyone gets sick and dies' mid-credits scene also strengthens the impact of the film. Hopefully, a sequel is on the way... minus James Franco.",8,1,2,18 August 2011
Super 8," A Tale of Two Spielbergs
","I have been a big Abrams fan since I got into Alias those many years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the likes of Lost, MI-3 and Star Trek, and I even forgave him for putting Cloverfield out there (Am I the only person who couldn't get past the terrible acting?) So when the teaser trailers sprouted up for Super 8, it jumped to the top of my 'Things To Do in 2011' list.After viewing the film, I found it to be... OK. It isn't the worst film I've seen this year, but I was gravely disappointed.In great Spielberg-fashion, Abrams' attention to detail in this film is spot on. From the model trains to the bedroom posters, the '70s feel is very authentic and charming. I found the pace of the film to be good, despite many reports that some found it to be slow and boring (ADD and Xbox Live will do that to you). The child actors held their own, which is a rare thing these days. Super 8 didn't rely on visual effects, which again is a rare thing in a summer blockbuster. In many respects, this film is a success.For me though, Abrams was trying too hard to be like Spielberg. I know that's like me complaining to my wife that she looks too much like Natalie Portman. But I couldn't help but feel like Abrams had sold out a little. JJ can bring a great deal to the table in terms of making a fairly dull concept (Star Trek) into an exciting piece of entertainment (Star Trek). Unfortunately, it was almost as if he didn't have the confidence to create a film which he could call his own. So he put Close Encounters, ET, The Goonies etc in a blender and served up what came out. He didn't need to, and that's why I'm disappointed.Still, the Star Trek sequel is at the top of my 'Things To Do in 2013' list, and Super 8 hasn't changed that.",7,0,0,17 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Is it any good though?
","You can probably tell by the number of stars I've given it that my answer is yes. But was it an entirely satisfying conclusion? I write this just over 24 hours after I saw the movie in glorious IMAX, and I still can't answer that question. Don't get me wrong, it was epic film-making - the kind of film you don't come out of regretting that you paid good money to go and see it. I could reel off a number of positive descriptive words that have already been used by critics and fans on this site, but that of course would be boring.I came away from the cinema feeling a little exhausted - partly because Chrisopher Nolan and his colleagues seemed intent on Bane-smashing our senses to a pulp, but also because I couldn't help but feel there was too much going on this film. Not like Spiderman 3, but certainly enough for me to drift off from the film a few times. Now I've read quite a few pieces of criticism from people/critics that say of certain scenes 'urgh that's not very realistic' or 'he wouldn't heal that quickly' etc etc. I'm not here to wave a big Plot Hole flag at entirely pathetic and minor issues. To paraphrase Nicholson's Joker, in what kind of a world do we live where a man dresses up as a bat?! And to answer, we don't. The Dark Knight Rises is a piece of fiction based on a comic book. It isn't realistic. Nolan's trilogy may be more believable for sure, but I still can't find Gotham on Google Maps if you know what I mean...What slightly marred the film for me was the flow of it. I would have been quite happy if this film had been 15-20 minutes longer perhaps just so they could take their time with a few of the story arcs and not rush around like they did. I know that it might not have been a popular idea to have a film over 3 hours long. Perhaps the Studio applied pressure to cut down the running time. But on the other hand I also thought there were a few scenes/characters which could have been cut altogether, like Matthew Modine's Deputy Commissioner Foley or Cillian Murphy's Dr Crane. I felt they didn't really add anything to the film.Also, as much as I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his character was given an unnecessary amount of screen-time in my opinion. Some of the characters we had come to know and love were occasionally benched to make way for John Blake. (I understand why they did this for sure - I just didn't like it.) So was the film any good? Absolutely.Was it a satisfying end? ...err.....I honestly couldn't tell you. Yes and no? Does Alfred's performance make a grown man want to have a little weep? Too right! (the only other film I've wept in is Team America, but for significantly different reasons).Did it follow the age-old Original Star Wars model of a strong opener, better sequel and weak conclusion? I would say yes - but I would go as far as saying the Dark Knight Trilogy is better than the Star Wars Trilogy, and The Dark Knight Rises a great deal better than Return of the Jedi.Sorry to be boring but The Dark Knight Rises is engrossing, magnificent, and a breath-taking experience. And as for it's flaws - nothing that a Director's Cut wouldn't fix.",9,3,7,23 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Erm...
","I would very much like to do a poo on this movie. It adds to the proof that Hollywood is purely a business, obsessed with making money rather than pushing cinematic boundaries. Yes, the special effects were good - I was fortunate to go see this in 3D at an IMAX cinema. But the effects were not a great deal better than the first or second Transformers movies. It was just more of the same. A great deal of the world also appears to be in mourning over the removal of Megan Fox from the franchise. Yet her replacement was just as attractive and lacked the same amount of acting ability to make her equally as cringe-worthy throughout. And the potential for a higher class of acting was completely wasted by Bay as he reduced the likes of John Malkovich and Frances McDormand to mere extras. I would also have liked to see less of Dr McDreamy running around with his pointless twist in the story, and more of Laserbeak slapping him across the eyes. BUT... I enjoyed it. Despite being a married family man, there is still a part of me that would like to take a day off work so I can go home and play with Lego. For that reason, Transformers 3 put a big smile on my face. I wasn't expecting The King's Speech. I wanted them to blow stuff up and do some car chases. And I felt like I'd got my money's worth (IMAX is chuffing expensive...). It didn't matter that the producers thought that all you need to do to make a scene emotional is to pipe in some soppy Linkin Park tune. It didn't matter that they went all Team America on us. At the end of the day, the CGI still blew me away, the action was glorious and Rosie whatsername was fit.",7,0,2,11 July 2011
