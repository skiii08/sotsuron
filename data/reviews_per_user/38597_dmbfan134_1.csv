Miracle," Great Movie!!!
","One of the greatest sports movies I have seen; right up there with Hoosiers. Thankfully, O'Connor stayed true to the story and did not put a 'Hollywood' spin on it. Great to see actual hockey players in the movie who were turned into actors and not vice versa. Kurt Russell was spot on with his portrayal of Herb Brooks -- looked like him, skated like him, talked like him. When I first saw this in the theater I felt as though I was actually there. I can't think of any other movie that I have seen in the theater that the audience actually cheered during the movie as though we were all at the game together. For a person with hockey in their blood this was a truly an inspirational film to watch.",10,1,1,10 June 2004
