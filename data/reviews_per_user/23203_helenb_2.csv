Requiem for a Dream," A beautiful movie about an ugly world
","'Requiem for a Dream' - what a beautiful title, I thought when I went to see this movie. I knew nothing about it in advance, but the title was enough in itself to make me want to see it. And what an experience it turned out to be... The three main characters all have dreams; but, as so often happens, these dreams are confronted with harsh reality. In this case, a reality so harsh that the movie could end up nowhere else than in a death mass for those dreams. To accompany these three persons from the bright days of summer, through autumn, to the icy cold of winter was dramatic indeed. At the end of the movie, the smile on my lips had been replaced by a grimace of pain, and the tears that ran down my cheeks had been drawn out by an almost physical pain in the heart. If you want to be moved, see this beautiful movie about the ugly world that we live in.",10,0,0,16 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beauty, Romance and Strong Women
","A beautiful movie, this one. Romantic, exciting, a regular fairy tale! Wonderful scenery, interesting fighting scenes (who wouldn't want to fly through the air like that!), and interesting characters. One thing that I particularly liked about the movie, is that the female characters, albeit incredibly beautiful, are not mere decorations. Not only do they take action, they take serious action! They are equal to any man, even if their lives are regulated by what is appropriate for a woman, and what is not.In short, I warmly recommend this movie. It offers moments for both smiles and tears.",10,0,0,5 January 2001
