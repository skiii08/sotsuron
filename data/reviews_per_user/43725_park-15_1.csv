Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What do you need to be X rated these days?
","While I did laugh at some of the early scenes, the hatefulness and the movie's incredibly perverse nature wore me down to the point I gave up. I am not a prude by any means but I believe this movie should have been rated X. Anal sex jokes. Fecal matter in a bag handed to your hostess. The wrestling scene. Full male frontal nudity. Masturbation. I'm surprised the bear did not end up in a sex scene but perhaps they tried and it didn't make the cut.My 13 year old daughter told me all her friends had seen this. Can you imagine? This is what we are supposed to protect children from not introduce them to.",2,2,5,27 March 2007
