Raiders of the Lost Ark," Total Classic
","My local multiplex showed this recently in a 'classic season'. I have seen this many times on TV and video, but never on the big screen and I can honestly say that everyone should try and see it at a cinema.
Watching an original print, which is 19 years old at this point and just one year younger than me!, was stunning. I noticed stuff that I had somehow never seen before, like german writing graffiting part of the map room, and the strange plane in the background when Sala is lowering Indy into the map room. These little things made seeing such an all time classic film for the umpteenth time amazing. The packed laughed at Indy shooting the swordsman, even though we all must have seen it thousands of times between us. This shows the sheer brillance of the film. You can watch it again and again, but it STILL entertains you.As a friend said when we left the cinema to the strains of John Williams, 'They just don't make films like that'",10,0,0,23 June 2000
Snatch," Better than Lock, Stock???
","A fantastic film. Again Guy Richie has constructed a masterful piece of film. The story is much more involving than Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and as a result I've heard some critism of it. However Richie brings more characters into the fray for us to cheer and boo.
Apparently Brad Pitt, upon seeing Lock, Stock approached Richie asking to be in his next film. All I can say is that it's an inspired piece of casting, with Pitt possibly stealing the show, although the rest of the cast fight pretty hard to stop him. A cinematic piece of brilliance, showing that us *Brits* know how to make a great film. An absolute MUST SEE",Null,0,1,10 September 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," It's Fun and clever.
","People may say that this is degrading Shakespeare. However, I think that it helps to introduce kids and teenagers to him without making them read long Boring passages.It's well acted and very funny in places. It's also got a really clever script. I love teen movies anyway, but this is one of the best. A definite must see.",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
The Patriot," Insulting
","I have just witnessed one of the most disgraceful pieces of cinematography ever made. People may rant and rave 'Oh it's just a film, it's fiction, it's not real'. But that makes it worse in some respects. The majority of people's historical knowledge is now coming from the televisual/film media. People will believe that this is true.
People will believe that the British really are that evil. And yet American attrocities such as Vietnam (alright there is 'Apocalypse Now', but that's wiped out by 'Good Morning Vietnam' Look everyone in 'Nam' was happy and they had nice DJ's on the radio) and various incidents with the Japanese in WWII are conveniently forgotten. (ordering aircraft to shoot lifeboats anybody????)It's a sick injustice to the British people and piece of crass American flag waving. I am surprised that the film company had the guts to release this drivel in Britain.Insulting.",Null,2,4,19 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Wow.
","This was the most gripping and emotional films I've seen for a very long time. I watched it on its very first screening and as a result there were many ex-service men in the theatre. The total and utter silence during the entire film except for the ending where quiet sobbing could be heard gives testament to the powerful imagery concocted by Spielberg.Having watched the opening beach scene being filmed in Ireland, I had no idea how dramatic it would appear on the screen. After the initial 20 minutes critics said how the film went downhill. I thought that it opened up the characters and made you feel for them at the climax of the film.All in all the most powerful war film ever.",10,3,6,3 April 1999
There's Something About Mary," And the fuss was about what...?
","The funny parts were in the trailer. The rest of the film is useless time filling drivel. Simple as. Don't watch it, watch the trailer. It'll save soooo much time. 1/10 (I'm being generous)",Null,0,0,8 April 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," I have never been so wrong about any thing before.
","Wow. I personally wanted to hate this film. With all the positive reviews I thought that it must have been extremely overrated. However I have never been so wrong in my life. The film was brilliantly funny with a style reminiscent of the old Ealing comedies. The acting was strong with possibly the star turn by Vinnie 'hatchet man' Jones. (reference to his footballer hardman status) The plot twists and turns and has far more coolness than any Tarentino film (just what is Pulp Fiction on about?). It has a realism to it, you could see the events really happening in south London. In truth many may not 'get' it, especially in America as there is a vain of British humour running through it. But don't let that put you off. This is an absolute must see. 9.9/10",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
The Matrix," Wow
","What can I say. I really didn't know what this was going to be about when I entered the theatre, as I was dragged along by my friends. However once inside I was shown a film that can only be described with the word 'wow'. The premise of the film is one which could work, you don't really know. And as for the special effects...Many, many people have a huge problem with this film, but they are just not getting into it.You must see this film. I have heard it said that it will change your life. I was sceptical of this but it's true. An absolute winner,and worthy of number 20 on the list of top films10/10",10,1,2,4 July 1999
