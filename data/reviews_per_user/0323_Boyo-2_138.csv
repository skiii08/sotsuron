The Blair Witch Project," Either I am stupid or the movie is
","I watched this entire movie in one sitting.  Didn't fall asleep or read a magazine during it. When it was over, I had no idea what I had just watched. I did not know why they ran from the tent, or what was found of the missing guy, or what happened in the house at the end.  Now that its the next day, I don't understand it any better and I also don't care.  I usually follow a movie fairly well but I was as lost as the participants and if that was the point, then I still don't care.",2,3,5,17 July 2000
Saturday Night Fever," Completely captures a time & place
","This movie is as great as any other from the 1970's.  I was seventeen when this was released, so I saw it at least twenty times.  John Travolta is grace personified on the dance floor and does very well with the drama too. The weakest link is Karen Lynn Gorney, but only her acting.  The soundtrack is, of course, terrific in its own right.",Null,2,3,14 September 1999
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Intelligent comedy
","You can tell this movie is not made in America because it doesn't pander to the audience, is not sugar-coated, and is very funny and intelligent.  Guy Pearce is one talented guy; to do this and then 'L.A. Confidential' in a short amount of time is some feat.  If you are offended by drag queens or think they are a lower form of human being, you'd best stay away.",Null,3,6,17 February 1999
Scarface," My wife is a junkie
","This movie contains more quotable dialogue than any other from the 1980's. If the only scene in the entire movie were when Tony is stoned at dinner in a fancy restaurant and is talking nonsense, this would still be great. The only downside is the womens roles.",9,1,3,23 March 2000
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Glorious Ignorance
","I didn't like the Borat character when I used to watch the 'Ali G' show on HBO. He made me uncomfortable but then again I think that's part of the point. He says and asks things that you can't believe, some of which make the unsuspecting interviewee squirm, and some of the audience as well..at least, me.But I've not read such glowing reviews for a movie since...'The Departed' came out a couple of weeks ago. A reviewer said he's seen it three times and plans on seeing it again this weekend. Reviewers rarely gush over a movie. I wouldn't have been surprised if he said he'd like to kiss the hem of Sacha's garment.So I saw the first show on West 23rd Street..minutes ago.The movie is hilarious. Not consistently, but hilarious enough to recommend. There are a couple of dry spots and some of the jokes do not get the desired effect. However, the stuff that is funny is very funny. And when its not very funny, its deliriously funny.Borat is an innocent. He does not know what he is talking about. Until he is channel surfing and sees the image of Pamela Anderson on 'Baywatch' and then his trip to America, his entire life, has new meaning. He and his companion/producer leave NYC immediately and head for California, via Atlanta. He meets all kinds of people, most of which are scary as hell. The ones he does not humiliate, humiliate themselves, unintentionally. The ones he charms would not recognize charm if it had a neon sign. A lot of the trip goes wrong and he has a disagreement with his companion/producer and they part ways. He has no passport, no money, and accidentally burns his ticket back to his country (don't expect me to remember that particular place or how to spell it) so he's at a total loss..more than usual. He ends up in California and meets up with his companion and they find that, miracle of miracles, Pam is signing autographs for her fans. He can't even propose marriage to a total stranger correctly. But he ends up with one of the only decent people he meets, who, by the way, is the only person he meets that I could even imagine having a cup of coffee with. This country is SCARY. Land of the free my ***.Again, I recommend the movie. Highly. Several of the 'user comments' on this site seem to have missed the point. Their loss. For the rest of us, enjoy enjoy enjoy. The laughter will do you good.A reporter from the New York Post asked me questions about the movie upon leaving the theater. I told her I'd give it an '8' out of '10', which is what I am doing.",8,5,16,3 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Incredible and unforgettable
","I just saw this movie last night and I've thought of little since.  Its already in its own place in my movie-memory bank, and I am grateful to have the pleasure to see such a cinematic experience.  I don't know how the movie was made, I don't know how the actors did what they did and I don't know how much money was spent but its all great, I mean GREAT. Ellen Burstyn must be given a special mention, for the work she does.  All the actors are excellent but Ellen does some amazing things and should be remembered by serious critics at the year-end awards.  I did not know Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans could act, but they can, and they were fantastic.  That leaves Jared Leto, who was just as good as everyone else and breaks your heart several times as well, especially his last scenes. There is also a very strong supporting cast, including Chris McDonald, Keith David and Louise Lasser. I urge any moviegoer, casual or dedicated, to see this in a theatre.  I swear there are parts where you will literally forget to breathe.  No kidding.",10,2,3,19 October 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Leonardo is Superb
","Fully realizing the acting opportunity he was given, Leonardo acts his tail off in this true story of a real crook.  He's not as cold-blooded as, say, Angelica Huston in 'The Grifters', but he's ruthless, unstoppable and sharp as a tack.  In many ways, he was just ahead of his time. Today he'd be on talk shows bragging about his conquests and would seem right in time.  Back then people were more decent and trusting and he was able to exploit that. 
Steven gives the movie a lot of style.  It all looks and feels correct to the period but you are not assaulted w/this.  Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner are terrific too.  Even Tom Hanks doesn't come across as annoying and self-important as he usually does.  Leo baby, I missed you.  Thanks for coming back to the big screen. 9/10.",10,2,4,24 January 2003
Lifeboat," For Tallulah
","Thank God Hitchcock made this movie with Tallulah Bankhead, who never was successful in movies but had a great stage career.  She is great in 'Lifeboat' but everyone else is, too.  The level of suspense and drama is high, and there is one very 'Hitckcock' scene that is frightening and scary.",10,8,10,21 December 1998
Erin Brockovich," Good, solid drama
","As I watching this movie, I was not bored, insulted and since I didn't know much about the real events, it was interesting also.  By the time it was over I was glad I saw the movie.  Today I couldn't tell you a thing about it, if my life depended on it.  I am not saying a good movie HAS to stick with you for the rest of your life, but I should have been able to tell you something about what happened, I just saw it three days ago.   I guess this is my way of saying its rather unmemorable. I am glad it got made, mostly on Julia's name, I'd imagine.
And speaking of memorable - there is not a chance in hell I think anyone deserves Oscars for their work in this.  An Oscar winning movie should make an lasting impression, and as good as this movie was, it does not belong with other heavy-duty past Oscar winners. Ellen Burstyn deserves the Oscar Julia will win.  Sorry about that but if you saw Burstyn in 'Requiem for a Dream', there is no way you'd disagree.  I can think fifteen actresses that could have done 'Erin' just as well as Julia, if not better. Janet McTeer, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett, etc etc etc. are all capable but not BIG BOX OFFICE.I enjoyed Eckhardt very much and Julia owes him a thanks.  Their emotional scene on the telephone (involving her baby girl) is provided by the hard work of Aaron but Julia reaps all the benefits.",1,12,30,20 February 2001
Fight Club," His name is Robert Paulsen
","I cannot honestly say the majority of movies I have seen in my life ever said anything to me, personally.  Meaning I can relate to the characters on any level.  This is a rare occurence but I got quite a lot out of this movie -  a feeling maybe I am not as alone in my isolation as I thought I was. Quite a bit of food for thought. Maybe that's why I also thought most of it was really very funny - it hit so close. I hated 'Seven' but this movie really is amazing.",10,3,8,23 May 2000
As Good as It Gets," Way over-rated
","Can't understand why people are so crazy about this one.  I cannot understand it.  Kinnear was trying too hard, Hunt not enough, as usual Nicholson was in his own movie...never felt any connection between me and the characters, among the characters themselves...you know things are not what they should be when you go to the dog for reaction shots.  Loved 'Terms of Endearment' a lot, but this cannot compare.",1,12,30,4 August 1998
The Rookie," I was strangely unmoved by this
","Usually I am a sucker for this type of movie.  I liked 'Field of Dreams', 'Rudy' and all the other 'conquering your dream'-themed movies.  But this one left me cold to the point that I have no desire to see it more than once, and usually I'll watch ANYTHING more than once, even if only to verify how I feel about it. It was too long, it was predictable and manipulative.  Dennis Quaid, who is normally emotionally available, holds back here.  I was DYING for a scene of joy, some kind of release, and thought I was getting it near the end but was again disappointed.  3/10.",4,1,3,1 March 2003
Memento," Must be me...
","I did not care for this movie at all.I would never see it again in order to figure it out, it should have been available to me the first time!  Like I said, I am willing to say that it was just me.  I just didn't 'get it', if indeed there was something to get.  The woman I went with didn't like it either but said she's recommend it so that others can see it and then maybe explain it to her. Great!I liked Guy Pearce in 'Priscilla' & 'LA Confidential' and he was good here. Its not his fault.  Nice to see Joe Pantolaino in something where he is not obsessed with 'Gladiator' or ripping someone to shreds.
Bring aspirin and a college professor, just in case.",1,9,19,2 April 2001
The Fan," Defines 'stupid'
","Movies like this give all movies a bad name. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.  This is the cinematic equivalent of slamming your hand in a car door.  If DeNiro and Snipes thought they were doing anything other than collecting a paycheck, they were sadly mistaken. Just because they made a mistake by appearing in this, doesn't mean you have to watch.",1,6,19,3 December 1998
Shakespeare in Love," It was okay
","I found this movie to be very interesting, never boring, but I am not dancing on the roof either. Paltrow is the type of actress that keeps the audience at a distance; as a result, you only feel very little sympathy and understanding for her character.  Affleck seems out of place, Rush is hysterical, Dench is in another movie, but Joesph Fiennes is fantastic as Bill.",2,3,6,20 January 1999
12 Monkeys," Fascinating
","This movie is fantastic, original and has a killer performance by Brad Pitt, who should have won an Oscar for his work.  Terry Gilliam must have terrific dreams.",10,3,6,25 February 1999
The English Patient," Binoche made the movie
",Finally saw it last week and loved Juliette Binoche a lot - she provided the movie with a heart.  Glad she won an Oscar for her work.  A fantastic movie all around.,9,2,5,17 August 1998

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious

Billy Elliot," Who can I thank for this?
","The older you get, the more movies you get to see.  Some are not worth it but some are more than worth it. That is especially appropriate in the case of 'Billy Elliot' which I had the pleasure of seeing last night.  The plot is nothing new but the execution is fantastic and I was glad to be in Billy's world for ninety minutes.All of the acting is great but Julie Walters stands out and should get an Oscar nomination, at the very least.  Lastly, Jamie Bell as Billy gives a very natural & effective performance.I love this movie very much.",10,0,0,24 January 2001
Batman Returns," Tim Burton is a movie-maker par excellance
","Tim Burton certainly knows what he is doing.  I felt like he let Nicholson get out of hand in the first one, but here, he gets great perfs from Pfeiffer and DeVito and  Christopher Walken as the villains.  Burton's movies all look and feel the same, but that is not such an awful thing.  I thought everyone was a little tough on this movie, which it did not deserve.",Null,1,2,22 December 1998
Brokeback Mountain," There's this, then there's everything else
","No one has seen anything like this before, so of course I haven't either. That fact alone makes this stand apart and above everything else. Add to that the idea that more people will most likely experience this as their first 'gay-themed'(even though it is not, not really) movie, and you're breaking new ground again. On top of that, it just so happens to be a really excellent, thoughtful, impossible-to-forget piece of cinematic magic.First I have to give it up for Ang Lee. I really admire an artist who cannot be pigeon-holed. As much as I love a lot of directors, a lot of their work is obvious, and 'been-there-done-that' is the tired expression that comes to mind. We've seen it before. They repeat themselves and are more than a little impressed by their own style. Lee does not have a style that's his, he creates it based on the project. He can excel in any genre and already has. Verrrry few people can go from 'Sense and Sensibility' to 'The Ice Storm' to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' to 'The Hulk' without missing a beat. Then he makes 'Brokeback Mountain' and I, for one, am in awe of his talent and willingness to do something unlike everything else.*Remember you were warned about spoilers!* Seeing Ang & Heath on 'Charlie Rose' gave me insight that I was glad I had before seeing the movie. Ang's comments about Lurene's conversation with Ennis about Jack's death were very helpful, even though I would have figured it out for myself, it was nice to have it confirmed. Ang said she's lying on the telephone, and he didn't say why she would do that, but anyway...Heath's saying that Ennis was a 'homophobic man in love with another man' summed up his character in one sentence and made me realize how he saw Ennis. He also gave some insight into the idea that believed Ennis was never attracted to another man in his life, and probably not a woman either for that matter, but that he fell in love with a person who happened to be a man. This theme is very seldom explored in cinema because I think an extraordinarily large amount of people never consider that as a human possibility. Its really not a 'gay-themed' movie any more than its a movie about how to herd sheep or how to easy it is to get sick of eating beans.I have to say I agree with those who say its Heath's movie. It is true. He's quantum, he's in a place all by himself. He's the emotional core, which is strange since he's so far from expressing his feelings that it isn't even funny, but somehow he pulls it off. Its a perfect example of the more-is-less school of acting. Any character that says as little as he can get away with but at the same time provides the entire movie with its heart...In fact all the emotion you feel comes from a very pure place. Its not manufactured by the soundtrack or some cinematic trick or anything..its just there and it never rings false, a true feat in itself.Michelle Williams in particular broke my heart. I'd only seen here in 'Dick', a largely ignored comic masterpiece of a movie, and she's 180 degrees from that. She hits all the right notes.Jake is always great and the Thanksgiving scene with the battle over the television was so well done that I thought about that damn electric carving knife all day today. From his point of view, it may be unfair that Heath is getting all the press and praise, but let's face it, at least 80% of Heath's scenes are with Jake, so if he hadn't been as good as he is...There is also not one single scene that I'd cut, and I can't say that about every movie. Most movies have fat on them to spare, this does not. You get enough, you don't get too much, and then its over, and you're left remembering this simple yet profound story for the rest of your life.As far as awards go, I'm THISCLOSE to giving up hope that I'll will ever agree with the Oscars again. I've been disappointed much more than I've been in agreement. I am glad this movie has won all the critics awards; they don't have a sense of obligation or nostalgia or politics, it seems to me, and award movies that they just happen to think are worthy. I haven't seen anything else this year but from what I've read, I don't see what can beat it.10/10, obviously. If you see this and do not, at the VERY LEAST, admire and respect it, then I have to say, I don't understand you...",10,124,158,24 December 2005
Ed Wood," Murray as Bunny
","I know this movie won an Oscar for Landau and Johnny Depp is top-billed, but I wanted to call attention to Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.  He is hysterical and whenever he is in a scene, its better because of him.  When he says 'Me-he-co (his way of saying 'Mexico) was a nightmare', I laugh like hell. Also very entertaining in this homage to Ed Wood is Vincent D'Onofrio, who seems to be channelling Orson Welles.",9,0,0,27 October 1999
Insomnia," Darkness where there is much light
","Really excellent, thoughtful and intelligent thriller.  Its been blessed with some top acting talent, all of whom have another meaty role to add to their resumes.  Even the supporting actors are in tune with the movie.
Do not want to give away any plot points, nor am I positive I'd be able to. Its not that movie is confusing, but its strange in that I am not sure what I saw, exactly.  Movie has a weird mood to it and I can't think of anything else like it.Pacino has disappointed me recently, but he's back in top form here. Robin Williams took a difficult role and made it his, and he is excellent also. Hilary Swank makes the most of her role and her best scenes are worth waiting for.  Nicky Katt and Martin Donovan and Paul Dooley are also in the movie and all very good as always, and Katt even gets to tell a pretty funny joke near the end.  Also enjoyed Jonathan Jackson, who I thought was very good in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', and Maura Tierney, who each have one or two scenes.Movie is edited to the skies and that is also a good thing.  Near the end, when Pacino is screaming for a break, the editing makes you feel like he does.  By then you want to throw a valium at the screen to give Al some relief.Cinematography is excellent and the location where the movie is shot offers many picturesque views.Christopher Nolan is a top talent, and I can say that even though I didn't care for 'Memento' at all.  I can see why people love it so much, but cannot agree.  This one gets it right, for me.  9/10.",8,0,1,28 June 2002
Insomnia," Where its always light, there is darkness
","Excellent telling of a fairly uncomplicated story, none of which I will re-tell here.  Partly because I still have questions about it all and partly because I am not sure what I saw, but I mean that in the best way possible.
All three stars deliver the goods, but Pacino is in his zone and for my money, hasn't been this good in over a decade.  Robin Williams is also excellent in a role he was probably not offered immediately, but he handles it all very well.  Its not that his acting ability was ever in question, but when you play the bad guy, there are a couple of ways you can do it, and a lot of them are bad.  Hilary Swank is just a talented actress who can do a lot more than parts like this, but she was excellent as well. I could see why all three wanted to be involved in this project.Out of the supporting cast, I enjoyed Nicky Katt (he tells a very funny joke toward the end), Maura Tierney and Martin Donovan. Paul Dooley is there in the beginning and then not so much at the end.Jonathan Jackson, who I enjoyed in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', basically has one scene, but he makes it count.The movie is edited to the skies but that's also a good thing.  Its especially effective near the end, when you want Pacino to sleep so bad that somewhere I bet people are throwing valium, blankets and Teddy Bears at the screen.  You feel exactly like he does, or when you feel when you're just about to fall asleep, but wake up suddenly, with a shudder.  That the editing can communicate that is worth mentioning.Beautiful cinematography and worth seeing on a big screen for the scenery. Top work by all involved.  8.5/10.",8,0,1,27 June 2002
L.A. Confidential," Great movie
","I love this movie, it was intelligent, beautiful to look at, and had a fantastic screenplay.  I even like the length and the amount of characters and how you had to pay attention, which is not necessary with most movies these days.  My only gripe is the totally over-rated performance of Kim Basinger. Anyone could have played that part.  I always think that in order to win an Oscar there should be at least a moment of something approaching  memorable...where you can see why that person won...not in this case.  She added nothing to this movie; I thought hers was the worse performance in the movie (other than Danny DeVito, who was in another movie entirely).  Why wasn't Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell nominated for Supporting Actor?  Crowe could easily have won - he WAS that guy. Good, solid movie.",9,5,10,31 July 1998
X-Men," Wow...
","Am I getting too old to see certain movies that are out of my realm of possibly liking?  Or did this movie just stink on ice?Either way, I had a perfectly mediocre time watching it.  Hugh Jackman reminded me of 'Goat Boy', the character created by Jim Breuer on 'Saturday Night Live.'  James Marsden looked like LeVar Burton in his Star Trek get-up and Anna Paquin looked like she was doing 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' for the high school play.  I had to conjure up something to keep myself entertained...Its not that I was expecting this to change my life or anything but it would have been nice to have been left with one memory of what I saw when it was done.  I am glad most of you enjoyed it.  I think the best movies are the ones people like, whether they are good or not is secondary.  I just can't join the majority this time.",2,1,2,25 June 2001
Spider-Man 3," Semi-interesting
","Having seen the first of the installment, and pretty much hating it did not dampen my spirits going into this one. I was with a friend who had seen them all and was very excited to see this one, so I was basically just being nice and cooperative seeing this movie. Its not like there is a ton of other stuff worth seeing anyway...But it was very good. I think it could have lost twenty minutes along the way, somewhere, but what's there is very interesting. I liked that it seemed to concentrate quite a bit on friendship - the importance of it, the loss of it and the idea that it should weather anything that might get in the way of it.Mary Jane has the hardest time of it, in many ways. This girl cannot get a break. After being fired from her Broadway debut (there's not a chance in the world that would have happened the way it happened, but if the main character in your movie flies through the air, you cannot expect full logic and you cannot ask for the things you might normally expect to get from a movie) and then getting a total lack of attention from Peter right when she needed it the most, she's lacking several things necessary for one's happiness. Dunst does not have a whole lot to do other than look pretty annoyed most of the time. Its not exactly her movie anyway but you kind of want the leading lady to be a little less joyless.Harry is also at a crossroads. Having battled Peter and then conveniently forgetting it ever happened, he's re-born as a nice guy following his 'accident' and then as his memory returns, he realizes that..'oh yeah, I want Peter Parker to be dead', things of that nature. When they are unable to reach an understanding, they battle again but Harry's elderly butler butts in, telling Harry that Peter was not responsible for his father's death, and this does not happen a moment too soon, since Peter needs Harry's help in order to rescue Mary Jane from not one but two evil dudes who are out to remove her from not only his life but her own as well.The f/x for the emergence of the Thomas Haden Church Evil Dude character are very well done. The same cannot be said for the Topher Grace character, since they are fairly cut and dried.Laughs are provided by Elizabeth Banks, as J.K. Simmons assistant. Bill Nunn, Theresa Russell and Rosemary Harris have a little to do with the proceedings, but not much.Its not a bad movie, its just not that memorable. Its rather somber at times and even sad. It does seem open-ended in its conclusion, so many there really will not be a sequel. Okay with me. Better to end while you're ahead, I always say. 8/10.",8,4,8,21 May 2007
Zodiac," Wow
","The friend I went to see this with remembers when this case was in the news. I don't remember it at all but I was not much of a news junkie back then. With that in mind, the only thing that kind of spoiled this for me was that after reading all the reviews, I was told that the movie has no closure for the viewer, that the killer was never caught so you might leave it feeling a bit cheated. If the real killer was never caught and the movie is faithful to the actual events, why is this even mentioned? I liked the other David Fincher movies I've seen and this is probably better than all of them, in many ways. Its a careful, detailed telling of this serial killer that terrorized various communities in California for years. He's up to the task and did not glorify the acts or the criminal.After cops David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) investigate this case for years, it goes cold, as it would. Then the cartoonist Jake plays sets his sights on picking up the pieces. He's always been interested in it, but as a cartoonist (not even a reporter!), he's been very limited on what evidence he was privy to. He dedicates himself to it and unearths things that the cops missed. The movie makes the point several times that the police on the case, from a number of different precincts, do not always have their efforts coordinated.Two scenes are very memorable. The first when Toschi, Armstrong and another cop named Jack Mulanax (played by Elias Koteas) interview a man named Arthur Leigh Allen (he is played by John Carroll Lynch, who I enjoyed in 'Fargo' and 'Volcano' and 'Bubble Boy' which starred Jake) at his place of work. The cops 'like' him for the crime and the scene is very well done at creating tension from all the points of view.That's nothing compared to the other great scene. Its near the end and Robert (Jake) is going at the evidence with a vengeance. He interviews a man named Bob Vaughn (played by Charles Fleisher) at this home. This scene is straight out of Alfred Hitchcock..just terrific.Really great movie..don't get turned off by the length of it. It needs that much time because its complex. You will not get bored by the details either. 9/10.",9,4,8,12 March 2007
Snatch," A lot of fun
","Exciting, interesting, never dull...the ideal movie when you're sick of boring movies that have a ton of down-time!Complicated plot twists keep you on your toes.  Great actors obviously having a blast keep you wanting to know what they'll do next.  A very tight screenplay can have you laughing and a director in his element combine for a very fun movie. Have to see it again..I didn't see 'Lock, Stock,...' so cannot say Guy Ritchie made the same movie twice, which some reviewers have alluded to. But if that is half as good as this, its got to be worth a look.Brad Pitt joins a distinguished group that includes Dustin Hoffman in 'Dick Tracy', and Robert Carlyle in 'Trainspotting', as Movie Characters Who You Don't Understand Half of What They Are Saying...but that didn't matter one bit, it added to the overall enjoyment.",9,6,8,14 January 2002
The Bodyguard," Liked their kiss at the end...
","..but unfortunately it took over two hours to get to it.  Its a great moment and is very old-movie in its execution, but the movie preceeding it is mostly awful.  Don't read this if you want your 'experience' ruined..Kevin & Whitney have some moments of genuine chemistry. He is hired by her staff because she is receiving threatening letters and intruders (she's a double threat - big in movies and in music - just like Neely O'Hara!) but she is mostly being kept in the dark about her stalker because she might get 'upset.'  Her staff is comprised of shady characters, all designed to make you think any of them could be guilty of stalking.She wants her freedom but he's very professional - he worked for the CIA and still regrets not being on duty the day Ronald Reagan was shot - so They Clash, so that they can Overcome That and Become Romantic.  Inexplicably, his professional responsibility is put aside and he decides to accept her invitation to go on a date.  Being that she is a huge star, its unreasonable that she is never recognized, but I digress..He realizes that they should not have gotten close the Following Morning, and she is angry that they won't be waking up together anymore.  When the threats take a more serious tone, they agree to get serious about her being guarded.  You don't want to know the rest.  See the fey dye-blonde guy who is obsessed with Whitney.  See the co-worker of Costner trying to get some of what Kevin was given.  See the resentful sister/secretary seething at every turn.
The best is the Oscars ceremony at the end, where she wins, but is almost gunned down..maybe the killer was pulling for someone else in her category!
The script is a mess.  Costner is wooden for the most part.  Houston is very good but has a lapse in some heavily dramatic scenes.  I don't think playing a spoiled diva is a huge stretch for her but its good to know your own limitations, too.  As mentioned, the finale is very well done, very emotional and cathartic. Its the only spontaneous, real moment in a mostly artifical movie.  5/10.",4,2,8,19 February 2002
The Beach," Liked it for the most part
","I had read the novel of 'The Beach' and didn't feel that the screen version was that much of a hack job, save for certain questionable writing decisions.  Leonardo is very good for the most part but he does make a false move or two.  I enjoyed the last moment of the movie the most and will see it again to relive that. Two hours after it was over, I still felt like I saw a movie, which doesn't happen as often as one would hope.",8,1,2,24 February 2000
Scary Movie 2," Can't believe I made it through
","Every 'joke' was beaten to death so severely that they never had a chance.Everything that made the first one tolerable (barely!) is thrown out the window and replaced with something flat and uninteresting and infantile.
Deceased members of the Actors Studio are all so glad Brando bowed out.  I can't imagine him doing some of what his replacement, James Woods, did.  I have a hard time forgetting Woods did them, but I presume he was paid well. 
'The Exorcist' parody to start with was decent.  Veronica Cartwright actually looked like Ellen Burstyn as Chris McNeil.  Then the scenes in the upstairs bedroom were all unfunny and the movie never recovered.
Really horrible.  Thankfully it was under 90 minutes. 1/10, only because there is no 'infinity' rating.  An insult to the medium.",1,3,7,5 August 2002
Knocked Up," Funny, but not consistently so
","I had a good time watching this movie. It was a spur of the moment movie decision to even go to see it and luckily it was at a very convenient time so we went, the day after it opened.I can't go along with all the raves and user comments that suggest its this hilarious movie. Its just not. That's not to say its awful because its not, its just not what I would label a hysterically funny movie. Its funny but hardly consistently so. There are many lapses in the comedy. Its too long - if it were edited better, the movie would have benefited.I could also complain about the believability of the characters. I did not believe for a moment that Alison really liked Ben all that much, even after she said she did. Maybe that was the script, maybe that was Heigl, but I didn't buy it.A lot of the enjoyment I got from the movie came from Leslie Mann, who played Alison's sister Debbie. I liked her a lot in 'Orange County' even though she didn't have that big a role in that movie. She's very easy going, very likable. I like Paul Rudd, too, and he's very good.I also enjoyed Kristen Wiig as Alison's co-worker Jill. She has only two scenes but she makes the most of them.The actors that have cameos are also fun, notably Ryan Seacrest and James Franco.I have to confess that I find it a very beautiful thing to see a woman give birth, and that scene was very well done and very touching for me.Again, it was a good time, but I can't go quite overboard as some of the other users and critics seem to be able to do. 7/10.",7,2,7,6 June 2007
Taxi Driver," God's Lonely Man
","I've seen this movie at least a dozen times in the twenty five years since its first release.  I saw it when it first came out and it played in second-run theatres on double bills with other Columbia releases like 'Shampoo' for a long time in Jersey when I was in high school.Story is of a man who has little or not human interaction in the jungle of the big city.  He can't sleep and figures he might as well make some money out of his insomnia.  He becomes fixated on Cybill Shepard who then rejects him - on their first date he takes her to the movies but it happens to be a dirty movie.  This always seemed like a very poignant moment for me - to him, that was what couples did, they went to the movies on a date.  He was not able to differentiate between that movie and a regular movie, it wasn't that he was coming on to her or anything.  And it wasn't that he was completely ignorant either.He becomes increasingly frustrated and is egged on by an encounter with a psycho passenger (played by Scorsese) who discusses in detail what he plans to do to his wife, who he can see is cheating on him from the back of Travis' cab.  This scene is a riot and you might hate yourself for laughing, but Scorsese obviously is enjoying himself.  I don't think DeNiro says a word in their scene together.  He also fancies himself as Saviour - he tries to appeal to a young hooker (Jodie Foster) to go back home and live a normal life.  She seems stuck in her world until all hell breaks loose.This movie has become a classic over the years, mostly because of DeNiro's towering performance.  Many other things contributed to the greatness of this movie, not the least of which was the score by the great Bernard Herrmann, to whom the movie is dedicated.",10,0,0,18 June 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Sir, does this mean Ann-Margret's not coming?
","This is probably the most accessible of Kubrick's movies, and its also one of the funniest.  The first half, all basic training and all R. Lee Ermey screaming at the recruits till you think his head will explode.  He is very funny ('You climb obstacles like old people f**k'), mostly because he's not yelling at you.  I still can't understand why he was not nominated for an Oscar, but at least he was nominated for a Golden Globe. 
The second half is not as good as the first.  The movie changes locations and is mostly concentrated on one incident with a sniper.  I still enjoyed it, but the best is over when Ermey is out of the story.Also memorable are Vincent D'Onofrio, Arliss Howard and Matthew Modine, but its Ermey's movie all the way. Great use of music, too - when was the last time you heard Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots are Made For Walking'?",10,1,2,19 December 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Not bad
","I avoided this for a long time, even though I am a Leonardo fan.  It was not that bad at all.  I enjoyed Claire Danes and Leo, but the best scene was Harold Perrineau's rendition of 'Young Hearts Run Free'.  It was a stroke of genius on the part of the director to put old pros like Margolyes, Postlethwaite and Venora in this movie, as they know their way around a scene like nobody's business.  It's certainly more interesting than the version Kenneth Branagh will make, someday.",Null,1,2,29 December 1998
Forrest Gump," Only YOU can prevent 'Forrest'
","Did I see the same movie as the rest of the world? I thought this movie was lousy. It couldn't have been less interesting. The only thing that got me was how they made Gary Sinise's legs disappear; and that was a momentary curiosity at best, an interesting f/x. That was very well done, no question about it.I am very sentimental, at least when it comes to movies; this movie didn't touch me at all. Tom Hanks was obnoxious, at best. Robin Wright Penn is miscast and I have yet to see her in a movie in which she should have been in. I love Sally Field but even she cannot rescue this for me.This may be the movie I dislike the most...the fact that it won Best Picture, Actor etc. makes me hate it even more, and usually I don't care what the Academy thinks since I question the whole thing to begin with.",1,16,42,20 August 1998
The Passion of Joan of Arc," 'Masterpiece' hardly covers it
","If there really was a camera at the trials of Joan of Arc, it would have looked like this movie.  I cannot even believe this movie, its so great and Maria Falconetti is amazing.  It deserves the place in movie history it has and Falconetti is unforgettable.  When I think of the intensity of the movie, I almost blush.  I couldn't even watch the whole thing is one sitting but I will remember this movie as long as I live.",10,5,10,23 May 2000
Top Secret!," I know a little German...he's right over there
","This movie is very funny, even after countless viewings.  Val Kilmer is surprisingly funny as Nick Rivers and he gets great support from Lucy Gutteridge.  Seeing Omar Sharif is always welcome; in this, he gets to have fun with his suave image and also gets some laughs.  I prefer this to everything in the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series.",9,6,9,24 February 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," It was very good
","A movie like this doesn't exactly hit you over the head with its originality, and can only be as good as the actors. They must convince you that you've never seen anything like this before. In this case every single member of the cast is so good that they sold me on the movie from minute one.  Heath Ledger & Julia Stiles make a great couple and his rendition of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off of You' was one of the highlights. When Julia listed the '10 Things' she was crying and I was, too - extremely unusual for me in a movie like this. Everyone else was just as good and this movie is a keeper.",9,113,137,1 May 2000
Fargo," I could watch it every day
","I really mean that, too, and I will admit it helps that its barely 90 minutes.  Should have won Best Picture over the over-hyped 'The English Patient' but McDormand should have lost to Brenda Blythen ('Secrets & Lies').  Loved the soundtrack, loved the end, loved the accents. Yah.",10,1,2,31 July 1998
Notting Hill," Much better than I was expecting
","I don't really like either of the lead actors in this movie but they are both very good in this light comedy.  There are several things that are better left unmentioned (if she is the biggest movie star in the world, she would have an entourage or a bodyguard at the very least; his ignorance of the outside world is silly - he never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio?!) but it still works pretty well for the most part.  Julia underplays most of the way and gives Hugh Grant a lot to work with.  It was a lot better than I was expecting it to be.",Null,1,2,10 July 2000
The Aviator," Leo, Marty and Cate/Kate honor the best of cinema
","A lot of the critics have commented on the fact that the leads do not physically resemble the people they are portraying. A lot of critics say Leo is too baby-faced to play an adult male, that Beckinsale is not in Ava Gardner's league, that Scorsese has made his least Scorsese-like movie, and that the movie is historically incorrect in many aspects.Say whatever you want, but this is a well-conceived, entertaining movie, with all principals at the top of their game.I think Leo does right by Marty, and vice-versa. They seem to work well together and I don't think if Marty wanted Leo in the movie, there was no pistol to his head forcing him to cast Leo. In fact, Leo brought the movie to Marty, and there was most likely no pistol involved in that exchange either.If Leo and the rest are miscast, who should have played their parts? People like to complain about things like that, but all they are doing is complaining, and not offering alternative casting suggestions.Blanchett deserves the Oscar right now. In some ways, she's the heart of the movie. She can do any accent you want, and do it expertly. Why do the British actors do accents better than anyone? I saw this at the first show on December 17, and am going again the day after tomorrow. As a dedicated Leo/Marty fan, I'd feel like I was letting them down if I didn't see this at least twice more.",10,7,13,23 December 2004
American Pie," A future classic
","In twenty years, this movie will rank as a classic of cinema.  Just like 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' & 'Sixteen Candles', the movie is ageless & timeless.  Its my favorite movie of the year by miles - saw it with my Mother, who is crowding 60, and we were still laughing in the lobby on the way out of the theatre.  An extremely entertaining movie that you'll love, if you'll allow yourself to.",10,0,2,10 August 1999
The Bourne Identity," Classy entertainment
","Maybe its me, but it gives me a familiar feeling when I see a guy in a turtleneck sweater, an overcoat and a rifle.  I know its a cliche, but why would this movie re-invent the medium anyway? I also like car chases through foreign cities, passports and accents.  So with all that intact, I liked 'The Bourne Identity' very much.  It has all the elements of the genre.  You know what you're getting and you get what you want. There is no point in going over the plot.  It gets confusing about 3/4 in but it does not matter that much.  Its fun for two hours and that's it.
I have been a huge fan of Franka Potente since becoming mildly obsessed with 'Run Lola Run' and she does not disappoint.  She has some real chemistry with Matt Damon and has a very sweet, inviting way about her.  She is not traditional leading actress material, thank God, and I credit the producers for hiring her.  Even more so when you realize that Julia Stiles has a small part in this movie.  I am sure someone wanted a bigger 'name' to be Matt's female lead and it might have occured to more than one exec to switch Franka and Julia, but obviously I am glad that did not happen.
Clive Owen adds another strong performance to his resume.  He has only one big scene, really, but makes the most of it.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are known for their sturdy work and they also deliver here.
Excellent, summertime entertainment.  8/10.",8,22,27,24 June 2002
Cast Away," Cure for Insomnia
","'Way too long' is the first thing that comes to mind..If you're going to have a one-person movie, no matter what else you do, don't let that person be annoying, and boy oh boy, does Tom Hanks annoy me!From a logistic point of view, I find it incredible he could live that long. It seems impossible, but then again if he died there wouldn't be much of an ending, and what's shocking about that ... Even when he gets back home, HE'S STILL BORING!  He's just not a fun guy. I felt sorry for the volleyball and was glad when he escaped.  I would have done a lot to get away from Gilligan..sorry, I mean Tom.Seriously, there was good cinematography.  The island probably would have been paradise if the population were more agreeable.  Now I can see why Russell Crowe won Best Actor for 'Gladiator'. Having seen all the nominees (except Geoffrey Rush) I can honestly say the Academy made a right choice for a change.",3,1,3,14 January 2002
The Thing," 'Aliens' in a parka
","I enjoyed this movie very much, even though I don't think its particularly original or frightening.  The cast is interesting and after a slow start, it moves along pretty well.  Kurt Russell and Keith David have a great moment at the end and the finale is jolting.  I enjoyed John Carpenter's work with that kid with the knife, to be honest. But I understand this was his chance to deliver in a big studio movie, only to be out-done by 'E.T'.  Talk about bad timing!",Null,1,2,15 August 2000
Armageddon," Waste of time
","The best moments were when Grace Zabriskie gave her husband the finger, and when Keith David said something about the future of  the world being in the hands of retards he wouldn't trust with a potato gun.  Other than that, I was bored silly.  Could not distinguish one actor from another as they were all cardboard cutouts.  Nice to know that there are still actors who will prostitute themselves for a hearty paycheck.  Lastly, Bruce Willis is an actor who needs a good director, cause when they are lousy, so is he!",3,0,3,19 October 1999
Doctor Zhivago," One of the Best
","I cannot believe this lost Best Picture to 'The Sound of Music'! This is an intelligent and accessible epic, which so few are.  Christie and Sharif are beautiful to look at.  Great supporting work from Rod Steiger, and in my opinion, the greatest score in movie history by Maurice Jarre.  Its actually better than a '10' on the ratings scale.",10,2,4,30 November 1998
American Beauty," Almost classic
","I admired this movie more than I liked it.  It is very well done and all the acting is terrific, especially Wes Bentley. I didn't always understand everyone's motivation for why they did things, but that is not a criticism at all.  I have thought about the movie quite a lot since seeing it.",8,0,0,30 November 1999
Edward Scissorhands," Burton & Depp's best
","I love this movie very much.  There are not many directors who would attempt a modern-day fairy tale, but Tim Burton creates the right balance of fantasty & reality in the telling of the story.  Johnny Depp is perfection in the title role - also great are Dianne Wiest and especially Alan Arkin (who insists on calling him 'Eddie').  A movie for everyone to love.",10,11,18,24 August 1999

Spider-Man," Even Miss Muffet hates this movie
","Okay, so it started out cliched but I was enjoying it anyway.  By the time Tobey got bit by the spider (that would happen!) which happens ten minutes into the movie, I started to groan.  By the end I was running to the exit and felt like I spent a week in that seat. Tobey is great, Kirsten is great, James Franco will be great..just not here. The screenplay is horrendous - all the actors have impossible dialogue to negotiate. Several of the set-ups are ridiculous - Peter Parker at the wrestling match was the height of stupidity; Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe, in a performance which tops his embarrassment called 'Body of Evidence') is a stupid character at best and his Green Goblin was worse; and the romance between Peter and Mary Jane lacked everything you need in order to believe these two actors are really in love.  There are dozens more..Cliff Robertson gets a break by being dispensed with early on.  Rosemary Harris has the best line in the whole movie when she says to Peter, 'You're not Superman'.  J.K. Simmons breathes some life into the movie as a manic, hair-dyed version of Perry White, but then he goes overboard needlessly. 
I am so sorry that this was an ordeal for me.  I wanted to like it but there's not a chance in the world that's going to happen.  There is also not a chance in the world I will see the sequel, which already has a new villian in place in Harry Osborn (Franco) but will do it all with one less audience member - me.  3/10.

","Too bad Disney didn't let the  director put out the movie he wanted.  It might have been good.  As it is, some parts are staggeringly dull, especially while Philippe is on the screen in particular.  Then other moments seem to catch the moments that made this time memorable and movie -worthy.  Mike Myers is terrific in the only performance of any merit, and Phillippe and Neve Campbell duke it out for worse performance.",5,0,1,31 August 1998
The Fast and the Furious," A lemon
","I don't think this movie is worth much at all.  Too many stupid scenes, too much bad acting, too much to appeal to a 15 year old and no one else.  None of it was clever, interesting, realistic or worthwhile. 
The actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about? Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in 'The Faculty' and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she's wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn't she in that female boxing movie too?The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in.
Racing scenes are no great achievement, either. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Makes 'Driven' seem like its not the most recent disaster on wheels - at least you could laugh at that one. 1/10.",1,4,9,30 July 2002
The Exorcist," This made me love movies
",I can compare seeing this in 1973 (I was 13 years old) to seeing 'Titanic' last year.  Some movies are events; this was one.  I made my parents sit through it twice.  This was incredibly scary and well-done.,10,3,5,26 October 1998
American History X," Don't use the word 'love' in relation to this movie
",Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors of his generation.  He proves it again in this movie and shows how his character goes through a transformation.  Some scenes are impossible to watch but overall the movie sends a positive message.  Several of the supporting actors are also great. I am glad I saw this movie but I couldn't watch it again.  It amazes me that fellow reviewers have said they 'love' this movie.  That's like saying you 'love' a disease or a war.,7,0,3,1 November 1999
Pearl Harbor," Its not that bad!
","I think sometimes people find it easier to jump on a bandwagon, that way they don't have to think for themselves.  As Brad Pitt's character said in '12 Monkeys', 'there's no right or wrong, there's only popular opinion.' 
That seems fitting in the case of this movie. Its just not as bad as I was led to believe by movie reviewers, movie fans and Joe Sixpack on the street. Believe me, I know bad..I hated 'Armageddon' and that was bad!Of course its corny.  Of course the romance is strained at times and sugarcoated.  This is where the gap between the generations shows its teeth. Audiences today are unwilling to transport themselves to a time and place when life was probably a lot more joyful.  Crime was not that much of an issue, there was no television, and a slice of Wonder Bread was as good as it got.  People talked corny because the movies they were seeing at the time were like that!  So I think you have to remember that when jumping all over the script.  I do see a problem with some of the acting, for part of the movie at least. I didn't buy Affleck for a second and for my money he made a ton of bad acting choices.  He had no chemistry with either Hartnett or Beckinsale and I just don't see him as a leading man at times.  I did in 'Chasing Amy' and maybe he's more comfortable in movies like that, so maybe he should stick to that.  He knew this was a romantic war epic and Kevin Smith was nowhere to be found.  Hartnett is much more emotionally available but still has a lot to learn.  Beckinsale also seems a little uncomfortable with the material at times.  But all problems were overcome with the extensive attack scene, which is exceptionally well-done from all angles.  In movies like this, if I can sense the terror, if I can get a glimpse of what that must have been like, then I am grateful.  The terror was encapsulated in the screaming plea of an extra, 'I CAN'T SWIM!'  Whoever that guy was, he acted his pants off and showed me a soul in distress.  That is probably very hard to do, also..show that in two seconds of screen time.  Then the hospital scenes were also very well done.  The chaos that occured had to have been unimaginable. 
As a New Yorker who was 2 miles from the WTC when it was hit, I cannot begin to know what being attacked was like..but I do live here so it did happen in my hometown.  That day I had to walk home (that's not a complaint) and on the way I spoke to several people (that's not a complaint either).  I remember saying to one guy, 'This is Pearl Harbor' and that was before I saw the footage of the buildings going down, or this movie.  But the movie hit me harder than it normally might have because of the 9/11 attacks.  Seeing Americans being murdered in a surprise, cowardly act does not get all that much easier with time, unfortunately.  For the people around in 1941, these events were profoundly disturbing.  Everyone that complained about 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor' was really just complaining that no one in either movie had a cell phone.  8/10.",8,0,2,16 July 2002
Enchanted," Started out good...
","The animation was fun. Looked dated but it was probably supposed to. When she arrived in Times Square it was funny. For about 45 minutes it was very funny and very clever. It did not stay that way. It became the very thing it was making fun of so the beginning and the end were like two separate movies for me.I do think that Amy Adams is extremely good and has enough talent and screen presence to keep the movie intact even when things go slightly corny. If she's not real good, the whole thing pretty much can fall apart.James Marsden is also very good as Prince Edward. Having seen him in this and in 'Hairspray' I am beginning to think I should be a fan. What was a little funny to me what that one day last summer I saw him in Central Park, and then he had that scene in Central Park when the guys on bikes run over him...Went with several family members, all female, and they really loved this a lot. I cannot quite join them in that sentiment, but I did enjoy it more often than not. I could have done without Pip, completely. A little too cutesy for me, really. 8/10.",8,2,4,1 December 2007

","I need proof, verifiable proof that Joel is not fronting for someone or maybe taking the credit for someone.  It seems inconceivable that that hack director of such schlock can be responsible for such a towering success of a movie.  Colin plays an actual person, who has good points and bad, who is complex like people really are in the real world.  He can cry at one minute over a sad story told to him by a perfect stranger and be a total pr**k the next..that's how people are.  People have moods and some of them are pleasant and some are not.  He's showing you a real person. Matthew Davis is just as good.  Magnificent movie and nice to know you have it in you, Joel. 9/10.",9,1,2,25 January 2003
Remember the Titans," Profound message given Disney treatment
","Movie has a ton of value and much to teach audiences of today.  If for no other reason than to make sure that its shown that racism never was a good idea and its still not.  It shows the struggles of a town to come to terms with its inter-racial beginnings.  Denzel gives his customary humorless performance.  He is never intense when he is supposed to be, and even when its time to celebrate or actually breathe, he can't seem to do that.  The only scene he seems to be giving anything to is one where the Titans beat a hated opposing coach who referred to him as a non-human - in this scene Denzel gets to give the guy a banana. Perhaps Denzel was uncomfortable with the subject matter, but its not like the script was going to be changed so everyone was holding hands from the start, right?Will Patton is worse.  He's THIS CLOSE to playing more psycho parts like he did in that Kevin Costner/Sean Young thriller that I can't remember the name of.  He whistles when he speaks and its annoying.The worse is his daughter, a nine-year old who thinks she should be coaching the team.  I loathe children in movies who act like they're 39 and she epitomizes that.  Too much is sugar-coated and too much is never even shown.  Also you never see any prejudice on the black side. I am sure there are blacks who are prejudiced against whites as well and were extremely vocal in their feelings about that.  No one's black mother is shown reluctant to meet her sons' new white friend. Why?  This is what I meant by 'Disney treatment' in the title..some things will never change as long as movies like this are never fair. The best actor is Wood Harris as Julius, followed by Ryan Hurst as Bertier and Kip Pardue as Sunshine.  This seems fitting, as the movie was about them anyway.  Harris has a great moment, when a cop car pulls up next to him. Guaranteed that's unfortunately happened to him much more than it should have, and for all the wrong reasons, but this time the police officer is congratulating him on a great game.  His look of shock combined with relief and genuine thanks is worth ninety other movies and says everything you need to know about this movie.  8/10.",7,1,2,16 July 2002

The Pianist," Brody, Polanski Most Deserving
","For maybe the second time in the past twenty years, I am thrilled with the Best Actor winner.  I found Adrien Brody's performance to be pitch-perfect. It reminded me a little of Gregory Peck in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', who also won.  They shared a quiet intensity, an understated dignity and do not chew on the scenery in an attempt for attention.  Brody's win might signify a maturity among voters, a willingness to honor an actual performance on the screen.  So many people had Jack or Daniel winning, and I congratulate the voters on seeing what Adrien Brody brought to the movie.  Let's face it, with Eminem, Pedro Almovodar and Polanski/Brody winning, it might have been just an atypical year, and next year they can get back to giving awards to non-actors like Julia Roberts and Helen Hunt..I can't honestly say that I've seen another movie like it, even though there have been a slew of movies on the subject.  Several scenes are very intense, but you have to know that going in.Congrats to Roman, too.  If it were up to me, he would have won Best Director for 'Rosemary's Baby' in 1968.  Maybe his was a we-owe-you Oscar, but given his personal difficulties, I kinda doubt it.10/10.",10,1,4,17 April 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Masterpiece of movie-making
","I don't know if this movie was originated as a myth or a fairy tale, or is an original screenplay, but it doesn't matter.  Its a gorgeous movie which is never boring and has the feel of an epic love story. With that comes the struggle to be open to love, so anyone can identify with the insecurities and doubts that the movie shows you.  The battle scenes are like a dream where you are flying, just beautiful, mind-bendingly so. 
Michelle Yeoh is a great actress.  You can read her very easily.  The great Chow Yun Fat is just as good but Yeoh owns the movie and is its heart and soul.  Ang Lee seems to own every genre he works in.  I can't think of many directors that have such an impressively diverse list of credits that include 'The Ice Storm', 'Sense and Sensibility' and this masterpiece.

He has taken an event that everyone is aware of, and still brought so much more to the story that you find yourself thinking about the assassination in ways you never have before.

","The second popcorn movie I saw yesterday with a friend ('300' was the first), 'Ghost Rider' is another good time at the movies. Not too demanding and with nothing to leave any kind of an impression when its all said and done, you just have fun with it. I wish some of the actors were onto that sentiment, especially Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles. He's too deadly serious (pun intended) for what amounts to a comic book movie. At least Wes Bentley as Blackheart figured out the best way to play a larger than life character and has a huge amount of fun as the son of the main bad guy.Motorcycler Johnny Blaze sells his should to Fonda after he discovers his father has been diagnosed with cancer. He did not figure that although his father would be cured, he would die anyway, following a motorcycle jump. His entire life is naturally clouded by and altered by this act. Blackheart shows up, starts killing people, then Johnny discovers his alter ego, Ghost Rider, who makes Blackheart look like Bambi.Eva is along for the ride and she's lovely to look at but its just the 'girlfriend' role and she doesn't have much to do.A couple more laughs might have been nice, but like I said, its forgettable but not unpleasant. 7/10.",7,1,3,12 March 2007
Good Will Hunting," No, Bad
","I don't understand the hoopla for this movie.  It was all right, a couple of good moments, but it didn't add up to anything, and I completely forgot the entire experience ten minutes after I was outside the theatre.  Anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing should stay away, too.  I swear at times, too, but not like these people.  For the most part, an unpleasant time.",1,52,115,6 August 1998
Driven," Stupid fun
","There is so much to laugh at, so much that is illogical, so much that is painfully awkward..that I cannot hate this movie.  Its played deadly seriously, which is a shame, and for that reason alone this in a class with 'Showgirls', and Gina Gershon is aboard in case you want the movie to make the connection for you. Highlights:--Estella Warren is inexplicably always at the track, even though her main function is eye candy.  Why is she there?  Does she have an actual responsibility, or is she just 'the girl'?  Who paid for her to go to Tokyo, Germany, etc.?  Whose idea was it for her to water dance, and whose idea was it to linger on a shot of her feet?--Stacy Edwards is also always at the track, even though she is just a reporter writing a story.  Is one magazine article enough of a reason to follow the race car circuit all around the world?  Why is she given communication with the racers while they are racing?  And why is her name Lucretia?--Burt Reynolds recalls 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?', not because he's in a wheelchair, although he is, but because his make-up must have been put on a with a paintbrush, like Jane Hudson's was.  There are some very unflattering close-ups of Burt, too. You don't get a flashback story about why 'he's in that chair' but I would have killed to see him get tortured a little, just for fun, in a movie that provides the laughs anyway, just not outright. --The trio of racers (Jimmy, Beau & Memo) look like they were filming a gay porn movie and accidentally stepped onto this set.  In some ways, this movie is porn-level in terms of acting and dramatic intensity.
--Gina Gershon is just around to call everyone an a**hole, basically.  She is Sly's ex-wife and now married to Memo Moreno, a plastic name if there ever was one.  Gina breathes fire and has a semi-decent scene in a ladies room with Stacy in which they almost come to blows. It does not rival Patty Duke v. Susan Hayward in 'Valley of the Dolls', but she seems to know the whole thing is a lark so lets loose a little, which is appreciated in a movie where every actor onscreen is so constipated.--To be fair, screenwriter Sly does not give himself all the big scenes, and does not make the victories his.  But the man responsible for so much bad dialogue at least had the sense to spread it around.  His race with Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly), at 195 mph, through the streets of Chicago, is another highlight and the only time I laughed, and I laughed a lot.  A police officer clocks their speed but obviously was not concerned enough to follow them or anything.  Both men get hit with a fine of $25,000 but the Chicago cops had nothing to say about it at all.  Incredible. Robert Sean Leonard is around to annoy everyone and to cause unnecessary dramatic conflict.  The slap he gets was from Estella was from the heart, I am sure.  Originally I watched this only to see Kip, who played Sunshine in 'Remember the Titans' but I am glad I saw it, for its camp-value, ridiculous acting, dialogue cribbed from fortune cookies and bumper stickers, and for its throwback value.  Every generation seems to get a race car movie built around a soap opera - others are 'Bobby Deerfield', 'Grand Prix', 'Winning' and 'Days of Thunder', but they didn't have Stallone writing the script and Renny Harlin directing...luckily.",1,1,2,21 May 2002
The Elephant Man," Thank You David Lynch..
","..for taking a break from making Laura Dern movies to create this masterpiece that is heartbreakingly beautiful and sometimes just heartbreaking.  It turns out that Lynch is the perfect director for this movie.  He assembles one of the best casts in any movie, starting with a ground-breaking performance by John Hurt in the leading role.  Anthony Hopkins is just as good; he can say more with a glance, do more with a moment, then most actors can do with ten pages of script.  When he first sees John Merrick, he cries one tear and its perfection.  When you have a supporting cast that includes Oscar winners Anne Bancroft, Sir John Geilgud and Dame Wendy Hiller, you know you're covered in that department.The black and white cinematography adds a lot to the mood of the movie.
All in all, a must see.",9,2,3,17 May 2001
Coyote Ugly," Only if you have to..
","..or nothing else is on..or if you're a sixteen year old girl..then by all means enjoy but don't say you were not warned!There is limited appeal in this uneasy combination of 'Flashdance', 'Valley of the Dolls', and 'Cocktail.' If you have never seen another movie, all this might seem new to you.  If you've seen any of the ones I mentioned, or have lived on this planet for longer than five months, you can see it all coming a mile away. 
The plot (you should excuse the expression) is paper thin, the acting is amateurish for a high school play and the biggest complaint of all is its not bad enough to be good..its just bad enough to be bad. 
I DID enjoy seeing Melanie Lynskey, who was so memorable in 'Heavenly Creatures' and she did a passable New Jersey accent.  I guess you have to pay bills, but I hope she gets better opportunities in better movies before she is stuck in the second female lead forever.  I enjoyed Perabo much more in 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' but part of that could be because she is not carrying the whole movie with that one.  She does not have the screen presence necessary for you to even consider the possibility that you are seeing a future star.  She might be a legit actress someday, but you can't tell from anything seen here.  She is not helped by a dreadful script, though.",2,1,2,16 July 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Worthwhile for McGregor & Broadbent
","I saw 'Romeo and Juliet' so had some sense of what Baz puts on a screen. For a lot of this movie, his style is appropriately over-the-top and gives the movie a ton of life.  Then it drags some in the middle and at the end.  The level of intensity could not, I guess, be maintained, so you are left with some forgettably overlong dance & songs. 'Roxanne' took forever!I didn't enjoy Nicole as much I had hoped to.  I can see why she didn't win Best Actress.  Its not that there is anything wrong with her, but she's not sympathetic enough to make you respond to her plight as much as you could have.  Jim Broadbent must have been really great in 'Iris', to have been nominated and won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for that movie instead of this one. He's electrifying as the owner of the club who is also a thoughtless pimp. Seeing him do a cover of 'Like a Virgin' was a highlight for me. 
However, all good things emerge from Ewan McGregor's quantum leading man performance.  He is emotional, he can sing like a bird, and he has the talent combined with the looks to make you love him like you are supposed to in the great tradition of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant.  His underacting is perfectly suited to the movie and did I mention he sings his knickers off? 6/10, all for Ewan's talent and charm.",5,0,2,16 July 2002
Slap Shot," My favorite sports movie
","I liked this movie when I first saw it over twenty years ago, and its still great!  The swinging 70's get perfectly captured, by the music, hair styles and especially the awful clothes.  All the actors do their own skating, so you aren't distracted looking for body doubles the entire movie.  The screenplay is priceless and if anyone thinks its sexist - a woman wrote this movie!  This is the only hockey movie worth anything - hopefully 'Mystery, Alaska' can join it.",Null,27,36,16 September 1999

Jerry Maguire," Tom & Cuba
","This movie would have been better if it had just concentrated on the relationship between Tom & Cuba.  I never saw Tom have so much chemistry with a co-star. At times this movie felt like a male love story masquerading as popular entertainment.  But you had to put up with the ever-annoying other members (except Bonnie Hunt & Jerry O'Connell) of this ensemble, and God knows I can live without ever hearing THAT phrase ever again.  All in all, I'd recommend the movie, but probably not for any reasons that would be widely acceptable. Cuba's Oscar was deserved and his acceptance speech was the highlight of the night.",6,3,6,20 April 2000
World Trade Center," Meat and potatoes from Ollie
","Its a no-frills, pretty much cut-and-dried re-enactment of a really horrible day in everyone's life. Considering that it came from Oliver Stone..well, you'd never know it if it didn't say so in the end credits.I saw it Friday night in a theater that can be measured in yards from the WTC site. That might be like going to Philadelphia to see 'Rocky' or going to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to see 'Titanic', but it just ended up that way.Two Port Authority police officers go to work that day, and end up in hell. That's pretty much it. So do their families and their co-workers, but of course its a different kind of hell.Cage and Pena do most of their acting with their faces and, more specifically, their eyes, since they are pinned down for a majority of the movie. The wives get the bigger emotional scenes, since they have no idea what's going on, if they were even down there when it all happened, etc. Maggie is very good at conveying the frustration she's feeling, and she's pregnant, too. She has a good scene in a CVS pharmacy - she doesn't even know why she's there. Bello's at her best when she meets the mother of an elevator operator at the hospital near the end. Its a very powerful scene between two very good actresses. I wouldn't have mind knowing what happened to the woman's son.The most emotional part of the movie was the footage of the day, most of which I hadn't scene since it all happened almost five years ago. It kind of overwhelms everything else, but reality has a tendency to do that. For the first time since smoking was banned in movie theaters, I was dying to light one up.It was good to see Patti D'Arbanville, a favorite of mine, and Michael Shannon..the guy who hid under a desk in 'Pearl Harbor' as the **** hit the fan; here his character takes the exact opposite response to a tragedy, as a military man who goes to Ground Zero and finds the guys when no one else is even looking. Shannon gives the movies best performance. Also aboard are Frank Whaley, who worked w/Stone in 'Born on the Fourth of July', Danny Nucci from 'Titanic', Stephen Dorff and Jesus Christ. To get political for a moment, and the movie does it for about that long, too..Shannons character says something about 'this being avenged'..and he's a military man..when will that happen? When do the victims families get some answers, or better still, some closure? These questions are not answered here, but at least they are posed. 8/10.",8,3,8,14 August 2006

Big Fish," The lost art of storytelling, by a master
","Leave it to Tim Burton to combine an interesting story with a vivid imagination, a heart as big as the sky, and a satisfyingly emotional ending, for his faithful audience.I have to mention first that when I wrote a 'user comment' for 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' that I noted that when Ewan McGregor aged, he's resemble Albert Finney, and here they are playing the younger and older version of the same character. I'm not expecting a parade down Fifth Avenue, I just think it was a good call on my part.The story is too fantastic and too great to go into now. But very few movies (I can think of 'Fried Green Tomatoes' and, to a lesser extent, 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'The Princess Bride') as three movies which rely on storytelling to tell the story. You don't believe it all but Finney/McGregor do, and who feels like second guessing them? Tim Burton is the ideal director for the material. Its extremely moving and all the actors do wonderful work. I've seen this at least five times and it holds up very well. 10/10, and thanks Tim..without you, you can count the original minds in Hollywood on one and a half hands.",10,0,1,23 December 2004
The Insider," I prefer to nap in quiet
","God this movie felt like it would never end!  It made all its points 70 times and got to be an ordeal for me right away. Crowe is wildly miscast and not very good - was I supposed to see him as a regular guy doing the right thing, or as a martyr, or as a victim?  Crowe does not tip his hand enough, for me at least.  I never felt one way or the other about the man. Pacino was good and not over the top, which is nice for a change.  The rest of the cast is largely wasted, especially Debi Mazar and Gina Gershon.Best scene was Wigand's deposition, involving his lawyer (Bruce McGill, who was a cop in 'My Cousin Vinny' and a jerk-in-a-suit in 'Silkwood') and Wings Hauser (the deadly pimp in the fantastic 'Vice Squad').  The entire movie should have had the energy these actors put into their scene together.

Quiz Show," What won the Academy Award for 1955?
","Herb Stempel saw 'Marty' three times but is forced to give an incorrect answer on '21', thereby allowing whiz-kid-in-the-making Charles Van Doren to take over as the champion of the show.  Herb's time in the sun is over but naturally he is trying to hang on to the fame, respect and money as long as he can.  Van Doren is then tempted by the same things but due to the behind-the-scenes mechanics of the show, is at odds with his conscience. 
This movie is about several things and they all meld into a great period piece which should be seen by anyone interested in a bit of a history lesson combined with magnificient acting and clear, crisp cinematography.Redford hired fellow directors Martin Scorsese and Barry Levinson for small parts, and got a great performance from everyone in the ensemble.  Of special mention is a scene when Charles Van Doren and his father share a piece of chocolate cake. Paul Scofield and Ralph Fiennes are especially memorable as father and son.  I can understand why actors are in awe of Scofield, he really has an amazing screen presence and deserved his Supporting nomination, though in all honesty it could have gone to at least four of five other men in the cast.",Null,6,9,12 January 2001
Major League," Ball Sixteen
","This movie is very funny and worth seeing.  It contains every sports cliche since the Greeks first threw a spear.  It is not a great baseball movie but a great comedy.  The Rene Russo character is aboard for the sole purpose of being The Girl, so she is wasted.  There are several good actors in this movie - James Gammon and Margaret Whitton among them - which adds to some mediocre acting by Bernsen and Berenger.  Wesley Snipes first showed his star appeal in this movie and Charlie Sheen is tolerable for a change.  Why this movie needed two sequels is anyone's guess, though.",Null,1,4,27 June 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Brittany Murphy was better than the movie
","This movie had too many cliches in it - the characters, especially the scenery-chewing by Jolie, did not evoke any sympathy at all.  The best performance was by Brittany Murphy as Daisy - she got into my head and she was mesmerzing and I have not forgotten her since seeing this movie a month ago. It seems a shame that all this attention is being heaped on the wrong performance in this movie. Winona was okay, and I enjoyed Clea DuVall very much too. The movie itself was not that great, but I never tire of hearing Petula Clark sing 'Downtown', so I will give it some credit for that.",6,3,4,10 April 2000
Blood Diamond," 'Diamond' in the rough
","The second-best Leonardo DiCaprio movie in which the search for a diamond drives the plot, 'Blood Diamond' should not be written off as an 'old-fashioned adventure movie', or, for that matter, just another Leonardo DiCaprio movie..although, in all honesty, if it starred anyone else, I probably would not have seen it this morning.Leo plays Danny Archer, diamond smuggler and part-time jerk. He lands in prison for smuggling and overhears an accusation that Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) has unearthed a pink diamond so huge it could accommodate a hockey team (preferably the New Jersey Devils) skating on it. Danny arranges for Solomon to get bailed out and strikes up a deal with him - Danny gets the rock, Solomon gets his family back (they'd been taken hostage earlier) and that's how the two start their reluctant relationship. Meanwhile Danny has struck up a another friendship with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who wants the truth behind the civil wars ravaging the country; she knows the international diamond trade is behind it and she also knows Danny is involved with that. She needs facts to write the story that has to be written in order to shine a light on this tragedy, all the whole acknowledging that 'Americans might see sixty seconds of this between sports and the weather on CNN.' None of the plot is far-fetched, unfortunately, and none of the action, either, most unfortunately. There is a huge body count of innocent people, women and children included, and children are additionally seen being recruited to join the rebels, so it makes the movie less than enjoyable, if you're just looking for escapism. I found it very well done and painfully realistic. If you have even the slightest bit of conscience in your head, you will be effected by the movie. You might not run home and throw all your jewelry in the garbage, but as the movie suggests, you might want to inquire before your next purchase.The three leads are all terrific. Leonardo is incapable of delivering a bad performance. Here he is as good as he's ever been. If he's not, the movie fails, and he also wisely realizes that he's not the emotional centerpiece of the movie. He allows Hounsou to occupy that space. Djimon is one of those actors whose soul is apparent on the screen and he can and does communicate without saying anything - my favorite type of actor. Connelly is not just 'the girl' or just around to look pretty - she has a lot to offer on screen and also never phones it in.In the useless trivia department - all three have co-starred with Russell Crowe - Leo in 'The Quick and the Dead', Djimon in 'Gladiator' and Connelly in 'A Beautiful Mind', and Djimon just won the National Board of Review Best Supporting Actor award, which Leo won for 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape.' As I mentioned, I respect the movie and am glad that it got made as it may change some grievous wrongs that have occurred, but with so much killing and violence, its impossible for me to say I 'like' it, although that does not mean that I 'dislike' it either. Its a helluva journey, with all that that entails. 10/10.",10,2,5,8 December 2006

","I am old enough to have seen something exactly like these movies when they would have come out in the 70s. After 'The Exorcist', all bets were off for me. I saw everything, even garbage like 'Abby', 'The Devil's Rain' and I might have seen that Juliet Mills 'Exorist'-knockoff, the title of which escapes me right now, but if I didn't it was probably a mistake. I also saw movies at a drive-in, and if I have to explain what that means to anyone who may read this, I am going to feel older than I already do.I enjoyed the first movie quite a lot. It was glorifying the blood and guts of its subject matter. Zombies, the undead, and those who want to destroy them..boy do I miss it! I enjoyed Marley Shelton a lot; Josh Brolin and Jeff Fahey, too. I always liked Freddy Rodriguez, especially after seeing his Oscar-worthy performance in 'Bobby' and I thought he was terrific, too.Quasi-coming attractions were fun! Especially 'Don't', that one had me laughing a lot.The other movie..well let's just say I wish someone had switched the order so that I would have seen the second movie first. It was too talky, too much yak yak yak yak yak then fifteen movies of stupid action. Why didn't THEY JUST PULL THE CAR OVER and that way Stuntman Mike had nothing to chase anymore?! It was not too much fun. I did like the girls giving it back to Mike, though, but not enough to overcome the boredom I was suffering from at that point.Sorry that this didn't do better.

Pretty Woman," Tolerable at best
","Some of the dialogue is funny, some of the actors are great but for the most part this is some egregious stuff.  The Cinderella theme seems a little out of date in a hooker/john movie.  Of course she is entitled to dream but I don't think the movie has the slightest idea what a hooker actually has to endure.  I am not saying I do either, but then again I am not making a movie. There is almost no realism in the movie and you are told Viv is a hooker but there is no other evidence of that onscreen.  You do not believe for a second she falls in love with Gere - why would you, there is nothing going on between them as far as screen chemistry goes.  All of the drama is forced and immature.  No one acts like this in the real world. I don't know any millionaires or hookers, but come on, the audience does not have to in order to judge these people. I can easily recommend Laura San Giacomo's portrayal of Kit, Roberts's roommate, and naturally since this is a Garry Marshall movie, Hector Elizondo is in it and he is very enjoyable too.   Boy, someone up there liked Julia the day she was nominated for Best Actress along side Kathy Bates, Joanne Woodward, Angelica Huston and Meryl Streep. If you look at that list, you have to ask yourself that age old question - 'what is wrong with this picture?' At least she didn't win, thank God, thanks to Kathy Bates' unforgettable 'Misery'.

A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Movie
","I think its a good idea to know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it.  Now that I've seen it, the commercials on television seem to be giving away too much.  With that in mind DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!Its a hard movie to pinpoint.  Its not like any other movie I've ever seen, in that a character exists that is not real.  John Nash's mind is the reality of the movie and its not until the movie is half over that you realize this and its jarring that you've been taken on a ride with this man's illness, and accepted it as the real world.  Its also a very heartbreaking thing.From the middle point, John and you see the world differently because he starts to receive treatment.Russell Crowe does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance.  Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002.  He really is that good.
Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent Jennifer Connelly, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie.  Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect.
I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over. I was shown a person at their best and the worse and everything in between, by a masterful actor at the top of his game.I am sure Ron Howard deserves a lot of credit that he won't get, too.",10,212,269,17 December 2001

I started to think that everyone is so desperate for a good movie they've gone overboard in its praise. I know that the last two Marty/Leo movies had their fans but they had their detractors, too. Scorsese has been accused of trying too hard to appeal to the Academy, and Leo has as many fans as he has people who cannot stand the sight of him.At one point it all just came together. I guess you could say it snuck up on me, had an 'accumulative' effect. The last 45 minutes are just remarkable. Its so great to leave a movie with that rare 'I just saw a great movie' feeling. I'm still pretty buzzed from it.I didn't fell like Jack was just being Jack (playing to his audience, with whom he shares some sort of secret that just they know..WINK WINK), I felt like he created a larger-than-life character who's, of course, memorable as hell. Costello is perfectly suited to his legendary ability, and he delivers, and then some.The real substance is the contributions by Leo and Matt. Playing two sides of the same coin could not have been easy (how did they know what the other was doing? they rarely are on the screen at the same time) but it goes to Scorsese's skill as a director that they work so well together, even though, like I said, they are almost never together. Once review I read put it perfectly - Leo is fire, Matt is ice. You see all of Leo's turmoil just by looking at his eyes. They show you Billy's soul, his conscience. You do not see Matt's conscience, because he does not have one.Much as I love and respect 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator', let's be truthful here..Scorsese is at his very best with this type of thing, and 'The Departed' makes that point again and again. Nothing wrong with that either.A movie like this makes it hard to consider seeing something else. Why would you bother? So don't! I might not be able to go on reading that lousy book I started the other day for a couple of days. The movie really does stay with you. 10/10.",10,4,11,6 October 2006

Rosemary's Baby," Horror classic
","This movie is still unique and incredible.  Mia Farrow should have received an Oscar nomination for her fine performance as a woman who endures not only Satan, but Ruth Gordon as a next-door neighbor!  I don't know which prospect is scarier.  This movie is a landmark in the horror genre, and hold ups extremely well.",10,0,1,23 August 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," A simple masterpiece
","I can only echo what the rest of the users here are saying - this is one of the greatest movies ever made, without question, and in my opinion, should be required viewing for children.  Peck is magnificent and his Oscar win is one of the best in history, because he gives the best performance of his long and brilliant career.",10,1,2,6 October 1999
Jaws," I lined up..
","..with the rest of the world when this came out.  Its been on cable quite often but not until yesterday did I see the entire thing uncut and uninterupted. Its a good movie, not classic, but solid entertainment with some thrills and some things best overlooked.  Spielberg created some excellent suspense but some of the deaths are horribly overlooked, they seem to just have happened to move the plot along.  Its hard to believe that a beach community would think twice about closing down a beach with known great white sharks in the area, so to make that feasible, it gets laid on the politicians, who are greedy and untrustworthy in  every single movie since time memorial. 
This is very timely right now, in this 'Summer of Sharks' here in the US. Each time someone gets attacked its all over the press; two people died this past Labor Day weekend and of course their families were all over the news, being continually insulted and exploited by the press.  On the other side of the coin, you get 'Jaws' author Peter Benchley on CNN proclaiming that the sharks are more often the victim than the predator, so its just easier to ignore it all and say a prayer.",8,1,3,4 September 2001
Kingpin," Makes me want to run & buy a bowling ball
","Very funny movie and Woody Harrelson gives a great performance.  He isn't afraid to show something of his acting talent and does not phone it in at all.  You feel sorry for him at times and at times hate him.  Just like a real person.The movie is a laugh riot for most of its running time.  Even the jokes that are unsuccessful are not horrible, just not funny enough.  With the Farrelly brothers, it seems like you get everything plus the kitchen sink, so some of it will fail and most of it will make you laugh.",Null,0,1,23 June 2000
Bring It On," Quite enjoyable
","This movie was extremely enjoyable and I recommend it. The characters are not annoying for the most part, and I especially enjoyed seeing new faces Elisa Dushku (Missy) and Jesse Bradford (Cliff).  They have screen presence and should be in front of the camera for many years to come, especially Elisa, who is really very beautiful.  When you look at her, there's so much there, unlike most actresses whose faces do not say anything.  You can tell there is alot going on in her mind just by her face. The screenplay is intelligent and very funny and aside from a slow stretch or two, I really liked the movie. It is not like 'Clueless' or anything else, which of course is a good thing. One of my favorite scenes is when Cliff and Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) are brushing their teeth.  Its probably a throw-away scene and there is no dialogue, but it was really great, for me at least.",8,46,56,7 September 2000
The Waterboy," Agony
","I thought this would be funny cause it made buckets of money and I figured anything with Kathy Bates can't be that bad.  Well, I've made stupider mistakes...This movie is totally unfunny and I didn't laugh at all. Adam Sandler is only going for the 11-year-old boys in the audience, and everyone else will be forced to make a face.  The only Sandler movie worth anything is 'The Wedding Singer', where he at least portrays a person.",1,4,10,11 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Magnificent
","I just saw this movie yesterday and now I feel ridiculous for waiting so long.  It was really great and I am sorry it did not win any Oscars, because it deserved to win more than 'Forrest Gump', in my opinion.  Tim Robbins actually played a likable guy and Morgan Freeman was perfection.
SPOILER ALERT!!!I cried when 'Red' was given parole! I also should have known what was going to happen to Tommy Williams, but that caught me by surprise.
I do have one problem with the movie, but I got over it right away and did not diminish from the entire experience.  If Andy's cell was on an upper level, and in between other cells, where was this tunnel he built actually supposed to be? The ending was very cathartic, thank God.  After the brutality and injustice portrayed in the movie, we needed that. And the ending was very beautiful too.",10,1,4,10 March 2000
Halloween," Great fun
",I am old enough to have seen this during its initial release.  It was a Times Square theatre at a midnight show.  I can tell you that I still remember the atmosphere and the people screaming during the frightening scenes and its a great movie memory for me.  The praise it continues to get is totally justified and the movie is John Carpenter's best by miles.,Null,1,2,29 December 1999
Carrie," Eve was weak
","This movie came out when I was 16 and it was a very big deal at the time. Three years earlier was 'The Exorcist' and this as a follow-up was too much for me and my friends.  Both movies were so great and we saw them several times each. This is easily DePalma's best horror film and down to the smallest part, the casting is perfect.  I must point out Piper Laurie as Carrie's out-of-her-mind Mother; she is just as good as Spacek in the lead role and helps create the mood of the movie.",Null,0,1,22 June 2000
The Queen," Royalty ain't all its cracked up to be
","'The Queen' is an interesting look at the election of Tony Blair as British Prime Minister followed by the tragedy of the accidental death of Princess Diana, and how the two events effected the Royal Family and the whole country of Britian.Blair is looking to 'modernize' British politics, which has already placed him at odds with the Queen. He shows her the proper respect even though it seems the thing to do rather than a heartfelt, genuine gesture. He's not much on protocol either and has suggested that everyone in the cabinet be on a first name basis. He gives every appearance of being a real person, whose wife does not know or care how to act in the presence of Royalty and drops an 'f-bomb' not twenty feel from Her Majesty.Blair was elected in may 1997. In August of that year, Diana died. She was already divorced from Charles, so no longer a Royal. Its never stated by anyone, but the divorce was obviously quite an embarrassment and Diana's public life after wards even more so. No regret or emotion over her death is felt by the Queen or Prince Philip, but Prince Charles is devastated, and to a lesser degree of course, so is Tony Blair. Subsequently, the Royals offer no response of any kind, which is viewed more harshly as the days go by. Since 'there is no precedent' and standing firmly behind the fact that she was no longer HRH, the Royals are steadfast in their belief and stand their ground. Prince Philip and the Queen Mum seem to have the only views that the Queen can hear; she has only proverbial 'yes-men' surrounding her, and all that tradition of honor and dignity, and the belief that she knows the Brits better than anyone and what they expect from her and, more importantly, what they don't expect. Tony Blair finds himself in the difficult position of wanting to enlighten the Queen while having to respect her title. She's oblivious to the fact that Diana was deeply loved, apart from her marriage, and he knows she's making a mistake. Prince Charles is seen as something of a simp and never confronts his Mother about his wish for a public funeral - that's left largely to Tony Blair to do. She's none too pleased with him but one day realizes he's right. She's finally able to bend without breaking. The Queen makes a public statement, expressing a lot of emotion while actually showing none at all.Helen Mirren is an actress I've enjoyed in several movies such as 'Some Mother's Son', 'Greenfingers' and 'Calendar Girls' and of course she's very good in this movie. It appears as though its an easy part to play and you're not exactly stretching every acting muscle you've got so I can't quite jump on the she-has-to-win-the-Oscar bandwagon, although I suspect she will. Lately it seems all you have to do is portray a real person. In the fifties, playing a prostitute got you one. Times change. I have to say I was a little disappointed with the scene in which she finally breaks down long enough to cry. Mirren is seen from behind, and I always think an actor can cheat by not having to be shown shedding any real tears. Either that or the director finally gave up hoping for the ideal shot and caved in by request. After I thought about it I realized that by not seeing her cry was the perfect way to show her crying, as its consistent with the 'stiff-upper lip', stone-face image seen by the public.I also enjoyed Michael Sheen, who I just saw in 'Blood Diamond' a couple of days ago. He also merits awards attention. James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms are very good, too, although like I mentioned before, underplaying seems less impressive, especially when everyone is doing it.The thing I got to most out of was the that the events showed all angles, and the difference between feeling what you want to feel about anything and what you think you're supposed to be feeling. The fact that the Royals only viewed Diana in terms of how she effected them and their legacy seemed grossly unfair, both to her and to themselves. She was a remarkable woman and the world lost a real treasure when she died prematurely.8/10.",8,1,2,14 December 2006
Raging Bull," The best

The Silence of the Lambs," I hate this movie with a passion
","Other than Anthony Hopkin's performance, this movie has no value whatsoever and, in my opinion, is the worse movie to sweep the Oscars.

Any Given Sunday," The usual Oliver Stone treatment
","If you've ever seen more than three Oliver Stone-directed movies, they all start to look and feel the same. You can tell one without even seeing the credits. He is not really interested in how you feel or how his characters feel so his movies are usually very entertaining but emotionally barren.This epic is no exception.  It did not matter a damn to me what happened to anyone in the movie, which is unfortunate since you are spending over 2 1/2 hours with these people. Too many scenes are redundant - Al getting wasted at the course of his life, at least three/four times? He was starting to remind me of 'Scarface' and I was waiting for a speech to go along with his misery.  OK, I get it, he's discontent.  I don't need a brick wall to fall on me to get that point across. Of the gigantic cast, only Dennis Quaid actually looks like a football player.  Jamie Foxx has some great moments and some not so great. I thought Al Pacino was wildly miscast but it was great to see him again, and I enjoyed a couple of his scenes with Ann-Margret.  Cameron Diaz was completely one-note, as was James Woods and Lauren Holly. Lela Rochon comes off best out of the 'wives/girlfriends' contingent. This is not a big deal, but it kind of bothered me...at one point, Al is watching 'Ben-Hur' and you get to see several scenes from that movie, including star Charlton Heston.  Later in the movie, Heston shows up as the Commissioner!  Granted, he's forty years older now, but still...was Gregory Peck too busy?  Its a three minute cameo, someone else should be been hired to avoid the distraction.But if you're not that excited about the movie you're watching, something like this can give you something to think about, though.",7,1,2,8 January 2001
Trainspotting," Starmaking performance by Ewan McGregor
","Ewan McGregor joins Diana Ross, Matt Dillon and Leonardo DiCaprio as the screen's best junkies.  Seeing the movie at this late date (last night!), I can understand why he is one of the most sought-after actors.  I did enjoy the movie, although I did not understand half of Robert Carlyle's dialogue, and it seems some characters are dropped inexplicably, and the end was a bit of a cheat.  Danny Boyle's direction was great - can't wait for 'The Beach'.",8,0,0,4 February 1999
Speed," When action compensates for logic
","A thriller must be logical all the way down the line.  It has to be very well-thought out from a writers standpoint.  If the early scenes are referenced later in the movie, they must be treated logically.  If peoples' lives are on the line, as an audience member you realize that their main purpose in the movie is to move that plot along, that they are devices for the writer, not actually PEOPLE in the best possible sense.  In this way, the movie got it fairly right.  No one on that bus is anything more than a stereotyped stock character, taken from many an Irwin Allen disasterous background. The villian should be colorful, have a variety of snide remarks with which to arm himself against the hero, and have a bone to pick with humanity as a whole.  The hero should have at least one expression other than anger, and the leading lady, if there is room for one in the budget, should be asking the illogical questions most of the audience wants an answer to. 
It should all add up at the end, it should be accountable to itself. 
This is not that movie although it got some things right.  Bullock was not yet a star so had little to lose by just being herself.  Keanu is so one-note that he looks constipated.  Casting Dennis Hopper as a villian is as original as casting Meg Ryan as a bagette-carrying New Yorker with a laptop and a mop-top haircut, who has a lot to give the right guy. 
Unfortunately, Jeff Daniels, Glenn Plummer and Joe Morton, previously thought to respect their craft, are along for the ride, too.
One question - how did the bus still run after the gas tank was punctured? Just curious.   I have two dozen similar questions, but need an answer to that one first.  If that has a decent answer, then maybe its just me alone that expects it all to make some sense.  3/10.",3,5,12,5 August 2002
Amélie," This is rated so highly cause it deserves it
","A slice of heaven right here on earth, 'Amelie' is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. 
Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character.  A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street. 
Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked 'Are you a congenital shmuck'?But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course.
Just beautiful.  10/10.",10,442,538,1 March 2003
The Sixth Sense," Ending ruined, therefore not much to enjoy
","Since I just saw this movie but knew the outcome, it was probably not as much fun as the opening weekend audience experienced.  I am willing to admit that that might have taken away from the whole thing. But I still don't think its a very good movie.  The whole thing with the color red seems very cheap and obvious.The best scene was the 'communication' scene between Osment and Collette in the car.  I could have used that scene a lot earlier, though.   Both actors were very good and deserved their nominations, but I am not so sure about the other nominations. I think this has been a little over-hyped.",5,2,3,3 October 2000

","I think everyone is making such a big deal out of this because Jim Carrey has done a dramatic movie.

If you really think about it, if it was made with Jeff Bridges or another actor, it wouldn't get any attention at all.",8,0,0,8 February 1999
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'How's it going, Royal Ugly Dudes?'
","This is a very good movie, which is weird cause its about a duo of nitwits. Normally nitwits are frustrating and overly obnoxious, but Bill and Ted are not. They cleverly get help with their History exam from Rufus, played by George Carlin, who arranges for them to be able to time travel.  They get the idea to bring back some of history's greatest leaders to San Dimas, California, for their exam.  Along the way, they encounter some 'beautiful babes', Socrates (which they pronounce 'So crates') and Beethoven (which they pronounce 'Bee Thoven').Winning story, acting and it actually is a little touching at the end, when Abraham Lincoln speaks.  Nice going, dudes!",9,0,0,7 August 2001
Thirteen Days," Excellent, solid historical drama
","There does not seem to be any reason to see this movie more than twice, but it is worth seeing once. Clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, its not that its boring, its just that it gets a little redundant.  Okay, Costner is frightened, I got that already, the 26th time.  I don't need him getting on line for confession or telling his wife to get ready for the unthinkable to realize that this was an extremely serious time in history.  Show me someone else having anxiety, he can't have cornered the market on that particular emotion. Possibly more time would have been better spent showing Joe Sixpack and his family and their reaction.  99% of the movie takes place inside the White House, it might have been nice to open it up a little.
But its all still really fascinating.  The politics and the politicians, the assuming you know what the enemy is doing, the power struggles, the second-guessing..its all right here. All the casting is fantastic.  Bruce Greenwood is not doing a party imitation and even gets in some subtle references to Kennedy's chronic bad back, without making a big deal of it.  Costner's accent was overdone at times but he is, for better or worse, the soul of the movie and you see a lot of it through his eyes.  All the supporting actors are great, but I enjoyed Christopher Lawford's couple of scenes the most.  I had assumed when I saw his name in the credits he would be playing his father Peter, who he resembles, but he does not.  He's also in on the only laugh supplied by the movie - a pushy White House receptionist gets off a funny line, which is much appreciated.
8/10.  Solid movie making, fascinating topic..and unfortunately, more timely to current events than any of us would like.",8,1,1,14 January 2002
300," Pass the popcorn
","I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I was expecting to. Its fun, its a popcorn movie. Sit back, watch the thing and then don't think about it too much afterward.Its not 'Gladiator' though I think it was aiming that high. The scenes of characters in fields reminded me of that epic. Also some of the dialogue makes profound statements about glory and honor and all that kind of thing.Gerard Butler has the whole movie in his hands and is up to the task. He did not say or do anything ridiculous, contrary to some of the nastier reviews I've read. He seems perfectly cast in this sort of thing.I'm not a teenager, I've never even played a video game so I don't pretend to know a lot about one looks like, but I enjoyed it anyway. 8/10.",8,2,11,12 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," Thank God for Jim Caviezel
","If the character Jim Caviezel played was not in this movie, this would have been unwatchable.  As it is, its no great shakes, but it is not awful either.  Rip out 45 minutes and then maybe you will have something good. It's slightly misleading to list actors like Clooney, Travolta and Jared Leto on the posters and ads, when in actuality their screen time amounts to the single digits.  Caviezel and Elias Koteas make the entire movie; I hope Caviezel has a fantastic career in front of him cause this guy is gold.",Null,0,0,21 December 1998
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Alot to recommend here
","On my third try I finally saw this entire movie recently.  I did not read the novel so do not feel one way or another about the screen version.  I enjoyed the acting from the leads to the smaller parts, but the acting honors go to Kirsten Dunst.  As a beautiful young girl who is robbed of her youth by a vampire, she lashes back at her attackers with a passion that was beautiful to behold. Tom and Brad are sometimes very funny and seem like an actual male couple, especially when they are bickering or Tom is teasing him.  The movie has more to say about life today than I would have thought possible, and gives the viewer much to think about when its over.  The fantastic sets, costumes and soundtrack work together to make this a complete package.  You are even smiling when its over!",8,2,4,22 August 2000
Jackie Brown," Extremely enjoyable
","It cannot be said that Tarantino movies are ever boring.  There is always something interesting going on.  I felt 'Pulp Fiction'  humanized the criminals to the point that they were supposed to be cuddly, but this movie did not do that.  I was also happy to see mature, middle-aged adults in a movie; Forster's craggy face was a study in lifes' journeys, and his scenes with Pam Grier were beautiful.  As always, a 'killer' soundtrack helps.  The other thing that bothered me was DeNiro was sleepwalking through his part, and I kept thinking about how anyone else would have been better.",Null,0,0,28 December 1998
Gangs of New York," Excellent Scorsese epic
","Okay, so Marty DOES seem more comfortable doing modern, urban dramas, but since this is his dream project, I don't think it'll kill anyone to give it more respect than they might want to.  Its a fine movie, if not entirely successful. The plot is pretty thin but its the characters that make the movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting as Bill the Butcher, who pretty much runs the entire show.  Everything that happens is filtered through Bill's eye (the fake one) and what he says goes.  DiCaprio is Amsterdam, who gives an understated performance, and more power to him.  He knows Daniel is the better actor and has the better part in the movie. They can't BOTH be larger than life, so Leo wisely lets his co-star run with it.  Ditto Cameron Diaz, and the rest of the cast.  Kudos to Marty for getting it all right.  I enjoyed the movie very much but did not feel as satisfied as I would have liked at the end.  Still, I hope Scorsese wins his first Best Director Oscar at the end of this month.  8/10.",9,0,0,1 March 2003
The Breakfast Club," Holds up surprisingly well
","I saw this movie when it was first released and I enjoyed it quite alot.  I saw it for the second time last week and I was surprised how well it held up - probably because the actors are so good at portraying actual human beings, unlike most 'teen' comedies.  I liked the dramatic sections better - Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez share a very heartfelt scene that is very well done.  The end of the movie drags it down slightly, as the movie stretches the credibility of the relationships that have developed.  But it is still a very good movie.",8,1,2,23 August 1999
Gladiator," Yes, Joey, I like gladiator movies
","If you see Peter Graves, tell him there is a gladiator movie for all of us to like!The movie is a class act all the way, with the elements of an epic intact. Crowe and the cast are terrific, even though I had a problem with Joaquin Phoenix occasionally.  Nice to see Oliver Reed go out with a great role. 
I hope the movie does well and I am glad it got made.  I cannot say it left me breathless or awestruck, but I enjoy it.",10,0,0,8 May 2000
Donnie Darko," Worth seeing at least 5 times..a week
","If I had $20 to spare, I'd buy this and have it running constantly.  This is the rare movie that is so interesting and gives the viewer so much to contemplate that you are grateful for the cinematic feast.  I've only seen it once and that is not nearly enough.  Jake makes a great choice.  I like that he picks non-mainstream choices, for the most part.  He's perfectly cast as Donnie, who is kind of like James Stewart on mushrooms.  There is no need to re-tell the details of the plot.  Suffice to say that its all real good and for me it was a joy without parallel to see Katharine Ross in a movie again.  ELAINE!!!!!!  I love you.10/10.  See it if you care about movies at all.",10,1,6,25 January 2003
The Wedding Singer," Hugely enjoyable
","I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to.  I am not an Adam Sandler fan, but he was good in this.  Drew Barrymore is really good, though, and she makes the movie as entertaining as it is.  I could have done with one less 80's reference and the appearance of Billy Idol at the end should have been more fun, but I still think it's a good movie.",6,1,1,22 February 1999

The Birds," Blame the lovebirds
","When I was a kid watching this movie, I assumed the lovebirds that Melanie brought to Cathy caused all the problems.  I was angry that at the hysterical woman in the diner who blamed Melanie for the attacks, and I was scared by the 'other world' feeling you get from the movie.
Upon recent viewing, I'm not sure I was right, but this is still a fantastic movie and I love the uncertainy at the end.  I have read that Hitchcock wanted more of an mysterious ending, but the studio would not allow it. There is a lot going on in this movie and is worthy of repeated viewings.",10,4,7,19 October 1999

","Like the majority of the civilized world, this is one of the best movie memories I have from childhood.  It still holds up today and is still oddly satisfying.Judy Garland and the whole cast did great work and this movie is not a yearly ritual on TV for decades for nothing.  It is just as good as that other classic from 1939, 'Gone with the Wind'.  But I can't believe it didn't win any major Oscars!I pity the soul who does not at least respect, if not love, this movie. You should see the Wizard & get a heart.",10,3,4,16 June 2000

","I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like 'Scarecrow' and 'Deliverance' so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense. 
I've seen it again recently, twice.  I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good.  But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.  Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice.  He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk.  James Caan is miscast.  Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing.  Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.",7,5,13,18 June 2004
