The Ring," Sometimes scary other times not...
","When I started watching this movie, I thought it was going to be really scary, but it was actually not so scary and I can't blame the people who didn't like it, probably it is all because of the very little content of horror or they didn't understand the script. The beginning of it looked as if it was another ghostly movie with ghosts and scary settings, but I must say 'The Ring 2' has much more supernatural horror than this epic. In some scenes I felt like I did not understand a single various thing like at the very confusing end, but I think you have to watch it again to get the full meaning. Also, in some scenes, were actually scary and it kept me on the very edge of my seat, wondering what is going to happen next. So there are ups and downs for this movie, but the bring it to a conclusion, I would say, it was an OK movie but if you're looking for something scarier - watch the sequel to this.Naomi Watts, another successful actress, took the chance to perform a single mother and in my opinion she did it really well. She was the perfect choice for Rachel Keller and you could see she really tried and surprisingly it looked as if she was doing it for real. As for Martin Herderson and Brian Cox - they are really marvellous actors. Like every actor/actress in this movie, they truly done there roles fantastically well and they really tried their very best. So the performances really brought this movie to the next level - which was great. But there was a real let down on the script, like I said, I didn't understand anything in some particular scenes. I mean, in the end and some scenes in the middle...what? I did not understand! So, like the content of horror, that was a negative point to the movie that is what makes the movie get poor ratings. So if you're looking for a little bit of a scare, but not a lot, watch this movie, but I guarantee you there will be a 75% chance that you might not like it.",9,1,1,28 May 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A wonderful adaption
","What can I say about this movie?? Well, it was a wonderful adaption to C.S Lewis's books, and he would be proud that his splendid books have been turned in to an amazing movie!! I'm not a huge fan of the books, and never heard of them until the movie came out and I thought the movie and the books has a great connection to each other, as the movie is followed by it's words and the movie writers did so well to try to make the books and the movie match together, and didn't skip a chunk of bits out, so that's a relief. The plot follows children, Edmund, Peter, Susan and Lucy, being evacuated during the World War to a Professor's mansion and while playing 'Hide And Seek' Lucy discovers a winter wonderland called Narnia inside a wardrobe. But unfortunately the others won't believe her, but they soon discover Narnia and has to save the kingdom, be united with Aslan the lion and prepare for a battle between good and evil. The performances were all excellent, fantastically played by the cast and they were all realistic and moving, so well done all the cast. Overall, a magnificent movie, with lots of energy to entertain to audience and I'm sure the second one will be as well as this!",9,0,0,29 July 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Spectacular sequel
","Fabulous movie.I got this movie for my 10th birthday, along with 'Over The Hedge'.This movie is such a great family movie and trust me you will get a mixture of dazzling feelings.You will be anxious, laugh, cry and even be blown away.Take my word, as an 11-year old, I found this movie a blast.It has produced amazing progress, since the first 'Ice Age'. A heavy character build-up, more colour has been added on, not to mention more effects and more entertainment.A dazzling plot, with a few laughs and tears. Well-thought out, I must say, from beginning to end, just solid and complex.A great development has been made on the special effects. Such as, when the ice broke, it looked very realistic.The voice animation was magnificent. They were all very realistic and solid. So well done to the cast.OVERALL RATING : 9.03/10 STARSA must see movie.",9,0,0,1 August 2008
Spider-Man 2," He's back and better than ever
","After the two year wait, he finally back and better than ever. I thought this movie was a real treat for Spider-Man fans, it was excellent, with lots of energy to entertain the audience and has a few twists and turns. Better than the first, it made good progress since then, this movie is more complex and exciting than the first, so you can see a big difference when you put this movie and the first together.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is facing more stress than ever, after two years of saving the world, life becomes more harder for him. He's been fired from his job, the newspapers says that Spider-Man is a criminal, Peter is not doing so well at school, his true love has been engaged to another man, his friendship with Harry is falling apart as Harry wants revenge on Spider-Man for killing his father and a scientist called Doctor Octavious does a fusion experiment but it leads to failure and he turns into a villain with four tentacles controlling him. This time, Peter must learn to control both of his two lives and he must find time to save the world and also try and live a normal life as a college student. But as the world needs Spider-Man's help as Doctor Octavious starts destroying and killing the city, Peter must make a choice of who he's going to be, Peter or Spider-Man...The performances, script, special effects were all amazingly brilliant. So well done.Overall, a great movie, with special effects were out-of-this-world, the performances that were outstanding, but a little work needs to be done on the plot : it needs cutting down, if it were 5 minutes shorter it would have been a masterpiece. But an enjoyable sequel and if you haven't seen it, you should!",8,3,3,30 July 2008
Finding Nemo," One of Pixar's best work ever
","Clown fish Marlin, a single father, who knows the dangers of the sea, has a young son called Nemo. Marlin will stop at nothing to protect Nemo, as he is his only son. But Nemo's first day of school didn't go well, as he and his classmates are going to the Drop Off and Marlin suddenly swims to the rescue. At the Drop Off, Nemo and his friends see a boat in the open sea and they're challenging each other to swim nearer to the boat. But Marlin swims in to the rescue and blames Nemo for what he's done and tells him to come back home. Disobeyed by his son, Marlin shouts at Nemo as he swam on and on to the boat. But suddenly, Nemo is captured in a net by a scuba diver and bring him back to the boat. Shocked that he lost his only son, Marlin chases after the boat - swimming as fast as he can. But the boat was too fast for him. Marlin suddenly bumps in to Dory, a jolly blue fish who has short-term memory lose. Dory offered to help Marlin be reunited with his son. Together, they go on an exciting adventure, full of dangers such as, tackling three sharks, running away from an angry angler fish and trying to get past a swarm of jelly fishes. Meanwhile, Nemo get dumps in a fish tank, full of many other fish, who wants him in their gang, as Nemo faces trying to get himself out of a pipe by himself and swimming through a sack of bubbles, he passed all the tests and joins their gang and gets a new name, which is 'Shark Bate'. Suddenly, Nemo makes new friends and tells them about him being separated by his father. Dertermined to help him, he and his gang thinks of ideas to help Nemo to see his father again. Don't worry Nemo you're father is coming to the rescue! Finding Nemo is a true masterpiece, as it shows of a movie of a father and son being separated and the father will stop at nothing to find him. Also, I certainly thought that this epic is a great family film, aimed for all ages, because it's not that sort of movies where it's aimed for only children, teenagers or adults. It's a mixed movie, which visually allows everyone to watch it, no matter what age you are. As an 11-year old, my dad brought this movie on video two years ago, along with 'The Lord Of The Rings'. Despite the fact, my video player is not officially working, I still wish I could watch this movie again, because it sometimes bring back some memories of me as a young boy.Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould (as Marlin and Nemo) did some spectacular voice animation, in their role, with great concentration and lots of energy to deliver to the audience. Along with Ellen DeGeneres (Dory) who did an amusing performance playing Dory. Overall, the cast did some wonderful voice animations. The plot was extremely well-presented, completely solid and complex from beginning to end. With not too many characters or plots, just simple and heartwarming. The animation was really colourful and imaginative, with great special effects to make this movie worthwhile.A great family film. Fun for all ages.",9,0,1,2 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," Throughly great, but not excellent
","I thought Spider-Man 3 was going to be the best of the three, and yes it was, it was great, but not excellent. I felt that their were too many characters, which makes the movie confusing and let's say, I was a bit confused.Peter Parker, a young college student, has a special secret, as we all know he's obviously Spider-Man. New villains come to town such as, 'The Sand Man' and 'The Venom', and Peter a.k.a Spider-Man has to save the world from villains, even stronger than you have ever imagined and try to go through the stress he is facing especially with his true love (Mary-Jane Watson).The performances by the cast, scored hundreds of points for the movie, they were all realistic and phenomenal, especially by Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker a.k.a Spidey) and Kirsten Dunst (M.J Watson). The plot, like I said, had too much dialogue and too much characters. Which is very confusing for the audience, especially if they're not familiar with Spider-Man, so to make it better, throw all the unnecessary chunks of the movie out and shorten it a little and try to have it with no more than 10 characters.The special effects were out-of-this-world! It definitely saved the movie from being a disaster and I believe, next to the performances, the special effects were the best thing about this movie, so well done.The costumes, settings etc. were great too, the idea of making the setting be in different parts of Modern Day New York was clever, because it builds an effect that not all Superhero movies should be in some fancy place like 'Translvaynia' and that the movie stars Spider-Man living two different lives in a normal American city. The costumes were a positive point to the movie as well, the new black suit for Spider-Man was fantastic, it really fits in with the new Peter, and all the other costumes for the rest of the cast were all splendid, they don't wear fancy clothes,(only their in some sort of play or date or even fighting against villains) they just wear clothes that any else would wear.To bring it to a conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie, with great performances, special effects etc. but what needs improving is the plot, which is too much for the audience and it sometimes gets boring and pretty confusing, but other than that it was an absolute joy to watch, I can't wait for the fourth movie, I'm sure it will be as well as this! 8/10",8,1,2,27 July 2008
Spider-Man," Peter's almost got the best of both worlds
","I've seen this movie a long time ago, there are only a few parts that I can remember which is ; a scene from the beginning, when he is chasing the school bus, when he got bitten by the spider and when he was bullied at school. Weird isn't it? It was such a long time ago, but I still can remember how great the movie was! It had such a excellent comic adaption, as I am a big fan of Spider-Man and read the comics, all I can say that movie is a bit different to the comics. One thing is because it illustrates Spider-Man fighting against the Venom and then we come to the end of the comic and it says Spider-Man saves the world once more. I know boring, eh. What I'm saying is that you can't compare the whole movie to the comics, because the movie also has terms which do not related to saving the world or fighting against a villain (I'm not saying Spider-Man don't save the world at the end and fight against a villain, of course he does!) I'm just saying there has never been a comic about Peter's high school life, so you can't compare some of the movie to the comic, his school life is way different from his other life (saving the world as Spider-Man) in his school life he is a very shy, geeky boy who is the laughing-stock of the school and gets bullied by people and when you look at Spider-Man's life, it's way different. Enough about the comics and the movie, the performances from the cast were throughly effortless, especially by Tobey Maguire who, as we all know, plays the shy, outgoing Peter Parker and also plays the kick-but superhero Spider-Man. The plot was great too, completely solid from start to finish, and I thought this movie is going to have too many characters that it starts to get a bit confusing, well I was certainly wrong about that! So if you're a Spidey fan, want to watch him do some superhero action, why not watch this? It might surprise you!",8,0,1,26 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Really good movie, with lots of energy - but still has some negative points
","7.99/8 I was excepting high hopes for this movie, and was throughly impressed by this epic, but the thing that disappointed me, which made the movie lose three stars, was the plot, a bit too many plots which makes the movie boring and confusing, but thankfully it still had some energy left to bring back to entertained the audience, which is great, but it's still beside the point. And the other thing was the colour of it, too dark, perhaps they wanted to make this one the darkest one yet and they ended up going over the budget, so I was disappointed by that as well. But the movie was still good, really entertaining, with a few twists and turns, which keeps the audience captivated to watch more and I thought it was the best one yet.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but it didn't start well, as Harry blew up his aunt, who was being very mean to his parents and fainted on the train to Hogwarts. But that's not all, the school and including Harry is in danger as mass-murder (Sirius Black) broke out of Azkaban prison to come and find (possibly kill) Harry. And that's not all soul-sucking Demonters are guarding the school grounds, which Harry is scared to face against, next to Sirius. Harry doesn't know what's ahead of him, as he faces new challenges in his life.Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) stole the movie, as he shone throughout the movie and his performances were all out-of-this-world, so well done Gary. And also congratulations to the rest of the cast, as they all performed their role realistically and is one of the best things about this movie. 9.89/10 for the performances.Overall, a great movie, lots of energy to keep everyone entertained, but too many plots, which lets down the movie and perhaps it's too dark - brighten it a little! Hopefully, the fourth movie will take the place as the best Harry Potter move yet!",7,0,2,29 July 2008
Mamma Mia!," Simply a Phemoninal Movie 'Ten Stars'. A true masterpiece
","I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch this movie, as I watch the trailers, I was excepting it to be great, and surprisingly it was! It turned the world of musical upside-down, the ABBA songs used were excellent, it fitted every situation perfectly.This movie gives you a mixture of feelings, it gives you butterflies, makes you laugh, makes you anxious on what's going to happen next and even makes you cry! The performances from the wonderful cast were a phenomenon, especially Meryl Streep, who surprised all of us with her singing talent and proved that she can shine, no matter what. So well done all of the cast! The script was throughly brilliant, it was presented very well, it had all the songs in the right places, all the laughs in the right places and all the tears in the right places. Not a single improvement to be made! So if you had a bad day and you're looking for a movie to take your mind off things, take a trip to the cinema for Mamma Mia and get ready to laugh, cry and be taken away.RATING : 10/10 A MUST SEE MUSICAL!",10,5,7,26 July 2008
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Deliciously glorious
","I thought Charlie and the Chocolate factory made a massive improvement since the first one (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.) The film was throughly excellent, with a few twists and turns, just to bring back some more energy to the movie, which is great.This movie follows, a poor family, named the 'Buckets', who haven't had much miracles in their lives (mostly failures), until a chocolate factory across the road, that has been sitting there lonely for years and years, finally opened and the owner of the factory Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) put five golden tickets in five ordinary Willy Wonka chocolate bars and those five lucky people who finds the five golden tickets in their chocolate bars, get to go on a tour in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) was the first lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. He is a fat, greedy boy, who does nothing but eat chocolate all day (he even eat a bit of his golden ticket) and is a selfish boy, who never ever shares his chocolate.Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) was the second lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. She is a selfish, rich, spoilt brat, who always gets want she wants and asks her daddy for some more (even she ordered her daddy to find the golden ticket).Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) was the third lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. She is mean and selfish and is a tomboy who does nothing but chew bubblegum all day (she is a bubblegum champion who has trophies all over her house) and thinks she is better than everyone else.Mike Teavee (John Fry) was the fourth lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. He is quite a moody and selfish boy, who does nothing but play on his games console all day (Teavee was a perfect surname for him) and again, has that look thinking he is better than everyone else.Then finally we come to the star of the movie, Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), the fifth lucky finder of the last golden ticket (who had two attempts trying to find the ticket, and luckily a miracle happened on the second attempt) and he stands out in the crowd, he is not a mean and selfish boy, he is a kind, generous and loving boy, who cares the world about his family.I'm a huge fan of the book and read some of it and I think this movie is a wonderful adaption to the book and the movie writer tried extremely hard to make the book and and the movie match together (it would have been a disaster if they skipped a chunk of bits out from the book and created a movie with a very different plot to the book - who wants that?) and I must say you have to be a fan of the book to watch the movie, otherwise you might hate it.The performances from the delightful cast were none other than a phenomenon, especially by Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka) I mean after, his previous movie, 'Pirates Of The Caribbean The Curse Of The Black Pearl', he proved that she can shine and in this movie he delivered more to the audience, so that is excellent. And Freddie Highmore (Charlie Bucket) a young, wonderful actor, who I've seen in 'Five Children and It' is an inspiration to young ones, who always wanted to be an actor and that is marvellous, well done Freddie! The plot was well thought out and thankfully it didn't have too many characters and plots (best stick to no more than 10 characters) otherwise the movie will get confusing and a little boring. And it was followed in Roald Dahl's words (Author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) from beginning to end and it was very solid, which is excellent.The Chocolate factory looked absolutely spectacular, it's like when you see it, your mouths start watering and you are desperate to eat it. It looked unbelievably creative, it was all followed in the book's words and it is the best thing about this movie.The songs were another positive point to the movie, they were all complex and delightful to represent each child leaving the factory, because they were naughty (of course not Charlie) and Deep Roy was the perfect choice for the Oompa Loompas and he has a lovely singing voice.And to bring it to a conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie, aimed for all ages and well done the cast and crew for working together to create this marvellous movie.8.75/10",9,0,2,29 July 2008
The Dark Knight," A marvellous masterpiece
","I came to watch 'The Dark Knight' at the IMAX Cinema yesterday. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Batman, but knowing this movie was hugely popular all over the world and has such good reviews, I was desperate to see the magic that has raised this movie to have full stars. And fortunately, I did. Everything was perfect, the performances, the script, the special effects and all the other aspects of the movie. Therefore, it was hard to see a negative point about this movie. I was completely blown away by it, it just kept me at the edge of my seat, staring at the big screen for over two hours. The IMAX graphics were incredible. Visually, I felt like being part of the movie and I have to say, it delivers the 3-D of the highest standard. Absolutely realistic. Heath Ledger (The Joker) was the heart of the movie, he was descended to play the part of 'The Joker' as he did some very amusing and excellent performances, if there was an Oscar for the best actor of the year, he definitely should deserve it. He delivers the most energy than anyone, leaving the audience to be entertained. Christian Bale (Batman) did some fantastic performances too, like Heath, he was the PERFECT choice to play Batman. To be honest with you, his fighting was the best part about it, his punches and kicks spread the whole cinema with anticipation. It looked very very realistic. I thought the script, was the backbone of why the movie was the best of the summer. It was well thought out and you can tell the writers did a phenomenal job in producing it.Normally, I'm not a fan of long movies, but the writers tried so hard to make every minute count and successfully they did. It just kept me in the edge of my seat throughout the movie and at the end, it didn't feel like the movie was 2 hours and 32 minutes. But at the end of the movie, I felt like watching more and more. I wouldn't mind if it went up to three hours, as long if it is enjoyable and never runs out of energy for the audience. The special effects dazzled my eyes, especially the explosion of the hospital, which seemed to struck lighting at the audience. It truly should deserves an Oscar. To bring it to a conclusion, it was such a true masterpiece, with incredible performances, script, special effects and whatever else was put in the movie. It was just the best film of the summer. Trust me, you won't be disappointed by this epic, you'll be stunned.",10,8,17,17 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magic, entertaining and quite similar to the book
","I've watched this movie a long time ago and I must say, it simply took my breath away. I've read the book and it was as terrific as the movie, it was quite similar to it but it skipped a few bits out such as the 'The Midnight Duel' and the beginning. But I understand they wanted to make the movie shorter and enjoyable and I certainly have no problem with that. I thought the plot was excellent and it fits in with the book (it's a good thing that they didn't skip a chunk of bits out from the book and made the plot very different from the book - who wants that?) and I must say all the characters from the book was the perfect choice for all the characters in the movie, such as Dumbledore, he looked exactly like the person in the back cover, which of course was Dumbledore. So all the choices for the characters were all incredibly realistic and makes the audience picture them in the book. The performances from the wonderful cast were out-of-this-world! All of them played their role very well and realistically, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), and I believe it was his best movie yet! And the special effects used in the movie was, again, incredible! They were used at the right time, in the right place and they looked absolutely tremendous, in other words, REALISTIC! The castle looked incredibly amazing and all of the other settings/costumes etc. were one in a million. The beginning was good, but in my opinion, there should be a story-teller telling the people who haven't read the book what happened in the very beginning of it (introducing the Dursleys, what they do, something strange going on in town and even how Harry's parents died) so that could be an improvement, rather than just cutting to the action at once which makes the people who are not familiar with the book unsure. But they did some fantastic work after that, introducing Harry and how his miserable his life is with the Dursleys and it was very clever what happened in the zoo, making the snake talk to Harry, which that sort of unfolds the secret of him being a wizard so that was great as well. The Letters From Hogwarts were very clever too, but Harry's uncle kept on ripping them up, which makes the audience know that something weird is going on and I must say when the letters flooded the house, I was laughing my head off! And finally Hagrid came to the rescue right on Harry's 11th Birthday! Which makes the audience have a mixture of feelings, scared/wondering who it is at the start and relived that all the secrets his aunt and uncle kept from him is being told, including Harry's a wizard! At the pub everyones staring at Harry and shaking his hand, it makes you feel that you want to be be him too! And that an ordinary boy actually turned out to be a wizard and not get defeated by the the great wizard 'Voldemort' (a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents but not managed to kill Harry) and also the name was very clever! When Harry met Professor Quirell, we got a completely different thought of him! He is a good guy, who is quite shy and stammers, but secretly he's a villain! Diagon Alley was amazing too, one of the greatest setting from the movie, which gives the thought of it's a place, where of course wizards go to but actually it's a normal alley, full of shops and people! And all the stuff in the shops, makes you want to have it such as owls and the Nimbus 2000! Gringotts was brilliant too, full of goblins doing work and while getting Harry's money, a secret jumps out, something is hidden in a vault but what could it be? Which makes the audience desperate to know the answer and they want to watch more and more, so that is a great way to keep them entertained. Discovering his wand was great, two wands that won't connect to Harry, but strange wand did! Amazing! The Journey To Hogwarts introduces more characters such as, Ron and Hermonie, and that is when their friendship is formed. Hogwarts Castle was remarkable, the makers tried so hard to make a real castle and they eventually did! Then we meet all the other characters and some are Harry enemies such as, Drace and Snape and then we find out Harry has been placed at Gryfindoor House, with all his other friends, so that is a great start to the year! And then we come to the mystery of the stone, which is truly captivating and grabs the audience and that is where the adventure begins and Harry faces new challenges such as Qudditch, fighting with a huge mountain troll and solving the mystery of the stone! So I strongly recommend you rent this movie on DVD/Video turn off the lights, grab the popcorn and get ready for two hours of pure fun and excitement! If you loved the book, you will love this!RATING : 10/10",10,0,1,24 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Breathtaking sequel - made amazing progress since the first
","9/10I thought Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a phenomenal movie, which made remarkable progress since the first Harry Potter movie.The story follows, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy and strange events occur such as, blood-writing on the walls, saying that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, people getting attacked and Harry keeps hearing these strange voices. No one knows who's doing it and Harry and his friends go on an exciting adventure to uncover the truth about it or Hogwarts may come to an end.The performances from the delightful cast were stupendously charming, all of them played their role well and realistically, especially by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley) Emma Watson (Hermonie Granger) who were the main stars of the movie and I felt that they put lots of concentration to it and still put lots of energy to it, which makes the movie more moving.The plot was, for me, the greatest achievement in the movie. It was complex and solid from beginning to end, not too many characters or dialogue, it was completely simple and understandable. And it also matches very well with the book, not too many bits were skipped out, just a wonderful adaption to it, so a big well done to the writers.Overall a splendid movie, with great performances, great plots and great settings. It has made incredible progress since the first movie and it's the best Harry Potter movie so far.",9,0,1,29 July 2008
Happy Feet," Tip tap toe, Happy Feet's got moves that will blow you away
","Normally, I don't give animation movies 10 stars. But this epic brought something new and to the world of animation. Very rarely, has there been animation movies like this, it is one of the best movies ever. As for me, I was excepting it to be just a movie about a penguin dancing, but I was wrong. Very wrong. It was a true masterpiece, which shows the destruction to penguins by humans and toe-tapping unique penguin, trying to find answers and trying to believe in himself to be the best that he can be. I was absolutely touched by this movie, that it lightened up by heart and gave me a great feeling inside. The voice animation was magnificent. Completely a phenomenon. The wonderful cast did so well in the acting and they tried extremely hard to make it realistic and fragile. The plot was beautiful. Visually, completely solid and flawless from beginning to end, the writers should deserve an Oscar for their wonderful work. The story is complex and heartwarming, and it tells the story of a young penguin called Mumble (a.k.a Happy Feet), who has a rare talent. He can dance. Disapproved by everyone, Mumble goes on a adventure to find out about humans and why they are causing destruction. This movie also gives a great message too, that always believe in yourself and if anyone says you can't do it - you can.",10,1,2,1 August 2008
