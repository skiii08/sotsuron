The Mask," Incredible
","I grew up with Jim Carrey movies. They were always on TBS with regular marathons and encore performances. Of everything Jim has done in his career, nothing had quite the same level of appeal and immediate likability that The Mask did. The story of a relative nobody finding an outlet through which their innermost desires could be openly and fearlessly explored resonated with me a lot. The jokes landed back then and they're still just as good now. Carrey has every bit of the charisma necessary to tackle this role properly and he does it spot-on from start to finish. This is a fantastic film to showcase why Jim Carrey was such a huge success in the 90s.",9,5,5,12 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An Improvement On the First
","'Kill Bill' really needs to be viewed as a single theatrical entity. It was written as one long film. It was filmed as one long film. And, despite the split into two being appropriate from the terms of a theatrical standpoint, it's best viewed as one long film when being viewed in the home video market.
I loved the first volume of Kill Bill. It was a violent bloodbath and I loved every single second of it. Volume 2 improves upon the original, something I wouldn't have believed even possible. It speaks to the quality work of Quentin Tarantino, that he knows how to tell a story and he can keep his audience enthralled and unable to look away from the screen for hours on end.
This film is a lot lighter on the 'action' than it is on the story, which is perfectly fine because Tarantino's story suffices nicely. Much like the predecessor, this film doesn't waste time, and there's never any point in the film that feels like it's filler. Everything flows well at the hands of a master storyteller who, more than perhaps anybody else in the business, knows exactly what he's doing.
Uma Thurman once again plays an absolute badass in the role, every bit as much as the first volume.
It felt like this volume had a little bit more of a focus than the first volume in the sense that it's a cat-and-mouse chase to narrow down the 'Death List' until, ultimately, the title of the movie is achieved.
The only major criticism of note for this part would be that the ending wasn't as epic as it potentially could've been, but it's still a fantastic story so it's easy to overlook that minor personal criticism.",10,0,1,16 March 2020
Gremlins," Weird but Fun
","Gremlins comes from a time in film when, in order to accomplish desired effects, hard work was required instead of computers digitally performing all the magic.
The special effects in this movie are nothing short of fantastic. GIzmo is one of the most adorable creatures in all of film history, and his mechanics are second to none for the time. His evil Mogwai counterparts are surprisingly well performed technically. This isn't a film that went cheap on special effects and it really shows. It's extremely well dated.
The film itself, despite being an absolute classic, starts to drag somewhere in the middle, making the movie feel like it's just a little bit too long with a little too much going on. The first act was fantastic, with its introduction to Gizmo and multiple shots establishing that precious little creature, and the final act was exciting, but it really started to get tedious toward the middle.It's a brilliant concept with a unique kind of evil that can be, without convenient circumstances, practically impossible to stop. The writing and acting were great as well.
This movie really embodies what made the 80s such a fantastic time for film. It's a movie that's worth multiple rewatches and will undoubtedly be on my watchlist for both Halloween and Christmas.
Also, young Corey Feldman. You can't get any more 80s than that.",6,0,0,30 June 2020
It," Meh
","Upon first few viewings in the theatre, I had a much more positive reception to this film. With the passing of time, however, the cracks start to show and the positive opinions have now given way to reveal the negative underneath the positive.It's perhaps most important to start with the positives and highlight what this film does correctly. The relationship the kids in the film share is amazing. The chemistry between them is second to none and, considering it consumes the vast majority of the screen time, is a major positive talking point. There's a definite feeling that these kids have been friends for the better part of their lives, and the viewer can easily relate to each of them on a certain level. Everybody knows somebody like each of these characters. The movie creates a drama with them reminiscent of Stand By Me, with some of the very same coming-of-age elements that King so likes to write.
This film also gets a better representation of the book, choosing some of the stronger points and leaving behind the filler, making this a passable adaptation of a book that I never thought to be that great to begin with. It's better than the 1990 miniseries version in that aspect. When writing for the TV audiences, there's only so much you were permitted to portray on TV, which is the only major shortcoming of the original miniseries.
Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is decent enough, offering a menacing performance despite nearly everyone of his appearances being ruined by digitally enhanced attempts to make him scary. Which is where the negative aspect begins to come into play.This movie just isn't scary.
Many attempts have been made to justify this, the weakest being that the film is told from the point of view of these kids and, thus, what is scary to them is what we see. That, of course, is redundant given that the film is general deemed unsuitable for that age demographic by many critics and review boards.
Bill Skarsgard is robbed of the chance to give a decent performance by the subpar CGI that permeates this movie. A character truly menacing on its own is destroyed by digitally altered teeth, ridiculous visual distortions and that run that easily ranks among the worst artefacts of horror movie history. It's not creepy, it doesn't induce anxiety, it offers nothing to the story. It simply exists to be the laughingstock of the film and to take audiences out of the story.
Pennywise is far more frightening on paper. Being a creature of fantasy it's simply impossible to accurately portray IT and be realistic. And perhaps that's for the best. Perhaps this is a story that belongs in the hearts and minds of the Constant Readers who picked up the book and enjoyed it, and who return to the book time and time again (I am not one). The 1990 miniseries had it's flaws and laughable special effects, but the cheapening of this film by the horrid effects is much more successful in destroying a movie that could've been great.",6,0,0,15 March 2020
Hereditary," Absolutely Phenomenal
","This is what horror should be as a genre
This isn't a jump scare-dependent movie. In fact, it doesn't even deal strictly in fear. This movie offers up a full range of human emotions, both for the characters and for the viewers. It was really an immersive experience, taking its time to craft a rich and interesting story that you couldn't help but watch no matter how grim the movie eventually became.
The writing was absolutely phenomenal, the script was a harmonious marriage of sound and vision, the acting - with particular nods to Toni Collette and Alex Wolff - was nothing short of perfection, hitting every emotion head-on. There wasn't a moment in this film that took me out of it, in the acting or in the special effects, which are easily the 2 most damning elements of a poorly made movie for me.Overall, this was an extremely well-done movie, and one I would absolutely watch again in the future. This restores my faith in my favorite genre, a landscape that has fallen victim to unsolicited jump scares to maintain its impact. There's none of that in this movie. It lays out a well-written story and earns its scares and suspense genuinely and honestly. It was a pleasure to watch, and I can only hope that this will help set the blueprints for the next wave of horror films, because this is the kind of thing the genre has needed for quite some time.",9,1,1,17 May 2020
Inglourious Basterds," A Real Good Story!
","He's been able to make a living off it, but Quentin Tarantino doesn't do what he does simply to make money off it.
By the time Inglorious Basterds came out, Tarantino already had major success in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, more than enough to permit him to live the rest of his life in good comfort.
Quentin Tarantino just loves cinema, and that's never been more obvious than with this film. The meticulous attention to detail and carefully - and successfully - written plot leaves the audience feeling completely satisfied. In a film that relies partially on subtitles to tell its dialogue, it's extremely effective and entertaining.
As with previous films, Tarantino doesn't waste time. This movie is to the point and every single scene adds to the plot. Coming fresh out of this movie, it's a fantastic product that I will definitely be going back to watch many times.",9,3,4,17 March 2020
The Hunger Games," What exactly did I watch?
","A bland, uninspired adaptation of an already unbalanced novel with its serious tones and cheapened, childish writing style. The plot held little of substance (and certainly nothing with any semblance of originality) and the film was shot with such shaky and jerky camera movements that more accurately rival an adolescent with a flip-phone camera running through the woods Being chased by a bear in the early 2000s. What should've been a Hollywood epic action film fell flat in a major way.",1,3,6,16 October 2019
Final Destination 2," Cheating Death
","Death is already showing to be unbearably formulaic and we're only two movies into this franchise. It looks, unfortunately, like the established formula is going to be the same for every single film: premonition, prevention, and consequences. Yawn.At the very least, this sequel acknowledges the film that came before it, taking what was started with the endlessly fun and suspenseful Devon Sawa original and trying to continue the story, which most slasher sequels don't bother to do.The kills in this one are just as inventive, fun and - in some cases - shocking as the original one, even if they are beginning to feel a little like more of the same already. This film can still entertain with its kills.It's also interesting the way the filmmakers chose to end these films with shock-induced comedic moments surrounding Death.This film will appeal to anyone who liked the first one; as a stand-alone, it really doesn't offer much. It's a run-of-the-mill slasher with the uniqueness of having a supernatural killer that never actually manifests itself. That's about it.",5,0,0,1 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Satisfying End to the Skywalker Story
","This movie has it's flaws, don't get me wrong. But through it all, it's a decently written and respectful conclusion to the Skywalker Saga that George Lucas began back with the original Star Wars films.
It could be a bit predictable at times - as the last couple of movies have been - but it was an enjoyable experience overall, and satisfying as a viewer to watch everything come to a close and for the series to go out on a high note.
I don't regret watching this movie for a single second.",8,1,10,29 December 2019
Forrest Gump," Did I Watch the Same Movie?
","Forrest Gump didn't do it for me.
I'd like to say it's because it wasn't what I expected, but I didn't go in with any particular expectations, other than the endlessly over-quoted 'Life was like a box of chocolates' and 'Run, Forrest, run!' I didn't go in with any elements of the plot in my mind; I was completely blind and open-minded.
The film I watched failed to hold my attention. Part of the reason why the top films of all time are so endearing are because the creative team behind them have successfully manipulated the viewer to care deeply about the characters, enough to invest a little bit of themselves into those characters.
Forrest Gump didn't really have that. The movie, for the most part, is about a guy sitting on a park bench telling the story of his life. Which is fine in theory, but until the last 20 minutes or so, it doesn't feel like it's building to anything. It's just a guy telling his story and, although the ending of the film wraps it all up nicely, there's an awfully sizeable chunk of film to set through that doesn't give much of an impression of a purpose, which made it a major headache and tedious watch for me.
This is the only 'classic' movie I've seen that has left me questioning the deservedness of the status and high rating.",2,0,3,15 March 2020
Cast Away," Better Than Expected
","For a film that spends a fair amount of its runtime with a single character trapped on an island with nobody but a volleyball to talk to, this movie was surprisingly entertaining. It takes someone with the acting capabilities of Tom Hanks to be able to portray something like that and do a good job of it.
This movie, surprisingly, has a lot of story besides the stranded-scene stuff. It's wildly entertaining from start to finish but it also manages to have a lot of heart. Overall, it's a very well-done film.",7,0,1,15 March 2020
Split," James McAvoy!!
","Every now and then, a Hollywood actor comes out and does the seemingly impossible.
In Split, James McAvoy brilliantly portrays a man with multiple personalities, providing a distinct portrayal for each and every character. They truly are their own entities existing within his body, and it's fantastic.
The premise of this movie is simple. A troubled man with multiple personalities kidnaps three young women and holds them hostage as they try to escape, warming up to the character's friendlier personalities and trying to trick the less cooperative.
It was fun and creepy without heavy reliance on jump scares, which is refreshing for the horror genre. There are also a few moments that are genuinely quite humorous.
M. Night Shyamalan was always a hit-or-miss director for me, but this was an amazing movie.",7,3,3,15 March 2020
The Shining," It's a Classic
","I'm a huge Stephen King fan, first and foremost. I've been reading his books for most of my life now, and I have very fond memories of the time I spent reading most of his books.
Except The Shining. The Shining, although far from being one of his longer works, was so full of unnecessary fluff that I had an extremely difficult time getting through it at all.Kubrick took the novel's best points, added some of his own trademark storytelling flare and made a product that, while vastly different than the book, is a product that still very much satisfies horror fans around the world. And, as a Stephen King fan, I wholeheartedly approve of the changes that Kubrick made to the work.This film, unlike its novel, is a true psychological thriller. It's an examination into the gradual mental deterioration of an individual stuck in an isolated area with only his wife and kid to keep him company... or so it appears at first glance.
There was a lot of tension behind the scenes, particularly between Shelley Duvall (Wendy Torrence) and Stanley Kubrick, but every bit of hard work and anguish that went into the project wielded one of horror's all-time greatest films that will be watched, enjoyed and studied years into the future.
And, in true Kubrick style, there are always some questions left unanswered. It's not for the purpose of setting up a sequel; it's done because i truly believe Stanley wanted his audiences to be thinking all the time. This movie is a major success in that department as well.",8,3,3,4 December 2019
Saw III," Lives Up to the Original
","The cut of Saw III I saw was 2 hours in length; the unrated director's cut.I definitely preferred this entry over Saw II. The budget and stakes are both much higher in this sequel. Mixing in enough of the previous two to satisfy fans who are in it for the long haul while mixing enough compelling story to entertain those who may make this their first entry in the series, Saw III is a worthy sequel that holds up every bit as well as the original.That being said, this film is also much higher in terms of gore. It's a bloody, acidic, raunchy torturous adventure that's both fun to watch and cringe-inducing in its high level of pain inflicted on the victims. If you're not the kind to go for a horror movie with a gorey body count, this will probably be a skip for you.I'm told these films progressively get more and more graphic, but I'm seeing the franchise for the first time.",8,0,0,26 December 2019

The Conjuring 2," Better Than the Original
","This film really works hard to not be a carbon copy of the original film, and it pulls it off well. It does a fantastic job at balancing characters and character development alongside the scares and isn't afraid to take a moment or two to show us some true humanity in between bone-chilling scenes.
Perhaps it was after Annabelle came out that Warner Bros. decided to expand the concept into an entire 'universe,' because this film, while being a film that can be enjoyed on its own, does a fantastic job of setting the stage for some of the films that would come in the future.
Watching the films in chronological order, this one definitely feels like it's setting up the future instalments more than any of the others. The stakes are higher, the suspense is stronger and the Warrens are ready to rise to the challenge.
Really the only downfall of this film is its hideous use of effects at certain times. Some of these scenes look like they were shot right at the end when the budget was really starting to dry up and the producers needed to go as cheap as possible. They were distracting and took me out of the film but, in general, I think they handled the material pretty well.Of course, there's undoubtedly a lot of changes from the actual events as they occurred, either for scares or drama (as there undoubtedly were multiple changes made in the translation from reality to the story the Warrens would tell everybody about what happened... if, in fact, anything actually happened), but the way the story was told and the details didn't take away from the film in general.James Wan knows what he's doing and I hope to see him working on more films in this universe in the future.",9,0,0,27 June 2020
Toy Story 4," Why does this exist!?!?
","I'll never forget seeing Toy Story 3 in the IMAX. Especially the ending.
That heartwrenching moment when our main character has to grow up and put his childhood behind him is burned in my memory and is a surefire way to make me cry during a movie. It wasn't so much what was happening that made it such an impactful scene, it was what it meant for each of us on a personal level that made it just... work so well.
Toy Story 3 was the perfect spot to end the series. The ending of that movie was a perfect bookend to the story.Toy Story 4, therefore, is the three or four additional chapters tacked onto the end of a long novel that should've been left on the cutting room floor. Take the heart and adventure of the first 3 films and the emotionally wrenching conclusion of the third one, suck all the life out of them and you have Toy Story 4 in a nutshell.From what I saw, I couldn't pick out any distinct message the film was trying to portray, really. Maybe it's something that requires another viewing or two; I have no idea. But my first impression of this movie is that it's just... pointless. It's fluff. It shows that Disney is fine putting out a story about growing up and leaving your toys in the past only to rush right back to them as soon as its nostalgic enough to turn a decent profit. I guess it worked; it performed well at the box office (and, yes, Disney sold me the BD combo pack) and it apparently got a high rating (likely for the sake that it's a group of animated things that resemble the characters you know and love. They felt like hollow shells of themselves, however; lacking anything of substance.Ultimately, this movie left me with a sour taste in my mouth. The original trilogy were such perfect pieces of storytelling, each serving its purpose, telling unique stories and developing the characters. This one, if anything, undoes that. It's a presentation of these characters for no other reason than that Disney knows we'll buy it again.I really hope this is the final instalment in the Toy Story series. Anything beyond this will enter into self-parody. It should've ended on the third one, but it didn't, and now we can only hope that this is the last toy story.",6,7,10,11 October 2019
Liar Liar," Jim Carrey At His Best
","By the time Jim Carrey did Liar Liar, he had already cemented his status as a comedy legend with Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura and The Mask, all of which came out 3 years earlier.
In Liar Liar, Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a workaholic deadbeat father with a terrible habit of lying. After letting his son Max down one too many times, Max uses a birthday wish to wish that, for a 24 hour period, his father would be incapable of lying.
What happens is a slice of comedic genius that only Jim Carrey could pull off. It's the epitome of hilarity, endlessly quotable and a true comedy classic, showcasing Jim Carrey in his prime. It's the funniest of all the films he ever did and, with a stellar supporting cast to back the project up, it's a delight from beginning to end.",9,1,2,15 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Be Patient
","This movie isn't perfect, but it's by no means bad.A lot of the critical reviewers are correct: this movie doesn't have much of a plot. It's a major slow burn if ever there was one. It's historically inaccurate. It's got a fair amount of Terantino's trademark foot shots. It probably would've been tossed out had the script been submitted by anyone other than Tarantino. All true.The movie isn't supposed to be a factually accurate portrayal of the Sharon Tate murders, however. It's been billed as a fantasy, hence the 'Once Upon a Time' in the title. It's a long movie that forces the audience to come along for a ride without a lot of rhyme or reason, and that's perhaps one of its greatest factors. It's a rambling love letter to the films and aesthetics of the 60's for the most part. It requires patience on the part of the viewer to hear Tarantino out before casting judgments.
Despite the lack of a concise plot, I can't honestly say there was any point in the movie where I was genuinely bored. There's something so compelling about the way Quentin Terantino tells a story that never fails to captivate from one shot to the next.
The payoff of the film is pretty great, and it makes it worth sitting through the rest of the movie. It ends with a more traditional Terantino style that is satisfying to watch.The cast all did a fantastic job with this movie as well.Please hang in there and give this one a shot. It's well worth the time.",8,3,8,17 January 2020
Django Unchained," Fantastic!
","I was aware of Django's existence more for the infamous Krishnan Guru-Murthy interview with director Quentin Tarantino than anything. You know the interview. It's the one where Quentin is asked about the link between film violence and real violence, to which he 'shuts -the interviewer's- butt down.' It's one of those great badass Quentin Tarantino moments, and I couldn't be happier that this is the film that would be tied to the iconic moment. Because the interview, despite that segment, isn't altogether bad (on Quentin's end, anyway) and the film itself is incredible.Django Unchained portrays (in the best way someone forced to work under the MPAA censors are permitted) slavery in an eye-opening way that manages to be heartbreaking while still maintaining the interest of the viewer. It was successful in creating an open dialogue about slavery and racism that we didn't have prior to this film, and it's something I'll always be grateful to Quentin for doing.
Django is a sobering movie with an important message, respectfully handing the subject matter when necessary but also giving the audience the cathartic violence they come to expect from a Tarantino picture. It's an epic 165-minute piece that doesn't feel at all like it runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes. It was incredible, without a dull moment or a minute of filler. Fantastic piece of fiction!",10,2,3,19 March 2020
Aladdin," The Best of the Disney Remakes
","The following is an unpopular opinion. If you are easily offended, please click away.I grew up with the original Aladdin. I'm not original or special in that way. The stunning visuals of Agrabah and the fun, upbeat music present in the original provided the soundtrack to my childhood.
The big hang-up on the original for me was that I was never a fan of Robin Williams. I love his dramatic work in films like World's Greatest Dad or Dead Poet's Society, but I never liked him as a comedian. I just didn't think he was funny. And his performance as the Genie came off as a pretentious attempt to be comedic that just fell flat in every conceivable way for me.That being said, the best parts of this remake are Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Will Smith as the Genie. They have chemistry together that works really well, I get a great sense of the relationship these two characters share in the film.
Both Mena and Naomi Scott are incredible young up-and-coming actors with a lot of talent and potential, and I hope to see them in Hollywood blockbusters for years to come.I went into this movie expecting to hate it,, as I think anybody who sits through a remake of a huge part of their childhood would. But I just couldn't. The sets are beautiful, the acting is spot on, the music is much more fun and fresh than the original, Will Smith isn't doing a Robin Williams imitation (thank god for the little things)... everything about it was wonderful.
Except Jafar. Minus one star for Jafar, but only because it's not really a character that translates well to live action, and the writing of his character was quite weak, I thought.",9,0,1,4 December 2019
Peaceful Warrior," Take Out the Trash!
","Victor Salva's seventh film is unlike anything else he's done before it. It's not a fast-pace horror thriller. It's not a deeply moving drama about a lonely outcast. It's a slow-burn film based on a book Victor read while in prison that had a profound impact on him.This movie is, for lack of a better term, a movie about spirituality. It's about surrendering control, being mindful of the situation you're in, focusing on the present and making the most out of every second we have right now. It's an important message that has the power to stick with a person for a very long time and will affect the way I approach a lot of things in my life.Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a gymnast. It's the one thing he feels he was born to do. When tragedy strikes, Dan is left in a situation where he must either surrender his current situation and recover by focusing on his mindfulness or potentially risk losing the one thing he loves most.It's a beautifully written tale, slow moving (particularly in the first hour) but well worth the time investment. Victor Salva, once again, gives an outstanding performance both in the writing and directing of this film. The man has a natural gift for storytelling, and it's just as evident here as ever. The score is impactful, creating emotion in all the right places without ever coming across as sappy. All of the actors in this film were fantastic to the point of giving genuine performances all-around; there was never a moment that felt like it was a group of actors.This movie leaves me with a major curiosity to read some of Dan's books. If this film is any indication of the kind of life he led and the things he encountered along the journey, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't want to experience the kind of present-minded determination explored in the film.",8,0,0,2 April 2020
The Number 23," Bland
","Jim Carrey is to be commended for not only his game-changing work in the comedy scene of the 90s, but also the dramatic film roles he would take on over the years, determined to prove to the world that he wasn't a one-trick pony or some funnyman to be thrown on the posters of films to sell tickets. Jim is a phenomenal actor across multiple genres, as has been proven time and time again.
This movie, however, falls flat, leaving a feeling of being far too needlessly ambitious to be truly enjoyable. It's no fault of Jim's, however, who acts with everything he's got, as he always does. The movie itself is just bland and boring, a real struggle to sit through and one I hope to never have to watch again.",3,0,0,15 March 2020
Dumb and Dumber," It Satisfies

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill: Vol. 1
","This movie was a bloody, violent mess... and I loved it! Uma Thurman plays an absolute badass that you love to root for and, under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, gives a stellar performance.
If you've ever seen a Tarantino movie, you just about know what you're getting: violence, killer dialogue, beautiful cinematography, astounding score... feet shots. And this movie gives it all in abundance.
This was a really exciting movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat, eyes fixated on the screen, distractions coming up left and right around me and on my phone, but my eyes refusing to look away from the screen for fear of missing something.
There's not a second of screen time wasted in this film. Tarantino gets right to the point, telling his story without gimmick and leaving the audience genuinely wanting more (lucky, at the time of my watching, Volume 2 is also available for immediate watching so the ending doesn't leave too much of a cliffhanger for me).
Some of the creative choices behind this movie are unique and also add to the charm of the film. The decision to strip certain scenes of their color or to portray certain scenes using anime were extremely interesting and added a certain extra kick to the films that is uniquely Tarantino.
This was a fantastic bloodbath of a revenge story that delivered just the right amount of everything it needed to be a true cinematic success. Quentin Tarantino once again proves himself incapable of producing a 'bad' movie.",9,1,1,16 March 2020
Saw II," A Worthy Sequel
","It doesn't quite live up to the original, but it's a decent enough continuation. It's more of the same but it doesn't feel like it's more of the same.
There are enough throwbacks to the original film to make this a rewarding viewing experience as opposed to most horror franchises with films written and produced entirely independent of each other.
One thing the first two entries in this franchise did really well was paying attention to the minor plot details. There are a lot of loose ends left in the dark corners of this story that are all resolved satisfactorily by the end.
And this film ends in such a way that I'm genuinely interested and excited to see what comes next. Very well done.",6,1,1,25 December 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL'
","A lot of people don't like this movie, and putting the label on them stating they just don't 'get it' really isn't fair. Because a lot of the criticisms against the movie are valid. The lack of dialogue and extended musical/visual scenes are definitely not something the general film-going public nowadays will flock to see (it's an absolute shame, but it's the reality). It truly is a slow-paced movie without much of a plot, too, which a lot of people dislike the film for.
Today, on its fifty-second anniversary, i have finally decided to sit down and view the film from start to finish, and I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed.
This isn't a movie that is designed to be watched like other movies. It's not something you can put on in the background while you're making supper or doing the dishes; this is a film that requires you to both watch and contemplate throughout. The stunning visuals (that held up over the years, I might add) only serve to amplify the beauty in simplicity that Kubrick was going for in this film.
With 2001: A Space Odyssey, you really get out of the movie what you put in. If you're looking for casual entertainment that can provide background noise while you surf your phone, this film will be a major disappointment. If you're looking for some deep plot, you'll also, likewise, be disappointed. George Lucas said it best himself when he explained the plot as being 'razor thin.' It's an extremely basic story told in a very grandiose way. It's pretentious (I don't mind), it's rambling (somehow I ended up enjoying all the extended sequences), and it's unlike anything else, which is both a good and a bad thing. Good in the sense that, aside from being parodied and tributed (not a word) to absolute death, there hasn't really been anything to my knowledge that has come out that felt like an imitation of this film. It's a bad thing because I would definitely have loved for Kubrick to explore this kind of filmmaking a little more in his lifetime.This is a confusing, baffling, mind-bending movie that requires more than one watch, without question. Film students adore it; Kubrick and sci-fi fans around the world hail it for what it accomplished both cinematically and in terms of its unique story-telling antics.
The immediate response coming fresh off this movie is definite confusion, but a curiosity to gain better understanding of what played out on-screen and how such a thing applies to me in my own life.Definitely a satisfying, if simultaneously maddening, experience.",8,1,1,2 April 2020
Midsommar," Revisiting Midsommar
","My initial review for Midsommar put it at a 6.5/10 with a note that I liked it but hoped to not have to see it again. But I did. And I changed my mind.Midsommar is a beautifully shot, expertly directed and flawlessly acted film. The cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous, telling a story steeped in horror that takes place in broad daylight. The tension works perfectly, the score is solely responsible for some of the most intense moments of the film, and, despite being a slow burn, it's entertaining from start to finish. Ari Aster knows how to grab your attention and hold you in that place, and he pulls it off expertly in both Midsommar and Hereditary, although I do prefer this film, if only slightly more.This is not an easy movie to pull off and, were it not for Aster's stellar leading lady, this movie wouldn't have been as impactful, entertaining and thrilling as it ended up being. Her devotion to the character and willingness to go through the entire range of human emotions required are nothing short of brilliance. The rest of the cast, including the extras, are all incredible, however, and this is a film to truly be proud of.Ari Aster is a breath of fresh air for horror. He's got his own unique style that's fun and intelligent simultaneously with carefully crafted creations that tap into some intense emotions. I'm excited to see where he goes from here.",10,0,12,18 May 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," It Just Isn't for Me
","This movie isn't bad. In fact, the acting is good and I commend the writers and director for the way in which they chose to tell their story.
But for it me it just doesn't work. There's not enough of a focus or cohesive story to hold my interest. There's not even continuity, with this film intentionally jumping through a number of time periods. It was a tedious film to endure when I watched it, and not something that left me with any desire to watch again.",3,3,5,15 March 2020
Saw," I Enjoyed It a Lot!
","I may be the only horror fan left on the planet who hadn't ever actually seen a single entry in the 'Saw' franchise. I had plenty of exposure to it in the form of parody - there's an unending supply of parodies of this film, many of which were just as bland, uninspired and unoriginal as I always seemed to believe the franchise itself was.
Today I watched the first entry for the first time, and i was pleasantly surprised. Was it the greatest horror film of all time, or the greatest franchise kickstarter I've ever seen? Not by a long shot. But it was a pretty interesting idea that you really need to watch for yourself to get invested in. It's not the typical 'person locked in a room with a time limit to get out because there's someone waiting outside to kill them if they fail.' This movie presents a killer with a coherent and interesting back story, even if they don't take the time to fully explore it in this film.The acting is wonderful; spot-on when it needs to be, cliche when the time is right, but always moving the plot along nicely. It's a non-linear story, which I also really appreciate. It's a film that demands your undivided attention from start to finish, and it's interesting enough to justify doing so.While it's far from a perfect horror movie, I think it's a pretty decent entry into the genre that everybody should see at least once. I'm just disappointed that I put it off for so many years.",8,2,4,25 December 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Debut
","Everybody has to start somewhere and for celebrated Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino, that 'somewhere' was Reservior Dogs, a film that, while not his best effort, managed to hold up over the years and still be an enjoyable crime film that, despite its flaws, is still highly memorable almost 30 years later.",7,0,0,15 March 2020
Pulp Fiction," 'English Mother......, Do You Speak It?'
","Of all the Tarantino movies, this is the one that gets quoted most often. It's also the one that has the most commonly seen film cover (at least in my experience). This film is a lot of fun, masterfully written and executed to absolute perfection by Quentin Tarantino. This, in my humble opinion, is a much better effort than his previous Reservoir Dogs.
This film is a perfect example of a good non-linear narration done right. It's not too difficult to mess up a movie whose storyline isn't told in chronological order, but Tarantino knows how to pull it off, how to make it entertaining and endlessly appealing from start to finish. There was never a dull moment in this movie.
To sum up Pulp Fiction, it would be fair to say that it is 154 minutes of pure cinematic magic.",9,1,1,15 March 2020
The Witch," The Positive Reviews Are an Enigma
","This film has already been branded 'a horror film for cinephiles,' which is a way for the so-called cinephiles to elevate themselves - in their own minds - to a status of mental superiority and diminishing those of us who, despite having an avid love for film, also have an aversion to the term.The Witch is nothing special. It's nothing enjoyable, nothing memorable, and nothing that's worth revisiting at any point in the future. What began as a promising movie missed the mark entirely. It's in the same vein as the 2020 film The Turning: it set up a concept that had potential, and completely blew it with the execution.This movie was so painfully boring that every passing minute felt like torture. This story could've been engaging and truly suspenseful but, by the time the movie decides to actually do something with itself, it's too late. An audience will lose investment in a film's plot and characters if nothing happens for an extended period of time, and this movie excelled at that, offering a story that, even in its non-horror-centric plot points, couldn't be even mildly entertaining enough to hold interest. This movie is best served as background noise, because ultimately it's not worth much else.To pick positives to point out about this film would be the beautiful cinematography, the decent acting and the costuming. It truly does look like a period piece, which would be extremely interesting were it not for the fact that the film is so bland and so unconcerned with keeping the attention of the audience that it's a chore to sit through. Catch this one if it's on TV, but it's not worth the price of admission to purchase or even rent.I can already feel the cinephiles preparing to descend upon this review and mark it 'not helpful' for a conflicting opinion, which will only further showcase my point. This isn't some film for people of higher intelligence; it's a cure for insomnia and a lesson in the history of filmmaking failure.",2,12,19,18 May 2020
Joker," 'That's Life'
","I went into this not knowing what to expect. I was told it was a movie about mental health (which it really is), that it's a movie not too dependent on the source material (being someone who was never terribly interested in DC's comics or films, that was a major appeal to me). This review, therefore, is coming from someone who doesn't have a connection to the source material or any prior adaptations of these characters. This is my honest opinion of what happened on screen, nothing more.This movie is more of a cautionary tale than anything. I was expecting the plot to be a little thicker with a little more substance, but it was far from disappointing. To watch this character and see everything they were going through and how society kind of turned their backs on him multiple times was a difficult thing to sit through and there were multiple times when I found myself wanting to comfort the character. It's like a big pot of water; it takes a while to get boiling but, once it does, it's satisfying to watch.My only complaints toward the movie would be to have offered a little more of the story and to have the character portrayed a little differently at the beginning. I would've liked to have seen some earlier years of the character's life to see if they were always the way they were, and i would've preferred to see him portrayed as a totally normal person at the beginning and then slowly turn into the person he is to become instead of always being a character you can never quite feel comfortable around.All in all, I thought it was a terrific movie.",9,1,3,28 March 2020
August Rush," Surprisingly Fantastic
","I went into this movie with a completely open mind, unaware that what I was going to get would inspire me, make me cry and really make me appreciate my life a little bit more.
August Rush is the inspiring tale of a young musical prodigy separated by his parents through adoption whose only goal is to meet his parents, who he believes he can communicate with through the music that exists all around him.
It's a fantastic story that's both well told and well acted with characters you can really care about from the very beginning. A young Freddie Highmore carries this film like no other could. It's equal parts emotional and inspiring, definitely a must-see movie.",10,0,0,15 March 2020
It Chapter Two," An Improvement On the First One
","Going into It Chapter Two, I was fully expecting this movie to be awful.The adult portion of the story has notoriously been poorly portrayed. The adult half is easily the less compelling part of the book and the part of the miniseries where the story quickly begins to lose favor with the audiences.
Once again, this film does a good job of making an abridged version of a novel that wasn't all that great to begin with.The positives are much the same as the original one. I loved the efforts to go back to story elements of the first one to add things in that were left out of the original. It creates a nice little nod to the original and offers enough additional content to maintain interest and enrich the story. The way in which the side of the story in this film is portrayed was done successfully and interestingly, and the surplus runtime was sufficient enough to tell the story without making it feel cramped, rushed or diluted.Pennywise falls victim once again to the awful special effects that have a major diminishing effect on the final product. Bill is a fantastic actor who doesn't need digital enhancements. This film, however, is a little less of a disservice to him, offering him a bit more of an opportunity to act without hiding behind a computer generated artificial image.This is a movie not without its flaws, but it's by far more enjoyable than the first chapter with enough of substance to make it worthwhile to watch again. Still, the two movies together are more than sufficient. A supercut would be interesting but, beyond that, I'm hoping that this story stays where it is. Just like I said in the review for the first chapter, this is a story that works best when it's limited to the imaginations of the readers instead of diluted for film. Although I will always maintain IT to be among the weakest of King's novels, it would be foolish to not acknowledge the beloved status it holds among Constant Readers. The films will only have a diminishing effect on the books.
This was a solid entry in the King universe, but let's let it end with that.",8,0,2,15 March 2020
The Green Mile," 'I'm Scared of the Dark'
","What can possibly be said about The Green Mile that hasn't already been said?
Coming from the mind of Stephen King (whose most endearing films were outside of the horror genre; namely, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me), The Green Mile is a story with many layers depending on how you look at it. Many have likened the story of John Coffey to that of Jesus Christ and, having seen the film, the connection is definitely there to be made with very valid points.
This is a special, once-in-a-lifetime kind of movie that is well worth a watch and will very likely wind up being one that everybody goes back to from time to time.",9,1,1,15 March 2020
Halloween," Great!
","A young Michael kills his sister. Now, fifteen years later, he's escaped from a mental hospital... and he's coming home.This film undoubtedly kick-started the 'slasher' trend as we know it to be today. It was relatively low budget and proved to be rather successful with minimal advertising.This is a slow-burn horror movie. It doesn't rely heavily on the number of people killed, nor are you watching the movie to root for the bad guy. This, quite simply, is what horror should be. There's been no demystification of the villain, so you're not rooting for the character, and there's a degree of fear when contemplating the character.This film - perhaps as a result of desensitization, which is always an issue with horror movies - doesn't pack the punch it may once have offered, but it's not hard to see what made this movie so effective and scary back in the day. The low budget filmmaking made it a more frightening experience and, perhaps, continues to this day with the imperfections in the digital transfer from 35mm film.It's a certified horror classic and, despite its flaws, is well worth its place in horror history.",7,1,2,10 May 2020
Final Destination," Surprisingly Fun
","This, ultimately, is just a slasher movie. But it's unique in the sense that the killer isn't your traditional Freddy, Jason or Michael. It's literally just Death, an entity we never see personified, which is something the film takes great advantage of.The film is fun to watch. Devon Sawa gives a fantastic performance. The humour, while not readily present, still lands well when it's used. The kills were well planned and executed, as was Alex's reaction/involvement in each.It's far from a perfect film, but it's also a film that doesn't deserve the unexplainably low review it got over on Rotten Tomatoes (35% at the time of this writing). If you go into it expecting a slasher and are prepared to receive nothing more or less, you'll have a good time.The only negative thing that I can personally say about this film is to criticize the pointless and tasteless joke on Michael Jackson. It had no place in the film and only served to add more negativity to a situation that was still ongoing and very hostile at that point in time. Any filmmaker who needs to drag Michael down for a laugh deserves a little bit of negative reaction thrown at their movie.",7,0,0,1 July 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Wes Craven was a genius!
","Wes Craven really knew the horror genre like nobody else. A quick look at the body of work he created in his lifetime showcases some of the greatest stories in horror history. And the Elm Street series is no exception.
Perhaps his crowning achievement, this film still feels fresh and original to this day. It's the introduction we have to Freddy Krueger, the menacing bogeyman. And this isn't the Freddy Krueger that gets the most media attention, either: this isn't the wisecracking antihero. This is the man who works in the shadows, appearing only when it's absolutely necessary. His humour is pitch black and on point, and there's a serious vengeance in this film. This Freddy doesn't like to play with his kill.
The actors in this film, from Heather Langencamp to a young Johnny Depp to Robert Englund himself, give stellar performances, even when pitted against stunts that, at the time, would've been much more complex and complicated than today.
It's not the strongest entry in the series, but it's a remarkably solid introduction to one of horror's most iconic characters. It's a horror story the likes of which nobody had encountered prior.",8,2,2,25 October 2019
The Truman Show," Unique, Ambitious, Well Executed
","Jim Carrey shines once again in this film, proving (as if he has to at this point) what a strong actor he truly is.
The Truman Show follows a young man (named Truman) who isn't aware that his entire life is a reality show. The movie focuses on his gradual awareness and attempts to break free of the control that unseen forces have over his every move.
It's an extremely unique idea, and it makes for a very ambitious film. It's the kind of idea that needs to be carefully executed because it's an easy one to fail to correctly portray, but the team behind The Truman Show did a fantastic job. At no point in this movie does it feel like it's dragging. At no point was I compelled to check the time on my phone.
It was weird, it was zany, it was unlike anything I've ever seen before. I loved every second of it. It really leaves you with a number of important things to think about and contemplate. Well worth the time.",9,1,1,15 March 2020
Jackie Brown," Not Tarantino's Best Effort
","Following mega-hits (especially back-to-back mega-hits like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) is bound to be a tough job. If Reservoir Dogs didn't cross your path back when it first came out, Pulp Fiction would've and, by the time Quentin Tarantino began working on his third film, it's only inevitable that people would compare whatever we would go on to do with his two previously established hits. Perhaps as a response, he decided to make Jackie Brown, which goes in a different direction entirely.
As has already been said here on IMDb, this film is much more 'mature' than anything else Tarantino's done, which could've worked in his favor. This movie, however, is a major slow-burn that really starts to drag before the halfway point.
A lot of people adore this film - would, in fact, place it on a pedestal as being Tarantino's best film - but it just wasn't for me. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it was a major disappointment to follow up the prior two films. This particularly story could've been justifiably told in a 90 minute window as opposed to the ass-numbing 154 minutes that is Jackie Brown.I still maintain that Quentin Tarantino hasn't ever made a 'bad' film, because 'bad' this film is not. It's just not the best Tarantino film.",6,0,1,16 March 2020
