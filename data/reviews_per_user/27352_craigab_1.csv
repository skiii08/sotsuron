The Blair Witch Project," Tons better than anything for years!!!
","The Blair Witch Project terrified me to the bone.  I went to see it with an unimaginative friend who didn't listen at the start, and did not understand the terror in the ending, and so I had to cover up my fear because he didn't think it was scary. But it all crept back on me when lying in bed, in the dark. This quite shoddily made film doesn't need to use special effects or world famous actors to entertain and scare us, it uses what it has and produces a very effective piece of filming.  The opening lines arouse an air of excitement, and the VITAL information at the very start is creepy at first but then turns to sheer fear later on. I disagree with many who eagerly await sequels. I just think that they will never ever be able to produce that standard again.  No matter how hard they try any sequels will be glamourized in some way or another, it was the first person filming that gave it the vital air of reality.  An ingredient which was essential in the film.",Null,0,1,13 March 2000
