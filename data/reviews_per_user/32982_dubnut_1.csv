Requiem for a Dream," Artistically Spewing the bile of Hell
","This film had the amazing power to affect me far greater (or worse) than any other film I have ever seen.  The outright nausea each character experiences through the course of their descents into self-degradation are accurately portrayed, hauntingly realistic and yet more surreal than the wildest, darkest dreams.Requiem is a disturbing commentary on the lies that human beings tell themselves over and over until the wires all burn out and there is nowhere else to go except to the place one fears the most, which in this case would be the realization of free will, choice, and consequences.This is the story of a few slightly interesting people that sink like rocks to the bottom of the apocalyptic stew.  If you are looking for something enlightening or meaningful, you won't find it here.  On the other hand, if you need to experience such deep places in pain and torment, addiction and insanity, you couldn't get any better than Requiem for a Dream.",Null,0,1,7 October 2002
