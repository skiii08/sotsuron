Blade Runner 2049," Horrible, empty mess
","There's no story here, of interest, and there's absolutely no meaningful discussion of anything. It's set after the original, but it looks less futuristic. If you'd been Rutger Hauer's character in the original and you had been forced to waste a few hours of your short life watching this, you would have exploded with rage. Even without comparison to the original, this is just an empty vessel: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",1,4,8,19 April 2020
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Not a Jersey Royal
","In the same way that, in a good film, the actors disappear while the characters remain, in this bad film it's the other way around. So it feels very much like actors acting, rather than characters behaving naturally.For example, there's a scene towards the end (around 100 minutes in), between Elizabeth McKenna (Jessica Brown Findlay) and Mark Reynolds (Glen Powell) which seems rushed and unreal.Something is clearly not right with this film, but I don't know if it's a poor screenplay, poor direction, poor acting, limited rehearsals or an unwillingness to reshoot scenes, that's at fault.Oh and Tom Courtenay is at his irritating worst; and Katherine Parkinson is at her hammiest: much closer to how she played the receptionist in Doc Martin than the head of department in The IT Crowd.",1,0,0,1 June 2020
