Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Kids Found the Movie Superb!
","Although I would rate Episode 1 as the third best Star Wars Film behind Empire and A New Hope, my kids ranked this movie as the best of the four.Thus, the new generation of Star Wars fan is founded with Episode 1 as the first film.  They loved the focus on a 9 year old and questioned how the cute little boy could become the evil Darth Vader.  The Pod Racing seen was a stand-up affair for our 8 year old.  The 11 year old loved the sound track and the Queen.For us old adults?  Well, our generation had Episode 4 and if I remember at the time the movie received a similar reception from the critics and my parents at the time.  Funny how history repeats in the movie biz!In conclusion, if you are a Star Wars fan see this film at least once.  If you have children, take them to see this film and let them kindle the magic that is Star Wars.",10,0,0,8 June 1999
