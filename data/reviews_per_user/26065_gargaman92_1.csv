Airlift," Airlift Awesome plot
","A story must to be spread #Airlift is compelling, thanks largely to a sterling performance from Akshay Kumar, who is both suitably weary and suitably level-headed for the part enough to anchor the proceedings. The actor is always fine when reined in, and Menon plays to his strengths and Kumar only snaps once, almost reflexively, into Bollywood hero mode, but he is mostly calm and grown-up and holding on.It is several steps ahead of Kumar's other recent January releases, Baby (2015) and Special 26 (2013), and deserves all the box-office it can get. The bar has been raised and it's about bloody time.Watch Airlift because it tells a very important story that never got a mention in our history books. And also because the attempt to try out such subjects and story lines is applause worthy. Only if there were less songs and an editor who could tighten the length, Airlift would be soaring newer heights.",10,11,15,21 January 2016
