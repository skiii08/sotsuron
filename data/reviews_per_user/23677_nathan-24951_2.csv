It," For fans of Stranger Things, Goonies and well made thrillers/mild horror.
","It - 2017 ðŸŽˆ'If you come with me, you'll float too!''It' goes down as one of my favs for the year and for good reason! From start to finish, this rendition doesn't waste any time introducing 'Pennywise' (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) and progressing the story along. Andy Muschietti takes from the old and makes new again, with surprises and twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat from on onset and throughout. The thrill that is Pennywise, along with a well casted bunch of kids, is what really makes this movie shine. There's something in this movie for most people who enjoy the likes of drama, thriller and mild horror. If you're a fan of Stranger Things or The Goonies, then this is the film for you! You'll be talking about 'It' long after the credits have finished rolling, trust me!Expect jump scares. Expect a decent story. Expect FOMO if you take a pass on this film. Don't expect to like clowns any time soon. Watch at the movies: Tick! Rating: 8.5 red balloons out of 10. ðŸŽˆTrivia: No CGI was used when Pennywise's eyes moved in opposite directions. Actor, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, was able to do this on his own.Keep up to date with everything 'Pop Culture' Instagram: POPcultureehttps://www.instagram.com/popculturee/ GAMING - MUSIC - FILM - TV",8,5,11,9 September 2017
