The Avengers," Great collection of superheroes
","I had my skepticism when going to this movie. Would it be incredibly corny? Who it live up to all the hype? Who we just wish it was Iron Man 3? But I was shocked at the masterful film Joss Whedon put together. He had a great balance of all the stars and big personalities. He left me wanting more from the relationship of black widow and hawkeye.Now I'm not saying this is a perfect film but it definitely surpasses the previous attempts of team of superheroes, i.e. X-men and the Fantastic Four. Some characters left me wanting more... yes I'm talking about you Mark Ruffalo. I felt like I was watching another one of his lame romantic comedies every time he was on the screen. Don't get me started on the Mark Ruffalo's stuff face on the hulk. Give me the big green monster from the Incredible Hulk and I would be closer to a 10 than a 9 for this movie.All things considered, this movie went by in a flash with all the brilliant action sequences and the great script writing. I can't wait for the next avengers film. It should be incredible if Joss Whedon is involved. Marvel/Disney don't let that man go because you have no chance unless you can get Chris Nolan to do Spiderman for you because we all know that is going to be a let down.",9,2,7,8 May 2012
