The Blair Witch Project," Originality
","The Blair Witch Project was the most original movie I've ever seen in my life.  Despite the fact that it was made to look like a home video, the plot and characters were entertaining and original.  This movie has been given the title as the scariest movie since The Exorcist.  Well I didn't find the Exorcist a bit scary, and The Blair Witch Project had an eerie effect to it. It isn't the Scream-style scares you're used to.  This movie should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good movie. I give this film an A+",Null,1,2,16 August 1999
