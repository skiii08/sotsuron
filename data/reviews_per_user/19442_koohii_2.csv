The Blair Witch Project," I'm supposed to be scared by THIS???
","I realize that this is one of those pop-culture movies that everyone is going to go see, just because. However, I can say that if you absolutely have to see this movie, pay as little as you possibly can to do so. Rent something else when you're at the video store, because chances are you're going to want to watch something else after about half an hour--maybe less.It amazes me that so many artsy-fartsy types are running at the mouth to praise this thing. OK, it was an independent film made with next to zero budget. OK, the actors were working improv without a script. Neither of those make this a good movie, or even an interesting movie. And granted, I am biased in that documentary is my least favorite style of filming.
The premise is that three film students are trying to make a documentary and get lost in the woods. There after someone/thing starts playing psychwarfare with them. Well, I'm not a film student, but there are two things I know to do when making a movie: Look up, and focus the damn camera! I also know how to point the camera at my face without giving it a view of the inside of my nostrils. The astounding stupidity of these people makes the movie so much worse.'Duh, we don't need a map!' Anytime you're going camping off the main trails, the first thing you do is figure out exactly where you are going. Even if someone else is in charge, each individual should have a good idea of the geography.Another film theory nuisance: Color or Black&White. Choose!
I see little of interest or value to justify the praise this film is garnishing. I am not impressed. I am not scared. I am not enthused. I am not engrossed. In the end, I'm glad when the film is over, not because of a good ending, just because it is over.",2,1,3,20 August 2003
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," What a pile of Dog Droppings
","How did this movie get made? Why did this movie get made? And by Bahamut's Blazing Ball-sack, how did it win an Oscar? (OK, I know that one: industry politics.) Well, after all the hype, I can honestly say 'What the Hell was that'? Whatever it was, it was not in any way good. It felt like a sophomoric attempt to be meta, which the actors giving their lines like they're trying to project in a play, but it didn't work. Honestly, I think I'd have preferred to watch the Birdman TV show or movies or whatever, because frankly, even the worst, cheesiest super-hero show is better than this pseudo-intellectual poser crap. Twitter and Facebook are somehow important or relevant? Puh-lease! Waste of time and talented actors. Can't imagine what the target audience for this was. In fact, I'm not sure the director or writer bothered to come up with a target audience at all, aside from themselves. Basically, if you like watching actors bitch and snipe at each other, it might be interesting. I don't, so it wasn't.",1,4,7,6 July 2015
