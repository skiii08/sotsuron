United 93," The Must-See Movie of the Decade
","I would love to have Hollywood finally make a film (or twenty!) that shows jihadists, in all their demented villainy, being opposed and defeated by, say, courageous U.S. and/or N.A.T.O. special-ops forces.However, in the meantime, I'll gladly take 'United 93.' The faux vérité approach -- which has been used and abused since at least 'N.Y.P.D. Blue' in the early '90s -- is old hat to audiences, but never has it been more effectively employed than here by Greengrass. During the last 10-20 minutes of the movie, my heart was pounding so fast and my hands were shaking so much that I feared I was going to have a coronary. I found myself trying to WILL from my theater seat the passengers of Flight 93 to make that last, final, desperate push over the terrorists, into the cockpit, and to the plane's controls. Of course, the passengers don't make it. And, of course, I knew this when I walked into the theater. But that didn't make it any less devastating when I saw it on screen.I implore everyone to see this film early and often. If we don't send Hollywood the message that we're adults and that we're tired of mindless, P.C. escapism, we'll have no one to blame but ourselves when Hollywood continues to shovel celluloid junk (e.g. 'R.V.') at us.",10,1,4,30 April 2006
Alien vs. Predator," In Defense of AVP
","While most critics have dripped acid on Paul Anderson's 'Alien vs. Predator,' apparently due to prima facie objections to the very idea of a non-courtroom-drama with the word 'versus' in the title, I was pleasantly surprised by AVP.Is AVP as great as 1986's 'Aliens'? Nope. But I think comparing AVP to 'Aliens' is to employ the wrong standard. AVP is not competing with that film, in much the same way that 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country' was not competing with the sensational 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' No, 'Star Trek VI' was competing with the largely reviled 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.' Similarly, AVP is really competing with the oppressively dark, fundamentally unappealing 'Alien 3' and the strangely goofy, utterly unexciting 'Alien Resurrection'; the last Predator movie, 1990's 'Predator 2,' was released so long ago and did such middling box office that it hardly figures in the popular imagination anymore.Some have complained about AVP's characters, arguing that they're mere sketches compared to the colorful, indelible personalities that James Cameron provided us in 'Aliens,' and John McTiernan gave us in 'Predator.' While true, it's worth pointing out that the original 'Alien' 'suffers' from the same 'problem,' so much so that a defensive Ridley Scott once said, 'The characters in 'Alien' are as defined as they need to be, no more and no less.' Just as the characters in 'Alien' were largely, nay, archetypically defined by their professions and their professionalism (or lack thereof), the characters in AVP are defined by their jobs and the proficiency with which they do them.Some have also complained that many of AVP's characters are dispatched too quickly. However, that's part of what makes AVP interesting. It's a real throwback to horror films of yesteryear, films that weren't afraid to toss virtually everyone to the wolves. Just when you begin to think, 'Oh, Anderson's spent too much time developing this character, giving him/her good lines and telling us stuff about his/her past, to just off him/her,' that person buys it. It's delightfully perverse, and it's what the horror genre has historically been all about.Then there are the complaints about the film's storyline, with some asserting that it's too simple (e.g. humans find buried pyramid; humans enter buried pyramid; sh*t hits fan) and others arguing that it overshoots the mark (e.g. humans enter buried pyramid and discover that it's remarkably complex, revealing all manner of information about the origins of human civilizations, namely that the titular Predators, much like the Monolith from '2001: A Space Odyssey,' made a marked impact on the future course of man long ago). But I had few problems with the film's premise. Even the rather silly, pulpy quality of AVP's grander narrative conceits didn't bother me that much. (Then again, such conceits didn't really bother me in 'Stargate' either.) And the simpler aspects of AVP's plot were its strongest suits, for they grounded the movie in a kind of gritty, easily understood 'reality,' the kind of reality that was very effective in John Carpenter's better action movies, from 'Assault on Precinct 13' to 'Escape from New York.' Yes, it's true that AVP never achieves the epic heights of 'Aliens,' the best film from either franchise, a film so complex and dynamic that it required a running time of 137 minutes to tell its tale. But 'Aliens' was, and remains, an exceedingly special film. 'Aliens' is the like the cinematic equivalent of one of those out-sized rock songs from the 1970s, such as Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven'; AVP, at approximately 100 minutes in length, is more like a Ramones tune: short but sweet.In fact, two of AVP's biggest problems seem to be the result of breakneck-speed sloppiness: 1. the Alien life-cycle is inexplicably abbreviated, with chestbursters making their nasty debuts in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours; 2. the Predators' long-range weapons (e.g. spears and throwing stars) are acid-resistant, yet their close-quarters matériel (e.g. wrist blades and body armor) are not.Regarding Issue One: I've read that Anderson accounted for this in the film, explaining that the Predators had injected bizarre hormones into the Alien Queen they'd captured to seed their battlegrounds, causing the eggs she produced to contain embryos that matured far more quickly than usual. This expository material was allegedly ordered cut by Fox because they felt it needlessly slowed the pacing of the film. If true, Anderson must be given a pass by the legions of angry fan-boys who've ripped him a new one over this.Regarding Issue Two: According to fan-boys familiar with the AVP comic books, this is explained therein thusly: the Predators must earn every acid-resistant armament they receive. So if the Preds in the AVP movie didn't have acid-resistant wrist blades or body armor, that's on them. But it's also on Anderson to have somehow explained this in his film. However, I'm willing to let Anderson slide here, as the best characters in AVP to have provided this explanation were the Preds themselves, a decidedly taciturn group of individuals.All in all, AVP did its job. With the exception of a handful of (de rigueur) overly-jittery/super-slow shutter-speed shots in otherwise well-made action sequences, AVP is a polished piece of work. Thanks to Anderson's direction, the ADI FX Workshop was forced to abandon the Mr. Hanky-looking design of the creature from 'Alien 3,' as well as the beastly, overly slimy appearance of the extraterrestrials from 'Alien Resurrection,' and provide the silver screen with its best looking aliens since 1986. Moreover, if you can't bring yourself to buy it when Sanaa Lathan's Lex throws in with and throws down alongside the last-standing Big Ugly Mother, nor get certifiably juiced when the Alien Queen finally extricates herself from Predator-imposed bondage and goes on an angry rampage worthy of a T-Rex in a 'Jurassic Park' movie, then I'm afraid AVP simply isn't for you.",8,2,6,21 October 2005
