Frost_Nixon," Hugely Entertaining Drama
","I enjoyed Oliver Stone's 'Nixon' and Anthony Hopkins' Oscar nominated portrayal was very good, yet the role was a largely negative version of the man. It was all deep paranoia and dark conspiracy, without any hint as to why Nixon was twice elected to the the highest office in the land, the 2nd time by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.Ron Howard's 'Frost/Nixon' is a fascinating view of Nixon through the perspective of the David Frost interviews. Langella's portrayal captures the insecurity and paranoia of Nixon, but also reveals a more intelligent and engaging aspect of him during his post Watergate years. I suppose this will automatically disqualify Langella from any chance of an Oscar nomination. I hope this isn't the case, because Langella's performance is on par with Helen Mirren's in 'The Queen', maybe even better. Ron Howard deserves kudos for directing this excellent movie. He's become one of Hollywood's best Directors of historical dramas. The supporting cast was great, Michael Sheen as David Frost was outstanding, and everyone else was excellent.A truly outstanding film and for anyone with an interest in recent American history, not to be missed.",10,8,13,16 December 2008
The Young Victoria," When Did Emily Blunt Become a Great Actress?
","She was outstanding as young Victoria. Deserves an Oscar nomination, absolutely. It seems I was just watching her as a working class lumpen prole in 'Sunshine Cleaning' and now she's pulling off this role. It's simply incredible. I am now a devoted fan.The character who played Prince Albert was also outstanding. He really did an excellent job and played it perfectly I don't think your average movie goer can appreciate what an outstanding movie this is. Like it's earlier historical movie gem, 'Bright Star', this film was simply mind boggling in its ability to portray life as it was back in the 1830's ('Bright Star' was a tad earlier, 1820's).As for the rest of the film, it was first rate. The screenplay and cinematography was first rate. I am a devotee of historical dramas of this type, but it was truly an outstanding film and brought to life the relationship of Victoria and Albert. A truly great film worth checking out.",10,4,8,23 December 2009
The Hangover," Early Favorite for 2009's Best Comedy
","I saw this move last night, for the 2nd time, and can say, without question, this is the funniest movie of the year, or possibly any other year. Where to begin? Give credit to the writers first and foremost, because this was LOL funny from start to finish and the storyline and dialog kept the comedy pace going throughout. There weren't any slow spots.The acting was pitch perfect, from the main characters to those with secondary roles, including brief cameo appearances. Zach Galifianakis, in a breakthrough role, was great as the goofy brother-in-law to be, Ed Helms was outstanding as the Dentist buddy, Brad Cooper also great as the hipster friend, brief appearances by Rob Riggle as the cop, Matt Walsh as the Doctor at the Hospital, Jeff Tambor as the father-in-law, Mike Tyson as himself, and the Wedding Singer (Dan Finnerty) in one of the funniest bits in the movie (he sings 50 Cent's 'Candyshop'), and numerous others actors, really contributed to the film.The film also finished strong, with a great ending that tied everything up nicely, with the closing minutes the high point of the film.A great movie, an instant classic I would add. Can't wait for the DVD to come out.",10,5,8,15 June 2009
Public Enemies," Outstanding Film Noir
","This was an excellent gangster drama, lead by Johnny Depp as John Dillinger with an outstanding supporting cast of fellow gangsters and desperadoes, but what really made the film work were the 'G' Men pursuing Dillinger. Christian Bale was perfectly cast as 'G' Man Melvin Purvis, who ran the Chicago Office of the FBI. Billy Crudup was also great as J. Edgar Hoover, portrayed as a ruthless administrator willing to stoop to any depth to catch Dillinger, including rounding up family members and deporting friends of Dillinger unless they were willing to cooperate. None of the Oliver Stone fantasies about Hoover in a dress, but the Hoover who ran the Department with an iron fist.The supporting cast of Dillinger's fellow gangsters is too long to list, but mention should be made of Marion Cotillard who played Dillingers girlfriend Billie Frechette. She proved that her winning the Oscar for Best Actress (Le Vie en Rose) was no fluke.Michael Mann deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Director and possibly Screenplay (he co-wrote).A great film, possibly the best gangster movie ever. Don't miss this one.",10,6,14,6 July 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Showtime's Version ('The Tudors') is much Better
","I was looking forward to watching this version of Ann Boleyn for the simple reason that I've had so much fun watching Showtime's version now running, 'The Tudors'.However, after seeing the movie yesterday, my advice would be go rent 'The Tudors' at Blockbuster or Netflix and skip this movie.It's not that Scarlett Johansson is bad as Mary Boleyn, she does a pretty good job considering what she had to work with. Natalie Portman comes up short as Ann Boleyn. The actress who portrays her on 'The Tudors', Natalie Dormer, is much better. There really isn't anything bewitching or captivating about Natalie Portman's portrayal of Ann Boleyn, unlike Ms. Dormer's performance, which is everything Natalie Portman's portrayal is not. Dormer exudes the aura of a temptress with sex appeal galore. Portman simply does not. I think Johansson would have been the better choice for Ann.Eric Bana is so-so as Henry VIII. Rhys Meyers portrayal is much more entertaining on the 'The Tudors'. To be fair, Bana didn't have much more to work with than did Johansson. The main character in this movie is Portman's Ann Boleyn, who seems to miss the mark.The supporting cast was good but overall you should save your hard earned money & wait for this to appear on cable.",6,16,27,3 March 2008
500 Days of Summer," Fresh & Original Romantic Comedy
","This was an excellent romantic comedy, although many might not agree that it is either romantic or a comedy. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes, but the laughs in the theater were few, and I think most people would label this a drama with streaks of black comedy.The driving force behind what makes this movie work (beside the script) is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who carries the movie on the basis of his physical comedy and acting ability. He is the unrequited love interest in the film. JGL does have brief glimpses of true love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) but it's clear she's not interested in anything permanent, just a good time. After his initial sexual encounter with Summer, JGL engaged in a choreographed dance routine of Hall & Oats 'Your Making my Dreams Come True', which should win JGL some type of award.Deschanel plays the role she usually plays, soulful & pretty free spirit. She played the character very well and the movie viewer could well understand her reticence to engage in a long term affair with Tom.These types of movies might leave some cold, but the ending turned out well.One additional bonus was Chloe Moritz, who played Tom's younger teenage sister and Psycho-Analyst. She was great.A very good movie worth checking out. A near perfect date movie I might add.",9,121,195,10 August 2009
Yes Man," Funnyman Jim Carrey Returns
","After seeing 'The Number 23' I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in 'Bruce Almighty', 'Liar, Liar', 'Dumb & Dumber', etc.Carrey is back in form with 'Yes Man'. While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).If you liked Carrey's earlier works, you'll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It's what he was born to do.",7,64,87,21 December 2008
Burn After Reading," Worth Checking Out but Not Among Coen Brothers Best
","The plot of this film was difficult at times to fully understand how things developed the way they did. As the trailer for the movie indicated, a CD containing classified information fell into the hands of Chad (Brad Pitt), a good natured if somewhat bone-headed fitness instructor, who comes up with the idea of selling it back to its rightful owner, a recently fired CIA Agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkevich). Linda (Frances McDormand) works with Chad at the fitness club. She has an internet dating service hookup with Harry (George Clooney) who is also having an affair with Katie (Tilda Swinton), who happens to be married to Osborne Cox. There were numerous other backstories & sexual intrigue, yet one thing that seemed to resonate throughout the film was that everyone is unfaithful & screwing someone else. And it all seemed so pathetically joyless. The sex displayed in the movie seemed like a publicity campaign for celibacy or at the very least a knock on internet dating services.The bad sex notwithstanding, what was less than clear was how the CD found its way to the gym where Chad happened to find it on the floor. We're left to assume it got there by way of Linda, but the film doesn't show when or how she got it. I suppose it doesn't matter all that much, yet I found that small detail just a little frustrating.All of the performances were excellent. I particularly liked George Clooney's role. He played the philandering Treasury agent Harry, with a goofy demeanor, not unlike his character in 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' or as the lawyer in 'Intolerable Cruelty'. There were many hilarious scenes, particularly funny was when Chad & Linda tried to sell the CD to the Russians (they called on the Russian Consulate after Osborne declined to pay their ransom demand). JK Simmons played a high level CIA chief with his usual comically bombastic demeanor displayed so well as JJ Jamison in the Spiderman movies.As far as Coen brothers films go, I would rate this in the middle of the pack. But as Woody Allen once commented about Sex and Pizza, 'Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good'.",7,7,14,17 September 2008
Knowing," First Rate Apocalyptic Thriller!
","I'd been meaning to go see this movie but just got around to last night and I was glad I did, because this movie rocks! It started off slow but once the central premise of the story became clear, it was actually very fast paced and spellbinding. It's axiomatic in show business to finish strong, and this movie does that in a very big way.The strength of the movie is in the storyline, plot, and climax. The acting was good, but the dialog was at times amateurish and could have been improved with some minor editing. But that's mere quibbling with what was overall a very good thriller with a spectacular ending.The central premise of the movie is in 1959, a troubled young girl writes a cryptic page of seemingly random numbers, to be buried in a time capsule (as part of an elementary school project) and re-opened in 2009. Flash forward to 2009 and the time capsule is unsealed and the letters randomly distributed to the current generation of students, with the letter written by the young girl given to Nick Cage's son. Cage, a college professor, decodes the letter's meaning, and finds it to be a prophecy of major disasters, including the apocalypse. An excellent movie, well worth checking out.",8,6,13,15 April 2009
The White Ribbon," Andrew Wyeth meets Stephen King
","This was an unforgettable movie experience. I don't recall ever seeing such starkly beautiful cinematography, where every frame seemed like an Alfred Stieglitz black and white photograph. The artistic nature of this film seemed to combine the rustic simplicity of Andrew Wyeth's paintings coupled with the literature of Stephen King. The trailers seemed a bit pretentious, but the rave movie critic reviews now seem well deserved. The story itself had a slow but ominous development, where the people of a rustic pre-WWI German village are experiencing various accidents and wanton acts of vandalism. It's unclear who is at fault, and much of the storyline falls around who the culprits could be. I found the pace fit very well with the plot development. The movie really kept me on the edge of my seat. The dialogue and plot are all very good, and the camera work and photography are truly one of a kind. Many might find the plot too slow and the characters too harsh and unlikable. Yet the character development was excellent and the screenplay seemed as though it could have been written by Thomas Mann. I hadn't seen any of the other Best Foreign Movie Oscar nominations but it wouldn't surprise me at all if this film walked off with the prize. It was outstanding.",10,3,8,23 February 2010
Tropic Thunder," Instant Comedy Classic!
","This was one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. Brilliant script and equally brilliant acting all around.The performances from the entire cast were remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent, Ben Stiller was equally hilarious, with many others, all great. Yet incredibly enough, Tom Cruise stole the show as the maniacally vicious Hollywood film producer. He was only in the movie for 15 minutes, at most, but he was great. I've never scene him play such an over the top comic role & this was an eye opener. There had been some criticism of the movie based on supposed insensitivity to mentally handicapped people, but that criticism misses the point that the offending scenes were largely a parody of how Hollywood depicts mentally handicapped people in the movies, vis-a-vis 'Forrest Gump'. Along those same lines, there was plenty for everyone to be offended by, including Vietnam Vets, Blacks, Asians, Gays, Catholics, among others. It was all in good fun and most people who appreciate a really good comedy will 'get it' and enjoy the film.If you liked 'There's Something About Mary' or 'Superbad', you'll love this. If you are easily offended, you might want to skip this movie.",10,2,7,19 August 2008
Revolutionary Road," Good Adaptation of Richard Yates's Classic Novel
","When watching the trailers for this movie, I wondered why anyone would want to subject themselves to two hours of Leo & Kate yelling at each other. It seemed like the ultimate downer of a film, an uninterrupted stretch of 'The Bickersons' on the silver screen. Why would an acclaimed Film Director like Sam Mendes and Hollywood luminaries Kate Winslett & Leonardo DiCaprio get behind this project?'Revolutionary Road' by Richard Yates is one of the great American novels of the 20th century. Published in 1961, it was hailed critically but it didn't do well commercially. It was a bit too grim in its outlook for the time. This is the first time it's been adapted to film. While the movie is faithful to the book, the novel is much more than just another story of suburban malaise. The movie doesn't go beneath the surface of the characters as the novel does. From watching the movie, we really don't know much about Frank & April Wheeler, other than that they are unhappy with their lives. The book goes into much greater depth. This is the film's major flaw. Like 'The Great Gatsby', to which it's often compared, the plot and its characters are secondary to the lyricism of the prose. It's very hard to capture this type of literary masterpiece to the big screen. Case in point: Coppola's 'The Great Gatsby' was a critical failure, despite a massive film budget, big name movie star talent, not to mention Coppola himself directing.That being said, I thought DiCaprio was great as Frank Wheeler. He really nailed the role perfectly. While Kate good as April, she tended to overact a bit too much. I thought her crying scene toward the dramatic ending was a bit artificial (after she made breakfast for Frank and he left for work) and could have been more genuine. I'm not sure why Mendes didn't do a re-take. It must be tough directing your wife (Mendes is married to Winslett). All in all, an excellent movie and by all means go see it. My advice would also be to read the book before seeing it. That's not to say one needs to read the book to appreciate the film, but it does help gain a better understanding of the characters and the story.",8,2,4,28 January 2009
Bolt," Excellent Family Movie
","I saw this in 3D at the local IMAX and was very impressed with the story and the animation was superb. Seeing it in 3D really added a lot to the experience, although I'm sure it's just as enjoyable seeing it on a regular screen.The plot summary is Bolt is a dog who is a TV action hero (in Hollywood) who is kept in an artificial environment (similar to 'The Truman Show') so that he actually believes he is the super action hero portrayed on the show. When he is lead to believe his owner, Penney, is in trouble, he escapes to try to save her but somehow ends up in New York City. Most of the story is his ordeal of getting back to Hollywood, with various sidekicks he picks up along the way.This was an excellent Pixar film, as enjoyable as 'The Incredibles'. Take the family, a date, or see it by yourself. It's a great movie.",9,7,12,21 December 2008
Kick-Ass," Kick Ass is Original, Visually Stunning, and Hilarious
","The trailers for this film looked like it had a lot of potential and for once the film was everything hinted at in the trailer and more. The main plot of teenagers dressing up as super heroes with predictable consequences was well written, acted, and very funny. Aaron is a teenager who buys a wet suit and calls himself 'Kick Ass'. He fancies himself a crime fighter but most of the time ends up getting his own ass kicked. What makes this movie special, unforgettable really, is the performance of Chloe Moretz, who plays the role of 'Hit Girl', the daughter of 'Big Daddy' (Nicholas Cage). Her introduction has to be one of the all time great action scenes ever. I'm not being overly generous. 'Kick Ass' was trying to persuade a local drug dealer to stop harassing a girl 'Kick Ass' was in love with, and when the drug dealer was about to dispatch 'Kick Ass' to the afterlife, we are introduced to 'Hit Girl', who proceeded to deal with the drug dealer and his room full of thugs, while the theme song from 'The Banana Splits' blared. My god it was awesome.I don't know about 'Kick Ass' the character, but 'Hit Girl' could start a franchise with this movie. The violence was over the top but in a fun comic book sort of way. Peter Parker's Spiderman can't hold a candle to 'Hit Girl'.Anyway, the movie was way cool and totally worth checking out. I'll probably see it again.",10,13,32,22 April 2010
Gran Torino," Eastwood's Final Performance is Vintage Clint
","I've seen this movie twice already and I'm sure I'll see it again. I think it's going to be one of those movies, like 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Apocalypse Now' that people will want to see again and again, based solely on Eastwood's unforgettable performance as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in a bad neighborhood in Detroit. Walt's character is a composite of Eastwood's many different screen personas he's portrayed throughout his long career: 'Dirty' Harry Callahan, William 'Bill' Munney, and the boxing trainer Frankie Dunn from 'Million Dollar Baby' come to mind.The plot is Walt's wife has recently died and he is alone in his home, coming to grips with what's left of his life. He doesn't get along with his sons, who live in the distant suburbs. He has a contentious relationship with his parish priest, who won't take no for an answer when it comes to getting Walt to attend confession. He doesn't get along with his neighbors, who happen to be Hmong immigrants. However, when the neighbors are harassed by Asian gangs, Walt springs to their defense and an unlikely friendship develops between Walt, his neighbors, and the Hmong community, who view Walt as a hero. The rest of the film develops the friendship between Walt, and his neighbors Thao, and Sue, both Hmong teenagers, while protecting them from the predations of the marauding Asian gang.It's an incredible story with a fitting ending. Eastwood has gone on record as saying this is his last film as a lead actor. It's seems only right and proper that his last film was his best.",10,3,8,16 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Funny and Moving Forrest Gump Type Movie
","After watching this movie, my immediate thoughts were Brad Pitt's performance was excellent and probably a sure bet for Best Actor nomination, but also that the lion's share of the credit for this movie's success belongs to the incredible creative talent behind it production, that is the screen writers, directors, graphic artists, supporting actors, and everyone else involved. I suspect there are many other actors who could have done what Pitt did, as there wasn't much emotional range required for his role. The central figure in the film was Benjamin Button but what really made the movie were all of the backstories, like his adopted mom, the Tug Boat Captain, his biological father, & the various other figures (i.e. - the nursing home resident struck by lightening 7 times). These were what made the movie interesting. I'm sure F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved of this version of his short story with two very big thumbs up. This is without question the best movie adaptation of any of his works I've ever seen. It more than makes up for Coppola's wretchedly bad 'The Great Gatsby', perhaps Fitzgerald's best known work with a similar big box office budget.The one weak link was its length, nearly 3 hours. I thought this could have been reduced by at least 1/2 hour. The love interest aspect with Cate Blanchett was a bit overdone, and the Tilda Swinton vignette could have been eliminated entirely, as he'd already lost his virginity in a New Orleans brothel, courtesy of the Tug Boat Captain.But all that aside, this is a really good movie worth checking out on the big screen.",9,2,5,27 December 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Steve Spielberg meets Rod Serling
","It's hard to describe why I liked this movie. It reminded me of various Twilight Zone episodes, but with much better production. Rod Serling wrote several different Nazi / holocaust themed episodes where the Nazi switched places with the doomed Jewish prisoner, but this movie adds a different twist, which some might find more disturbing. However one might feel at the end of the movie, the story, acting, character development, cinematography, the music, and everything else was first rate. I believe that this movie should do very well come Oscar season. Possible nomination for Screenplay at the very least. As stated above, there was a Twilight Zone quality about the plot. It centered around a Nazi Concentration Camp Commandant's son, eight year old Bruno, wandering up to the perimeter fence of the camp & befriending another eight year old child prisoner, Shmuel. Anyone even remotely familiar with holocaust history realizes this is a highly unlikely scenario. Yet a suspension of disbelief is required to appreciate the story, as this remains central to the plot. The interaction between Shmuel & Bruno is mesmerizing to watch. The rest of the cast was superb.Even though the movie is ostensibly about children, I'm not sure it would be wise to bring a child to see this movie. Use your own judgement because the ending may be upsetting to some.",9,3,5,4 December 2008
Paranormal Activity," Things that go bump in the night
","This was a film that cost practically nothing to produce yet offered up a host of scary moments and a plot that kept the viewer on the edge of their seats right up to the wild ending. Kudos to the writers and producers who made this film. They struck gold and I'm sure they already have their next project funded and in the works.This type of movie is similar to 'The Blair Witch Project' in that it's a documentary with the main characters filming themselves while attempting to prove the existence of paranormal activity in their house. Katie has been haunted most of her life by a ghost or demon, and the ghost follows her regardless of where she lives. Now the ghost resides in the home of her boyfriend Micah, with whom she now lives. Micah is initially skeptical but then comes to see that the ghost is a real presence. He isn't intimidated, but wants to show the ghost 'who's the boss'. A big mistake on Micah's part, as things later prove.This was a very good movie and as horror movies go, this is one of the more clever ones I've seen. There's not the blood & gore of the typical horror movies, but a very subtle type of tension in the development of the plot. The tension builds throughout and peaks at the films ending. The release of this film during the Halloween season was a smart move. I'm sure it will do fabulously well, as word of mouth gets around. I definitely recommend this movie.",8,3,6,18 October 2009
Taken," Good Action Flick
","Just got back from the theater (caught a $5 10:00 am cheapie @ AMC) and thought this was a good movie, with a good plot and action sequences, albeit typical shoot 'em up how the hell did Liam Neeson not just get killed fashion.Liam Neeson is a retired CIA spook whose daughter lives with his ex-wife and her current husband, who apparently is very very rich. The movie begins with Liam attending his daughter's birthday party at her home, which looks a lot like the Villa Borghese. The daughter goes to Paris with a friend and is kidnapped by some Albanian mafia types, to be sold into a prostitution ring. The rest of the movie is Liam opening up several jars of whoopass on the bad guys. It was lucky for Liam that the Albanians were terrible shots. They couldn't hit water if they fell off a boat. I had fun and so will anyone who enjoys these types of action movies. Liam Neeson was pretty much the movie, everyone else were villains straight out of central casting. Judging from their ineptness, they were graduates of Dr. Evil's Henchman Academy.Given what else is currently playing, this is definitely worth checking out.",7,7,15,31 January 2009
Avatar," Avatar 3D - See it for the visuals, not the plot itself
","Saw this in 3D Imax and highly recommend it in this medium. I am sure it is also outstanding in the standard format but the visuals ARE the movie and if you have a 3D screen within driving distance, definitely take advantage and go see it.The plot itself is somewhat generic. It's the stereotypical military / industrial complex (i.e. – The USA) exploiting the natural resources of indigenous peoples (i.e. – Iraq) with ruthless and inhuman efficiency. The protagonist is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is an Army soldier who is transformed into one of the indigenous natives in order to better exploit them (ie. – steal their oil, or 'unobtainium' in the film). The natives are 9 feet tall blue people who can communicate with other organic beings in their universe through their hair. If this sounds dumb, it is. But the visuals are stunning and well worth putting up with the D grade movie plot.I don't have much else to say about his movie. Dumb plot and insipid dialog, but breathtaking technical wizardry making this an incredible experience.",10,11,20,3 January 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Dazzling Technical Wizardry and Excellent Story
","I've seen several 3D movies in the past few months, including 'Avatar', and I rate this one the best of all. The story itself was clever and original, about a young Viking lad named Hiccup who marches to a different drummer in that he's not your typical blood thirsty Viking but more an artist. Part of a young Viking's training is learning how to master the art of dragon slaying. Hiccup has an inside track on learning how to deal with dragons, and becomes what would be known today as a 'Dragon Whisperer' (my term, not the movie). He knows how to make them do whatever he commands. However, slaying dragons is not in his ken, and the film's main plot centers around how to reconcile Hiccups pacifist tendencies with the ethos of the Viking Warrior.The 3D animation was absolutely exhilarating. I enjoyed this even more than 'Avatar', if only because the story was good, unlike the tiresome boilerplate plot in 'Avatar'. I would recommend seeing this in 3D but lacking a 3D screen, go see it in 2D. It would still be excellent.",10,2,4,12 April 2010
The Great Raid," Inspirational and moving account of American POWs
","Critics had carped about the dialog and pacing of this movie but I think they were wrong. This was a faithful adaptation of the book 'Ghost Soldiers', with first rate acting and outstanding action sequences. When the movie ended, original news reel footage was run with the actual POW survivors while the credits rolled. Nobody left the theater until this had ended. I liked it better than 'Saving Private Ryan'. A true story about true heroes, unlike so many Hollywood produced war movies that are written to please focus groups. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in American history as it is accurately and movingly portrayed on film.",10,2,4,17 August 2005
Crazy Heart," Best Movie of the Year
","I just saw this movie for the 2nd time yesterday, and I enjoyed it even more than the first. The performances by the supporting cast were awesome, with Robert Duvall in a great role as 'Bad' Blake's friend, helping him overcome his alcoholism. The other minor roles, mostly of Blake's devoted fans and fellow musicians, really made this a great movie. Of course, Jeff Bridges as 'Bad' Blake was outstanding and should be the runaway favorite to win Best Actor. But he had great material and a stellar cast helping him out.Why this movie did not make it onto the expanded list of Best Movie Oscar nominations is baffling. Was it too 'Red State' for the mostly liberal movie critics that comprise the Academy? They didn't overlook Jeff Bridges or Maggie Gyllenhall for their performances (for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actress) and it rec'd a nod for Best Music. But why not Best Picture? Or Screenplay? The entire story was very well written, the cinematography was outstanding, with excellent panoramic scenes of the western US, the music scenes were all perfectly choreographed, even when 'Bad' Blake was too drunk to stand, and the character development was pitch perfect. As good as Bridges was as Blake, the writing had much to do with his ability to connect with the movie goer. This was some very excellent screen writing and deserved an original screenplay nod. A truly worthwhile movie experience and should most definitely have been nominated for Best Picture. Go see this gem.",10,4,8,15 February 2010
There Will Be Blood," The Montgomery Burns Story
","This movie, based on the novel 'Oil!' by Upton Sinclair, was excellent but the ending could have been better. The first 140 minutes were riveting, the final 15 minutes unraveled into a mess of psychotic actions on the part of main character, Daniel Plainview. The act of dismissing his adopted son, H.W., might have made some sense, in terms of Plainview's descent into acute alcoholism, but the senseless murder of the Preacher was silly. It really spoiled the movie. When it was finished, the crowd was speechless. The ending was so over the top.I say the Montgomery Burns story because Plainview was a caricature, and in his mannerisms, his misanthropic ways, his unbridled greed, he seemed to be channeling Monty Burns. If the Simpsons hadn't already done a spoof of Citizen Kane, this movie would provide a good episode, with Bart as H.W., Monty Burns as Plainview, Rev. Lovejoy as Sunday, and Smithers could be Fletcher Hamilton.The ending aside, as crazy as it was, this was a great movie. Day-Lewis deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. His character, Daniel Plainview, will become an enduring symbol of capitalism and human nature at its worst, which I am sure is how Upton Sinclair would have intended it.",10,3,9,10 February 2008
The Reader," Bizarre yet compelling drama on the banality of evil
","Kate Winslet's portrayal of Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi death camp guard living in Berlin in 1958 and working as a trolley car conductor, is one of the strongest roles in her impressive acting career. Somehow she was able to create a character that the audience could feel some degree of empathy with, despite her having worked in Auschwitz, selecting prisoners for extermination. To her, it was just a job, like any other. She had no education (she was illiterate). She befriends a young high school student, Michael Berg, and they carry on an unlikely love affair. Before they made love, Hanna insisted that Michael read to her, thus the title. She weeps as Michael reads Homer and laughs to Mark Twain. A complex and fascinating character, she lived her life from day to day, with her past buried safely behind her. That is, until a death camp survivor published a book which included details about Hanna's past, resulting in a public trial and the sordid details of her past are retold in court.The story is narrated by Michael Berg, as told through a series of flashbacks, beginning with when they first met in 1958. While Hanna Schmitz's character is played by Kate Winslet for the entire film, Michael Berg's character is played by 2 different actors, David Kross plays young Michael Berg and Ralph Fiennes as the adult. While Kate Winslet steals the show, the movie is putatively about Michael Berg. More's the pity, since his character is not all that appealing. As a callow youth and as an equally callow adult, he doesn't seem very engaging (as an adult, he is too busy to attend his father's funeral). This is the movie's biggest flaw. Kate Winslet is in a supporting role when she should be the main attraction.The plot is complicated, and the heavy use of flashback narrative doesn't help things. The movie begins in the present, flashes back to 1958, into the 1960s, with a flashback within a flashback to 1944 (as re-told in the court proceedings), and then into the 70s, 80s, & 90s. I would recommend this movie despite the plot simply to watch Kate Winslet's study in the banality of evil. It's one of the great and memorable performances of 2008.",8,13,18,31 December 2008
Defiance," A Unique WWII Drama Well Told
","This was a compelling film about a group of WWII Jewish refugees hiding out in the forests of Nazi occupied Poland (present day Belarus). The group, lead by Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), evade the Nazis and do battle with Polish villagers and police, while foraging for food, guns, and medical supplies. While it's true that many of the action sequences were embellished and the Bielski brothers weren't exactly model citizens, the inspiration for the story is beyond dispute: a group of Jewish refugees facing certain death choose to flee into the forests of Belarus, where many of them manage to survive the war. How they are able to survive in the midst of Nazi, Soviet, and Polish partisans trying their best to kill them is what makes this movie work. It was clear in the movie that the Poles were every bit as eager to murder the Jews as their Nazi occupiers. These Jews fought back. This is a different type of Holocaust film, and one whose story needed to be told. Considering the hundreds of WWII movies dealing with the Holocaust, where the mostly docile and unsuspecting Jewish prisoners were uniformly murdered by the Nazi war machine, it was good to see a film where the Jews fought off the Nazis & their willing executioners (i.e. - the Poles) and managed to survive in the end. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in WWII history, particularly with regard to partisan resistance to the Nazis and their collaborators.",7,5,11,26 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Excellent Sherlock Holmes Adaptation
","This was a very good adaptation of the classic detective series. While purists of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels may sniff at the liberties that Film Director Guy Ritchie took with the title character Holmes and his faithful sidekick, Dr. Watson, the movie was highly entertaining with great cinematography and a fast paced plot that didn't let up throughout and kept the viewer in suspense up until the very end. In other words, it was well worth the money and I will be looking forward to the next installment, which will feature the better known nemesis, Dr. Moriarty.Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as Holmes. He is one of the best actors for this type of role, a flawed super hero who doesn't take himself too seriously. Jude Law was up to the task of playing Dr. Watson, and Rachel McAdams was excellent as the mystery woman who is both the object of Holmes affections and a possible adversary. The rest of the supporting cast was also first rate. Guy Ritchie deserves a lot of praise for pulling all of this together. It's nice to see him making entertaining films again. Great movie and well worth checking out.",8,2,5,3 January 2010
The Blind Side," Bullock's Masterpiece
",I don't think I've seen a Bullock movie since 'Speed' that didn't leave me watching my cell phone for the time. Her movies have been pretty awful and worth skipping. Not this one. The story received a lot of press and one has to give her much credit for snapping up the rights to it. She also did a fabulous job as the heroine. I was simply amazed. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in 'Pulp Fiction'.I loved the story. It is a genuinely heartwarming tale of an abandoned teenager adopted by a wealthy family and guided to success. And it's all true. This is what make me love movies. What a great film! Go see this movie. I loved it and so will you.,10,149,248,27 November 2009
Iron Man," Heavy Boots of Lead....
","This was one heluva movie. I liked the acting, the story, the special effects, the music score, everything was great.I especially like Robert Downey's ability to make his role multi-dimensional, from Billionairre playboy to boy genius to concerned citizen to super hero. He really pulled it off nicely.Jeff Bridges turned in a great performance as the villain. He played the part of Downey's evil corporate partner perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow played Downey's assistant (loved the name 'Pepper Potts') and did it well.The techies who did the special effects deserve much of the credit for making this movie the success that it is. It was simply amazing how they were able to create the 'Iron Man' model.The ending was perfect, without spoiling it for anyone, it wrapped up the picture very nicely.Wonder what they'll cook up for Iron Man 2?",8,1,3,2 May 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," 'City of God' with less blood
","This is a story set in the slums of Mumbai, about two orphaned brothers who grow up on the streets. Like 'City of God' (set in the slums of Rio De Janeiro), one of the boys is good (Jamal) and one is bad (Salim). They both love the same woman (Latika). Each brother watches out for each other as they grow up, but it's clear that Salim is a ruthlessly violent character.The story begins with Jamal playing for the top prize on an Indian version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionairre'. Before he can play for the top prize, the show ends & he is asked to return the following day to finish the game. However, the game show host suspects the boy is cheating & has the police take him away for questioning. The police brutally interrogate Jamal, but he does not break down & confess, but, re-counts his upbringing on the Mumbai streets to show how he was able to gather the knowledge to correctly answer the questions on the show. In the process, the story of his life unfolds.This is an excellent movie. While it is clearly an Indian cast and setting, the language is English. It's a very clever fusion of Hollywood & Bollywood. The cinematography was stunning, the music was great, the characters very engaging, the plot was excellent, with an ending that tied up everything beautifully.I highly recommend this movie.",9,108,197,4 December 2008
Valkyrie," Excellent Historical Drama
","It was curious timing to release this film on Christmas Day. As David Letterman quipped on last night's monologue: 'Nothing says Holidays like a good Nazi death plot'.Release timing not withstanding, this is a very powerful movie and by all accounts comports with the historical record. There was little embellishment for dramatic effect here. Hitler murder conspiracy dramas are abundant in Hollywood, but this one actually happened and was nearly successful. The story is riveting, and even though the outcome was already known (at least to anyone who had a rudimentary knowledge of WWII), the excitement level was sustained by not really knowing the precise timing of events or, more importantly, who would be spared in the end.Tom Cruise was very good in the lead role as the chief conspirator (Col. von Stauffenberg). The rest of the cast was first rate, including Tom Wilkinson as Gen'l Fromm, a Nazi head honcho who was playing both sides of the fence, and many other notable actors, such as Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp, all excellent.For fans of 'Downfall', the German film documenting Hitler's final week in the bunker (one of the all time great WWII films and #75 on the IMDb top 250), there were two actors from that movie playing in this one. Thomas Kretschmann and Christian Berkel both were key figures in 'Downfall' had supporting roles in this film. For people with an interest in WWII or history in general, this is one film worth checking out.",8,188,247,27 December 2008
The Fighter," Christian Bale is surreally good as crackhead former palooka
","Mark Wahlberg keeps up to as the brother and aspiring boxer. Amy Adams was great as Mark's girlfriend, and the entire supporting cast was pitch perfect. How did they ever cast the family? One gets the impression they were real life & not actors. The mother and her brood of harpie daughters were the roughest bunch of females ever to appear in a movie that wasn't science fiction. You could definitely see how they were cut from the same mold as Bale's character but Wahlberg's character seemed too decent to be from that group of people.You wonder who gets the nod for best actor in this film. Wahlberg or Bale? Bale's character might seem to be confined to a supporting actor nod but Bale made the film a great one and if it wins best picture (which seems like a good bet), Bale would seem to be inline to get most of the credit.Anyway, a great picture, not to be missed. Quite possibly one of the best boxing films ever made. And Bale's performance was one for the ages.",10,4,7,2 January 2011
Up in the Air," Most Overrated Film of 2009
","This was a good movie but I'm not sure why it's on top of all the movie critics top 5 lists. It seems to push all of the politically correct anti-business buttons in terms of heartless corporations mass firing downtrodden proletariats from their soul sucking jobs in the private sector while enlightening the movie viewer with the redemptive story of Ryan Bingham (Clooney) whose full time job is firing people while bedding down different women along the way. He is a 'termination consultant' who is contracted by different companies to tell their employees they are fired. There are a number of scenes of him firing people with the predictable tears, violence, suicide threats, and so forth. You see, life in the private sector is really like this, day in and day out. Capitalism is exploitation, property is crime, we are all expendable components of an evil machine that ends up destroying us in the end. No wonder the left wing film critics love this movie.Anyhow, Ryan falls in love with a fellow business traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) whose soul is even more shriveled than his own. Ryan also develops a relationship with a newbie to his 'firing' company, named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who eventually becomes disillusioned with firing people for a living. Go figure. Ryan becomes humbled by Natalie's humanity, not to mention his own experience of being used and discarded by Alex. Thus, we are lead to believe, Ryan becomes a better person for being on the receiving end of what he is usually dishing out. This aspect of it wasn't remotely believable.A good movie, but for my money, the most overrated of the year.",7,13,24,3 January 2010
