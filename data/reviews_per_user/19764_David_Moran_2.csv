Kill Bill: Vol. 2," a dissapointment
","the sequel to the first kill bill, that was a genuine masterpiece, fails to deliver what it takes to make a decent end to this vengance saga. it seems to me tarantino lost himself during production, and this of course is very strange, because the two films were made as one. something happened. these last 5 chapters of the story are written without the inthusiasm and brilliance like the first five. tarantinos very well known dialogue writing talent seems missing from the entire movie. the only good part of the film is the 'pai mei' chapter in which thurman is taught by a chinese kung fu master the ancient martial art. tarantino creates in this the only reasonable and funny chapter in the entire sequel.it is a real shame that this young american genius filmmaker cant stay in line with himself in this supposed to be fantastic project. i do recommend watching it, especially those who love martial arts movies but this surely not the sequel it is supposed to be. a dissapointment.",Null,1,3,25 April 2004
Cold Mountain," too long, too boring, too much!
","this 2 and half hour movie made me so sleepy during watching. there is no doubt, something is seriously wrong with this film. it looks very promising in the beginning but as long as we go along it starts really to make you wonder. all this could be reasonably finished within 90 minutes or maybe less and it could be much more intense and smarter that way. not all historic melodramas must be that long. at least in 'titanic' we had some action. the only thing that's left in my memory is john seal's delicate camera work. nicole kidman really tries but unfortunately she doesn't have enough to go along with. rene zelweger looks pretty stupid. it is not her fault. it's a classic mis-cast. don't watch 'cold mountain'. there are so many other things you can do in your precious spare time. sleep for example.",Null,1,3,3 December 2004
