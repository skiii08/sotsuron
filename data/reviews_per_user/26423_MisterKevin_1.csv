The Avengers," Joss Whedon Scores Big!
","This movie easily did even more than I expected it to do, and I expected a lot b/c I am a big Avengers fan, loved the recent Captain America, Iron Man and Hulk Movies, and I think Joss Whedon is maybe my favourite recent writer and director of anyone else out there. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character from the government agency said 'Stark knows he's not the only superhero in his world'. The Avenger Initiative is action packed, fun, just a superbly entertaining and well done movie. I never would have believed it could be possible to put all of these characters in the same movie and do them all justice, at least not unless the movie was more than three or four hours long! What a fantastic, fun movie this is, I highly recommend it and already want to see it again.",8,3,8,12 May 2012
