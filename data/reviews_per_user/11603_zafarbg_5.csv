Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Cinematic Masterpiece For The Ages
","What do you get with Steven Spielberg behind the camera, George Lucas serving as the creator and executive producer, Harrison Ford as the lead along with great score, story, humor,romance,supporting actors and a iconic opening scene? You get Raiders of the Lost Ark.With Harrison Ford riding on his success after starring in the hit space opera Star Wars, he was Lucas' first choice for the titular role.Little did the public know something big was coming.After the release, people were dazzled by the film's uniqueness and the unforgettable visual effects. Harrison Ford became every girl's crush just like the ones in the film.Spielberg had just made one of the greatest action films of all time.The film opens in 1936 with Indy after a golden idol worshiped by the tribal people in Peru.He's accompanied by a young Spanish man named Satipo, portrayed by a young Alfred Molina. What follows is a iconic opening to remember.Back in America after returning, Indy is approached by government officials to stop the Nazis from obtaining the Ark of the Covenant and thus do the former before them.Indy then travels from Tibet after approaching love interest Marion portrayed by Karen Allen in humorous fashion to Cairo where the film's best moments occur.From memorable and hilarious Sallah to the iconic fight with the Arabs, Cairo remains the film's best location.After encounters with nemesis Belloq and the Nazis and a high octane car chase,the film enters its iconic and nail-biting climax.The climax is a really good one and avoids being disappointing.Also,the negative characters are really good, with Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq in a quite a funky performance and Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, who was perhaps the most hated character in the movie.He was someone I loved to hate.Overall, Indiana Jones and The Raiders if The Lost Ark is a marvelous film with iconic action, stellar performances, visual effects, memorable action scenes,humor and not to forget the iconic score.It has a certain charm which isn't present in the later installments,even in the almost-superior The Last Crusade.It is one of those rare movies you wish you could watch for the first time again.It's just that good.",10,1,2,23 October 2015

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Enough Fun To Make It The Second Best Spidey Yet
","Well Andrew Garfield Wears the Mask Once Again And Marc Webb's Back Too.Sometimes the movie might seem a little overstuffed with special- effects villains and over the top action.But The Story Of Peter Parker And His Relationships Save The Day.Mostly It Gives What The First Film Failed To (Secrets).Special Effects Were Amazing,Including Electro. Also,Dane Dehaan Steals The Show With His Portrayal of Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (But No One Can Replace James Franco For Me).Jamie Foxx Was Good Too But Not Perfect.I Expected More Rhino But He Appears In The Beginning And For 3 Minutes At The End.Finally,Andrew Garfield's Performance was Perfect and So Was Emma Stone.Pity She Dies At The End.Overall,The Film's Plot Might Look A Bit Unappealing but the top notch special effects,well chosen cast and love story save the day. Grade=A Score=8.2",8,2,5,14 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Best Since the Originals
","I would just say JJ did it! With great new leads armed with stellar performances, the original trio back, the iconic score, the visual effects a masterful blend of practical and computer effects, emotional depth, tiny bits of nostalgia present almost everywhere and fantastic villains, The Force Awakens is great way to resume the franchise. The opening, with many of the film's characters, is thrilling and establishes Kylo Ren as a villain to be feared upon.With the introduction of Finn, Poe and especially Rey and the Millennium Falcon being revealed, the films starts building its momentum, as Rey's life on Jakku accompanied by her score, makes the audience connect with her easily.Also, the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker is quite unknown. Expect Where's Luke to be more than just a hashtag. The pacing is fast, if rushed, but doesn't feels so due to the constant highlights and Lawrence Kasdan's great screenplay. Also, John Williams score practically improves everything.The Starkiller Base feels a bit underwhelming as it isn't as iconic as the Death Star but locations like Jakku respectfully pay homage to Tatooine.The finale is fantastic, and makes up for any of the mistakes the movie had committed, with the lightsaber battle being the most stunning of its kind along with being emotional and easily capturing a spot on list of best lightsaber duels. The ending can't be described, since it would be thought as a spoiler, but I would just say it sets up the next episode perfectly.As for the aspects, the action sequences were thrilling, visual effects were spectacular, screenplay was fantastic, the story a bit unoriginal and the performances spot-on, with Harrison Ford as awesome as ever, Carrie Fisher in the most Leia way possible, BB-8 living up to the hype, and Daisy Ridley and John Boyega performing in a fun, charming and amusing manner. The latter's verbal exchanges with Han Solo being hilarious and also one of the key highlights of the movie.Oscar Issac was the best of the new trio, stealing every scene he's in as Poe Dameron. But the standout performance was by Adam Driver, as Kylo Ren, an already complex character who Driver portrayed with more depth, resulting in a fantastic three-dimensional character.Almost every standout sequence in the film involves Kylo Ren.As for the motion capture perfromances, Maz Kanata and Andy Serkis were great, with the former as a female and orange version of Yoda and the latter making Supreme Leader Snoke look like a some-what more eerie character than Palpatine. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker can't be talked about since it would be termed as a spoiler, so I'll just leave it.If there's anything bad, it would be the story and handling of some characters. The story seems like a re-hash of A New Hope, with a few additional elements and hyped-up characters like Captain Phasma and Poe Dameron. The latter was the best of the new trio but was given very less screen time, and Phasma too. She was supposed to be the new Boba Fett, but by the looks of it, she may not be.Overall, The Force Awakens is fantastic film with brilliant effort from JJ Abrams and others. It captures the heart and spirit of the original trilogy to make a great final result. It's a thrilling ride and what a ride it is. It's perhaps the third best overall.Grade-A-",9,4,43,18 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Epitome of Filmmaking
","This film is sheer excellence. In my opinion, It's the best film of all time and the best film of the entire saga created by the visionary George Lucas.I mean, where do I start? It has everything a Star Wars fan could ask for. From the masterful Battle of Hoth to the unexpected twist at the end, from sweet-talking Lando and cult classic Boba Fett to iconic Yoda, It's truly a masterpiece.As for the aspects, The story is the darkest of the trilogy, The screenplay is the best of the bunch, the direction is commendable, the score, as always, by John Williams remains the best ever, special effects are top-notch and the characters and performances are fantastic.The opening crawl followed by the Hoth sequences, especially the Battle, is really enjoyable as it takes up most of the first act. Its end shows Luke, the protagonist flying with R2-D2 to Dagobah, to find Yoda while Han, Leia, C-3PO and Chewie escape from the Imperial troops.The training sequences at Dagobah are one of my favorites since Yoda is such an interesting character who Frank Oz voiced humorously. As for the rest of the gang, the scenes inside the monster were funny and romantic courtesy of the one and only Han Solo.The escape to Cloud City where they meet Lando, Han's old friend, and the CGI there is fantastic. Lando's sweet-talking was one of the film's best bits along with Harrison Ford's charisma.Meanwhile, the mysterious Emperor reveals to Darth Vader that Luke is Anakin Skywalker's son and Luke decides to stop his stop his training and go to Cloud City, to save Han and Leia,who might be in danger.After that, the third act is legendary. The duel between and Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker is one of the sagas's best moments, not to forget Han's epic 'I Know' response to Leia's 'I Love You'The pacing is OK, but might feel a bit slow if noticed or bored, which is impossible. Also, the fun and light tone of the previous film is completely lacking compared but is expertly replaced by the suspenseful plot line.However, the ending MAY be a bit daft due to the fact that it isn't a complete conclusion and is kind of a cliff-hangar ending.As for the performances, James Earl Jones and Frank Oz's voice acting for Vader and Yoda respectively is really good, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were satisfactory, Anthony Daniels was hilarious as C-3PO.But the best of all was Harrison Ford as Han Solo, the epitome of cool, whose charisma and rugged good looks enough to make girls swoon were some of few great qualities that made him the film's best character and performer. He remains my favorite character in the whole saga.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect movie with all the qualities a masterpiece should possess and packs a perfect sci-fi punch. The Empire of George Lucas truly struck back with a marvelous effort.Score-10 Grade-A+",10,1,2,23 January 2016
