Mission: Impossible III," All in all a good film
","This film was energetic and full of fun gadgets, there weren't many down points but some of the film wasn't very realistic enough. You only realise this, however, after you have seen the film. This film is worth going to see, but don't expect to much. If you are expecting a deep meaningful film this is not for you, as a teenager is was full of enough action to keep me awake!! The acting was sensational as always the storyline was quite thin at the start but picked up half way through. It is a good family film, but a good un' for the guys. Mission Impossible 3, doesn't let down the other two films which is the main concern facing most people thinking of watching this film. But hopefully they will stop now and not try for a forth.",8,0,0,14 May 2006
