Raiders of the Lost Ark," I'm just making this up as I go along.
","Imagine an oldtime Saturday matinee serial like 'Don Winslow of the Navy' given A-list status, a massive budget with the top craftsmen in the business involved, and you have the heart of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Except for a few relenting moments to allow the audience to catch their breath and for exposition, this movie proceeds at a rollicking pace with one great action sequence closely followed by another. If any movie can be said to be packed with thrills and chills--laced with winking humor--it's this one. Steven Spielberg deserves much of the credit for transforming poverty row camp into cinematic gold, although he never quite matches his orginal effort with the sequels much less top himself. The Biblical arcana is hokum, but the powerhouse special effects are almost a religious experience by themselves.",Null,0,0,18 November 2002
The Bourne Identity," An enjoyable Ludlum adaptation
","Contrary to expectations, 'The Bourne Identity' is a satisfying action-spy-suspense film. And it's made as though everything after the 1970s never occurred, a rather old fashioned movie in texture and technique. An over-used device like amnesia should have been a liability but never really slows up the intriguing narrative. Also the audience is ahead of the story when it comes to the mystery of who crossed-up the protagonist, but again it proves to be less of a stumbling block. Doug Liman, as director, keeps things stripped-down and on the ground--as opposed to the improbable comic-strip antics of James Bond--and at least makes the proceedings quasi-convincing. Matt Damon as mysterious-action-hero-in-search-of-his-past is likeable here and does a good job kicking butt. Unfortunately Franka Potente has little to do as does Julia Stiles in an almost throwaway bit part.",Null,0,1,29 November 2002
Total Recall," Arnold Schwarzenegger's most thoughtful movie.
","Total Recall works for most of it's length as a convoluted Hitchcockian science fiction thriller. It's only at the denouement that things become...despite an indulgence in sadism that would offend delicate sensibilities...cartoonish and unrealistic (e.g., exposure to the Martian environment would in truth be a swift race between suffocation and freezing to death). While as a whole the film has flaws--things that tend to ruin the suspension of disbelief--that aren't easy to overlook, there are a number of individual scenes that I particularly cherish, rewarding repeat viewings. There is, for instance, Doug (Schwarzenegger) Quaid's visit to Rekall, Inc., and the salesman's pitch that slyly reveals the entire plot of the movie beforehand. Another is the encounter in the Martian hotel room where the possibility Doug is unwittingly undergoing a dream--in the form of synthesized memories--is brought up, and another set of predictions particularly covering the third act is expounded. Lastly, the scene in which the villainous mastermind (Ronny Cox) reveals his stunning machinations qualifies as a mindbender. One more note: it's appears that almost every significant character in the film is not who he seems to be at first glance. Some other items in the movie's favor is the musical soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and spectacular special effects. Again, Total Recall is not greater than the sum of its parts, has patent absurdities that insult intelligence, and bloody violence. Still, it remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's strongest...and most thoughtful...film.",Null,30,51,12 November 2001
Apollo 13," Failure is not an option
","Since so many NASA insiders seem pleased with 'Apollo 13,' including astronaut Jim Lovell, I assume the story is fairly true to what actually happened. There was carping over some over-dramatized aspects and use of poetic license, but it's difficult to avoid criticism of this sort if the goal is an entertaining recreation of an historical event and not a documentary. (Ron Howard and company suffered harsher reaction to 'A Beautiful Mind' for essentially the same approach.) As far as I'm concerned, the movie is a rivetting one, a triumph of the human spirit against fearsome odds, against the lethal and unforgiving expanse of outer space. The actors did a creditable job, in particular Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as mission controller Gene Kranz. The computer graphics are spectacular. A footnote: 'Apollo 13' is the first movie to use real weightlessness or zero g (via the Vomit Comet).",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
Jurassic Park," Murphy's Law, not Chaos Theory
","'Jurassic Park' will always be noted in cinema history for featuring the most groundbreaking development in special effects since Willis O'Brien brought King Kong to life with stop-motion animation. Thanks to computer generated images, dinosaurs live again. But Steven Spielberg didn't originally plan to use CGI--he had more mechanical methods in mind--but turned to the rapidly evolving world of digital resources late in production, which indicates a technical savviness and flexibility on his part. Spielberg is anything but a technophobe. This is in contrast to the movie's Frankenstein theme, an inveighing against scientific hubris. Just because we can doesn't mean we should. The sequels should have taken the message more to heart.",Null,0,1,24 November 2002
