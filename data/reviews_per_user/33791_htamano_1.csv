The Blair Witch Project," Someone who doesn't like it!
","This film is unique in its method, which I find to be truly wonderful. However, once the veil of reality is lifted by certain acting choices and post-mortem late-night talk show appearances by the actors, the movie loses its edge entirely. When lost in the woods without food, without direction, and, ultimately, without a traveling companion, one's sense to make a documentary would likely fade in the emerging presence of the overwhelming need to survive. Cans of film wouldn't be hauled around. Batteries for lights wouldn't be hauled around. Cameras would be dropped when punching your buddy who kicks maps into rivers. I love film, and believe in the suspension of disbelief. But when the entire film's meaning rests on the shoulders of people's belief that 'it really happened,' those responsible for the film can not ruin this effect by crediting 'Director of Photography' first, appearing on talk shows, and contributing to the media's disintegration of the very veil that makes the film work.",1,1,3,2 September 1999
