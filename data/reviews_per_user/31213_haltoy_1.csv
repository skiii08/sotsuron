Marie Antoinette," VERY GOOD MOVIE
","I have seen this movie for second time on tv and again couldn't find anything wrong with it. I consider myself a cinefil, regarding number of movies of different kinds I've seen in my life so far. Someone here wrote, this movie will get more appreciated in the future. I agree. Don't understand negative reviews about historical inaccuracies if French education association awarded the movie. Also, you often have documentaries on the subject on tv, if you want. There I found out, that king demanded all of the aristocracy to move to Versailles after it was built, to surround the king and entertain him. Maybe this also contributed to revolution, if this remained the case 100 years later, because the 'upper management' was removed from different parts of France and maybe this also showed in economy? Just my thought.. From first time I have seen this movie, I remembered especially the excellent dinner scene at the end, when royals were dinning in mortal silence, still following court protocol, while the angry mob on the other side of windows was shouting for their heads. It makes you relate to that moment in history, how the disliked couple must have felt..The modern soundtrack is very innovative approach and probably also brought more youth to the cinemas to see historic drama. The birthday party scene stands out. Kirsten Dunst is lovely and witty with her facial expressions in this role. She should have received some awards for it. She's shown also in Fargo she's an interesting actress..Pitty Sophia Coppola doesn't make more movies, I very much liked Lost With Translation as well.",10,2,4,12 July 2018
