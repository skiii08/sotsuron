It," I turned it off after an hour
","I love horror films and am actually pretty easily scared by them, so imagine my surprise at falling asleep with this film. While there is atmosphere, I didn't find anything scary - maybe mildly creepy. That's it.There really wasn't much going on the first hour, and I really struggled to keep awake. Soon afterwards I asked myself 'why am I watching this when there are so many better movies to watch?' (something that I rarely, if ever, have asked myself) so I turned it off.If other people find this scary, then that's great. I found Pennywise more interesting than scary, and the film just had a bunch of cheap 'boo' shots and CGI monsters.Maybe something happens during the 2nd half? That's a long boring build-up, if that is the case.meh.3/10....",3,0,3,6 July 2018
In Bruges," utterly depressing, predictable and not funny
","I really don't know which film people saw, but the one I just watched was one of the most depressing, gory, boring and pointless films I have ever watched. To call this film a comedy is like calling 'Rear Window' a comedy. A few (few) jokes, and some strange characters do not make a comedy.This film is about suicide, death, killing of innocent children, guilt and hopelessness. Just what people find funny about this eludes me.The 'un-PC' dialog seemed forced and unfunny.Regarding the thriller/drama/crime aspect, I was never engaged with the characters and every plot twist could be seen 20 minutes before hand.I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a film.As a straight drama/thriller, the film put me to sleep. Combined with a total lack of laughs, I rate this a 3 and strongly advise people to ignore the trailer - it was very misleading to me.",3,10,28,20 February 2009
Underworld," Incredible
","The film experience of the year!  Imagine the best parts of the Matrix, Aliens, Terminator, the Howling, The Hulk, with fight scenes choreographed by Yu Wen Ping, gun battles by John Woo, with a solid story and characters, great special effects, acting and directing, all rolled up in a gory mesmerizing and unique film of vampires vs werewolves!  A 11 out of 10! Pure enjoyment without one moment of boredom......haven't been this excited about a film like this in years...",10,1,1,15 September 2003
Terminator Salvation," Fun Action Flick
","I have to admit, the first 20 minutes of this I was thinking 'uh oh. This is not looking good.' But after that, the film really worked for me.The good: 1) action scenes were incredible. There were quite a lot of jaw dropping moments for me. The huge car and robot were awesome! 2) I REALLY liked Marcus as a character and Worthington as an actor. I felt this film was really about him, and not connor.3) Set pieces were impressive What could have been improved: Actually only 2 things. 1) Christian Bale seemed to take away from the main story and the focus on Worthington's character. I just got the impression that there were close ups of him because he is a bigger star than Worthington. The film would have been a little tighter and more focused if Connor's character would have been put in the background (which is what rumor said the original script had).2) There was absolutely no explanation about Kyle's character and how it fit into the story. Sorry - I saw T1 and T2 eons ago and couldn't for the life of remember why this character was so critical to the plot.I really enjoyed this - a lot more than I thought I would.That being said, this is a VERY different Terminator film - it stands out in many ways different than the 'franchise.' Some may find that irritating.. I liked it.",7,2,5,21 May 2010
Fast & Furious 6," Incredible! Thoroughly enjoyable!
","I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.Not this time.I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!' and 'yeah' even clapping during a film!The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.This could be 'the' measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....run, don't walk to see F&F 6.(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)",9,188,362,21 May 2013
Tangled," much better than I expected!
","Just got back from a 3D showing of Tangled with 2 10 year old girls.The movie was GREAT! One of the more enjoyable kids films I have seen - it REALLY works for adults as much as kids..and not just girls either.The animation was top notch and VERY effective use of 3D. Much better than Toy Story. The 3D definitely enhanced the film, and there were some scenes that we actually reached out our hands to try to grab something! A first for us! The story seemed a little 'meatier' and mature than some of the other Disney films, while retaining the formula 'spunky girl goes after her dream and nobody is going to stop her.' I really don't want to talk about the plot because I thought it was very well laid out, with a TERRIFIC villainess, and a smart alec -tho-you'll-learn-to-love-him guy and a really likable girl. But it s a very clever take on the Rapunzel story.I was never bored.. I laughed (the humor is REALLY good - so slapstick, but some refreshingly subtle humor too). and yes, I cried (won't tell you why).This may be the most enjoyable Disney film I have seen in a LONG time.There were only 2 things I wished they did differently.1) The songs. They were 'okay' and served the film well, but nothing really stood out. I left the theater and couldn't remember one song. Nothing like 'under the sea' or 'circle of life' from the earlier films that stay with you after the credits have long gone by.2) speaking of credits, these were the lamest closing credits I think I have ever seen in a big budget film. There was nothing to keep our interest (and the closing credits were LONG).. No animation.. no clips.. no outtakes.. no surprise scene at the end, etc. Just text scroll. Of course, most people don't include closing credits in their review, but I have seen so many clever credits (remember Lemony Snicket's closing credits?) that after such a cleverly done film, just seeing plain text scroll for 5 minutes was disappointing.. Of course, we were the only ones left in the theater watching the credits so this may mean nothing to most people...Highly recommended for the entire family.9 out of 10.",9,3,6,27 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," The little engine that could
","Just got back from seeing Captain America.First, the good news.They FINALLY got the origin story right for a change and kept to Kirby and Simon's plot! VERY accurate and Chris Evans was PERFECT to play the scrawny Steve Rogers. (with 2 exceptions I will note later).The humor was on point. I would say >95% of the humor worked, which is VERY impressive.The references to other Marvel characters were truly wonderful, and were seamlessly in the film. That is not a small feat! The action scenes were decent.Now, what I didn't like (SPOILERS!!!!) 1) Chris Evans was all wrong to play Captain America. I can't be 100% sure if it was his inability to play the part accurately, or if it was written like that in the script, or if it was the direction, but he played essentially the SAME character after the change!! He was STILL a scared, clueless kid from Brooklyn when he became Captain America - he was just stronger and had a cool shield. At no point, did he exude confidence or leadership qualities - which were the hallmark of CA in the comics.The only quality he had was 'the little engine who could.' he never gave up! Well, that is a very admirable quality but Captain America was far more than that. He had the kind of personality that would make anyone want to follow him. Evans never exuded that. And you always felt that Captain America could take on anybody and anything single handed. In the film, I felt that he was helpless without his elite team watching his back.2) Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull also suffered the same fate. He was an extremely weak villain. Any Nazi from any 1940's based war film was more terrifying that this guy. In fact, his Agent Smith from the Matrix was more intimidating than his portrayal of the Red Skull. Having a weak villain is never good in a super hero based film.3) I can accept some of the changes to the story, (such as the costume change actually made sense in the context of the film), but changing Bucky Barnes to be a grown up didn't make sense, and greatly lessened the impact of his demise.4) I think having CA as a secret identity worked better as defined in the comics. Having everyone know that Rogers was CA took away a major plot device in the comics that always added a nice touch of humor and mystery..5) The whole major plot twist of having him frozen in ice was not clearly made. Some people in the theater thought that the whole movie was a dream, and that Rogers was simply asleep for 70 years after the transformation. Showing Rogers in ICE would have been a much clearer choice, and drop the whole movie as a flashback device, which just had the film start off on the wrong foot (I actually had to double check my ticket stub to ensure I was in the right movie!! the tone was that 'off' to me).6) the 'Chorus Girl' segment just went on WAAAY too long. The point was made in a few minutes, but it seemed to drag on to about 15 minutes or more and really slowed the film down for me.7) Too much of the film struck me as a sequel to 'The Rocketeer' that the director did years ago. I appreciate the reference, but that was a very different movie that I didn't think need to have it look-n-feel ported over to this movie.In the end, I found myself nitpicking the film to death more than liking it, yet I also really enjoyed myself and would recommend it as a fun summer film. So at that level, it succeeds.But it could have been SO much better.Oh, and yes, you really should stick around after the end credits. Those few scenes were worth the price of admission.Unfortunately, those post-credit scenes show that Evans will once again be playing Captain America. I, for one, was hoping someone else would take his place in future movies.7/10",7,4,14,22 July 2011
Van Helsing," Under appreciated fun
","Just came back from seeing this film.  What a blast!  I really don't know what all the critics were complaining about.  Stephen Sommers set out to create an action packed, roller coaster big budget fantasy film with all kinds of creatures, 'cool' special effects, funny lines, and a fun popcorn film.  I think he has succeeded.Visually, the film is brilliant.  The sets and photography were always fascinating.  And I was never bored for one minute.Yes, the plot has tons of holes in it - though I found what was there actually entertaining and the few plot twists I thought were actually interesting.  The characters were 2 dimensional.  But who in the world goes to see these kind of films for rich character and plot development?This film is more of a comedy and satire than a horror film.  Those looking to be scared out of their wits will be very disappointed (though there was at least one scene that made me jump). However, I saw this more in the vein of a modernized 'Abbot & Costello meets Frankenstein' than anything else. Mr. Sommers also does some great toung-in-cheek fun of Indiana Jones, Star Wars (love those Ewoks!), Alien, Batman, Gremlins, with some very funny lines.  I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.  And yes, I think these laughs were intentional.  Those who think this is MSK3000 material is missing the humor that is inherent in this film.In regards to the creatures themselves..Well, I personally found the CGI Mr. Hyde infinitely better than last years Hulk (and funnier too).  I mean, the film opens up with you seeing Mr. Hyde's drawers falling down and you see his butt!  How can anyone think this film was meant to be serious?The Frankenstein monster was more inspired by Mary Shelly's creature than Karloff's (even the ending was straight out of her book).  And Dracula was an over-the-top satire of Gary Oldman's Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola's version. The Brides were an over the top satire of the Hammer films. The Wolfman was really a nod to the Howling.  So ironically, while this is a Universal film, the creatures pay more homage/satire of other studios.Yet some of the scenes of the film were straight out of the 30's Universal franchises.  The carriages running through the night.  The mob of villagers storming Castle Frankenstein, etc.  At least I appreciated what Mr. Sommers was trying to accomplish.I even found the closing credits to be entertaining! (Don't know the last time I could say that).Yes, one can argue that we have had enough of 'leave your brain at the door' CGI based action films.  And I don't honestly know the replay value of this film.  But if you can go in with the right attitude, you can have a very fun 2 hour ride.",8,1,2,2 June 2004
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Fun B-movie!
","this is one of those cases where the trailer really did the film justice. It captured the look, feel, action and mood of the film.This seemed a mixture of the good parts of Van Helsing and Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness - mixing horror, comedy and action.The plot isn't all that much, but honestly - who goes to see these films for plot!I got to see this in 3D and IMAX - the 3D was VERY effective. It wasn't always 'in your face' but I felt in many scenes it added the enjoyment.There wasn't too much opportunity for boredom - too much was going on.Essentially its 2 witch hunters , uh,, hunting down witches! they eventually meet up with the head evil witch and chaos, death, gore and fun ensues.If you like the trailer, then you will have fun at the movies!It sets itself up for a sequel at the end, and I think I would see it.7/10",7,1,3,3 February 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," artistic torture porn
","I just got finished watching this film, and I feel as if I need to take a shower.This film makes Hostel look like a Gumby episode.Yes, there is good acting, cinematography, direction.But there is also***** SPOILERS ******* Graphic Rape scenes (both female and male), Torture, Incest, Bestiality, Graphic oral sex, Graphic sex scenes, excessive gore, Graphic violence, Mutilation, Dismemberment, Ritual killings, And a host of other disturbing scenesNo - I was NOT prepared for that.None of those scenes were needed, in my opinion. If the film wanted to make the point that we are all capable of torturing people, it still didn't have to graphically show those events.The plot? It has to do with the mysterious disappearance of a girl 40 years ago. I figured out the mystery in the first 10 minutes. It is essentially a Swedish version of the French Film 'Tell no one' - which I also thought was very predictable.None of the characters were likable. NO ONE.The girl of the title is pretty empty character, driven by trauma she suffered as a young child. Oh, and she is very good at hacking computers. Other than that, I didn't think I got to know her.The other characters too seemed very 2 dimensional to me. And I really found it hard to care for anyone.The film also went on WAY too long for me.. Too many subplots to tie up in the end.I understand the torture porn industry- I just don't care to see it.For those looking for a decent mystery, you will find it here.Among all the other seamy items mentioned above.I honestly wish I never saw this film.. Some scenes will haunt me potentially for life.Ugh.3 out of 10.",3,4,14,21 September 2011
Evil Dead," 101 things that didn't work for me..
","I could literally blog every day for at least 3 months on the things that irritated me about this film.I will recap just some of my thoughts . ******* Possible spoiler comments below ************1) The first 30 minutes played like a LifeTime story about drug addiction.2) the last 60 minutes felt like Saw meets Hostel by way of Martyrs. Just non-stop gore.3) There was not one second where I was scared.4) there was no sense of dread.5) Even though the film was supposedly about demonic possession, I never for one minute really believed it. 6) The so-called hero was one of the most irritating characters I have ever seen. I could not wait for him to die.7) The characters were - at best - 2 dimensional. Bland. 8) There was no emotional impact. I could care less what happened to anyone.9) The Demonic POV (the Raimi-cam from the original) seemed here more like a POV of a jogger in the woods.10) The acting ranged from mediocre to down right laughable11) The plot holes were so thick that you could drive a mack truck through it12) The film should win the award 'most consistently stupid things done on screen'. Even for the horror slasher, the actions of the characters went beyond stupid. My eyes actually hurt from rolling so much.13) The big-oh-so-scary demon that everybody was afraid of was the single wimpiest evil presence I have ever seen. Think the wimpy devil from Exorcist: Prequel kind of wimp.14) The makeup was not scary15) The music was so ineffective that I am not even sure there was a soundtrack.16) after 60 minutes (30 minutes of non-stop gore) I felt numb. at 70 minutes I started thinking about grocery shopping.Etc. etc. As I said, I could go on and on about what didn't work for me.The good? this film has two- and only two good things that I can say - the SFX was very impressive. Not scary, but impressive. And if you like gore, then this is the film for you! Not just buckets of blood, not gallons, - whole truckloads (no joke).This was a thoroughly typical teenage slasher/torture porn film. No plot, no logic, no acting, no scares, no music- nothing but blood and gore.Yes, it was competently made. If that, and tons of gore is enough for you, then you will definitely enjoy it!After about an hour, the woman next to me said 'so this is essentially about 5 really stupid people killing each other. With lots of blood. That's it?' I said 'yup. that's it'Did anybody cover their face in the movie? Sure!! When you someone pulling a needle out of the eye you will wince. That is not horror. that is not scare.. that is just 'gross out' moments.I talked to some people coming out of the theater. NOT ONE PERSON TOLD ME THEY WERE SCARED DURING THE FILM!Isn't that what a horror film supposed to do?Have we really just substituted frights and emotional scares with SFX, blood and gore and think its the same thing?Its been a long time since I have seen the original I definitely intend on doing so.. it has got to be better than this.As a remake it was better than most Platinum Dune projects - but that isn't saying much.As a film by itself, it is passable entertainment for gore hounds.Oh - if you must see this film, then please stay for the post-credit sequence. It was the only thing that put a smile on my face.I really wished I liked this film.. But I cannot recommend it based on my experience.May yours be different than mine.3 out of 10. Generously.",3,184,384,1 April 2013
Clash of the Titans," Enjoyable b-movie
","I went in to see this with low expectations. Most of the reviews were not kind.But I just wanted a fun, brainless 'popcorn' movie with some cool action scenes.And that is exactly what I got.There was only maybe 5 minutes where I was bored. Most of the time I appreciate the mood, sets and plot until the next action piece. And the action pieces were very good.I am a HUGE fan of stop-motion animation, and love Ray Harryhausen. But I knew this was a cgi-fest and accepted it as such. I actually really liked the improvements to Medusa, and while the other creatures did not have any of the personality of Harryhausen's work (very few CGI creatures do, in my opinion), they were pretty cool and I enjoyed those scenes.it did feel like a throwback to 1981 and to some of Harryhausen's movies. Which is not necessarily a good thing. Outside of Ray's creatures, the movies were sometimes dull, predictable and the acting mediocre. In many ways, this movie had the same flaws.But in the end, I enjoyed it and didn't regret seeing it on the big screen. And yeah, I plan on getting the DVD.I deliberately saw this in 2D based on the reviews I saw. Reviewing the film I really can't see how 3D would make a difference, so unless you have a burning desire to spend extra money I would think the 2D experience is fine.I didn't go into the plot, because that is covered by other user comments, but there were some nice plot twists over the original and some very nice touches of humor (which works here and did not work very well in the original).There was something that was lacking however, to make this a great film. Good, not great.if you go in with reasonable expectations, you might enjoy it.7 out of 10.",7,2,3,3 April 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," disappointing, though enjoyable, mess
","Meh. That is my initial reaction from just seeing this film. Wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but definitely not one of the better ones. And this is from someone who LOVES superhero movies and Marvel comics. It is hard to explain just what is wrong with this film, but it just seemed 'off'. The acting didn't see sincere, as if everybody was just phoning it in. The jokes seemed flat. The action scenes were confusing, exhausting and ultimately boring. The villain was weak. Too many subplots. The romantic plot seemed to come from nowhere. In short, the very things that worked so well in the first film worked so poorly in this film. Also, they seemed to ignore Iron Man 3? There was no true end credit gag either. There was a semi-post credit scene (shortly after a few credits) but it was not surprising and even that felt like 'been there. done that.'I have heard the Wheadon had to cut 30 minutes of the movie to keep it to its existing already long 2.5 hour version. Perhaps that extended cut on Blu-ray might yield a very different experience.This version just left me tired and disappointed.I would wait until this is on Blu-ray. No real reason to see it in a theater. There were no crowd-pleasing scenes.6/10.",6,3,8,3 May 2015
The Descent," truly great horror film!
","I heard some good things about this film, and I really liked Dog Soldiers but even so this was better than I thought. This is one of the few horror films that had truly fleshed out characters - I really felt I knew these people and was sorry when they died.The fact that this film essentially featured 6 women was also great. Despite other reviews, I definitely did not see this as women vs men. It was women vs creatures. The creatures were both men and women - it was an entire culture/family of creatures.But this film is as much about relationships and people dealing with their own issues as it was about the monsters.For horror fiends, this is a real treat too. Great FX, lots of gore and - thankfully - no nudity for an mostly female film. It was nice that despite women getting soaked (with water, blood, etc.) that there were no 'wet t-shirt' shots was very refreshing.I have heard there is an alternate ending that played outside of the US. But I liked this one too, so am hopeful the other one will be on the DVD.This is an extremely well done film that can satisfy horror, drama and both male and female audiences. And that is not a small feat.",9,3,7,3 September 2006
Kong: Skull Island," great creature feature!
","Boy did I enjoy this film.forget plot and logic. This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures.There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little ones.Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The end.Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie, and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile on my face... No spoilers.. you have to see it for yourself.My wife and I had a blast. The first 20 minutes were regrettably lame, but the rest of the movie was a hoot.8 out of 10 for fun factor.",8,198,375,12 March 2017
Despicable Me," cute family film!
","Surprisingly, there seems to be a lot of PG rated films lately - which is nice for families.We saw the previews in 3D and it looked like a cute film.Which it was.Just don't go comparing it to anything by Pixar, but it has heart and humor.Won't bother to repeat the story.. But it was nice to see Love as the central message of a movie.Love of a mother for a son, a son for his mother, children for their dad.And the minions love for ..um.. Grul.The message is that we sometimes lose track of what is important to us (family) when success gets in the way. And that wanting to please other people (Grul wanting to please his mother) stops us from being whom we were meant to be.The minions were cute, but felt they could have been used more...The cast was very good, and while the animation is not up to Pixar quality, the film was always watchable.Ironically, my theater could only get the 2D version. Somehow, I think this would have been more fun in 3D.Fun for the whole family - though there is one scene that looks like blood that could scare very young children.7.5/10",7,5,10,11 July 2010
Iron Man," Finally- they got it right!
","Finally, they made a comic book super hero film that was true to the source material (in spirit anyhow) and a great film! This film has action, heart and impressive special effects that didn't seem (oh no not another CGI shot again), a good plot, a great hero and a great villain.Robert Downey Jr was fantastic - and a lot of the films success rests on his bravura performance.In fact the movie was SO good, I really have to struggle to quibble with it. OK, having the Vietcong as the enemy wouldn't fly nowadays, but did we really need to have Middle Eastern terrorists? Do we REALLY need yet more stereotypes that Muslims and Arabs are cold blooded killers bent on mass destruction? Yes, I know they never were explicitly labeled as Arabs/Muslims, but they came across that way anyhow. If they wanted to make these 'generic' terrorists they could have been 'white English speaking' folks. It would have worked the same.Aside from this (and many would not even care), the movie was fun, fast, exciting and I can't wait to see it again and buy it on DVD! Not sure how many other films I felt that way after leaving the theater.And, those after credit scenes - WOWZA!!! Worth the wait!!",9,1,3,4 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," a grim masterpiece!
","This film was incredible! I found it to be a many layered, complex film that was influenced more by Ingmar Bergman than Michael Bay. The film deals with a lot - it is essentially three films woven together - Batman Vs Superman; Doomsday; Dawn of the Justice LeagueThe movie is done from an European-art house perspective. The flow is not linear, some of the film is more poetic than cinematic, etc.I was mesmerized by this film, and am convinced I will enjoy it more when I see it again.Affleck was great. He is now my favorite Batman!Snyder also managed to summarize the first Batman (keaton), 3rd (Kilmer) and 5th (Batman Begins) in about 10 minutes. Quite a feat.Jesse Eseinberg didn't bother me as much as I thought he would. I just accepted he was more the Joker than a traditional Lex Luther.In fact, I think I enjoyed the film because I just accepted that none of the major characters (Batman, Superman, Luther) were like their comic counterpart. This is a reimagining of those characters. I liked what Synder did - but I can understand why it angered some comic book fans.I also understand why some people hate this film. As I said, it is not a traditional super hero film by any means. Definitely not kid/family friendly (leave the little ones at home), and I can see it getting an R rating with just a few more killings and violence.The plot not flowing linearly also may disturb some. It is not until 1 hour into the movie that the 1st hour really makes sense. Snyder has woven a complex tale that does take a while to connect all the dots.It is also VERY grim. There are only 2 attempts at humor- that's it. This is a VERY serious film. Nothing like a Marvel film at all.If you are going in to see a big budget superhero action film, you may be disappointed. If you can suspend any preconceived notions of what the film and characters should be, then you may be in for a very pleasant - though intense - ride.I liked Doomsday.. the CGI didn't bother me, though I admit it could have been better.Wonder woman was incredible and really added to the cast.The introduction of the members of the Justice League was also unorthodox.The movie starts out right at the end of Man Of Steel. In fact, they could have called in 'Man of Steel 2 - Dawn of Justice' and that might have been better. There is no recap of MOS - it is assumed you know/remember what had happened, otherwise the entire opening scene makes no sense.The film also expects you to know these characters already.I did - except some of the members of the Justice League - which intrigued me.As I said, I loved the film and think it is a masterpiece. Perhaps Snyder's best work. But I fully understand why others will dislike or even hate it.It is a VERY unusual film, and I applaud WB for allowing such a film to be made. They could have gone the easy route but didn't.It will be very interesting to see how the DC universe unfolds.Personally I hope Snyder does the other ones. Others may disagree.9/10...",9,7,17,2 April 2016
Toy Story 3," Fantastic movie! Horrible 3D!
","First, the movie was great! I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed going to see a movie in a theater so much! I laughed.. I cried (yes, many tears were shed by the end of the movie).My 10 year old daughter loved it to.With reviews, I don't like to talk to much about the plot - I think the less one knows the better one can enjoy it.There were lots of new characters, though for my money Ken was the highlight!! Every scene he was in (especially with Barbie) was just too much! It was brilliantly plotted with very, very funny dialog. enough 'in jokes' that only adults would get (the great escape?), so everyone in the family can enjoy it.Not too many films one can take the family to see.. This is one of them.I actually may have to think where this stands in the Toy Story trilogy. Others have said 'nothing new' but I actually enjoyed this one most of all.There are some pretty scary scenes that might be too intense for very young children.. but you know no one is really going to get hurt or die in this film! The short before the movie was cute, but I wasn't quite as impressed as others have been.One negative comment - and the reason it is not getting a 10 from me - is that the 3D was 100% complete waste! There was not ONE reason that this had to be a 3D movie. not ONE shot took advantage of this technology. Even my daughter said 'why was this done in 3D? nothing is popping out at me!' Couldn't agree more.So go have a great time, and just put up with those silly glasses with the understanding that they will not add anything to the experience except perhaps add some unnecessary eye strain.",9,0,1,19 June 2010
RED," HILARIOUS Romantic action comedy!
","Just got back from the theater.I can't remember that last time I have so THOROUGHLY ENJOYED myself! There is a 'vibe' to this film that if you can go with it, will bring a smile to your face for 2 hours.It's actually a very gentle film - despite all the explosions and guns a blaring. It's also a tender lover story (a couple of them, really) - but all encased in a gentle and funny action comedy.The plot has to do with retired assassins, but what makes the film work is the acting, direction, timing and dialog. Every frame is filled with a wink and a nudge and a smile.There are gut busting scenes, but mainly just a lot of smiles and small laughter that are gingerly peppered across the film.While there is action, I would definitely not call this an action film. Die hard action junkies will be disappointed.If you want to see a sweet film, full of laughs, warmth, witty dialog, great acting and lots of explosions and gun fights - this is the film to see.I think all the actors were great - it's hard to pinpoint any single great performance. Willis, Freeman and Malkovich have never been better. and the minor parts by Borgnine and Dreyfuss just added icing on the cake.I lost track of how many times I laughed and clapped my hands. I honestly cannot remember doing that in a theater in a VERY long time.Bravo to everyone involved..Could a film staring Willis and freeman as assassins with explosions be the feel good movie of the year? It was to me.",9,5,11,15 October 2010
Munich," surprisingly well done!
","I am not a Spielberg fan. With the sole exception of Schindler's list, I have found his films to be boring, predictable, saccharine and manupaltive. Here he has done something wonderful - he has brought the Middle East crisis forward on film as even handedly as possible - given the circumstances. The film manages to bring the suffering of both the Jews and Muslims as part of real people - that aren't that much different if you can look at it from each of their's perspectives.I am shocked that people find this an 'ordinary film.' This is a brave film that I was even surprised could be made and distributed. And the fact that it was made by a Jew and could see the Palestinian side is even more astounding.I really hope people see this film and it makes everyone think a little more about what is happening other than just 'some crazy terrorists killing people.' There is a reason behind every violent act - and while, in my opinion, that violence is never justified, the motives for the violence are sometimes understandable. I believe it is through this understanding that peace may one day be achieved.It is very hard to talk about the film without getting emotionally involved in it's subject matter. I think anyone who really cares about what is going on in the Holy Land will be moved by this film. The acting was great and my only real complaint is the graphic nudity and sexual situations that I just felt could have been avoided and the same message conveyed.This is not just a great film - but an important one. And I am fortunate that someone with enough clout like Spielberg could get this distributed in theaters.",9,3,7,26 December 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," Great fun!!
","Just got back from seeing the movie.The less said about the plot, the better.I really think this could become a classic over time.It really had everything going for it.It was very clever without being condescending to the audience. The stoner dude was effectively used as a mirror for the audience. Which I found very effective. Every time a horror cliché was executed, he would say something like 'I do not think that is wise!'There were enough twist and turns that even this jaded viewer never saw coming.And oh, that climax!! Not only did it go totally insane in the last 20 minutes, the finale was about as non-Hollywood as you could get. I can't remember seeing an ending like that in a very, very long time.It has humor, a great plot (which alone is a novelty), gore, suspense, great special effects.I have read that some people thought this movie 'ripped off' a lot of other horror movies. I didn't see it that way. To me, this was a lovely homage to the genre and I think it did it with class.As you may have guessed, I have been very vague about the movie. Again, the less you know the more you will probably enjoy it.If you love horror, humor and smarts in a film, then you should enjoy Cabin in the Woods.9/10.",9,1,11,14 April 2012
Alien: Covenant," Very very good. Explains a lot!
","I don't get the negativity surrounding this film. I saw it opening day (so no info on what was going to happen) and loved it!First, the cinematography was excellent. Ridley really has an eye for the visual flair.The acting was very good, with a near-academy performance by Fassbinder. There were some great action scenes and some great scares.I won't spoil anything, but the special effects with Fassbinder were truly astonishing.I was captivated throughout the movie, and jumped out of my seat a few times. The new version of the xenomorph was cool/creepy/beautiful at the same time.This film is a wonderful wedge between Prometheus and the first Alien film. It explains a lot (who really created the alien creature and why was it created) and had some really great moments in the film.Most of the negative comments I have read deal with the lack of depth to the human characters. Really? This is in essence a monster film that tries to deal with some heavy topics. The human element is definitely secondary. The film is all about Fassbinder and the creatures. Watch the 1st Alien film and besides Ripley, and maybe Dallas, were the other characters all that deep?I can't wait to see it again on blu-ray.If you liked Prometheus, then you will like this better. If you hated Prometheus, then I don't know.. To me, it accomplished what it set out to do - tell some more backstory of the Alien and set-up the next film - which I am anxiously awaiting...8 out of 10...and from what I have heard, some scenes on the cutting floor might even have made this higher.Ignore the nay-sayers...Go an enjoy. The less you know going into the film the better.",8,42,78,23 May 2017
The Martian," very impressive!
","just got back from an advance screening. Wasn't quite prepared for the ride. I am not a fan of Matt Damon's work on film, but found him very effective as the lost astronaut on Mars who has to survive. I was never bored, frequently on the edge of my seat, and the dialogue was extremely witty. Once the credits rolled and I saw the name 'drew goddard' , all the dark and twisted comedic aspects of the film made sense. (Goddard did 'the cabin the woods.') This is a real crowd pleaser, with everyone rooting for Matt to come home. Most of us actually clapped at the end of the film. How many movies make you want to do that?The 3D is VERY effective.. I would recommend seeing it in 3d.9 out of 10. One of Ridley Scott's best efforts.",9,5,74,29 September 2015
V for Vendetta," amazing
","I was hesitant seeing this as I knew the Wachowski brothers were involved. I absolutely detested the Matrix sequels. Thankfully, they were not behind the camera on this one. And while they are given writing credits, they were working with such a strong story that I wonder if the real credit shouldn't be given to the director (who unfortunately is being lost in the 'film by the Wachowski brothers' media hype). But I digress.The film is simply amazing. One of the most intellectual films I have seen in a very long time. I believe if you really follow what is being said on screen, then this is a very challenging film. The acting was brilliant, cinematography, directing, etc.I am also surprised that a film like this - that essentially to me glorifies (or at least justifies) terrorism was released in today's political climate. while the base story is essentially British in nature, the parallels to America today are eerily close.This is a brilliant film and needs to be seen. Normally this would be produced by an Indie firm, so my hats off to Warner Brothers for having the courage to release such a daring and thought-provoking film! It's movies like this that make me think about going to the movie theaters again.",9,3,6,18 March 2006
Furious 7," What a Blast!
","Wow! When was the last time a film actually lived up to its hype? I cannot believe how much I enjoyed myself at the movies! This film was a TRIP!Yes, it is an illogical leave-your-brains-at-the-door movie with every law of physics thrown out, but if you can accept this, it is like a fantastic roller coaster ride.I said leave your brains, but not your heart. There is a lot of emotion to this movie - and not just because of Walker's death.The stunts will go down in history as THE definition of 'over the top.'One of the thing that surprised me is that this franchise if probably one of the (if not THE) most consistent with its story line and character development. With the sole exception of Harry Potter, I am not aware of any long standing franchise that has the exact same people playing the exact same roles with a story line that actually depends on the prior movies. Just remember that #3 is really the back story before the very end of #6. So the order is 1, 2, 4, 5,6,3, 7. If you have seen these films, the you understand.There is no recap here. If you have not seen at least 3-6, then some of this would be 'what are they talking about?' Han's story was throughout 3-6, Lettie's story started in 1 but really took off in 4 and 6, Sean only appeared in 3, etc.Regarding how they handled Paul Walker: just incredible. I was LOOKING for Cgi, body doubles, twin brothers, and - maybe because I was so caught up in the movie - I never noticed it. The way they ended the film was really nice. It could have been exploitative, but instead it was sweet.My only complaint (which is why I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10) is that - like #6 - it just goes on 20 minutes too long. Just one more insane over the top action scene than was needed. Minor quibble.My hat goes off to James Wan, who really surprised me. I have seen practically everything that man has done, and it has all been in moody horror films (after the 1st Saw film, he dropped the gore and torture - thankfully - from his subsequent films). Never would have expected him to direct an action film so well.Definitely on my wish list for the blu-ray version.If you like 1-6 (or even 4-6), then you will love this.If you have never seen any of these films, I would recommend seeing 4-6, then 3.If you don't like any of the others, then you won't like this.This franchise -for fans like me - actually seems to be getting better and better.How many #7's are rated one of the best of the series?I am ready for #8!!!",9,3,9,4 April 2015
