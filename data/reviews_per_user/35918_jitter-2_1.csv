The Blair Witch Project," Society is a heard of sheep!
","I heard from a couple of people that this was a 'terrific' movie. I should have known better yet hope springs eternal! What on earth is it this decade? Why on earth do movies like this become box office hits? The only possible explanation I can find is that 'Misery likes company'. It is true that it is a unique and original film, but wouldn't having 80 minutes of footage from a security camera in a cattle barn be original as well? When movies like this one or Pulp Fiction become box office smashes I have to wonder if our collective intellect has reached it's evolutionary peak and is now on the slippery slope downward",Null,0,1,24 October 1999
