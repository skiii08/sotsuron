The Devil's Advocate," Amazing theological movie
","(Minor spoilers contained)You may find this surprising but, as a Christian, I thought this movie was excellent. Extremely graphic in many places but boy did it make you think. Assuming Al Pacino's character John Milton was indeed the devil (this was heavily insinuated by the script and some of the characters clearly believed it, but Milton himself never admitted to it), the character was written in such a way as to line up with much of what the Bible says about him. He is wily, cunning, plays on the weaknesses of the humans he preys on rather than blatantly overpowering them. Seems harmless at first, seems even rather attractive - offering money, a good life, all sorts of promises. And interstingly enough, he keeps his promises - it's what he DOESN'T say that will trip you up every time. If I was an extremely spiritually aware person, but not a Christian when I saw this, I think I would have been terrified out of my wits by the truth portrayed by this movie. Which is, the devil CAN get you. It is so easy for him to lull us into a false sense of security. And I too would have done what Reeves' character did at the end of the final conflict, IF I did not know Jesus. Seeing as I do, my reaction would have been different, and the movie would have been a COMPLETELY different plot if Reeves' character had been a Christian. If you'd like to know what might have happened, I highly recommend you check out the novels by Frank Peretti, 'This Present Darkness' and 'Piercing the Darkness'.Devil's Advocate is a movie I would recommend to anyone who is a Christian! You'll learn a lot. Just be prepared for the nauseating graphic content of some of the scenes. I watched it with someone who had already seen it, she told me when the worst bits were, in advance! It was a good plan!",Null,1,1,10 September 2001
Saturday Night Fever," Sad and Frustrating
","I have to say I watched this movie in the hopes of seeing some good dancing. Well... some of the dancing wasn't too bad. But what disturbed me the most were the going-nowhere characters in this movie. If you enjoy watching young people who have poor role models and the emotional maturity of three-year-olds screw up their own lives and each others' lives, watch this movie. I found it quite depressing. Possibly the last moment was slightly redeeming but not enough (for me) to have made watching the movie worthwhile.",Null,1,2,2 March 2002
The Beach," The movie let itself down
","I was quite enjoying this film all the way through (apart from thinking that DiCaprio was woefully miscast - he's far too good-looking and charming to play such an annoying and charisma-less character) and then came - the END. I have never in my life come across such cinematic disappointment. How the film's editor can sleep at nights I will never know. All the tension, all the tragedy, all the realism was blown away in one fell swoop and may as well not have happened. Why didn't they just screen an episode of the Brady Bunch instead of spending millions of dollars and wrecking (so I hear) an entire Pacific island? Altogether unforgivable.",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
Moulin Rouge!," beautiful, fantastic, breathtaking... shallow
","I love this film. It is amazing to watch. A string of superlatives that ringed the globe could not come near to describing it.
Being a dancer, I loved the dance scenes (some of my friends were in them), they were unbelievably good. Very passionate and over-the-top, wonderful to watch.I loved the way Baz mixed current and past culture in so many ways - it made what could have been a period film into a relatable entity for so many people.The costumes in this film were remarkable as were the sets and effects, I could go on and on and start to write (probably really bad) poetry, that's how moving the visuals in Moulin Rouge were.HOWEVER I have one complaint: I did not cry. I was not moved by this film. It is an easy thing to do - I'm an emotional person, I walk into the cinema looking for opportunities to be swept away and moved inside by the production. Not in this movie though. The fundamental problem, for me, was the love affair. The love was not deep enough, they had not shared enough, their love had not really been tested enough for me to believe in it. Oh sure there was the Count, but he was a cartoon character - to ridiculous to be believably evil. I could not see him as a serious threat to the love of Satine and Christian.So there's my complaint. I couldn't cry at the demise of a love that was really too insubstantial to begin with.",Null,2,2,2 October 2001
Mission: Impossible II," eye candy and adrenaline
","I had heard this film was short on plot, and I had heard correctly! However, having said that, I actually thought that in most other respects it was a good film. I thought that (aside from lack of plot) the script was reasonably good, the main characters were believable and their responses to one another seemed real and not melodramatic. At times the camera work DID tend towards the melodramatic, which I know friends of mine have found quite laughable, but to me the shots were so beautiful that I didn't mind. I'm a very visual person and, being very tired when watching this movie, I didn't mind that there was not much brain-food, I just enjoyed the gorgeous images floating over the screen. We all know the ending anyway, honestly. The bad guy dies, the good guy wins the girl.This film was wonderful to look at, and for me, that redeemed a lot of flaws!",Null,1,1,2 October 2001
