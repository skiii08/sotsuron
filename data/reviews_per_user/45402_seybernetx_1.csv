Sucker Punch," Wasn't expecting much. Blew me away!
","Every so often TiVo offers 'cheap' (usually $0.99 or $1.99) movie rentals for download. I had downloaded a couple others, and was debating whether or not 'Sucker Punch' was worth the effort. It was.If logic and continuity are really important to you, you'll hate it.If you can just lean back, and let the images wash over you, you'll love it.Most of the movie is a fantasy, imagined by one of the characters. The fight scenes are kind of a combination of steam punk, and sword and sorcery, with a twist of kung fu martial arts. I saw a couple places (at least) where they were quoting from other movies, include one moment that was straight out of the ending of 'King Kong'. (The only things missing were the building and the ape) (trust me on that, it'll make sense)For the first time in a long time, I've found a movie I might be willing to buy, not rent.",Null,1,2,4 August 2011
