Minority Report," A delusion....
","As Kubrick's A.I. has been destroyed by mr.Spielberg, the same happened to Minority Report by Philip Dick. Both movies have insulting silly endings that come clearly form Spielberg's mind. The plot has infinite holes and the movie should have been 20 minutes shorter. This is the kind of dumb action movie with wonderful computer graphics that appeal so much people nowadays. It's not bad at all, but it's just that: action. Everything else is left behind.",7,0,0,7 October 2002
Mission: Impossible," Hilarious in his mediocrity
","I cannot believe there is people that liked this movie. Not only it lacks any kind of realism, any kind of acting and any kind of plot, but also it shows us such an old load of clichÃ© that you will be asking for your money back. It seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by Brian De Palma!",3,3,8,23 May 2000
Gladiator," Hollywood is not history
","This movie has nothing to do with history, is totally unrealistic and is packed with amazing action. In other words, it's exactly the usual kind of movie Hollywood has been producing for ages. It's not different from that silly 'Hercules Vs. Zorro' movies that Titanus produced 40 years ago. Such a pity: Scott was my favorite director.",5,0,0,23 May 2000
