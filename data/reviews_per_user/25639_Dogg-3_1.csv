Requiem for a Dream," A punch in the face that you'll enjoy
","This movie is a shocking, dark, violent and disturbingly delicious.  This is the best movie I have seen this year.  As good as I found this movie to be, it is not for everyone.  People that like to feel good after a movie will not like this movie.  This movie follows the lives of 4 people through the dark and wicked ways of drug addiction.  The movie is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Pi).  This movie would not be nearly the movie that it is without the fresh and laser sharp editing techniques that Aronofsky uses.  If you've seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about.  The true gem and centerpiece of this movie is the performance that Ellen Burstyn gives.  Her character continues to haunt my mind months after seeing the movie.  This is one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen.  She is deserving of an Oscar. This movie enters your system like a drug and possesses you for two hours and leaves feeling lousy and craving more just like a junkie.  And you thought watching car wrecks was disturbing.  This movie is a 10.",10,0,0,3 August 2001
