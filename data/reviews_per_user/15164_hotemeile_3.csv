Sucker Punch," Worst porn flick ever
","I'm confused...There's more grunts than dialog in this movie, so this is clearly a porn flick, right? On the other hand, unless i got the censored version or something, there doesn't seem to be any actual sex in it... That is, if you don't count guns as phallic symbols and all the explosions as ... well, you know what i mean.Then again, this is certainly a work of masturbation with no real plot to talk about and horrible acting across the board, so it really can't be anything else than porn.The lack of sex scenes however forces me to award a very low score.",3,0,5,21 January 2012
Rango," Watch out Pixar!
","I approached this movie with caution. I anticipated entertainment from reading some reviews, but was weary as always of its blockbuster character. Let's be honest: Nickelodeon has been consistently pouring out terrible movies; Gore Verbinski has yet to prove himself outside the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise; John Logan, despite all his brilliance in other screenplays, hasn't shown to be at the same level with animation, as his work in Sinbad attests to. So, critical acclaim aside, i wasn't convinced...But scratch all that! This is a new age for Nickelodeon, a defining moment for Verbinski and a testament to Logan's literary genius.Rango has everything: masterful CGI, impeccable storytelling, radiating creativity, surgical attention to detail, humility, depth, vision; and almost none of the usual handicaps, clich√©s and mistakes of the genre. And let's not forget humor, a cascading, gushing, showering deluge of humor: meta humor, black humor, adult humor, satire, parody, and of course, potty humor. But its crowning moment is its referential humor, its homages - the Spirit of the West, the Fear & Loathing... All beautifully interwoven into the story in a way that separates it from what so many mash-up comedies try to do (and fail horribly).The western genre is made fun of repeatedly, but never is it ridiculed or tarnished. It's a story made with love and admiration for its themes. A wondrous thing in this cynical world and a rarity amid comedy. Humanity is reflected perfectly in this fable. And viscerally. With all its flaws and weaknesses, and all its charms and achievements. And despite the many anecdotes, despite the myriad caricatures, it's never shallow, never false. It remains true to its principles and offers as many laughs as lessons. And by that, i am truly amazed.",10,1,1,28 January 2012
50_50," More than a cliff-hanger. A movie that will hang with you for a long time.
","I walked into this movie expecting to be shocked into laughter with all sorts of grotesque black humor. I didn't get what i expected, and i'm glad i didn't. I did laugh. I laughed like i would if i was hanging out with Kyle, getting hammered and chasing skirt, trying desperately not to take life too seriously. Because this is one of those rare movies that make you forget you're watching a movie. I felt like one of the guys, truly disturbed by the tribulations, truly relieved by the few good news. I was spitting insults at Rachael, like i'd been waiting for years to let her know. I wanted to hug Adam's Mother. And i think i might have fallen a little in love with Katherine.I feel like an idiot saying this, because after all the hundreds of movies i've seen in my life, i was sure i'd be immune to this gullibility. I really really wasn't prepared to cry like a little girl at what should've been just a fun creepy comedy. I must have some weird eye disease or something.But that's how good this movie is.John Levine has crafted a flawless pearl. His directing is so perfectly impartial, so focused on the characters instead of style, that it allows for the actors to become their parts in such a complete way, you'd be surprised if they were actually different people in real life.A must-see work of art which will leave you staring endlessly at the credits all the way to the last line, directing the rest of the movie in your head, like you were planning to meet them all again tomorrow...",8,0,0,26 January 2012
