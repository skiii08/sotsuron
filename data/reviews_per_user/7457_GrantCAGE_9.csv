The Mask," FANTASTIC, SPECIAL EFFECTS-LADEN MOVIE ROLLERCOASTER!
","I saw this for the first time at the cinema in 1994 when I was 10 and I just loved it! I bought the video as soon as it came out and I watch the movie regularly. It's not Jim Carrey's best movie (Dumb And Dumber is lol), but it was one of my favourite movies for ages! The animated effects are genius and the storyline is also endeering. The way plain old Stanley Ibbkiss (Carrey) finds an old, ancient mask and puts it on and becomes a rowdy, crazy, cartoon-like happy maniac is just so classic! This was Cameron Diaz first proper movie role and she's great as well as Tina Carlisle (who stanley's attention is immediately attracted to lol) and what a movie to be involved in. THE STORY IS CLASSIC, THE ACTING IS SPOT-ON AND THE EFFECTS ARE EYE-BOGGLING! 10/10",Null,0,0,2 August 2001
Ghost," Before Sam Died he promised Molly that he's love her forever. (sob)
","I first saw this movie years ago and I must say watching it again now that it still has it's magic. The characters are cast well with Patrick as Sam Wheat and Demi Moore as his partner Molly. There is also the comic interest with the brilliant Whoopi Goldberg as the fake spiritualist women who is the only living person that the dead Sam comes across who can actually hear him speaking. It's a classic love story filled with romance, violence, suspense and a twist that creates the films magic. 9/10",Null,1,2,22 June 2001
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Dazzlingly Superb Animated Family Movie!
","This movie is superb! Anyone would find something enjoyable in it! Human actors and actresses perfectly interacting with cartoon characters is brilliant in itself and the great storyline is a bonus. Roger Rabbit has some great lines and the interplay between Bob Hoskins and Roger is simply stunning! There are plenty of great actors in this movie and some of our most favourite cartoon characters as well. Christopher Lloyd is great (and scary!!!) as Judge Doom who believes in toons paying the price for the crimes they have committed. So all in all i'd say that this movie has something for everyone, whether it's tiny children, adults and even older people will find something to delight in while watching this superb, effects-filled Blockbuster! Truly satisfied viewing. A whole thumbs-up!",10,0,0,25 April 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One Of The Best Sci-fi/Action Movies Ever!
","This is a great futuristic movie. I wasn't so keen on The Terminator (1984) in which Arnie played the bad cyborg trying to kill Sarah Connor but in this movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day he is the good robot in human form sent to protect Sarah Connor and her son John Connor from the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). This is gripping stuff and the special effects are revolutionary throughout the movie, especially the T-1000 liquid metal scenes that are really dazzling to watch.  Unlike many movies of this variety, Terminator 2: Judgement Day compliments all the SFX by a decent storyline which is strong and prominant throughout the movie without just focusing on the violence and bloodiness. It's one of my favourite action movies and well worth checking out even if you're not into that sort of thing. Try it. You just might like it! 9/10",Null,1,1,21 May 2001
Dirty Dancing," This Movie Is A Breath Of Fresh Air
","This is a fabulous movie. Probably one of the best musical romance movies ever. Jennifer Grey couldn't have been better cast as 'Baby' Francis Houseman and Patrick Swayze is in great form as dirty dancing Johnny Castle. The interplay between the two stars is amazing throughout the movie. All of the stars are perfectly cast in this romantic, summery movie which is simply a breath of fresh air.",9,0,0,16 May 2001
Dumb and Dumber," Hilirious Road Movie!
","This is a fantastically funny film! it's the story of Lloyd and Harry (Carrey and Daniels) who are tired of the same old boring, hard life. When Lloyd drives Mary Swanson (Holly) in his Limo and falls in love, it only seems right that Lloyd and Harry should return her briefcase that she forgot at the airport...to Aspen! It's a hilirious movie with some crude sexual references and toilet humour but it comes off great! Jeff Daniels is hilirious in this movie and i was surprised he was so funny! Especially the 'Turbo Lax' scene in which he's just hilirious! All in all this movie is well worth seeing, there's never a dull moment in it and it's a great laugh throughout! There has been so many movies like this since it's release but it can't really be touched! A big 'Thumbs-Up' for a very hilirious movie. Check it out.",9,0,2,25 April 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," SUPERB MOCKUMENTARY!
","This is hilirious! Michael Mckean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer taking the mickey out of all those heavy metal bands! There is some damn funny scenes in this excellent, inventive comedy. Nigel Tufnel is so dumb that he's just hilirious to watch! There are too many funny parts in this movie to even start mentioning! Just buy this 'rock mockumentary' and enjoy all the scenes that are perfectly executed and the jokes and double-meanings simply cackle with invention and freshness even when watching it now some 17 years later. Amazingly articulately cast throughout, every character just shines with the humour throughout the movie. When watching the movie, you even start to believe it's actually a real band and genuine documentary! If you wanna real light-hearted laugh at the music world then buy this! Amazing!",Null,0,1,29 April 2001
Jurassic Park," AMAZING MOVIE FOR IT'S TIME
","Great cast and absolutely breath-taking special FX make this BOX OFFICE SMASH a true winner. Wont go on about the plot too much as when you are watching the movie you simply don't care. All this movie is about is the FX which, on it's own is supreme. ****1/2",Null,1,3,5 September 2003
Beetlejuice," WHY IS EVERYONE IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE? IT'S APPALLING!
","I have no idea why everyone is going crazy over this movie! It's just not funny. The make-up is tacky, the acting is even tackier and the main reason why it isn't funny is due to the sheer dullness and bland jokes throughout! It's a sort of horror/comedy that just doesn't mix at all. The whole thing looks as if it was made and a budget and it's so dated! I think this movie could've been OK, but it's completely let down by bad acting, drab and depressing scenery and tacky effects! AVOID IT! lol",Null,0,2,2 August 2001
