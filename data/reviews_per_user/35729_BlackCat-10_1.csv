Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace....BRILLIANT!!!!
","I don't know what is wrong with those people who say The Phantom Menace is not worth of being called a Star Wars movie, because this movie was AMAZING!!! I don't see how you can't like this movie!  It is so much fun!! I think the people who don't like it have lost all sense of FUN in their lives because that's the only excuse there is! There was not one bad thing about this movie (AND I LOVED JAR JAR) this isn't Citizen Kane, you don't watch this movie scrutinizing every little thing, you're supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy!! Critics and Fans who don't like this, I really think you need to rediscover what the word FUN means and see this movie with an open mind because obviously you haven't!!!",10,0,0,21 May 1999
