Casablanca," An absolutely beautiful masterpiece
",My favorite film of all time. Beautiful plot that naturally weaves together and builds to a truly emotional climax. Could affect even the most nihilistic of people. A masterpiece that is truly one of the greatest films ever made. 10/10,10,19,19,25 December 2018
Darkest Hour," Fantastic movie - really worth watching. Oldman deserved the Oscar
","Clearly Oldman is the star of this film, fully convincing in his turn as Winston Churchill. The dialogue is amazing and the flow great as we see a charismatic Churchill who as harsh as he may seem, truly cared for his country. Hearing that the subway scene wasn't true did inevitably diminish its greatness for me, but that horrible ending! Out of nowhere! Left the movie on such a weird note.",8,16,23,12 May 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Deserves all the accolades it got. Great movie.
","Outstanding film with great performances across the board. Sam Rockwell is truly phenomenal in this role. Stunning acting from a superlative cast. Just shows what can be done with a simple setting, minimal special effects (okay, the explosion), and just a spectacular script. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed in this. Deserve all the plaudits. The emotion is raw and the pain it draws from you stays long after leaving the cinema. It's a triumph.",8,0,1,6 June 2019
Lion," This is a beautiful story about a lost little boy in India.
","Absolutely moving. Touches your deepest feelings. There couldn't be a better cast. Everything, from the language and location to the actual footage in the end, make this a masterpiece. Excellent Movie. This extraordinary tale was a good watch!",8,0,0,6 June 2019
Dunkirk," Incredible cinematic experience !!!
","A war movie done right. The film is beautifully shot and the sound design so amazing. Filled with emotion even with a story that does move quite slowly, despite its short running time. While unnecessary, it could also use a central character, which I believe would have worked better.",8,0,2,6 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," PERFECT MOVIE
","It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years.
Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say.",9,6,12,3 May 2019
Drive," An instant cult classic.
","Cast's Performances, Music and Photography. Everything is just perfect. This movie does all of those things perfectly in my opinion. Ryan Gosling is damn near perfect playing a soft-spoken man with some inner demons. Some of the stylish, sleek, and seamlessly cool imagery in this movie gave me chills. If you are looking to study films and how they should be made, please watch this movie. Drive will go down as an arthouse classic.",8,0,3,10 May 2020
Schindler's List," SENSATIONAL !!!!
","This Movie is sensational. I must say Its a piece of art. It delivers the message of human spirit. The direction and screenplay is just astounding and truly a great cinematic experience.
Overall, Schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie. its engaging and will keep you engaged throughout. Must-watch. I give 9 out of 10.",9,5,8,9 May 2019
1917," A journey worth taking. Mendes keeps his film brilliantly paced throughout.
",Incredible cinematic experience . 1917 sets up the main plot quickly and from there just moves. Even in the 'slower' portions the audience is left wondering what issue is going to arise next. I might've thought I was actually watching World War 1. Watching the movie you can really feel Sam Mendes's passion for the movie that he's creating. This film should be on every movie buff's shelf at home.,9,0,1,10 May 2020
The Imitation Game," This movie was masterfully done.
","Great film about a not so well known part of WWII, Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent. I really liked this movie. it was pretty interesting to watch. One of the best movies I have ever seen.",Null,6,8,12 May 2019
Don't Breathe," Edge of the seat thriller !!!
","A deep, disturbing, emotionally filled, masterfully filmed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime. This is one of the best movies of the year by far and if you like thriller it is a must watch!",8,0,1,6 June 2019
The Shape of Water," Possibly one of the weirdest love stories I have ever watched! Good acting nevertheless!
","Highly overrated movie with mostly no surprise, forgettable acting and disappointing visuals. Loved Shannon's performance and Del Toro's depiction of Strickland though, both bold and so cliche that you can't take your eyes off that character.",6,14,24,12 May 2019
Crazy Heart," Extremely good movie. Sentimental !!!
","This is a sweet and believable film about real people. The story is anything but original, and yet it is done very nicely, with kind, genuine performances and a majestic Jeff Bridges. One very good move is that the director and screenwriter put most of the exaggeration and cliches at the beginning of the movie in order for us to 'get' the characters. In doing so, the movie got more interesting and realistic as it went on.",Null,6,6,12 May 2019
Parasite," Brilliant !!!
","NOW THAT'S A MOVIE. Everything from the opening to the closing was quite the spectacle. This is a modern day masterpiece. Masterful Cinematography. Bong's a genius when it comes to building up tension in this film. Everything from color grading, angles, and mise en scene were done with intention, providing a treasure trove of symbolisms that draw up a larger social commentary about the state of poverty in Korea. The best part of this film was its ability to bend genres, serving up comedy and drama so naturally.",9,2,2,8 May 2020
Marriage Story," Masterpiece !!!
","Incredible movie. Beautiful acting, script, score and cinematography. The performance that was given by Scarlett and Adam makes the story drive deep into your heart and breaks it. Amazing. I felt like I was watching a true, messy divorce instead of just a movie. An underrated masterpiece. Not to miss!",8,2,2,10 May 2020
Rear Window," One of the most outstanding masterpieces of Hitchcock's movies
",A fantastic movie. Hitchcock at his finest. Jimmy and Grace are astoundingly brilliant in what is one of my favourite movies of all time.,9,9,11,8 May 2019
