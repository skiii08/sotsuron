The Blair Witch Project," What a clever film!
",This film is very clever indeed.  It gets into your head and if you don't stop it and come to your senses it can make you extremely terrified.  About half way through the film my heart rate was getting so fast I was struggling to breathe.  I had to remind myself that it wasn't real and that it's just a film!,9,1,2,3 January 2000
