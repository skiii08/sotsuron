Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a cruel travesty!!
","As TPM drew to a close, I keep thinking to myself dreams are only fantasies not able to be fulfilled. George Lucas has insulted our capacity to participate with the world that Star Wars has meant for long-time fans. The worst is that the 8-10 yr-old kids for whom the movie was made must have felt strange also. Aside from Jar Jar Binks and the cocky Jake Lloyd, the trade taxation and blockade plot is pointless to kids that are just beginning to learn their math and grammar.The movie has a really bad self-conscious trip and feels as if itself knew that it was part of a pop culture phenomena.(Kind of like in a galaxy far, far away in 1999, not a long time ago.) The acting was so terrible. But this is not to blame on the actors. Aside from Jake Lloyd, there was true potential in Neeson, McGregor and Portman. It's just that Lucas wouldn't have the time or the desire to let their talents show. That Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan routine just felt like they were Batman and Robin, and although the Queen's wardrobe was nothing less than astonishing, it seemed so heavy for Natalie. I suppose that's why she's so rigid throughout the film. Jake Lloyd seemed to me like a moron kid than the young Dark Lord Vader. What the hell with those 'Yipee''s!!!!Don't get me started on Jar Jar Binks, please. Why didn't this character die? Ohhhh, I could have imagined the soaring applause from the audience!!!! By the way, I don't even know anyone that liked this character. Chewbacca was kind of goofy, but at least funny. Jar Jar Binks is just stupid, obnoxious and dumb.It is utterly impossible to comprehend how at the end of the 20th century, Lucas didn't use models and actors for ships and creatures. The effects were way overused. The problem with this is that no matter how well done the CGI is done, it doesn't convey the mass and volume of the objects. You just know they're superimposed. And how can the past of the first trilogy be somehow more high-tech? I'm talking about the ships for example, their chrome-like surfaces and the aerodynamics (some clearly modeled on the Blackbird SF-71). It doesn't make sense. The only puppets here were Yoda (I think Lucas felt it would have raged the audience to digitize the wise Jedi; but Star Wars is not only him) and the Trade Federation Viceroys.Which bring me to the accents: I still know why the ANH scene between Greedo and Solo was so great. It was not only the tension of the dialogue, but the use of the subtitles!!! It gave you the feeling that we were in a galaxy far, far away. No such thing here: The Viceroys are Japanese, Watto is Arab or Italian, Jar Jar Binks obviously a Jamaican. And what about the two-headed announcer? Is this the NASCAR race? I thought that at any moment they were going to say the pod race was sponsored by Castor Oil.It would've been so easy to invent languages for these characters(Although the attitude of Watto was very cool, kind of slick. That I would've kept).And the relationship between mother and son wasn't well sketched. But again, I think this was mainly Jake Lloyd's fault (God, did I hate the kid!!). He doesn't make you feel the connection.Having to explain scientifically the Force killed it. With this, my inner child died from then on. Whatever happened to Yoda saying in ESB: 'Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter'? At least the new age mumbo jumbo gave some mystique to the story.Darth Maul will probably pass as the most underused great character in Star Wars history.  More Darth Maul instead of Jar Jar would have benefitted the movie immensely!!Well, I could go on and on, the 'roger,roger' android-speech, the androids themselves, the last lap of the race being longer than the previous ones, the double character of Natalie Portman (unnecesarily confusing), the long-necked Jedi of the Council (have you heard about mass proportion?), but why bother? This movie has more holes than a golf camp. Since I've seen many people torn between deception and loyalty to the franchise, it would be unnecesary to say what I liked about it. There are still few detractors like myself, but time will give us the reason to say that this doesn't hold a candle. Suffice it to say, see it, and plunge into depression.",Null,0,1,29 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Super sweet!!!!
","Up to this point, I considered South Park to be a very imaginative show, thanks to the ability of Stone and Parker to come with things that few people could ever conceive in their minds (Mr. Hanky comes in handy). After seeing this movie, I changed my mind about them being creative. They're freakin' geniuses, for God's sake!!!!!! If you thought they had pushed some buttons in the TV series, in here they start the next world war, quite literally . Crude, vulgar, sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, all in the name of some good political incorrectness. But don't worry: there's some social comments about our state of morality for us who like our humor raunchy but deep. What amazes me even more is the accuracy with which Stone and Parker satirize American vices. I laughed my butt off at a part when a man steps out of a movie in the picture sayin': 'What did you expect? They're canadians.' I heard a man in front of me sayin' this same thing and leavin' the theater when I went to see eXistenZ (a recent movie by talented Canadian film maker David Cronenberg).Talk about life imitating art!!!!! I even envy Canadians a little bit, 'cause they'll be having an intellectual high with this film. There's some wicked references to some films like Clockwork Orange, Patton and Akira, so go and find them. Also, the musical numbers were great, mocking everything from Disney musicals to Les Miserables. This movie is really one of the greatest mixtures of high art and low humour I've seen in a very, very long time. If you thought Beavis and Butthead do America was naughty, you'll think it's a conservative crap after you see this. Ahhhhh, and one word of advice: Don't eat too much before the film because you may either barf in disgust or hurt your stomach from laughing your ass off.",Null,0,0,10 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's last is a GREAT movie and its tone reminded me of another underrated film-maker
","First of all, I want to say that this film has been targeted at the wrong audience, the type that probably goes to see most Hollywood mainstream stupid fare. That is why most people have said so many times it is boring and pointless. Second, Kubrick made a film with Warner Bros. but ultimately this is a conscious art film that the company rarely, if ever, gets to finance. Certainly is the prestige of Kubrick that makes for a film like this to be as widely distributed as any other Hollywood film.Having made that point, it seems very clear to me that Kubrick made a film not caring for the size of its viewing audience. When you think about his other ones, he hasn't cared either. But Eyes Wide Shut feels very experimental and definitely his sense of adventure works. It is a very disturbing portrait of male sexual psychopathology that Kubrick hadn't tapped before as deeply as this (very much more than in Barry Lyndon). As time passes by, Eyes Wide Shut will certainly stand as his weirdest movie. This movie was very satisfying in all levels: the choice of music (some excellent somber compositions by Ligeti) and the uses of certain cinematographic colors and lighting to enhance the uneasy atmosphere.Kubrick deliberately directs the actors to give a very constrained and methodical style which reminded me very much the way David Cronenberg directs the characters of his movies. By the way, this movie brought memories of the excellent Crash from the EWS tone to audience's reactions in the theater, which confirms my theory that this movie should have been made to showcase on art film festivals. It doesn't matter if people hate this movie 'cause past Kubrick films hadn't been well received at the time of its release. Sure, now all people say 2001 and Clockwork Orange are classics but that's just 'cause they've heard others say so, not because they truly appreciate these movies. Back in 1969 and 1971 the films went under heavy attack (check some film history to see for youlself), but still they have stood the test of time. And so will Eyes Wide Shut.",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
Cube," Good and interesting movie, if somewhat flawed
","Yesterday, I got the chance to see this movie on the Sci-fi channel. I had planned to rent it at the video store but had never got the chance. Well, now that I've seen it I can say I could have spent a good $3 'cause the movie delivers on its premise.As has been said before in other reviews, some of the weak points of the movie are its far-fetchedness with math principles (I'm no math wiz but how the math girl wasted even 3 seconds to ponder if even numbers are prime? Hello?). Some of the acting gets sometimes too melodramatic for its own good, and they tend to overact.But considering this is a low-budget film, I think they worked wonders with the single set and the general atmosphere of the film was pretty creepy. Considering that nowadays it's difficult to see good horror anymore (although this movie it's more of a sci-fi/horror blend), it's great to see some explicit gore in a movie (the first death of the movie will quickly summon Hellraiser to mind).Remember that most of the good horror outings now are coming from the independent sector (Check out also The Ugly, which was released also by Vidmark). The Blair Witch Project is another recent example to remind us that the future of horror does not lie in Scream and I know what you did last summer, those pitiful attempts at the genre.",Null,0,0,25 July 1999
