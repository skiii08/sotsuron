Raiders of the Lost Ark," adventure thriller of unparalleled brilliance
",Harrison Ford acts brilliantly as a 1930's superhero/ Anthropologist. This film and its predecessors kept me at the end of my seat. I found few if any boring moments in this movie. The story line kept me guessing and wondering if all would turn out well. Even the love story parts kept me watching with held breath. The story kept me guessing about what events were to unfold and I never did predict them correctly. This movie is an original and stands out as a real classic. Harrison Ford was at his best. The story never looses its pace and stays believable. In addition this is a film where the characters have been well developed and the script stays clear and clean.,8,2,4,29 March 2005
The Sixth Sense," A suspense/thriller that follows a boys' extra sensory perception.
","This movie is absolutely outstanding! It's not often that I rate ANY movie higher then a seven. This film is clearly an exception. The Sixth Sense promises to be a classic! If you like horror/thriller, I higher recommend seeing this film. (just not necessarily before bedtime)There are so many twists and turns that even if one was to attempt to guess what the finale holds, one would likely fail. It's best to just play along with the script. The camera work and sets are expertly designed. It's almost impossible to find a mishap in this regard. Another rarely: This film is able to keep one attention on the screen even when it's already been viewed. I have seen this film at least 5 times since its' release in 1999 and it never fails to send a new fright. The wide screen version is definitely the best.",10,1,1,26 February 2005
