Hereditary," The best horror film in 2018
","This is too scary, There was no jump scare but I'm freaking scared and i never want to go back and watch again. It was so painful to watch till the end and the last 15 minutes, It was too shock and I cant even breathe . Overall, It is terrified me and very recommend.. Toni performance was blow my mind.. She should won an Oscar.",10,1,2,16 October 2018
