The Longest Yard," Unfunny 2-Hour Commercial
","This film is an hour long commercial for ESPN as many personalities appear in on-screen roles. Michael Irvin, Dan Patrick, Jim Rome, Sean Salisbury and on down the line. McDonalds apparently paid a hefty fee to have about 20 mentions in the movie. One character is dedicated to talking only about McDonalds products.To make matters worse, there are several attempts at juvenile humor and they all fall flat. There is not a genuine laugh in the whole movie. It's stunning that Chris Rock is so funny doing stand-up and so bad in a movie. Adam Sandler's funny days are clearly behind him. Oh, and the plot is contrived and predictable--but you probably guessed that. See this movie at your own risk.",1,8,16,6 August 2006
