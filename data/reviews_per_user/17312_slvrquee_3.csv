The Blair Witch Project," A Test in True Human Imagination
","I see everyone here falls into the catagory of film goer where you have to be spoon fed special effects and essentric acting in order to enjoy the movie.  This movie proves that all you need is a good imagination to enjoy a film.  If you don't then of course, you aren't going to like it. 
And quit complaining about the camera movement.  You are supposed to be veiwing everything through a camera that the girl carries around with her so OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BOUNCE FOR GODS SAKE!! That's part of the fun! 
Hollywood has breastfed its viewers for so long that you cannot use your own imaginations anymore.  What's scary is not what you see, it's what you don't see.    I would also like to see anyone in Hollywood attempt to act as well as Miss Heather.  Bravo girl!  She wasn't over dramatic, she was just plain scared and convincingly at that.  Imagine some Hollywood starlet playing that part, the movie would have taken a nose dive.  Bravo to the guys too! 
The film is indy brillance.  If you can't take it, go see Star Wars and be breastfed again.",Null,1,1,12 September 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Good, but not quite
","I am an aliens fan all the way and this movie was good, it was good but it fell short of the other 3 (even awful Alien3).  It leaves 200 years open for other movies though, I mean, what if Alien3 was just a company report and Ripley was really alive.... now that's a movie.   For Alien5 lets hope they do something like that...As far as this fan is concerned, it's an ok flick about aliens but that Newborn thing... PLEASE!!!  Let me write the next one... Geeez",Null,0,0,13 April 1999
Elizabeth," Brilliance!
",To be critical of the brilliant film making that went in to this movie is to show that one is a stereotypical filmwatcher and not a film lover. Blanchett was FABULOUS!  The dazzleing filmmaking and music and shots are what is missing out of films today.  Why waste money on I KNow What You Did Last Whenever and crap like GO when you can make something as brilliant as Elizabeth!!  ONWARD HOLLYWOOD!!,10,0,1,21 May 1999
