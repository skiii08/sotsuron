Skyfall," One of the best Bond films ever made.
","I have long been a fan of the James Bond franchise. I was brought up with the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. The first one I ever saw was Goldeneye, from that moment I was hooked. But his movies got worse as they went on, being a Bond fan I liked them all, but I had to admit they were getting worse. This culminated with Die Another Day. It was at this stage a reboot was needed. I was wary of Craig at first, I didn't think he would cut it as Bond. I really liked Casino Royale but I felt it was a tad overrated. Maybe it's because I wasn't used to this more darker human Bond. Quantum of Solace was a step down from Casino Roayle, and I felt this could be the end of Craig's Bond. I was wary that the critics were overselling Skyfall, and that it would be not as good as they said. I am happy to report, I was totally wrong.Skyfall is in my opinion one of the very best Bond films ever made, arguably the best. A blistering pre-credits sequence, in which Daniel Craig destroys half of Istanbul in a quest to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, initially suggests Bond is back on track after the stuttering blip that was Quantum Of Solace. No sooner are we settled though, when James is shot in error by one of his own (Naomie Harris), plunging from the roof of a moving train into the opening title filled with skulls, tombstones and other totems of death.Bond survives, of course – he always does. But when he comes back to life he is far from his best, Craig's unshaven chops and bloodshot eyes betraying a man whose heart isn't in it (if it ever was).It doesn't help that Judi Dench's M also looks set for the scrap heap, or that the new Q (Ben Whishaw) is a techno-nerd barely half his age. ('You still have spots!' sneers Bond contemptuously during their first encounter in the National Gallery.) Put through his paces after some Mediterranean down- time involving scorpion-baiting drinking games and post-shag Heineken, 007 can hardly manage a chin-up before collapsing in a heap. He can't even dangle from the undercarriage of an ascending elevator without wincing in discomfort. If Casino Royale was Bond finding his footing, Skyfall is him remembering where he left it - a clever turnaround made all the more effective by giving 007 an adversary who, for much of the film, is crossing the finish line while Jimmy's putting on his trainers. With his shock of blond hair, dodgy dentistry and vengeful M fixation, Javier Bardem's Silva is that rarest of creations: a cyber-terrorist who genuinely terrifies. But he also has a playful side; witness the literally thigh-rubbing glee he brings to one stand-out interrogation scene. It's far from the only sexually charged moment, cue a steamy shower clinch with Bérénice Marlohe's femme fatale Sévérine, plus some saucy banter with Harris' Eve that positively fizzes with winking innuendo. But in line with Craig's summer assignment at Buckingham Palace, the real Bond girl is of a more seasoned vintage: Dame Judi herself, here evolving from 007's testy taskmistress into a surrogate mother he will kill to protect. The casting of Dench was always a master-stroke, but it has taken seven outings, and one Oscar-winning filmmaker, for her to be exploited properly. Mendes' ambitions, though commendable, don't always fit the material. The Bond series has lasted half a century without referencing Shakespeare, Tennyson and JMW Turner, so why shoehorn them in now? Thankfully they don't interfere with the standard Bondian trappings, Skyfall boasting all the glamour, excitement and exoticism we have come to expect and then some. A floating Macau casino, complete with firework display and komodo dragons, supplies a perfect setting for cocktails, fisticuffs and Live And Let Die in-jokes, while Bardem's hide-out - a deserted island full of crumbling masonry and broken statues - has all the grandeur of Blofeld's volcano with none of the impracticality.A splendid mid-section in London, meanwhile, spurns the city's overexposed architecture for a chase beneath its surface, Bond pursuing Silva via sewer, tunnel and Tube while still finding time to crack the odd funny. Indeed, for all its intimations of mortality and harping on obsolescence, Skyfall is more often than not a hoot, Craig having the confidence at last to lace his Bond's killer instinct with a bone-dry wit and wry nonchalance. The scene where he contemplates utilising one of the series' oldest and most famous gizmos is a perfectly judged grace note, while an appearance from Albert Finney near the end of the picture exudes warmth and good humour. It all adds up to the 007 adventure we've been waiting for: a flawlessly assembled thrill ride with a cast to die for and a nakedly emotional undertow. Happy birthday, Mr Bond. Here's to another 50 years.",10,5,16,2 November 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A fun exciting and very Underrated movie
","I was all set to see this film at cinemas but many critics said the film was poor but recently I saw this at a friends house and realized this is one of the most Underrated films ever. Prince of Persia The Sands of Time has everything a movie needs Action Romance Comedy and a good plot. Jake Gyellenhaal is great as Prince Dastan a boy who lived on the streets before been adopted by the King, Jake does the action scenes very well and makes Dastan a likable character someone you get to really care about as the film progresses. Gemma Arterton is fantastic as the very beautiful feisty Princess Tamina the guardian of the dagger of time. Jake and Gemma have brilliant chemistry in a relationship that starts off with hatred which turns to friendship and then to love. Sir Ben Kingsly delivers another excellent performance as Nizam the scheming Uncle of Dastan who will do anything to get hold of the dagger. The best performance in the entire film in my opinion falls to Alfred Molina as the scene stealing Shiek Amar, Molina brings all the comedy to the film as the greeding tax evading Shiek who has a love of Ostriches and has Ostrich races hilarious.I really enjoyed this film and don't understand why it got so much criticism. Most of the criticism came from the film differed from the game well I have never played the game so I cannot compare the two but most of my friends who have played it and seen the film tell me it did not change that much. Also the fact that most of the cast were English and American and not Persian bugged them well the cast was perfect in my opinion you have to remember this is a film and wont be perfect but this is very close to it.I really hope they make a Sequel at the moment the chances of it are slim as the film did not do as well at the Box Office as expected it would be disappointing as the end of the film seemed to hint there was more to come.",9,0,1,9 April 2011
Stardust," Fantastic Film Not to be missed.
","I have just seen this Movie for the first time and I am kicking myself that I didn't watch this sooner because it was Brilliant.The Story is great there are just so many things going on at once that the film never gets boring because sometimes with films even great films have some parts where you start to lose interest but this kept me glued to the screen.First of all the film was hilarious The Ghost Brothers really had me cracking up and Robert De Niro doing the cancan was the funniest thing I have seen in ages.The Cast was phenomenal as well. Charlie Cox did a great job as the lead character and I am surprised that I have never seen him in anything else its as if he has disappeared which is odd because he does a great job.I think I have fallen in love with Claire Danes she looked so beautiful and her acting was perfect especially in the scene with the mouse.Michelle Pfeiffer was a great Villain she really stole the show her performance was flawless.Mark Strong gave a good performance as Septimus because the film needed another Villain as well as the Witch, his Character was interesting and Mark Strong always does good as a bad guy.My one small problem with the film was the fact they underused some great Characters Robert De Niro was not in the film enough he didn't appear until nearly one hour in and his characters was only in the film for twenty minutes. He was the funniest characters in the film and should have had more screen time it seemed a waste of De Niro's talents.Look out for some great cameos by Ricky Gervais who steals every scene he appears in, and Peter O Toole puts in a good performance as the King of Stromhold.I Loved the film though and was really shocked to find that it did poor at the Box Office. A part of me wants a Sequel because it would be interesting to see the Characters again but I have a feeling that a Sequel could be poor because the Story would have to be Original not like this one which was based off a book.Overall Stardust is a great film for all the Family which mixes Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance and Horror.Rating 9/10",10,4,5,24 July 2011
