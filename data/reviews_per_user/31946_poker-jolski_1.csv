The Hangover," Well made but not good
","I seriously don't know why this is rated so up. First annoying thing: this is full of radio-top-list music, though it's good music I cant find a single spot with something happening and without music that i heard 5 times earlier on radio this week. I think people's reactions is one of the most important things in movies, are those realistic and well acted. Well those wasn't realistic and events of the film wasn't so realistic neither.-> So they somehow borrowed some gambling money from ' 'funny' ' Chinese guy. If they won with the money then they should return 100% of winnings. Okeey... This movie is full of unrealistic things but i can't say this wasn't entertaining, not boring whatsoever. Not a must see but worth of watching.6/10",6,0,5,7 August 2009
