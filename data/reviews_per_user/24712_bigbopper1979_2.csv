The Ring," Quality Rating: B-
","Frightening flick about an evil video tape bringing death to those who view it seven days later. A reporter who watched the tape sets about trying to find the origins of the tape. Well directed, well acted shocker with realistic effects suffers from over length and a script that holds contempt against its auidence in the last half hour.",Null,0,1,3 March 2003
Spider-Man," Quality Rating: C
","Big screen adaptation of the beloved comic book plays it totally safe, takes no risks and ends up being one of the most uneventful films of the year despite making a killing at the box office. The average sized actors feel out of place around the giant sets, and the film features little suspense & is devoid of humor. It's over length (about half an hour) is another major flaw.",Null,0,0,3 March 2003
