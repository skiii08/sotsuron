Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Amazing amalgam of animation history and classic noir
","Not sure that I can put into words the sweeping epic this film truly is.  The Toontown scenes are the most chaotic I've ever seen on film.The THX-quality sound and incredible digital video on the new Vista Series disc that was released this past week is extraordinary, and it's amazing to pick up this movie after so long and watching all of its little treasures.10/10",10,1,1,27 March 2003
8 Mile," Powerful
","As powerful as a fictionalized account of Marshall Mathers' life can be, expertly crafted by a cinema master.  Eminem's work is superb here, lending dramatic depth that my fellow fans and I would expect from an artist of his caliber. Not your typical Hollywood fare. You either love it or hate it, and it's as good as it could have been.8/10",7,0,0,25 March 2003
Blow," Great filmmaking
","Demme's exploration of the Jung legacy was sadly his last completed project.. but it was also his greatest.  His filmmaking work here hit a zenith- the ideal casting of Depp, the flashy-yet-classic cinematography, and the peerless set designs contribute to this mammoth work.  I saw it in the theater largely because of a Peter Travers review .. and I was not disappointed.  It was one of the few movies of 2001 I can say that I saw and enjoyed immensely. And I got it on DVD.  Stray away from this one if you have qualms about the War on Drugs.. because Jung is one of the big casualties.  Its main drawback lies in the plot dynamics and the fact that it does not tell us anything largely about the human condition.  But it's a fun, interesting, and sometimes saddening ride into the heart of the one-time largest cocaine importer in the United States.8/10",8,0,1,21 March 2003
The Thin Red Line," Excellent war movie with plenty of human drama
","Spectacularly shot, engaging film that will leave you breathless in many moments.  Malick's genius will return one day.  I won't give away anything else suffice to say the cast was excellent and many of the 'faceless' have gone on to become big stars in just a few years, for good reason.  The problems lie in some inappropriate voice-over and the overbearing heavyhandedness of some situations.8/10",8,0,1,25 March 2003
Donnie Darko," Bizarre doesn't always mean compelling
","A very strange, well-made piece of science fiction with our man Jake G giving a damn good performance. It's quite watchable by those who have a brain cell, but the 'so-what' ramifications are abound. While it's interesting for the most part, the sheer inanity and bizarro world aspects it emphasizes shot this one down for me.  Had a hard time hanging on thru the whole thing.7/10",7,0,0,25 March 2003
The Wedding Singer," Sandler's best and most watchable
","This is the Sandler movie that has the most coherent of what resembles a plot with the best mix of drama and comedy that turns into a quite heartwarming and compelling movie. I could watch this quite a few more times. But then again, it is a Sandler movie. Not high art.7/10",7,0,1,25 March 2003
The Godfather," The Greatest
","There is nothing I can tell you here that hasn't already been said. Spectacularly spellbinding performances, great story helmed by a great director.10/10.",10,0,2,25 March 2003
