The Blair Witch Project," Completely Awesome!!!
","The movie is great and original in concept.  The use of actual footage by the actors gives the movie a fantastic realism - especially the ending sequence.  Being an avid fan of horror and/or slasher films from the 80's on, it was great to be able to use my own imagination to scare myself and not have to rely on a CGI or special effects sequence.  I recommend watching the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' special on the SciFi Channel.  It is a great complement to the movie itself.",Null,1,2,17 July 1999
