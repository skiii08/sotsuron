Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What is America coming to?
","Borat is one of the worst, most disgusting movies that I have ever seen. The humor is nothing more than potty humor mixed with bullying. 'Borat' makes fun of every stereotypical target that they could think of. Christians, Jews, foreign people, American people, and gay people just to name a few. I found it offensive and disgusting.The movie, though short, felt like the longest hour and a half in my life. I would rather have been having a cavity filled. At least then you get novocaine.What does this movie show? It shows that America will sink to any level for 'entertainment.' The fact that Americans find bullying, teasing, and potty humor funny is disturbing. The fact that people would endorse this sort of a film is appalling.Hopefully you will not have to suffer the 90 minute horror that is Borat.",1,262,527,20 November 2006
