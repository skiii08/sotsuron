Come and See," One of the Best War Movies Ever
","I loved this movie because it was the kind of war movie I had been looking for because of its gripping events that happens in war. Klimov does an epic job in showing what the Russians had to go through with survival and the gripping physiological hardships of what not only adults, but what children had to endure. Before I could only imagine the implications of a society where the survival of the fittest is the bottom line, and this movie helped me institutionalize it. The feeling of being on your own in wartime, and losing all you have, including your sanity, is greatly hinted in this movie for you. At the end, feel for the kid that had to endure everything in addition to his aging. I think that. Basically, it is a powerful reminder of war being hell where it is worth emphasizing in ways like this.",9,1,1,27 July 2012
