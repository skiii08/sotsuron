Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bad pizza is still reasonably edible
","Now with Disney producing new Star Wars movies, the prequels have once again come under the microscope. I'm a Star Wars fan, I was 8 when the first film was released, and it is one of the most memorable things from my childhood. Nobody had ever seen anything like that, and I loved every second of it, every time I saw it. I was ecstatic when I learned that they were going to make two sequels, and those didn't disappoint either. Now the original trilogy is widely regarded as three of the greatest movies ever made.Fast forward to 1999...a 15 year gap since the last Star Wars movie, and when I learned that 3 new Star Wars 'prequels' were being made, I felt the same way I did when I was 10 and heard Star Wars was getting a sequel. I went on opening night, got my popcorn, and felt that same thrill I did as a kid when the opening theme played and the storyboard scrolled across the screen. But the feeling I had when I left the theater was different this time. In all fairness, the bar was set pretty high by the original trilogy. I harbored no illusions of the prequels equaling them, but I did expect the Star Wars magic to be there. Sadly, it was only there in brief, fleeting glimpses, and as quickly as it came, it was snuffed out by one of the films many 'why would Lucas do that?' moments. Space bugs in your cells that make you strong with the force instead of the intangible, mysterious thing it was before, A virgin birth and ancient prophecy ala New Testament, a trade dispute setting the stage for the evil bad guy to take over the galaxy, scene after bloated scene filled with 'Lucasisims'...ie CGI sensory overload garbage everywhere that distracts from the heart or point of the scene, action packed filler sequences that have little or nothing to do with the story or characters (underwater pod journey through the core of Naboo, for example)....and of course the ever loathed Jar Jar Binks....the list goes on and on and on. Heap on top of it some really bad casting, horrible (even by Star Wars standards) dialogue, weak character development, a confusing, conflicting and muddled story, and too much lowbrow camp and slapstick, and you have one giant hot mess of a Star Wars movie.The reason Star Wars (1977) worked and the prequels didn't is really pretty simple. It's a great example of 'less is more' at work. Lucas was on a budget, he had people to answer to, and some of his 'creativity' was reigned in by others. What you ended up with was a movie that was relatively simple in its individual parts, had clear protagonists and antagonists, clear goals and messages. Lucas was still a filmmaker at heart in 1977, and being on a budget and timeline, he had to fill scenes with character and plot development rather than fluff to make them interesting. Star Wars contained ground breaking special effects, but they weren't the backbone of the movie, rather they were tools to enhance the story and overall viewing experience. All this combined to form one of the greatest movies ever made.When Lucas started making the prequels, he was no longer the young filmmaker he was in 1977. Now, he was a businessman and an egocentric. He crammed as much stuff as he could into these movies in an attempt to appeal to as many moviegoers as possible to generate large box office financial returns, bottom line. Nobody was there to say no to him when he wanted to include something unnecessary or just plain ridiculous in the film. The prequels are what you get when just one person has sole creative power in a film. It often makes me wonder exactly how little Lucas had to do with the original trilogy's success as films. Comparing them to the prequels, it's hard to believe the same person made them both, they are that vastly different in almost every aspect. It was no shocker that Disney chose not to include Lucas in their new trilogy and spin off films, and this is why, although still not as good as the originals, they are vastly superior to the prequels and are receiving a much more positive response from Star Wars fans. Disney did their best to get back to the basics of what made Star Wars work in the first place (although Episode 7 is a little too close to the original 1977 Star Wars in my opinion).Episode 1, and the rest of the prequels for that matter, are like bad pizza....it isn't good, but you can eat it.",5,2,5,17 June 2017
Suicide Squad," disappointing, shabby mess
","I'll state up front I'm not a huge superhero movie fan. I will watch em if I think they are going to be good and entertaining. Having said that, there are a few superhero movies that pass the sniff test and qualify as great movies. I enjoyed the earlier 'Spiderman' movies before they spun too deeply into the realm of fanboy absurdity. I thought 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was an extremely well done and entertaining movie, loved it. 'Deadpool' was a lot of fun, as was 'Hellboy'. Tim Burton's Batman is the crown jewel of superhero movies as far as I'm concerned, and it's the benchmark by which I judge the others by. 'The Dark Knight' was pretty good (in spite of Bale's laughably pathetic portrayal of Batman) due mainly to a very strong supporting cast, including an amazing performance of The Joker by the late Heath Ledger.I really wanted to like Suicide Squad. Initially, it sounded to me like it might be a fresh take on a tired, worn down and clichéd genre. And really, it did have the potential to be a very good, if not great, superhero movie. Wrong. This film suffered from so many different things I really don't know where to start.Casting....this movie is a casting nightmare, period. The only, and I mean only character that was cast well was Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie delivered a solid, believable performance and she did do a good job with the garbage she was given to work with. She carries every scene she's in, and her performance was the only reason I didn't simply stop watching the movie. Will Smith delivered a weak performance in a role he wasn't well suited at all to play. He came across as a blend between Hancock and his character from 'I am Legend'. They couldn't have picked a worse person to play this role. Which brings me to Jared Leto. There aren't many actors that can pull off the complex role of The Joker convincingly. Nope, Leto isn't on that list. He came across as nothing more than a creepy, disgusting thug...The Joker is so much more than that. He brought absolutely none of the intangibles, depth or complexity it takes to pull off that particular role. And the makeup...wow...it looked like little more than a rushed Halloween costume. Thankfully his role in the movie was mercifully small and his scenes were short. In spite of this he still managed to ruin the character of The Joker for all practical purposes. The rest of the characters I won't even mention, there were far too many of them to even try to pay attention to or care about....which leads us to...The storyline/plot. Bad. period. Its essentially a cheap ripoff of the basic plot line of 'The Dirty Dozen', except the Suicide Squad version doesn't work at all. Way too much going on with way too many shallow characters. It appeared that as they were writing it and ran into blocks or couldn't come up with a good idea, they simply threw a new minor superhero character in there as a distraction. More is better, right? In this case, no....this would have been a far better movie if they had picked three or four characters to focus on and gone from there. Maybe they felt like none of the major characters were solid enough to carry the movie so they made up for that by adding every minor and uninteresting comic character they could come up with. Aside from cliché flashback scenes, character development of the major players is virtually non existent. And they have so many of them you simply stop caring about any of them. By the end of the movie, I didn't care if they won or lost, who lived or died, I just wanted it to be over.Overall, aside from a few decent Harley Quinn scenes, there is little of watchable or entertaining quality here, unlikely to appeal to any but the most hardcore superhero fanboys. It's a shame really, it did have the potential to be a really good movie,but it's just way too flawed on on way too many levels. Skip this one.",3,1,1,18 June 2017
The Thing," A True Horror Masterpiece
","John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is truly a masterpiece of the horror genre, and arguably deserves a spot at #1. So few truly good films come out of this genre, this is one of those rare gems that sets the benchmark for excellence. I saw this movie when it came out as a young teen, it scared the s*** out of me in a way no horror movie before or since has been able to.John Carpenter's strength lies in his ability to create intense mood in his films, and 'The Thing' is by far his best work in this regard. The musical score, the sets, the cinematography and the dialogue all work together in perfect harmony to create an incredibly eerie and terrifying setting for the viewers to be dropped into. You can feel the isolation and paranoia he creates almost as if you're trapped down there alongside the characters. The film brilliantly plays on some very core fears in the human psyche with chilling effectiveness.The buildup is purposely slow, and by the time the reality of situation the characters are in is realized, you feel like you're right there with them due to Carpenter's masterful ability to draw the audience into the film. The balance of tension is perfect, and keeps you feeling uneasy and frightened throughout the entire film.'The Thing' is extremely well cast, every actor delivers a solid and convincing performance of his respective character. Character development is a touch on the weak side, but it's more than ample for this particular film, and where it's lacking, Carpenter more than makes up for it with his ability to draw you into the events and setting of the film.The conventional special effects are top notch, even by today's elaborate CGI standards, and have aged quite well. Compared to the CGI alien from the disappointing 2011 'prequel', Carpenter's alien has the material substance and realism that computers just can't deliver, making it far more frightening and believable than its later CGI counterpart. Gory by any standard, but not depraved...some of the truly horrifying images created will stay with the viewer for a long time after viewing.Here's a personal example of exactly how effective this movie is...last Halloween I was showing my teen son and stepson different horror movies from my collection in an attempt to scare them. They are typical teen boys from today, jaded and desensitized by the constant digital bombardment they receive from video games and cable television. One movie after the next was shrugged off, laughed and yawned at. Then I showed them 'The Thing'.....both of them sat wide eyed and transfixed, not uttering a word throughout the entire film. 10 minutes after it was over they both still sat there silently, until my stepson weakly said 'that was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen'....my son nodded and uttered an agreement. Neither of them slept well for a few nights following.Initial reception and box office returns in 1982 were mediocre, but the passage of time has allowed this film to be recognized as one of the true masterpieces of the horror genre, and an excellent film in its own right. It currently enjoys a spot on this websites top 250 films, and top 10 ranking on practically every online list of best horror movies. For best effect, view it alone at night, preferably with a good snowstorm raging outside.And remember,......'it ain't Fuchs.....it ain't Fuchs'",10,3,7,18 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," C'mon Disney......what was THAT???
","I've seen every Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back on opening night, and I can honestly say I've never left the theatre feeling more disappointed and let down than I did after this one. This was a shockingly bad installment in the franchise, even by prequel standards. It left me wondering if Rian Johnson had ever even seen a Star Wars movie before, because this one certainly doesn't deserve to wear the name. It was more like a really bad episode of Battlestar Galactica than a Star Wars movie.This movie was so flawed on so many different levels I'm not sure where to start. I'd say the major problem with this film was the incredibly weak story, combined with the total waste of screen time on ridiculous sub-plots instead of using that time to do some much needed character development and some backstory/explanation of the majority of the major characters. Combine this with taking almost all of them in the most wrong direction possible and you've got one giant mess.Which is exactly what this film is....a huge, unfixable mess. *spoilers ahead* Not only did this movie fail in almost every imaginable way, but the mess it created with the story and the characters is so big it will be virtually impossible for Disney to fix it in the next movie and still make a good film out of it.Snoke...what happened there? We got no backgroud, no development, no anything before he was effortlessly killed by Ren....why? They wasted some great potential here to create a really interesting and valuable character to the movie and it's inevitable sequal, and took the story in an absurd direction at the same time. So the character responsible for Ren turning to the dark side and the new Jedi falling was just some creep bad guy we now know nothing about? what? And no point in giving him a back story in the next movie, because, well, he's dead now and nobody will care.....absurd.Leia...they botched this character big time too. Was it wise to make her now one of the most central characters in the story? With Carrie Fishers untimely passing, sadly, they were left with no choice but to find a way to remove her from the story at some point in this movie in order to be able to do the next one. They had plenty of opportunities to do so in a way that would have furthered the story, but they chose not to for whatever reason. When Ren changed his mind about killing her but the other fighters fired, that would have been a great time to do it because it would have added to Ren's character and given him new motivations for upcoming aspects of the story. What are they going to do now? Imply her death in some meaningless way inbetween the movies or just kill off a bad CGI version of her in the opening scene of the next one?Luke....ok, if you're going to kill off LUKE SKYWALKER, the central character in the original trilogy, at least give it some real meaning and depth appropriate for the character. Like maybe while trying to save Ren and repair the past in order to set things on the right path. No....they chose to kill him off creating a diversion for the rebels to slip out the back door and temporarily escape the First Order. Wow.....what a waste of what needed to be a much more powerful moment in the story.To wrap it all up, I'm shocked Disney let this one out of the gate. Didn't anybody at any point question any of this, or was Rian Johnson simply given free reign to do as he pleased with this project? However it all went down, Disney should be ashamed of themselves for ever allowing this movie to see the light of day.",4,0,0,15 December 2017
Jaws," Outstanding movie, enjoy and appreciate it for what it is
","This movie has come under a fair amount of criticism for a number of reasons as of late, primarily for its less than accurate portrayal of shark behavior, and some subsequent harm done as a result of that.OK, it's 2017 now, most of us know that this isn't the way sharks behave. We know the odds of being attacked by a shark are less than being struck by lighting, and we know this is because sharks simply don't attack people all that often. And we also know that as a species we pose a far greater threat to sharks than they could ever pose to us.With that said, let's talk about 'Jaws'. I seriously doubt anybody involved in the film had any intention at all of portraying sharks in a manner that would motivate an uneducated mass of people to inflict harm on these creatures. Many involved, including Benchley himself, have expressed regret and remorse at the negative light sharks are portrayed in and subsequent damage done to them as a result of the film. Their motivation for making this film was to take a popular novel of the time and make it into a movie that would hopefully impact the audience and be a box office success. And oh boy, did they succeed in that. I would challenge anybody to name a movie that had a more profound impact on moviegoers of the time than 'Jaws'. It frightened a whole generation of people out of the water. I myself was 6 when it came out, and, with the PG rating, my dad thought it would be OK to take me to a drive-in to see it. It literally traumatized me, I was terrified to go into the water for a long time after that. But it also started my lifelong fascination with sharks, and it's the one film that I credit most for the beginning of my love for movies.Negative critics of this film often take it out of context, inject their own personal feelings into it and project the backlash of peoples' reaction and actions as a result of it back onto the film itself. I submit that by doing that, they are no longer reviewing the film in and of itself.What 'Jaws' is, in and of itself, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It shows exactly how talented Spielberg is as a filmmaker, overcoming so many setbacks and problems to create one of the greatest movies ever made. Enter the rubber shark...The rubber shark is undoubtedly one of the films most glaringly bad technical issues. But again, in 1975, this is as good a prop as they could come up with. Most people don't realize that the majority of the rubber shark footage either ended up on the cutting room floor or was never shot in the first place. The prop plagued production of the movie during its entire filming, often failing to work, or creating scenes so bad they were abandoned. This is where Spielberg's talent as a filmmaker shines, he had to come up with other ways to complete the scenes. A brilliant mix of theme music and creative camera work were used instead to imply the presence of the shark, with a stunningly successful effect. By Spielberg's own admission, having to redo scenes like this where the shark wouldn't function made 'Jaws' a far better movie than it otherwise would have been had the rubber fish worked as planned.What 'Jaws' lacks in accuracy and special effects strength, it more than makes up for in mood, setting, casting, character development, acting ability, screenplay and cinematography, all of which fall solidly into the excellent category. These elements are perfectly blended, and create some of the most memorable movie scenes ever filmed (Robert Shaw's drunken account of being on the USS Indianapolis is a wonderful example).Take 'Jaws' for what it was...it wasn't a statement of the menacing danger sharks pose to us...It was a chilling, thrilling roller-coaster of a movie intended to delight and frighten audiences. It started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster and impacted moviegoers in a truly profound manner that so few movies ever manage to do. A benchmark film in cinematic history and one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,1,2,18 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars is headed in the right direction again
","Disney taking the Star Wars reigns out of George Lucas's hands is likely the single best thing that could have happened to the franchise after the controversial prequel mess. With the prequels, Lucas managed to take Star Wars about as far away from what make it work in the first place as was possible, destroying many of the great things about the original trilogy in the process. Effectively, Star Wars was dead...Lucas wouldn't have been able to pull off any future films, even if he would have been inclined to do so.Personally, I was excited when I heard Disney had purchased Lucasfilm and announced plans to make new Star Wars movies. Love em or hate em, if there is one thing Disney knows how to do, it's make successful films. I was even more excited when I heard that Lucas himself had been cut out of the creative loop, the last thing we needed was for him to take us further down the horrible path he chose to take Star Wars with the prequels. After Lucas was dismissed from involvement with the new Star Wars films, I imagine Disney sat down and took a long hard look at what made the original trilogy such a beloved success and the prequels such a criticized mess. Undoubtedly, they didn't want their new franchise to be met with the same overall negativity the prequels received.The formula they came up with was overly simplistic...Star Wars 1977 worked, so let's mirror it. Episode 7 is essentially a reboot of the original movie at its heart. The story is remarkably similar, and each major character from the original is mirrored by a new character. Even the original characters, in addition to being who they were, also seem to at times mirror other original character roles from Star Wars 1977.As simplistic as this is, the bottom line is it worked. Episode 8 looks and 'feels' like a Star Wars movie, and it's the first one that's been able to pull that off since 1983. The movie has its flaws to be sure, but when put against the prequels, it's superior in almost every aspect. More importantly, it brought back some of the magic to Star Wars that the prequels had effectively snuffed out. No mention of space bugs in your cells that make you strong with the force, no ridiculous prophecy, no distracting fluff and scene bloat, no circus side show of unnecessary characters, dialog and scenes, no uncomfortable and awkward botched romance side story....and no Jar Jar Binks or his equivalent.Instead you have a well paced and clear story. Interesting characters you can connect with on an emotional level. Special effects that dazzle you but don't overwhelm you or take center stage. You have what made Star Wars...well, Star Wars.Taking my young son on it to opening night left me with this thought in my head....that movie experience was, for him, as close as he was going to get to the same experience I had as a child going to see Star Wars in the theater for the first time. And that, in and of itself, made this movie a success in my eyes",7,50,80,17 June 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," great new addition to the Mad Max franchise
","People who are critical of this movie I'm guessing in large don't understand what a Mad Max movie is or were never fans of the original franchise in the first place. If you're expecting a deep, profound study on human behavior and richly developed characters, you'll have to look elsewhere...Max Max was never this, nor does it pretend to be. Mad Max is a hit you in the face roller-coaster ride of an action movie set in a sci-fi post apocalyptic future world. The elements of this movie are quite simple, just like the first 3 installments. Fast paced, violent action centered around situation survival. Complex character development and rich dialogue aren't needed here, nor does the film suffer from it. Mad Max Fury Road, like it's predecessors, doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it simply is. And that's the beauty of this movie. In a cinematic landscape full of thought provoking, profound films that often tend to be too highbrow for their own good, Fury Road was a welcome breath of fresh air. A guilty pleasure I loved every minute of.It should go without saying that the special effects, action sequences, editing and cinematography here were top notch...the Academy agreed as well, giving this film nominations and awards in many of those categories. Frankly, based on the weak competition that year, I feel the only reason Fury Road didn't receive Best Picture was because the Academy didn't have the stones yet to give it to a film like Mad Max.Sure, this wasn't any thoughtful film with a deep and profound message, nor was it claimed to be, but it was a damn good movie that blended all of its own elements together flawlessly to create an amazingly entertaining viewing experience. And in my opinion, it did so far better than any of its Beat Picture competitors.George Miller went out on a limb casting somebody other than Mel Gibson in the role of Max. Max is certainly a movie character that is very strongly tied to the actor who portrayed him. Using Mel in this film wouldn't have worked for a large number of reasons, and Miller knew this. Having said that, the character of Max isn't a particularly complex or deep one (Max had fewer than 20 lines of dialogue in The Road Warrior), any number of actors could have pulled the role off reasonably competently. But Mel Gibson did bring an important intangible quality to the role that made the character strong. Tom Hardy was an excellent choice to replace Mel Gibson as Max, he succeeded in bringing that same intangible value to the character. If Miller would have chosen a different actor who lacked this subtle quality, he wouldn't have been able to pull it off nearly as well as he did, nor would fans have been as accepting of the new lead. Hardy did a wonderful job as Max, and I hope we see more of him in this role in future films.Charlize Theron delivered her typical outstanding character performance here, stealing every scene she was in. She demonstrated why she is considered such an amazingly talented character actor, able to handle such a wide spectrum of parts. If you're a Mad Max, action, sci-if fan, or if you just enjoy very well done films, Fury Road is a must see",9,2,5,18 June 2017
