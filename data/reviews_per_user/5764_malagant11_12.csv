The Avengers," crowded !!!
","I've always been a big fan of comics; however i failed to like any of the movies that have been made over the years featuring these characters... with the exception of Batman; coz i think all his movies is actually much better than the comics...anyhow now - back to our main title today The Avengers... first i have to emphasis that i really like Scarlet Johanson but she is just not cut for these kind of movies... physically and character wise... the rest all sucks actually i did not enjoy the movie, actually i felt even bored during it, and did not like any of the humor it also...its crowded; and they spend a long time talking about technical, mechanics and stuff in the dialog that you really lose the story in the middle of itother than that; the music sucks... the acting sucks... and the only explanation how did this movie beat Avatar at the box office is that this movie and all of the movies that paved the way to it (Iron man 1+2, Hulk 1+2, Thor, Captain America) has all Targeted specifically the teens and it was all a big very well planned marketed series that's all... but under the big names there is really nothing to it...no matter what, i think everyone would want to go and see it, so try to enjoy if yo could!!Muhannad Kalaji",5,4,13,19 May 2012
Star Trek," great sequel
","am no big fan of the original star trek series; always thought its a dull and boring! however this movie reinvents the whole idea totally; i think the producers have nailed it this time it is so new, original, and the characters are adorable and full of actions, this sequel offers a great entertainment its so full of new ideas and used the story very well,if you are a fan of the original star trek you'll find this amazing (at least this is what my friends fans have told me)I've always appreciated a good fiction movie - and this one offers some really new ideas also there is no mysterious un-understood ideas here; you'll be toned in your seat for the whole rideenjoy it, i did",7,0,1,30 March 2012
The Hunger Games," Hunger Games !! it did not fill me up... at all
","may i start by saying that i did not read the book, nor had any idea about it before i watched the movie... and to be frank here i am not much of a reader but never the less i found the movie very boring.based on a book, based on another movie or not based on anything at all i don't care; when you check into a movie it should offer something exciting, thrilling, pleasant to watch...etcthis movie did not offer much of any... the director did not pull us into the story world, nor kept us anticipatingmay i add that i hated the action sequences - it didn't make any sense...the only pretty thing here was the actresses lovely young face and that is iti don't think that anyone have reached 21 and above would find this movie entertaining... i personally hated it and couldn't find anything to like about it...this is a totally teens moviecheers, Muhannad Kalaji",Null,9,12,30 March 2012
Wanted," good idea but not so great
","i have to admit that the idea is pretty much 'original' in a funny way actually... i mean shooting the wings of the flies !! curving bullets !!it is funny as much as it is thrilling... the production was big also and the director did really good job,however the movie was too short i think; the writer must have ran out of line ha?the characters has fine identities but there is no enough depth in the characters; that's why i stated earlier that the movie is too short... i mean spending some time to enhance the characters could have done some more positive affect...i also would like to state that Angelina needs some series help ! some body gets that woman something to eat please - she looks like she didn't had any meal in weeks, and this is really extreme i say.to sum it up - it's fun to watch, but you'll be forgetting it as soon as you are out of the door",6,0,2,31 March 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," silly, stupid and so wrong to watch
",'awful' is the only word that i could come up with after having seen the movie which was quite an accomplishment considering the silliness of the story and the idiotic idea behind the filmi don't believe they actually thought they are going to make money out of this movie !!no wonder it was such a bust at the box office the movie is so dull and numb don't waste your time nor money on it it's not even funny not even the slightest bitit is similar to what George Clonee has done in (burn after reading) only that one was a bit less silly - never the less it is silly enoghi think they were trying to come up with something original & funny like Tarantino's movies only this one came up completely pointless and hopeless Muhannad Kalaji,1,4,11,13 September 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," its a long way Down from Mi 1
","i am a big fan of tom Cruise but i just could not like this movie i cant help keep comparing this one to the first part of Mission Impossible which was amazing i think i love the music and everything about it i hated the 2nd part and loved the third one but this one is the worst it think.there is absolutely nothing new or original about thins one, i think the writers are pretty much broke here and couldn't offer anything clever and when you compare this part to the first one you cant help seeing that the first one was brilliant and very smart and this one is dull and stupid...also being from the middle east and having lived in the great city of Dubai i also did not like the way it was presented here... i thought it was a chance to change the typical stereotype about Arabs... it was too much to hope i think.i hope this is the last squeal of the franchise, god knows we've had enough of it and hope tom Cruse offers us something totally new and original and lays off the commercial hungry movies and offers something Original as a change; he has enough money - doesn't he ?",1,18,36,30 March 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," why did they made this movie?
","indeed i ask; why did they make this movie? there is absolutely nothing new; nor original about it they just cloned the original movie in a high tech graphics & effects they have these days and they forgot to make a story perhaps,am not gonna critic the picture; it just dose not worth it and the scene at the bridge ! so Hollywood like also a bit silly and childish i though what were they thinking ! and the actress staring the movie, i think she just forgot that this is a movie, i mean i hope she didn't get paid for this.don't wast you time watching this crap; better to watch the original movie its 100 times better i promiseMuhannad Kalaji",3,1,6,12 April 2012
Drive," like nothing else - a class of its own
","what it liked here about this movie that its about the driver - not some crazy lunatic car stunts and so on !the driver here is simply a 'driver' with a code and dose only driving but that code is broken it unleash a monster ! you can notice that the Driver is not a physical role at all, and its all about the characterthe surprises in this movie is pretty well done; the director dose it very easily, and pulls you back in just to surprise you again the ending also is so real and not happy ending like Americans love itthe actress also is so sweet and Innocent; she forces audience to empathy...the first scene where the heist is undergoing and the dodge to cops is pretty amazing and it makes you really believe it is totally true its a great movie for smooth slick lovers",8,2,5,4 April 2012
The Artist," Visual effect, Die hard - Here's some Amazing Acting!!
","its simply very pleasant, extremely well done and marvelous acting by both starsthis proves the theory that a great movie dose not necessarily needs visual & audio effects and that's what i loved about this movie nowadays you hardly come across a movie that computers did not had a big stake in it, then this movie comes to shatter all this commercial hunger for visual effects.the story is very good classic, and the acting is just 'oh my God' i loved every minute of it; it offers great entertainment, humor, and drama.just when we though that such movies were long gone, the director comes and slam this in Hollywood face.also what i loved in this movie; that a successful movie dose not necessarily needs to be American ! yah can you believe it ? other folks who are not American can manufacture Amazing moviesi think after this one i will cut back on the American movies and try to catch a couple of European ones this movie is a real 'Must See' you'll find it brilliant and so original and before i wrap this up; i would like to tell the French star: is this guy for real ! he is a perfect perfect match for the role and he really looks like 30's & 40's like",9,0,2,30 March 2012
The Queen," a Queen indeed
","a royal performance by a nothing less than an astonishing gifted star Helen Mirren nailed it 110% and i believe that no other actress could have matched herthe director choice of lighting is very remarkable the movie was brilliant to shake off the stereo type that people have in mind about the royal family and brought the Queen closer down to earth and showed that they are no aliens nor from planet cold Helen Mirren gave the performance of her life i believe, and was awarded handsomely was the best actress Oscarthere was no competition the Oscar it was clear that she will get it not doubt of that this will also apply and amazing pressure on our Queen as i would like to call Helen Mirren in picking up future roles the movie raises sympathy with the entire royal family and the Queen specially this remains one of the best biographies that have ever been filmed try not to miss it, this is one is a must see",8,0,0,14 September 2012
Speed," great action - bring it on
","i still remember clearly when this movie was released - i think i must have seen at least ten times... in a row yah that's how good it was back then, the whole idea of the bus that cannot slow down is amazing... and from the first minute the director wastes no time in stating that you cannot take your eyes a minute away from the screen.the action starts from the very first minute and stops only at the end credit... Keanu Reevs was great and took it on really well... i wish i could say the same about Sandra Bullock who i cannot see her as an actress at all, i just cant see what people like in her ! she cannot act nor beautiful or appealing what the hell is she famous for ?however as usual the sequel sucked big time and damaged the image of the first one, and was a total bust at the ticket office",8,1,2,31 March 2012
Looper," uninteresting and lost !!
","now let me just start by saying: time travel is so out of date thing and it has been presented in movies hundreds of time... and only very few exception actually worked and i can only think of 'Terminator' the rest is just dull and rather silly than interesting, and in all of time travel movies the character has to meet his younger / older self and this should be the peak of the 'drama' and this movie just falls into it exactly, i mean they just mention that 10% of the population can move things telepathically and they move along...just like that and we are suppose to buy it !!and you can't help not getting any sense of the future, i mean what did we see of that future ? a short gun that can only hit from a very short distance ? a silly bike that looks 10 years old by today's standards ? give me break here ...Bruce Wellace has not done any good or even decent movies in the past ten years and the Director being the writer in the same time that dose not make him any special at all and i think he should quit both - directing and writing coz he ain't good in neitherdon't waste your time and money",1,7,18,28 October 2012
