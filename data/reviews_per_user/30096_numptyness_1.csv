First Man," Boring
","There seems to be a trend these days for characters to have absolutely minimal dialogue and let the set, the coffee making and the pauses between the silences tell everything. l find these films boring and frustrating.
lm a big space fan and lve watched loads of TV dramas and documentaries on this subject and this was the worst of the lot for me. l ended up fast forwarding to the space bits as they were the only parts of the film worth watching.There's one part in the film where Armstrong gets some important info from a chief but needs to confirm some other aspect of the mission. He makes no discernible response to the news. Instead of asking his superior about the matter he just stares at him and waits for him to talk. After a pause and a small smile he nods. If NASA went about all their decisions like this then the conspiracists would have been happy, as NASA would never have got off the ground. For excellent space/family drama watch TV series For All Mankind it's great.",6,3,5,12 April 2020
