The Blair Witch Project," In a time of special effects. It's great to see such a simple movie, with a great plot, thrill people around the country.
","No music, No special lighting, No blue screens. Just three innocent teenage kids doing a simple class project.  It seems like one of the lamest movies of all time. But, when written and performed like it was, The Blair Witch Project was one of the greatest movies of all time.  I was so glad to see a movie that wasn't 98% special effects, and could scare me enough to look over my shoulder at night when I'm walking home. No movie has done that since The Excersist, which I still have bad dreams about.  But this wasn't a gore movie, it wasn't a teen slasher movie, it was dealing with the unknown. And your imagination can terrify you worse then any special effect creature ever will.  And that's what makes This such a great movie.  I Highly suggest any movie fan to go see this, you won't be disappointed. Thank You.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
