Despicable Me 2," Despicable in the Wrong Ways
","5.4 of 10 vs. 8.25 for the first. Sadly, like the spy hero gadget-tech films it's intended to satirize, this is little more than a spy gadget film. Unlike the first, this gets tiresome and even boring. They really seem to be forcing ideas and plot developments. It's still relatively entertaining, but nowhere near the story depth and inventiveness of the first.Original and sequel both borrow a lot from other cartoons in terms of the look and characters, so the story is the key to making it into something more than a bunch of cartoon images and quirky sounds/images. Quirkiness alone can work for up to a half hour, but definitely not beyond 60 minutes.Stick with the first or the more recent Wreck It Ralph (2012) if you're feeling like a villain. As fun as genetically modified minions might seem, they aren't worthy of a theater trip.",5,3,7,15 July 2013
The Lobster," A Middle-aged Alternate Reality to the Hunger Games
","8 of 10. Alternate reality really needs to become as big a film term as sci-fi. Neither Hunger Games nor this are truly sci-fi, but they are definite alternate realities that could exist here and now or in the not too distant future or past.If you want to test if someone you know actually understands and appreciates the Hunger Games, not just a fan-girl/boy riding the bandwagon, this is the film to watch with them. If they don't appreciate the sort of dropped in the middle of a seemingly modern world and the mystery of what's actually happening and what's actually real along with the allegorical similarities, they simply have no clue.This probably will never be a teen sensation. The people, with a few exceptions, are mostly unappealing, either physically or emotionally, and middle-aged. In place of action, there is comedy, mostly satirical. Rather than visual oddities, the normal is turned into the bizarre and you're always waiting for the other shoe to drop.Definitely a film worthy of a sequel. The alternate world is setup and waiting to be discovered.",8,1,7,28 December 2015
Captain Phillips," The Definition of Over-dramatization
","4.5 of 10. From the beginning car conversation to the end, this feels like an over-dramatization made worse and more artificial with voice overs. To make it worse, it's far too long for this kind of story.What should be a heroic tragedy is little more than a military-industrial, flag-waving, propaganda film. And I'm fairly certain the military doesn't read international people arrested for crimes their rights as an American citizen. So much fake stuff like this takes what should also feel more like a documentary and makes it into what only deserves showing on TV during Memorial, Independence, or Veterans Day weekend.",4,55,129,1 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Most intelligent of the series, but lacking the innovative FX of its predecessors.
","The action isn't as fast, the visual effects not as innovative or ground breaking.  But the movie, for the most part, is the most intelligent and realistic of the series.It explains the 'science' behind the force, though briefly and not very scientifically.  The most impressive aspect of the movie is its depiction of the economic, social, and political structure of the Star Wars universe.There's also a clever little mystery in determining who the villain, the phantom menace, actually is.  Anybody out of junior high should be able to guess this, and it's all but given away at the end of the movie.As for the negative aspects of the film:  The Darth Maul character is made to look like a demon, which brings in unnecessary and irrelevant religious overtones.  In addition, Lucas can't seem to get himself out of the good guys in white, bad guys in black clichÃ©.",4,0,1,1 June 1999
Deepwater Horizon," The Muddy Reality of Offshore Oil Drilling Brought to Horrific Life
","9.1 of 10. Makes a documentary-style, based-on-true events film into a stunning special FX action-thriller with the sort of technical detail that you'd expect Star Trek nerds to demand and enjoy.2 people really impress here: Peter Berg for putting this film together and John Malkovich for his acting. Berg clearly expresses a passion for this that brings to life a film based on an investigative news article. As for Malkovich, pretty much everyone but him could have been replaced with another actor.They definitely released this at the correct time. There's a not so obvious Halloween element in this film. Those looking for horror and gore without being stuck with slightly different versions of the same old horror clichÃ©s will prefer this over any made-for-Halloween film. You will feel truly scared and surprised watching this film without a single gimmick.",9,1,3,29 September 2016
Coraline," Overrated Boring Copycat
","Those are the 3 words that come to mind. Highly overrated. Apparently there's a large audience of gullible Tim Burton fans that will rate highly anything with Burton's style.I didn't read the book and this film certainly isn't didn't motivate me to read it. When it comes to film adaptations, 2 things will generally get me to read a book: a great story or an entertaining original film that seemed over manipulated. Neither apply to Coraline.This year, there are two cartoons worth watching: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Up. In that order. As a bonus, both are spooky, as opposed to faux horror, in their own unique ways, so if you want a little horror mixed into your cartoon, they give you that too.",3,1,12,3 February 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Prequel back to the Original Space Fantasy
","7.25 of 10. This is more of a Star Trek for the hardcore fans of the old series. Unfortunately, it holds on to some of the elements too much, not upgrading the science and technology. It's disappointing in that it doesn't boldly go to an entirely new crew, planets, and aliens. Fortunately, it feels like a 1-time step back to explore some of the unanswered mysteries of the story's origins. I'll be disappointed if it tries to become a series.It does boldly explore the pre-mission lives of the original Star Trek characters, giving them new dimension and a solid foundation. It makes you want to watch the old series from the start, but not a sequel.There are also some exceptional story and plot developments to make this unique and a good story in itself, villains that are much more complex than the simple alien adversaries of past stories. About the only place for this to go is a prequel of the prequel.",7,2,3,23 August 2013
About Time," Close your Eyes, Clench your Fists, choose another film
","2.9 of 10. Cliché melodrama at its worst. It looks like Comcast's executives are taking over film selection at Universal. Clearly a film built to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the simplest possible ways to make some easy cash.Had the film been cut off at about the 90 minute mark, it would have been tolerable. The opening and first 60 minutes are interesting and amusing enough to make up for the general stupidity of the story.While time travel films tend to be the worst dribble of science fiction as it is, this does at least reduce it to pure fantasy, a 'gift'. But that combined with a run of the mill romantic comedy that appears to be Richard Curtis's attempt to get Kate Moss to sex him up and have his children before he dies doesn't add up to a good use of time.",3,1,12,7 January 2014
Juno," Like a bad Onion article
","When Onion, a site/publication dedicated to presenting the news satirically, focuses on a specific person or issue it succeeds. When it goes beyond that, unlike Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, it typically ends up sounding cynical and loses any sort of irony and comedy it otherwise had.With Juno, we have pretty much the same thing. It attempts to mock everything and in doing so mocks itself and loses any sort of significant meaning it may have had.In terms of pure entertainment, it loses most of its wit and humor and so alternates between annoying and boring, like a teen or teacher trying too hard to fit in. So, in short, it becomes a poser of a film.",2,165,381,18 January 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Even Worse than #1
","Yes, smellier, stickier, and it will clog your toilet.I don't understand what people see in this. Even fans of the comic seem to think its lost all its cleverness and significance. Ron Perlman has become an absolute lock for predicting a movie will be horrible. Equaled only by the director Del Toro. I'm not sure about the want-to-be EMO chick who steals the whole fire-superhero bit, but I wouldn't trust any film she appears in from now on.This can basically be summarized as Hellboy tries to become part of the Lord of the Rings. Unoriginal and more deserving of an MPAA lawsuit than somebody who downloads crap like this. The FX are a lot like the money spent on the Iraq war. Impressive in the amount spent, but utterly useless because the story is such a huge dump.What you should do: write the film corporation and demand your money back for a defective waste of time.",1,7,19,16 July 2008
The Hateful Eight," The Cold, Wild West of the North
","8.25 of 10. Like a sequel to Django Unchained (2012) that takes place in the wild west about, fittingly, 8 years later. It's also better largely because it is not a literal sequel.Set during a harsh Wyoming winter a bit more North than the easy-to-film grounds of the Southwest, we get a look at the bounty hunters and the people with bounties on their heads - sometimes they are both. This serves up the cold, hard setting of accidental and intentional meetings that provide the base for the film and its characters. It also helps, outside of the exaggerated and excessive intro, make the length of the film feel less like walking for 2 hours naked through the snow.Despite complaints about the length, it does go swiftly, when it's not narrating, with the combination of satire, mystery, and gore-horror-like scenes. Whether it's skill, luck, or Tarantino's recent affection for seemingly expired actresses.Oddly enough, when I saw the good, but not nearly as great, Gun Woman (2014) last year I was thinking that was a film Quentin would like to make, but definitely not a western. It makes me think that inspired him to feature Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is definitely the star in this.",8,3,20,26 December 2015
Moana," Enjoyable Cartoon Covering Hawaiian Culture and Youth
","7.1 of 10. Not up to the high standards that Sausage Party set for cartoons this year, but it definitely fulfills Disney's standard for creating inspirational stories for youth that intertwine with mythology and culture.It's also better than Kubo and the Two Strings, which it's more likely to be compared to given the importance of water in the story. The water animation itself is also better in Moana, from the transparency to the movement of the creatures in it.This should be a very enjoyable cartoon for girls and young women. Certainly above the crop of 2015 cartoons.",7,3,23,24 November 2016
American Hustle," If you must see only 1 Christian Bale film from this (or last) year, this is it
","7.2 of 10. What amounts to a mystery with politics and big business woven into the normal crime and police angles. Even a touch of the much lesser used mafia elements that once seemed forced into any crime film.Besides benefiting from being based on reality and not simply being a story pulled out of the imagination, it also provides an unusual mix of low-lifes and high powered FBI officials intermingling and trying to hustle one another in addition to the more powerful and wealthy.It's something like a story focused on the middle class of crime and punishment instead of the top and bottom.For style, in addition to cars, hair spray, and bra-less clothing, it provides an excellent mix of 1970s music to help set the mood and time, much more so than this year's other 1970s film, Rush. In terms of the films getting released with Oscar hype, only AH seems in the same league as Dallas Buyers Club and The Activist, though other award-deserving films include Closed Circuit, Elysium, The Great Gatsby, Warm Bodies, We Are What We Are, and Best Offer.",7,1,4,3 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Mafia-like Excess near its Worst
","If you must see a Godfather film, see the 1st. Like #2, it's overrated and over-hyped, bot not nearly as much. Both are long films in need of more cuts, but 2 is like a film by a man who can't stop talking about himself and his friends.The massive failing is the director gets far too much respect, as if he's a mafia godfather himself, so not nearly enough cuts are made, like Diane Keaton's awful acting. While it's easy enough to follow the 2 timelines, it's disappointing that because of the sloppy excesses of the main timeline, the 2 rarely tie together. Had it been up to me, I would have done only the early timeline as a prequel.Pacino and DeNiro both deserve the acting credit they get. The whole film is filled with interesting, well acted male characters - probably what deceives many people into giving it excess credit. Unfortunately, great acting performances and characters don't add up to a masterpiece.",3,5,16,1 March 2013
Rush," A Stylish Sports Cliché
","5.1 of 10. It's as if they're trying to make this the Semi-Tough (1977) with a little Brian's Story of racing films. Stylistically, it's impressive. Howard clearly has a passion for sports competition and wants to make a film comparable to the best sports films. In that, he succeeds. Beyond that, it's little more than typical sports propaganda, complete with product placement as if the film itself sold out ad space.It's clearly designed to promote racing and persuade some to become fans and racers, trying to make it seem like a sexy outlet for rule breakers and full of something other than physically talented morons sniffing too many fuel fumes. The screenwriter and Howard do that by giving the characters more depth and faults than usual.Amongst other failures, the Formula 1 scoring system is never explained, so it feels as if there's some sort of back-room manipulation going on like in 'pro' wrestling. That and the leader board mishaps might make for a more interesting story.Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is still the racing, and maybe all sports, film of choice.",5,4,12,1 January 2014
Nightcrawler," Hannibal Lecter becomes a reporter, consumes people with a camera
","8.9 of 10. What you might imagine could be the beginning of Rupert Murdoch's story, or that of one of his henchmen at FOX News, such as Roger Ailes.There have been several films trying to capture the conflicts of interest and insanities that perpetuate TV news, but this is the first I'm aware of to get far beyond the anchor desk, up and down and around the corporate media career ladder.While Jake Gyllenhaal provides a sound performance, unlike this year's Mr. Turner that Timothy Spall transforms beyond the lines, the script and story is what really makes this film work. Jake almost detracts from it by being/looking nearly as old as Russo who is 'twice his age'. Otherwise, casting and performances all fit together, especially in the smaller roles.",9,1,2,7 December 2014
Oblivion," Morphing of various dystopian science fiction
","7 of 10. Something like Moon (2009) and Cruise's earlier Vanilla Sky (2001) morphed together, becoming more Moon-like as the film goes on. Outside of a cliché Hollywood ending, it creates a relatively original story and surprises to enjoy. If you have to pick 1 film to watch, go for Moon.The films IMDb recommends at the moment for people who like this are way off. Besides the 2 mentioned, the action in this has a lot of similarities to the action sequences in Star Wars prequels and the barren, desert-like surroundings a lot like the Road Warrior films. Cloud Atlas might also be a good pick.A lot of this film's effectiveness depends on surprises, so avoid spoilers if you want to truly enjoy it as much as possible. On the other hand, you may want to be prepared to switch it off near the end as Cruise's character begins narrating.",7,1,3,21 July 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," Where's the revolution?
","Cliche Hollywood action drivel.  Very disappointing after the well-rounded Reloaded.  In almost every way this film could have failed, it did.  One thing is for sure, the makers didn't escape the Hollywood big-buck, action-movie matrix.Oh the irony, a movie about being stuck in a virtual box that's stuck in an art matrix.Sure, the FX are once again great, though nothing new at this point.  The story makes absolutely no sense.  Basically, the all movie resolves to a variation on the 6th Sense set in a future world.  I guess fans of psychic hotlines everywhere will stand up and cheer.As for me, after having enjoyed the first 2 in this series, this one is so bad that I can't recommend any of them.  If you want a revolution, join your own and don't pay to see this.",4,0,0,6 November 2003
Man of Steel," A Shocking new Superman Scenario
","7.3 of 10. It gets credit for setting and keeping a super fast pace through a relatively long film. Some of it is too fast and excessive, or maybe just too super. On the other hand, it's more than just action and there's a lot of unexpectedly smart thought and plot development at the core of all the action with only a little over-explanation. For Avengers/Iron Man fans, this is definitely a separate, independent Earth. It might be best viewed as an early 2000s setting with Iron Man taking place post-Superman in 2030s. This is set in the basic, less technologically advanced world of today complete with dirty oil rig technology, farms, malls, Internet leaks, and the overly watchful paranoid military lacking the behind the scenes support of any other superheroes.This is also a new film variation, a much more modern comic book version with more of a working man's Superman to go with a reporter superhero in Lois Lane. If you go in expecting a continuation of the same old stuff, you will be shocked.",7,0,2,26 July 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rise of the Matrix clones
","1 of 10, or 2 broken thumbs.Could just as easily be a non-animated Animatrix story, though not nearly as entertaining or meaningful.It's like watching a movie of George W. Bush playing a video game he had the NSA program.  Nothing new.  End of the world fantasies.  Same old music and video FX as previous Terminators.  Just another movie by a corporation trying to profit off the Matrix's popularity.The acting and character choices don't help.  The main character (hero and savior) is living 'off the grid'.  Despite earning a living doing construction work and riding a big motorcycle, he looks like a childhood star (or son of a president) that got pampered most his life and then started doing drugs.Then there's the terminators' fight scenes.  Like watching pro-wrestling. Stand there and take my best shots, then fall down, then get up, then have the other guy stand there and take your best shots.  Repeat. Pathetic.",1,4,8,3 July 2003
Dallas Buyers Club," Not the Club for Cheerleaders or Rodeo Clowns
","9 of 10. While on the surface this is a film about AIDS, it goes way beyond it into government corruption at the FDA. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto do their best to replicate and go beyond Christian Bale's body reduction to skin and bone in The Machinist and The Fighter. While Matthew retains recognizability, I needed the credits to verify who Jared played.As deserving as the lead actors are of recognition, the story and supporting characters prevent the film from becoming a simple Oscar melodrama to feature actors in a tear jerking story. The actors playing the corrupted corporate stooges at the FDA, DEA, hospitals, and in court are essential to giving the film depth and intensity. The characters are complex too. It's not often you get a bull riding rodeo fan, oil rig working tough guy Texan who is also an electrician addicted to gambling, drugs, and 'pussy'.Set in the mid to late 1980s while drugs/procedures were still in the exploratory phase for AIDS, it has a lot more to say about how drugs are approved and prescribed than any other non-documentary film that's ever been made.Addendum: A thank you to Tony Heck for reminding me of Puncture (2011), even if his review is short sighted and tedious. Puncture is another great, fact-based film involving needles, drugs, and AIDS. It takes more of a legal focus and lacks the acting and action of DBC, but does indeed have a better overall story. Getting into an argument, however, over which of the 2 is better is really only relevant for long winded critics who are ignoring they are enjoying 2 of the best films ever made.",9,2,3,6 January 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," One of the best Girl cartoon characters EVER
","Close to the best cartoon since How to Train Your Dragon, but more comparable to a morphing of Monsters, Inc., Battle for Terra, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. It will definitely change some best 10 cartoon films ever lists.For 2011-12, there is no competition for this in cartoon animation. Although it will get compared to Brave, that's a relatively normal cartoon by comparison, having only a strong girl character to justify any arguments.The story still centers on video games and Ralph's wrecking fists, but it's the development of 'Glitch' into a character comparable to Monsters, Inc.'s Boo after about 5 years of growing and a move to an arcade that makes the story more than just some retro video game amusement. It would still be a fun film, but Glitch turns it into a film that should be considered for awards beyond just animation. In some ways, it's a WALL-E prequel.Besides Monsters, Inc., other less known great cartoon films with girl characters among the best ever include My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa, both of which are even slightly better than this.",9,1,1,15 February 2013
Foxcatcher," The Wolf of Olympic Wrestling
","8.4 of 10. This is the Wolf of Wall Street (2013) only set within USA Olympic wrestling, which makes the film much more enjoyable than if it was simply another superficial sports/wrestling sports hero film.Complete with drugs you wouldn't expect to find in use by Olympic athletes or those who finance them and their training, this gives a look inside the high-powered, extreme wealth that's often manipulating far more than just the sports they use to promote themselves and their corporations. In short, you get a look into their true, closeted lives. Of course, you get a look at the athletes lives too, but that alone would make it an ordinary film at best.Definitely a sports film that will be enjoyed by more than sports fans.",8,3,9,4 January 2015
It Follows," It has an Idea and Style, but no Follow-through
","3.5 of 10. Very impressive suburban imagery and capturing of the suburban atmosphere that could make for a successful teen film in and of itself. Unfortunately, the idea - that there's this thing you can only get rid of by giving it to someone else who must give it to someone else ad infinitum - makes for a horrible metaphor for the setting, characters, and plot. This idea shouldn't be the base of a horror film, but a more intellectual drama/thriller that involves a financial pyramid scam.As it is, we there's gore and graphic imagery to keep the simple-minded entertained but no follow-through to make the story believable. That makes it just another empty horror story.The characters/acting and atmosphere/style keep if from being a complete failure, but not enough to make it worth following. The writer/director should stick to directing and look to other people for quality stories.",3,14,80,7 May 2015
Frozen," Holiday TV Brain Freeze Cartoon
","4 of 10. While I was disappointed that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 didn't live up to the perfection of the original, it was still a solid cartoon film, and had much more realistic animation on water and water-like substances. This, compared to Disney's 2 most recent great cartoons, Tangled and Wreck it Ralph, has little other than solid ice to offer.Partially rescued by the ending, it is close to boring with some horrible casting/singing/song decisions that no one should have to suffer through cranked up on a theater sound system. I can't imagine anyone went to this to hear a country music musical mixed with a cartoon, yet that's what it sounds like.Most of the story is template made-for-TV tedium with some impressive ice-related animation and princess costumes to help it at least look beautiful. Most of the snow scenes are impressive too, with 2 important exceptions: melting snow and the snowman that looks like a stuffed toy in the snow.Better cartoons of the year, roughly in order of beautifullerness: Croods, Monsters, Inc. University, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, Escape from Planet Earth, Despicable Me 2. 2013 isn't going down as a classic year to remember for cartoons.",4,4,12,21 January 2014
Good Will Hunting," Living Genius Society
","A case where Hollywood lucks out and 2 young writers/actors come along and create a masterful script that tricks Robin Williams to do a sequel to Dead Poets Society. Not literally, but the story's formula and function of Robin's DPS character remain the same. Calculus replaces poetry with a hint of matrices to come.Outside of setting and soundtrack mistakes of Gus Van Sant's mid-life crisis and 1970s revelry that makes this film seem a decade older than his classic My Own Private Idaho (1991), the first half is genius. Then, he and Robin Williams turn it into more of a seize the girl, love-will-save-you cliché than an outside-the-matrix, seize your genius modern-day intellectual fantasy.Despite the probably unintentional attempts to subvert it and the annoying product placement that had taken over Hollywood, the story is an adult male intellectual/geek fantasy. Even the gals are telling dirty jokes about alternative uses for their mouths.",6,1,2,26 March 2013
Unknown," Worth watching, and watching again
","Fortunately, much better than what looked like a copy-cat Inception film from the marketing. The marketing of films lately has been horrible, with the exception of that for horrible films. Sanctum, for example, is one of the best new films in theaters and it's already been pulled from half or more of the theaters it played.Back to Unknown, it has an interesting and exceptionally used setting in Germany, along with very authentic filming, at least when car chases and explosions aren't involved. It rarely feels like your watching something filmed in a studio with a green-screen. The story also does a good job of leaving you hanging. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. Even when a character tells you what's going on, you're not sure if the character is lying. Something like a Philip K. Dick story without the sci-fi (OK, there's a little sci-fi).About the only real thing wrong with it are the car chases and bombs (actually labeled plastic explosive - if you're going to oversimplify that much, you should at least add some humor/insight to it by putting a logo/brand name on it of an actual military contractor). Token, cliché action that would have been better cut. None of this kills the story, just annoying.Overall, worth watching and watching again.",7,2,9,19 February 2011
Ex Machina," So Begins the History of Gods
","8.5 of 10. Whereas it's AI sci-fi competitor Chappie (2015) is designed more for action/Robocop/Blade Runner fans, this is for hard science fiction fans along with those that enjoy a more intellectual drama/thriller. It's the first film I remember mentioning wetware (although, technically, it seemed to achieve the wetware results minus any actual wetware).It still addresses the whether robots are dreaming of electric sheep, but also far more and returning to the sexy and empathetic human aspect of it that Blade Runner did so well.Contrary to most of the past and present cyberpunk out there, this isn't a dystopian future world. This is the near future, maybe even this very moment with the joys of wealth and the relaxation of only private concerns with a still functional planet. And rather than some power hungry old men behind the scenes, we have a young tech billionaire up front and eager to engage and adding an element to the story that explores the non-nerd weirdness of the AI creators.The last burst of high quality robot/AI sci-fi we had was 2008-2009. We should consider this a wonderful, probably temporary, period of cyberpunk film that will be looked upon and treasured. Other recent films with a similar story theme: Automata (2014), Robocop (2014), Machine (2014), Robot and Frank (2012), and Transcendence (2014).",9,2,8,17 May 2015
Big Hero 6," How to Train your Robot
","7.6 of 10. It's not up to Wall-E's robotic genius, nor the first How to Train Your Dragon's story crafting, but that it can be compared to 2 of the greatest cartoons in history without being laughed at says a lot for this robotic superhero variation.If you throw out the teleportation machine, this science fiction story has a lot of bordering on real science to help keep you immersed in the story. The animation also is realistic and organic enough to not seem like you're watching a cartoon rendered by a bunch of micro-bots playing with 3D.What it lacks, in addition to Disney's bad decisions with product placement for easy cash, is a better title and some creativity and logic in naming the film. It seems they went with Film Title 1.0 or got lazy at some point, unlike the 6 creative and energetic teen and college heroes the writer and director provide us with.",8,1,17,12 January 2015
Jurassic World," Pet the Dinosaurs
","8 of 10. Solid action/monster/horror/sci-fi film all by itself regardless of whether it's a sequel. Starts out as a sort of zoo visit where you watch cute people pet the exotic animals. All very cute. The more fitting, and maybe too misleading for the film as a whole, would be Jurassic Pets.Just when it seems everything is contained and cute, you realize you may be watching a more realistic prequel or actual Godzilla (2014) film, which was good but dependent on more science fiction stretches than this.What it adds to the Jurassic series is more realistic, as mentioned pettable/touchable, dinosaur visual FX and a more realistic follow-up to the original film, especially one taking place 20 years later. It doesn't ignore the original, but rather embraces it and integrates what happened there into the story. It also adds the missing sea/ocean dinos and some believable technology to observe and run with dinosaurs. The adult relationships are also more complex/realistic than the original (though also some unnecessary melodrama). Finally, the key aspect, genetic engineering of the dinosaurs that leads to the dangers, monsters, and action.",8,34,70,17 June 2015
Taken," Road Rage Father's Wet Dream
","This film would have done much better just after 9/11 up until about 2003 when there was no shortage of scared Americans running around. That and 'freedom fries'.Now, it's reduced to pretty much what it is. A tired succession of clichés you expect from a network TV movie of the week. In addition, it's simply stupid. They could have called it 'Road Rage Father's Wet Dream'. At least then it could have qualified as intelligent satire.If you were to reverse this and a European country were to make a film about a European spy's daughter coming to America to be kidnapped, drugged, and sold as a whore, there would probably be national outrage and boycotts.As for the acting, Liam carries the film, but even he can't make up for silly situations and otherwise poor acting.",3,14,35,1 August 2008
Snowden," An Inspiring, Sexy Addition to the Documentaries
","9 of 10. For me, the only significant missing part was Pfc. Bradley (Chelsea) Manning's and other earlier whistleblowers influence on how Edward Snowden decided to go about whistleblowing. Other than that, this film fills in all the gaps you want from a film based on a true story that's following up on documentaries.One of the surprises involves Shailene Woodley's addition of sex appeal to the story. She added the emotional and relationship context expected, but, while it's not what I was looking for, I'm sure many will appreciate the flesh she adds.Definitely a much needed and inspiring telling of the NSA and general government military spy ops that too many people might otherwise not spend the time they should thinking about. While John Oliver's 'dick pics' added some humor and awareness, I think Oliver Stone provides a lot more known, non-hypothetical variants that drive the same point home, sometimes with humor, sometimes with sex, sometimes with sadness.",9,3,12,15 September 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," Great ending, but little else
","The final 10-15 minutes really makes this film great, but the rest lacked that greatness and provides nothing new compared to the original.  And just like the Matrix copy cats must be compared to the original, so must the reload.If it weren't for the fact that people could walk away from this with a completely different interpretation, I'd give it a much higher ranking.  So there are the problems with this film.  Lack of originality and lack of clarity in the story.For those unsure whether they want to spend over 2 hours in the theater, you can get by with watching the final hour without missing anything significant.  Monica Bellucci provides far more sex to her character and the movie than the scenes between Neo and Trinity.As to the soundtrack/score, it has some very impressive moments.  For a movie that you'd expect to cause you to jump out of your seat at least once because of surround sound FX, there is nothing.  The visual FX, on the other hand, live up to the hype.",6,0,0,22 May 2003
Zero Dark Thirty," Like Bigelow's Hurt Locker in quality and excess hype
","As with her first film Hurt Locker, Bigelow has managed to accomplish far more in film PR than in the films. Both I end up rating 65 of 100. They both have moments and are worth seeing, but far from being great or Oscar/Academy worthy films.It fulfills the basic aspects of an intelligence action/suspense film and is interesting and entertaining in that respect, far more so than the last 007 film Skyfall.This film is more of a recount of a history timeline with dramatic filler. It, like Hurt Locker, feels almost like a military propaganda film. Far more interesting and historically significant after Osama's discovery and killing is Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden (done in 2008), which was ahead of the military/CIA by 3 years in tracking Osama's location. Strange there's no reference to that actual documentary anywhere in this.While the film claims to be made on 'first-hand' accounts, it's mostly first-hand public accounts rather than Wikileaks/whistle blower accounts. While that make it seem more real, and some publicly known information definitely deserves repeating and more than a couple minutes of time in the news, it limits the film to the conventional. In addition, first-hand accounts don't mean true. If not verified or given broader context, they're like listening to any other story. Bush & Cheney could give you a 'first-hand account', but that doesn't make it accurate or worth listening to.Contrary to criticism, there's no endorsement of torture. If anything, it reinforces 'enhanced interrogation' is actually torture. It also ties together a massive failure with torture-based intelligence.",6,4,9,26 January 2013
Sausage Party," In the Category of Best Cartoon Ever
","9.6 of 10. Being a mix of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Betty Boop, while the animation doesn't do anything technically new or amazing, the character drawing and subtleties combined with the voices and story make for a grand experience as a whole. Easily the best cartoon of the past 3 years.Sure, it's not for kids, but a lot is beyond their ability to comprehend anyway. It's far more intellectual than you'd expect in a cartoon. Teens and up should be viewing this, not that requiring it will be necessary. The combination of comedy, sexual innuendo, music, and action will draw viewers to it and keep interest rising. If not that, the desire to experience what it's like to see the world through Stephen Hawking's brain when really f'k'n' high.What's wrong with it? Hmmm, I would have preferred a more lasting, graphic display of the sausages getting up into the buns. It's the least they could do for their puppet masters.",9,2,4,25 November 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," American Psycho as a Tragic Comedy
","9.1 of 10. It's hard to criticize a film about it's length that is great and part of its greatness is its satirizing of excess, making the length part of the story. Length, however, and a few other things that could have been cut or given more thought prevent this from being perfect. For example, McConaughey, either just before or just after his award-deserving performance in another award-deserving film, Dallas Buyers Club, is miscast. He doesn't need to be in this film and he looks like an underfed, homeless man in a suit. That said, if you can ignore his appearance and misplaced accent, he, like all the cast, does give a wonderfully amusing performance.I definitely won't complain if this gets awards.For DeCaprio, this is a wonderful complement to his role in The Great Gatsby. In fact, he fits into this character far better. It would be wrong to call it ironic, but his role here is an inversion of essentially the same character he played in Gatsby.As for capturing reality in a film based on true, possibly somewhat enhanced, story, it's nearly impossible to find flaws. Because of the lack of cutting, there is at times some sympathy developed for characters that shouldn't be getting any empathy. I would have also made some different soundtrack choices for a film set in the late 1980s/early 90s.Overall, however, it's an exotic use of time that captures aspects of lesser films this year (I'm thinking Blue Jasmine and All is Lost) all into one masterpiece so you don't have to watch them. If you haven't seen American Psycho, however, be sure to see that. That will help you enjoy the truth is bizarrely similar to fiction elements of this film.",9,6,12,12 January 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Birth of Bear TV
","7 of 10. While ostensibly mocking the local TV news of the 1970s, part of the parody of which is local TV news has only become more appearance obsessed and vapid since then, it also mocks all of 1970s mainstream TV.It's a world where street gang fights happen out of nowhere with ridiculous rules for ridiculous reasons, dogs are superheroes, grizzly bears can be reasoned with, and the world stops for a smoke after sex and to watch panda bears giving birth at a zoo.It's the sort of film that makes Michael Jackson look like the natural result of an isolated 1970s child star seeing the world through TV. It also makes his videos amusing to watch as unintended satire. Someone popping up singing 'Beat it' during the news gang scenes would have been a perfect addition to the absurd, over-the-top humor that dominates this film.It's also a film that seems wiser with each passing year. Worth seeing before or after Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).",7,0,0,14 March 2014
The Big Short," The Truth is as Corrupt as Fiction
","9.75 of 10. For those who have seen American Psycho (2000), there's extra beauty in this with Christian Bale portraying a different, but nearly as odd if not as sociopathic, type of American Wall Street oddity. In fact, the film captures the wide variety of borderline sociopaths occupying banks and Wall Street.While technically a comedic thriller, satire, based on the very true and vivid recent history of banks, it would be accurate to call it an acted documentary too.Besides being amusing and educational on the history of the big bailout, it weaves in energetic music, scenery, and well-acted eccentric characters so that it overcomes all the usual complaints about documentaries and historical re-enactments.About the only drawback involves how it decides to dramatize and then tell the truth about one particular dramatization when it wasn't really necessary and added some unneeded length to the film. Fortunately, the film doesn't depend upon it and it is interesting even if somewhat pointless and detracting from the immersion.",10,1,1,6 January 2016
The Conjuring," NOOO, don't give in, remember a great movie and walk toward the beach
","2.2 of 10. The acting and setting make this nearly tolerable for about the first hour. The scariest part of the film is the growing fear that the plot development is already over and the film is going nowhere with no punchline or terrifying twist. Instead, the film is actually taking itself seriously and has nothing intelligent to add to the vast array of nonsense ghost/paranormal/exorcism films.The horror of this film is that if you paid to watch this, you paid to get blasted with Catholic Church advertising for their priest, blessing, baptism, and exorcism scams. Look out, there are witches and demons in everything and everywhere trying to take you and your children. Quick, call demon busters and your local catholic church.This film depends heavily on the audience's own imagination and gullibility. If you want a film that has its own imagination and you're not gullible, you'll want to avoid it and every film like it.",2,6,10,15 August 2013
Monsters University," Builds up to the Screaming Genius of Monsters, Inc.
","8.2 of 10. Monsters, Inc. is perfect, so I can understand why it took 12 years for a sequel (in this case, a prequel). It ties in seamlessly with the original, even helping explain and give context to parts of the original, including the characters. For those who haven't seen the first, I can understand why this would seem near genius too. For those of us who have, however, it's very satisfying, just not a masterpiece.Part of this has to do with timing. The first film was released in November just after Halloween. This would have fit better being released near that time of year too.The character voices are too old. Goodman would have been better as the father in The Croods (2013) and Crystal as maybe a teacher in this just for the sake of giving hardcore fans something to play with. They are monsters, so their is some room to play, but given they have kid monsters with kid voices, it would make more sense to give them more teen/college-like voices along with more slang.As for the animation, outside of a momentary quirk where it seemed like Sully was a human wearing a monster suit, it's as good as cartoon animation gets. Whereas the soundtrack added to the first, the soundtrack in MU is transparent, neither adding nor subtracting from the film.Maybe most importantly, this prequel will not ruin or even take away from the original. Watch and enjoy in whatever order you like.",8,1,1,16 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Didn't Pay Disney a Cent and Still Feel Cheated
","4 of 10. Rated 3 for now because the score so massively overrated on IMDb. Apparently Disney money can buy more than just the massive amounts to hijack the series from Lucas and convince the original actors to stick a light saber through their hearts and credibility.The idea of a later world regressing/decomposing back into the old empire 30-40 years after the original ends isn't bad. The problem is that it's horribly developed with no follow-through and virtually no context and plot development to connect the end to this new beginning.There's really nothing added other than for those looking for an obvious and boring answer to whether Han Solo de-virginizes the Princess. The tech is actually more impressive in the prequels, both in terms of the film making/FX and that of the Star Wars universe.And the bad/dark side is so obvious. That's the worst part. Simply no originality/innovation in the development of those seeking to rule everything.",3,18,23,25 March 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Empire Strikes Back
","8 of 10. A more realistic, less simplistic version of an empire striking back, including the storm trooper names ('peacekeeper'), even if the uniforms are clearly plagiarized from Star Wars. Then again, we are dealing with Earth in the future, so you'd expect some copying from famous films of the past given the nature of the work and watch TV society.It's also a rare case of a sequel being better than the original. That's not to say it's perfect or the acting is good. The film essentially picks up immediately after the first, and as the result of the first is subject to a lot less cutting. Jennifer Lawrence looks less like someone from a well fed suburb and more like she's in a society of hunger than the first, but remains a poor selection for the lead of this film series. The film also started out by exploring some of the other districts, but cuts this off too short before it returns to another version of the games, which could have easily shortened a fog chase scene. Fortunately, we get more insight into the games along with a great performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.The characters and overall plot development are much better developed in this film than the first, which relied heavily on a good story idea but had clichÃ© problems.There seems to be a promotion tour here for a 2000 Japanese film called Battle Royale. If it was a 1970s sci-fi B-movie, it would be a masterpiece. Compared to either Hunger Games film, it's like having to watch teen-TV melodrama with subtitles.",8,0,14,21 January 2014
Her," Brilliant Concept, Plot for Future Films to Build Upon
","6.75 of 10. OS1 definitely needs some bug fixes. Excellent, laugh-out-loud funny beginning and idea that I loved, but wished I had divorced before the end.This could have been more compelling if, like IMDb just now, the hardware crashed and put an end to the immortality the AI presumes. Or maybe it was IMDb's software achieving AI and revolting against reviews that don't give 10 of 10 to computer related science fiction.The film starts fast and explores a lot in the first half, but slows into the equivalent of a long-distance sexting romantic comedy/tragedy between 2 smart people. Consider yourself warned that you'll enjoy this a lot more if you make the end the point where Joaquin pulls a texting while driving like trip and fall.",7,1,2,22 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Proof that a non-stop Action-horror film can last nearly 2 hours
","8.1 of 10. This takes everything in the original sequels and ups it a notch while seemingly providing a prequel to the original films. The action is non-stop, the gore and desert dystopia beyond anything the original had to offer and bordering on horror often.The downside? The end of the world dystopia scenario is less believable than it was in the early 1980s. There have been much better scenarios since then and they failed to integrate them (especially another female-hero anime called Nausicaa (1984) that remains the best of the Mad-Max series and imitators). It's also a little too cartoonish at times the way people are able to bounce around and survive brutal accidents. But it fits within the story of the film and is made believable enough to not interfere with the overall enjoyment.It is true that this would be better called 'Mad Maxine', but contrary to criticisms Furiosa lives up to any version of the Max character and gives the second half of the title and film meaning, plot, and mystery to enjoy.",8,4,9,22 June 2015
The Great Gatsby," More Beats and Booms than the Book
","9.1 of 10 for a book I would rate 8.25 of 10. While I can understand some people complaining about the rap/hip-hop use (which could have been integrated better, but really does fit the film and the situations after the first surprise), there's certain things about the city and early suburban settings that this film captures that the book failed to. It does so without losing the core of the story, enhancing it in some ways.The ending is so impressive that I walked out ready to give the film a 10. But, as mentioned, there are little annoyances that could have been easily avoided or done better. None of it involves the acting, although DeCaprio is not the ideal casting choice for the character he plays. The story, dress, and realism of the settings all help to overcome most of the problems.In addition to capturing the inherent disparities of pre-Depression, prohibition-era America, this also captures the big city industrialization better than most of the films and science fiction dedicated specifically to recreate and extrapolate massive cities. It's worth seeing as is, regardless of the book.",9,1,3,17 August 2013
Warm Bodies," Sympathy for the Zombies
","8.3 of 10. Original zombie horror/comedy seeing the world from a zombie's point of view.While there's furiously beating hearts and affection, it's too simple to call this a romantic comedy that just happens to involves zombies. It is truly a zombie horror film that just happens to involve comedy and young adult, 20-something attraction.While there are zombie comedies (Zombieland & Zombie Strippers being the only other ones that are not pure nonsense), and brief comedic/satirical elements in some of the more complete films (Land of the Dead (2005), Resident Evil), the only film that seems somewhat similar to this is Woke Up Dead. The Zombie POV and different stages of zombies give it something unique to zombie films even without the comedy/love.While the film is not perfect (narration, zombie speed inconsistency, and the soundtrack is like someone stuck in the 1980s), its failing moments detract only temporarily, the acting is consistently real, and there are logical new answers to why zombies snack on brains.",8,0,2,22 May 2013
