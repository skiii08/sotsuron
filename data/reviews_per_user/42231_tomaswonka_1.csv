Iron Man 3," I do not hate it, but...
","The movie was obnoxious from the beginning, Robert Downey Jr. is not the one to blame but a total waste of time and disappointing, Sorry MCU fans. The character of Tony Stark it's boring this time, i think he has some kind of depression that we didn't see before or they didn't tell us. Nothing to say about Mandarin, a total fraud, it could have been a decent Marvel villain but they screwed it again. Then again, the jokes another Marvel problem, if you are in a serious situation, come on that's why this movies are for kids.By the way, what the hell is Rebecca Hall's role in this movie she's like there doing nothing.Hope Marvel one day make good movies again like IronMan, Captain America 2 or Civil War.",1,0,0,20 September 2016
