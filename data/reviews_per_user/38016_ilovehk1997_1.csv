Requiem for a Dream," detailed description about drug addicts
",This is the most descriptive film about drug addiction that I have ever seen. Amphetamine use for weight reduction and leading to dependence and schizophrenia like symptoms; heroin leading to amputation of the upper limb; strong craving for the drug and withdrawal symptoms experienced by the abuser; the social and psychological problems due to substance abuse. All are commonly seen but neglected by general public. This film would be both educational and recreative. Strong visual and auditory effects leading to a 'confusion' state that mimic the mental state of the actors. I would give at least 9 marks for this film.,Null,0,1,16 December 2001
