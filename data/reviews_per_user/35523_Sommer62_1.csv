The Avengers," Most amazing movie ever.
","The Avengers is an absolute must see movie, with the amazing storyline and action packed heroes it is a top quality movie like no other. The cast from The Avengers is the best actors for the characters what so ever, and of course there can be no Iron-Man without Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans is just right for the part as our favorite patriot Captain America, if I should mention one more actor who I believe did an outstanding job it would has to be a mix between Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Chris Hemsworth as Thor, those two work so perfectly together and play the characters of the norse/nordic gods better than I could imagine anyone ever will be able to, if you have not seen The Avengers yet you should do your- self a favor and buy it right now! it is that kind of movie that you cannot live without having watched.",10,1,9,16 January 2013
