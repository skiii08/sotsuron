Catch Me If You Can," Great movie, pity about the DVD
","I enjoyed this Steven Spielberg movie. Leonardo gives a wonderful performance - witty, amusing, moving etc, etc. But what on earth has gone wrong with the DVD? There isn't a single extra feature to accompany the film. I mean that literally. There isn't even a trailer, let alone a documentary about the making of the film, interviews with the actors, production team etc, let alone a director's commentary. This is unacceptable. If you charge full price for a DVD the viewer has right to expect more than just the movie. There's a serious point here. A lot of movie criticism is wrong. The press are often hostile and intrusive. Extra features on the DVD enable movie makers to restore the balance - to record under controlled conditions what was going on. Features enhance a viewer's understanding and enjoyment of a movie. When these are recorded at the time the movie is made they have historical value. Walt Disney pioneered documentaries about his movies in the 1950s. They give a wonderful insight into how his films were made half a century ago. Is it too much to expect that Steven Spielberg, who directed this film, can come up to date? By explaining what you're doing - or trying to do - you reach out over the heads of the know-all critics and widen your circle of understanding. In Disney's day making a documentary was expensive. Nowadays any member of the production crew can wield a video camera. There's no excuse. I feel cheated.",Null,0,1,26 March 2004
