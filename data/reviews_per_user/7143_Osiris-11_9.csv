Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than 'Jedi.'
","After a wait of sixteen years Lucas has delivered the beginning installment of what has become the American epic saga.  The first thing I have to say is that the movie is not the best episode of the series, nor is it the worst. As far as the existing trilogy goes, this one rates above Return of the Jedi but falls short of The Empire Strikes Back.  I would personally place it neck-and-neck with A New Hope.  However, since in 1977 A New Hope completely revolutionized the science-fiction genre The Phantom Menace will never be remembered in as high esteem.  The movie itself consists almost completely of  foreshadowing to both the existing trilogy and what Lucas plans to do in episodes 2 and 3.  As such, this movie has fallen prey to a slew of bad press.  The people responsible for giving such negative media to the film have made a grievous error in judgement.  This movie should not be taken on its own as a film, but must be taken in context with its surrounding story line.  This movie was the action-packed opening chapter of the saga, much as A New Hope was in 1977.  Unfortunately such expectation has been heaped upon Menace that it could not possibly have delivered all that was desired.  By the release of the third episode, Menace will be respected in its rightful place of the opening sentences of the story, taking the first few steps toward a complex plot spanning a total of six movies.  If the critics today are berating the story as they are simply because the movie does not deliver all the answers, imagine how these same critics would have rated Empire. Then again, critics were never very adept at noticing or appreciating such complexities.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Exactly what I wanted to see.
","When the credits rolled the first time I saw The Phantom Menace, my first thought was it would be three long years before I got to see the next installment.  Now that installment is here, and it is everything I was waiting for.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  The acting was a wonderful improvement over its predecessor, and Hayden Christensen stole the show.  I was captivated by his portrayal of a man teetering on the edge.  But all the characters, not just Anakin, seemed more real this time around.  The story is much more emotionally charged in Attack of the Clones, and the film itself is an action movie, love story, whodunnit mystery and a story of deep personal conflict all rolled into one.  The special effects are fantastic, it being a Lucas joint and all, but what makes this film such a marked improvement over The Phantom Menace is that the storyline, not the CGI, really drives the film.  This movie offers something for everyone of all ages and is well worth the price admission (several times, at that).  Its only drawback is that now I have to wait ANOTHER three long years to find out how the whole story comes to a close.",9,0,0,22 May 2002
Cast Away," Amazing Depth
","If Russell Crow weren't so darn good in Gladiator Tom Hanks would be a three time Academy Award winner.  The performance he tendered in Cast Away was honestly better than the two that won him Oscars, especially when one considers his co-star for the majority of the film was a piece of sporting equipment.  This film amazed me from beginning to end.  For a couple of hours I because Chuck Noland.  What more could I ask from a movie?  I liked this film more than most of my friends, and I can certainly understand why it just wouldn't click with some people.  Cast Away is deeply psychological and personal, and it makes the viewer think as much about his or her own life as about the story line.  It is ultimately a story of hope and perseverance, not of one man but of the human race.  Now that it has left theaters I suggest watching this movie alone and free from distractions.  I hope it speaks to you the way it spoke to me.",10,0,0,4 April 2001
American Beauty," Thank you.
","This is it.  This is what cinema can be in its most beautiful and shining moments.  This is the goal, the apex of all film: to weave a story so real you become a character within it.  Forget all the blockbusters, the epics, the cinematic tours de force that have come before.  This film is a glimpse at what can be when everything about a movie is right.  It is beautiful and heartbreaking and terrifying.  This is the world we all live in captured in a little black plastic box with videotape spooled inside it.  I have never seen a movie like this before.  I will never see a movie like this again. It is one of the most beautiful stories I have been witness to.  I don't know if this movie will change my life, but that I must admit it might signifies that this movie has touched me as no other.  Every performance is perfect, every character is unerringly understandable, and every minute of it passes too quickly.  See this movie.  If you do not love it, I fear you might have lost the idea of what cinema is really all about.",10,0,0,15 May 2000
The Princess Bride," The most dramatic use of the word 'bitch' ever.
","This movie is a contradiction in terms.  By all rationality it should not be as popular as it is.  It is basically one cliche after another played out on some of the most obvious soundstages ever seen.  Somehow Rob Reiner has made one of the most popular and endearing fables of all time.  I still have not ruled out a pact with Satan.  Somehow though, it all works brilliantly. Cary Elwes' dry humor, Mandy Patinkin's delectable portrayal of a Spaniard, Andre the Giant's paradoxical boyish charm, and Wallace Shawn's immortal use of the word 'inconceivable' have made this the fairytale of the latter half of the 20th century.  As always Reiner relies on the innocence of childhood to win audiences as he plays out the plot within a plot of Peter Falk reading a young, sick Fred Savage a story in a moment of grandfatherly bonding.  Throw in a beautiful damsel in distress, an evil prince, a vow of revenge, a miracle man, a senile king, the greatest sword fight in cinematic history, incredibly large rodents, an abbot with a speech impediment, a holocaust cloak and a wheelbarrow, and you've got a movie that no one except those who have forgotten how to believe in fairies could dislike.  The fact that the dialogue is infection only adds to the addiction.  Yes, this is a ten.  Why?  My God I wish I could figure that out.",10,1,2,9 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," An exceptional war movie.
","This film is an exceptionally well done war movie.  It is perhaps the greatest of all time, although in my mind it is waging its own war with Apocalypse Now for that prestigious title.  It pulls no punches in its representation of the horrors of war.  I am certain that most movie aficionados have heard the stories of veteran flashbacks and emotional breakdowns caused by the film.  It is certainly the best portrayal of war in this decade.  It has even bested Braveheart's violence, a feat thought impossible three years ago.  The scene in which Private Mellish is killed by the German soldier chills me to this day.  It is indeed a fantastic war movie.  As a movie in general it is not quite as great.  It still is a wonderful tale with moving emotional content but I feel certain it was not robbed at the Academy Awards.  The characters seemed quite one-dimensional to me and the plot left something to be desired.  In the end this film did not approach the quality of Tom Hanks' two Oscar winning performances. And to risk missing the forest for the trees, I must say that the opening scenes of the storming of the beaches at Normandy almost made me feel sick.  This was not from the excessive gore, and that fact does trouble me somewhat, but instead from the camera work.  I understand that in this age of 'ER' popularity the 'messy camera' look has become incredibly popular.  In spite of this I think the excessive motion of the camera during this scene detracted from the film.  I found it difficult to concentrate throughout. Personally I thought the camera work during the battles in Braveheart were much more effective in conveying the mood of a battlefield.",8,0,0,9 May 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Intriguing Story for all Times and Cultures
","My ultimate measure of quality in a film is how understandable the psychology of the characters is. Ambiguously evil villains and infallible heroes make a story line boring at best and completely derail it at worst. Every character in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is thoroughly understandable and multi-dimensional, complete with desires and flaws. These characters are real people in complex situations and, although the setting and much of the action is highly fantastic, we can all relate to them. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon reaches across time and culture to take the viewer on deeply philosophical and spiritual journey. I was highly impressed with both the acting and the action of the film, truly a masterful accomplishment by director Ang Lee. I was also impressed on how egalitarian the characters seemed, with as strong a set of female characters as has been found in cinema in a long time. Everything about this movie is beautiful, wonderfully directed and choreographed so that the finished product is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone.",10,0,0,3 April 2001
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's Best.
","To lend myself to the cliche, Tarantino has revolutionized cinema.  Some praise him, some berate him, some despise him, and quite a few lose sight of what he has brought into the mainstream.  In this, his best work to date, Tarantino succeeds in telling one of the most realistic tales ever to find its way into theaters.  It is this realism that makes Tarantino so impressive a director.  While epics like Braveheart and Titanic concern themselves with the most noble points of human existence and morbid thrillers such as Se7en focus on the lowest depths of depravity, Pulp Fiction instead stays firmly in the middle ground of daily experience. The film has been criticized as glorifying violence and drug use.  Instead I feel this movie simply portrays such facets of society, and portrays them very similarly to the 'real world.'  Pulp Fiction, along with Tarantino's other films, is so captivating because the characters are so very human, more than a collection of catch phrases and a cool exterior.  Tarantino offsets this stark realism with offset chronology, drawing the audience in even further by making them fit the pieces of the plot together in their minds.  Granted, Tarantino was not the first to use the directorial techniques that make Pulp Fiction a fantastic story.  He did not use them first, but he has used them best.  He is so good at what he does that Pulp Fiction is a great movie despite his own acting.  That alone is worthy of an Oscar.",10,1,2,9 May 1999
Braveheart," An achievement in storytelling.
","This film is perhaps one of the most entertaining stories that Hollywood has produced to date.  It is of course completely historically inaccurate, though it is certainly not the only, nor the most recent, film to obscure historical truths and still be impressively well done.  Gibson does nothing new with this movie, as it is a classic blend of adventure, romance, morality, and comic relief.  What Gibson does do, however, is weave these aspects together with greater skill than most.  To compare this story to history is futile, as is comparing the Bard's tale of Julius Caesar to the actual occurrences in ancient Rome.  While based on historical events the purpose of this and any movie is to entertain.  Education, while a good and noble purpose, is not nor should it be the primary goal of the cinema. While Braveheart will not educate as to the events in medieval Scotland, it will indeed tell a tale that has been told the world over in a million variations.  Some call Braveheart laughable and trite and in some respects these critics are not wrong.  My counter to this argument is that all epics, from The Odyssey to Beowulf to the Lord of the Rings, are by nature laughable and trite.  The story of William Wallace as presented by Braveheart is not the story of the man who lived in Scotland centuries ago but the story of every epic hero.  As an epic, the story must invariably deal with and contain archetypes so broadly ranging that they must be described as laughable and trite.  That Braveheart is a very basic story, which I will admit, by no means qualifies it as a bad story.  Instead it is an epic story, and a very good one at that.",10,2,3,9 May 1999
