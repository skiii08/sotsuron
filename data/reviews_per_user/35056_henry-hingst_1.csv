The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I feel infinite
","It looks like another lying and silly American teenager high-school drama. All the typical characters are there. The cheerleaders, the football players, the weirdos and the nerds.But as it goes deep inside Charlie's (Logan Lerman) life, it gets more and more dark. I'm Brazilian and I really don't know how it is the life of young north-Americans, but that was the most realistic movie about the theme that I ever watched.Along with the problematics Patrick and his friend Sam - Ezra Miller and Emma Watson - Charlie, who is introspective and has no friends, finds a safe haven and is forced to confront the reality of his life and his mental issues. The slow soundtrack that includes The Smiths enhances the melancholy and makes everything more plausible, pushing away the clich√©.A great turnover on the script at the end of the movie connects all the points and makes you think about your own reality. After all, is it so cool to be normal?",8,0,0,8 July 2013
