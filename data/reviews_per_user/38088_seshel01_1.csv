The Blair Witch Project," Imagination is the key
","This is a film you either love or hate. The ones that didn't like it are the ones that have to let someone directly influence and interpret the film.This movie is for those of us that can get ourselves completely engrossed into it. If you didn't feel like you were there, you probably didn't like the movie. And plus, if you don't pay attention in the beginning, you may miss the meaning in the end. A lot of people hated the ending. Personally, it made me wonder, and left me feeling odd and detached, like I saw something I wasn't suppose to see. I still have questions; questions to ask those three people. They're the only ones that really know(and always will) what happened in the woods that weekend.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
