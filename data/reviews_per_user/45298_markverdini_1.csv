The Avengers," The Avengers Review spoiler free.
","OK so this is my first review I've done so sorry if it isn't grade A standard.I'll start off by saying before you see this movie make sure you watch the movies that lead up to The Avengers it doesn't take away from the experience but you'll get to know the characters better and add depth to them all. The 3-D nothing special maybe one part that did it well but other then that just your usual converted 3-D. The characters were good Tom Hiddleston (my opinion) out shines them all except for Robert Downey Jnr but maybe its because I'm a big fan of Robert and Mark Ruffalo performed well. There is some good comedy in there even during the final battle. One problem I had though was with Captain America suit, I know it's part of him and from the comics but I felt like I couldn't take him seriously and by the end of it Hulk didn't feel like Hulk I would explain but I feel like it would spoil things. That being said though I still enjoyed the movie. Please take into concern this is MY opinion don't take it seriously, people like different things. Thank you for your time.",8,1,4,25 April 2012
