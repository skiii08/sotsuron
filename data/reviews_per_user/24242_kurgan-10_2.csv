Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Okay sci-fi, toss-up as prequel, mediocre Star Wars
","*May Contain Spoilers* You've been warned...Not much I can add to what has already been said about this flick, but I'm going to throw in my three cents anyway. A few points I'd like to make after going through (no, not all) the past comments:1) The term 'immaculate conception' I have seen frequently misused when discussions of Anakin's mother come up relating to the film.First off all the term refers to being concieved immaculately, that is perfectly. It refers to the Roman Catholic doctrine of Mary, mother of Jesus, as being born WITHOUT the stain of original sin (that is preserved from sin through the grace of God from her conception).People are undoubtably confusing this with the Christian doctrine of the virgin birth (that Jesus Christ was born of Mary, who was a pure virgin).2) Jar Jar is pretty #@$(*# annoying. Yes, it needs to be said a billion more times. More than a blatant attempt to appeal to young children and sell dolls (several months ago I laughed at the huge glut of Jar Jar merchadise at Goodwill collecting dust).Jar Jar isn't like Chewbacca.. Chewie could kick ass, and at least he didn't have a pigeon language that made one cringe.Jar Jar isn't Salacious crumb.. Crumb wasn't in every scene of the movie he was in (Return of the Jedi) and he didn't say 'ex-squeeeeeeze me!' (gack.. Wayne's World?! How old is that line?!)Jar Jar is certainly not C3PO. C3PO was tolerable because he was the fish out of water. He was the British Butler trapped with the rough and tumble swashbucklers and cowboy rebels. He was the clever slave.. the stuckup snob. Yes, he had his moments of being stupid and annoying, and yes he did some good stuff. But the main thing is, he didn't act like a retarded person or a toddler 90% of the time like Jar Jar did. Plus, people told him to shut the @#$#@$ up and he did it! (or at least they shut him up).Jar Jar has got to be the worst character ever added to Star Wars.3) Midichlorians. Most fans I think just didn't like it. I'd compare it to the 'Planet Zeist' in Highlander II. If you're a HL fan, you'll know what I mean. ; p Personally, I could swallow it for the sake of the film, but it's a bit of a stretch given the context of the other films. I know, George Lucas can do no wrong, and they're his movies, blah blah blah...And I'm NOT saying all this just because I saw the original movies when I was young, or whatever other reason. The fact is that the only thing the Phantom Menace had going for it that the other movies didn't was 15+ years of hype, and a bigger budget for CG technology and such. I could level the same critique of a person who watches TPM first as they are growing up and they are going to complain that the other movies don't look as spectacular, etc. The flow of the movie was very different than the others too.I did enjoy the subtle intriuge of the future Emperor, and the final saber duel was great. The Pod Race was alright. The rest of the movie felt a bit forced, nice to look at, but not a lot to keep it going.The character work was somewhat off as well. I actually 'bought' Watto, but Jar Jar, no way, and I cringed when I heard the Nemodians 'talk' (couldn't they at least get the lips to move realistically to go with their foreign comic book accents??).Now, all that said, I rate the Star Wars movies in the following order, from greatest to least:1) Return of the Jedi (purest action, happy ending) 2) Empire Strikes Back (dark, I like the twists) 3) Star Wars (it's mostly backstory.. though it picks up speed towards the end) 4) Phantom Menace (great effects, not much else to say)As a Sci Fi film (apart from Star Wars) I thought it was okay. It had its ups and downs. However, I think that one should take into account that it's part one of a three part story (and then a part of a six part saga). However, that shouldn't be an excuse to ignore all of its flaws.So if all of that p***ed you off, repeat after me: 'It's only a movie.. on ly a movie.. only a movie...'",Null,0,1,24 February 2001
Blade," Fun escapist Horror/Action fare, based on a comic
","I had actually never heard of the comic that this movie is based on, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.'Blade' is set in the 'present' (1999) where a Vampire Hunter, the title character, is on a 'ridiculous crusade' to get revenge on the vampire underworld that killed his mother.Sporting black leather, a nifty pare of shades, a sword, and enough gadgets to make the Inspector proud, Wesley Snipes' action hero takes on nasty after nasty in a dark sinister world run by legions of the night. He really kicks butt!With excellent performances by the main characters, good visual effects, and plenty of mindless action and mood music, this dark action/horror flick is worth watching, as long as you don't mind non-stop swearing and bloodshed. The ending sequence is particularly cool.If you liked the movie, avoid the official 'soundtrack' at all costs, unless you're a hardcore rap fan, as the music is merely 'inspired by,' and only a couple of tracks (including the monotonous rave blood club theme) from the movie actually make it in. It's not worth it for a bunch of rap with Blade references thrown in seemingly at random.Back to the movie. It suffers from some hokey flaws, such as the fact that we're treated to a Dick Tracy-esque smattering of 'explanations' (ex: 'You're being injected with sodium nitrate.. garlic'). The audience is treated as stupid, with every technical (or semi-technical) term being explained or given another name. While this make sense in some respects as a character is being 'shown the ropes' it's a bit annoying with repeated viewings. The annoying bits of dialogue aside, the main bad guy has a certain affinity for overuse of the 'F' word, (much as Kevin Smith's 'Jay' in 'Dogma'), which really gets old fast.If you got sick of black leather/trenchcoats and designer sunglasses (no cell phones thankfully) in 'The Matrix' prepare for more of the same...Watch for a hilarious 'Japanese Rap' scene at a nightclub.There is a lot of gore towards the end, as is expected in modern 'vampire' movies.There are some 'sexual' scenes within the first few minutes of the film, but you don't see any exposed flesh (sex always detracts from these kinds of movies anyway, IMHO).I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It's exciting, it has great atmosphere, and it's fun to watch for the fight scenes alone.",Null,0,1,18 June 2000
