Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OK for kids, boring for adults
","I'm old enough to remember seeing 'Star Wars' back in 1977, and I loved the movie.  Like most kids my age, I also watched and enjoyed the sequels, although 'Return of the Jedi' was somewhat of a disappointment.  I eagerly awaited 1999's 'Phantom Menace', but it was a huge disappointment for me. Director/Writer George Lucas obviously intended this movie for children, and not for people my age.  The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, so Lucas probably feels he made the right decision.  However, I predict the final two sequels won't do as well financially unless Lucas concentrates more on a better story and tones down the special effects, which are wildly overdone in 'Phantom Menace'.  This movie has no soul or substance to it.  It's just flash and gimmicks.",Null,1,2,16 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An improvement over Episode 1
","Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones...whew, that's a long title. Anyway, it's an improvement over Episode I.  'Clones' has a more mature story than 'Phantom Menace' and interesting villians.  The much-maligned Jar Jar Binks has a reduced role, and a young man, not a kid, is the lead actor in the movie.  That bothered me about Episode I.  Negatives: I still think George Lucas relies too much on computer- generated special effects and doesn't concentrate enough on developing his characters.  IMO, none of the main characters in Episode 1 or 2 are as interesting as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or even Princess Leia.  I hope 'Attack of the Clones' is released to DVD sooner than was the case with 'Phantom Menace.'",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
