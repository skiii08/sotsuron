Minority Report," One of the best Science Fiction movies I have even seen
","I got swept away. What a movie! Filming techniques were absolutely stunning. Has Spielberg seen some of the danish Dogma movies? Looks like as some scenes were shot with handheld camera. And the plot! Amazing. After 1½ hour I thought well were are coming to an end, but no Spielberg/Cruise take us on a fantastic ride to the end. It´s a 10, no doubt!",10,0,0,20 August 2002
