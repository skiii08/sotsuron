Walk the Line," A First Class Biopic
","The great challenge with any biopic is to give some dimension to real characters rather than to simply join the dots of their lives. In WTL both Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver masterful performances, that absorb you totally into the story of Johnny Cash's and June Carter's lives. What makes this film so special though is that they do this both musically and with their acting.Witherspoon is simply mesmerising in what may be the performance of her career.Inevitably when a substantial number of years are crammed into one film, a lot of generalising takes place, and you are left to wonder how much has really been revealed (for example the Cash's relationship with his first wife - it went on too long to be all turmoil).The only shortcoming for me was that some of the actors playing bit parts as big time stars of the 50s and 60s don't come across that well, but they are secondary to the main story.In all a captivating film that will appeal to all music lovers of the period, even if country music 'aint your thang'. I know I'll be buying my own copy.",9,1,2,5 January 2007
