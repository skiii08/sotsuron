Deja Vu," a quality suspenseful 2 hours
","This movie was a major surprise! I hadn't heard of it when I watched it with about 30 people & I noticed of those around me, that the sense of suspense I was impressed by, was seemingly much broader appreciated, as you could have heard a pin drop, & looking around twice, I noticed every eye was engaged on the evolving plot of cleverness but delicacy on the screen! Time & again, I didn't see how the plot was about to unravel! I doubt it could succeed. But I was pleasantly surprised, time & again. It did! It did succeed! My only reservations being the flawed improbabilities of the car chase scenes. All I can say is that a 10+ movie in my eyes, became a 10/10.I looked at the protagonist gazing at the images of the past projected before his eyes. He was questioning, even sceptical. But he kept churning through the possibilities into impossibilities! So did the car seller amidst her innocent emerging predicament of trauma into tragedy! And potentially, much more tragedy! Hero & heroine, beckoning, but not without individual flaws! So surely realistic. But evolving into their transformed existences of abstract suspicion but not total distrust, that would have served the interests of powerful interests that covered up most of their conglomerate dealings to their fullest intent of deception, into more deceit & injustice! I was impressed by the time travel aspects presented but acknowledging its shortcomings! I didn't see how it might be sufficiently drawn together, but it was! At least to my satisfaction.A night at the movies I thought would be without much merit, but turned out to be a masterpiece!Personally, I thought it was the superb drama of 'Three Days of the Condor' updated 25 years! My only reservation being, that I would have given 'Three Days of the Condor' 10+ that I cannot give this!",10,8,15,10 August 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," a rewarding journey
","I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking & well-made movie. It successfully beckoned this adult viewer on a journey into the imagination & a world of fantasy. It has a great amount of relevance to the modern issues of child & adult alike. It was dramatic & absorbing in its unfolding story. Thereby appealing to young viewers, but too, held more complex messages for older viewers of any age. It works well on multiple levels, appealing to different kinds of viewers & their personal lives & concerns.It was also so true to life with the youngest of the children being the one whose concerns were initially overridden & derided. But too, it was this girl who actually was most open to the whole adventure that was about to engulf all their lives. How true of the nature of so many family & school situations, where such young minds are not appreciated or taken seriously or unjustly crushed, in our logical but deceptive world of experts, all bringing their common weight of superiority to dismiss any alternative thought, especially in a younger child.Yet this innocent girl is the one who finds this world & its curiousities joys & terrors more quickly & fully, while the older children are still struggling to look beyond their sense of self-importance. Isn't this so true of human nature in general? Especially in the modern adult world where any minority belief is mostly harshly scrutinised & criticised & dismissed. This movie offers a gentle message that the imagination & individual creative thought can be encouraged in us all. As surely as each of these children is duly given special gifts & talents that may help their individual personalities, & each other, even their broader community.The character of the God-like hero of a lion, covering for his kingdom & its constituents, is most thoughtful & impressive. A wise leader who literally serves his kingdom, as the best of leaders do! Also impressive were the use of special effects & magnificent scenery, with intriguing creatures & beautiful colourful costumes.All in all, those who take this journey to Narnia with an open mind & heart, will be rewarded for whatever gifts & sense of wonder that they bring to this very enjoyable & effective movie.",10,3,3,12 July 2006
Alexander," Alexander THE GREAT as portrayed
","This was an extremely appealing movie to me from beginning to end! I thought it was set up for the ensuing war sequences with precision, and did not shy away from the abhorrence of war. I was reminded on several occasions of the barbarity of war through the ages, where human beings are today being too often reduced to some nett gain on a balance sheet of detachment that would only appeal to powermongers and their spin doctors.But Alexander is much more than a war movie! It is FULL of inspiration and concern for the humanity of portrayed victims. as too of the treachery and appalling gross injustice of those who may outlive them! By my knowledge of history, this movie has been well researched, but more importantly, is presented with compassion & an imaginative vision that has prevailed across time & place into the essence of what is good or idealistic. As such, it is untainted by the darker aspects of its presentation, merely giving the viewer a glimpse of what is desirable and what is not! On the first hour of Alexander, I would have rated it a 10+, but I thought it slightly got lost in the middle with numerous time period shifts forward and backward, before it settled down to a deserved rating of 10. Highly recommended!",10,1,10,11 December 2005
Sleepy Hollow," lingering for more from 'Sleepy Hollow'
","I think this is a strong dramatic movie that is worthy of much thought, that the collective efforts of actors & contributors behind the scene, have combined to produce into a quality movie.It is suspenseful, & in that regard, it reminded me of a masterpiece over a decade before, that I chanced upon & that seemed to be unheralded by movie critics. 'Jamaica Inn' was a quality production of British suspense & drama & with substance & thoughtful plot, resulted in a complete product that lingered! Till this one several years later! This too, is much admired. I thought enough of it to want it in my collection! The same eerie lingering possibilities. Much more popularist in style but very similar if not original, in substance.The cast of the likes of Johnny Depp & Michael Gambon, are impressive in their roles, & appropriate to the evolving drama. But there are unanswered questions ... like why does the 'headless horseman' fail to claim the hero when he might have claimed him without mercy, while similarly claiming another victim? If not earlier, when hooves thunder in from a distance! This is still early on! But maybe it is the intention of the production team here, to present that good & evil are so delicately poised, in ongoing battle. Only the scales are shifted in favour of the good & the fair & the just, layered by circumstance & individual contribution.But despite such flaws or perceived deficiencies, real or imagined, it is presented to the viewer as a quality piece that I felt intrigued enough to watch a second time, & enjoyed this experience much more so than the first.So give way to your intrigue & let its suspense overtake you with each approaching hoof beat & shadow that may be threatening in the darkness from a distance. But maybe it a positive. Let its simplicity & investigation engulf you with drama & curiosity, that reveals much, with its child-like trance of delight, slowly unraveling.It may not leave you fully satisfied, but you will be left lingering for more from 'Sleepy Hollow'.",8,1,2,1 August 2007
Batman Begins," batman surprises
","I thought this movie would not appeal to me much, For I was not much into Batman & Robin, from its serial days. I always felt it was a potentially great concept that failed miserably in its fakeness among amateurish 'pow' 'wow' comic strip antics of the most basic kinds of sensationalism without substance. Its plots were largely pathetic & its offerings were mostly plastic! Zorro, Superman, Robin Hood & such as the Count of Monte Christo & such adventures of precision were much more endearing & enduring to me! But in this 'Batman Begins' atmosphere, situations are well built in this impressive production.The child into youth evolving into a Batman superhero, is credibly developed in his circumstances beyond his control or will. The fears & the experiences of the young 'bat boy' echo into his head & his being! His heart & soul are crushed, yet prevailing evermore into something greater! This is a quality production, that seems to have evolved with much wisdom & insight & empathy, from producers & cast & crew committed to their enterprise.'Batman Begins' is suspenseful & entertaining & gripping! It binds the heart & soul & mind of the viewer, into its concept & dimensions of fairness & justice & integrity.What more can a quality movie hope to do?",10,2,4,20 April 2007
Wedding Crashers," style before substance
","A predictable comedy that rates between 5 & 6 by my reckoning, though my pair of companions considered it more highly. As I watched it, I thought of what Hollywood was descending into, with mostly movies of special effects & no plot! FAR from the great era of movies of the era that Cecil B. De Mille & his ilk painstakingly engineering productions with MASSIVE contributions of their acting cast, hailed & famous, or unknown & mostly unappreciated in their seemingly trivial roles.But of course, in a comedy of this type, there's no expectation or place for special effects & plot, for it is inane entertainment, made only for the night you have nothing to do. Take an actor imitating any number of Robert Redford performances & an imitation Meg Ryan, as partner in deception. Polish it with the worst of Americanism. Throw in an imitation Max Von Sydow & a cross between Arnold 'Terminator' seeking to present as a Billy Joel & other forgettable fraudulent performances like the horny would-be mother-in-law & you've got the underlying motive of supposedly popular appeal this offering seeks to inflict upon its viewers. Come to think of it, maybe I could have rated it below 5 out of 10. Nice settings & occasionally humorous contributions don't deserved this, but it's mostly messaged to be expected several minutes before it arrives.Probably best watched when you have had a few wines or beers & are seeking a meaningless encounter with the world you are seeking to keep at bay, or when the movie is just to be a harmless diversion in appropriate company you wish to set an optimistic & romantic atmosphere for. Your relationship, however trivial, will surely be of greater substance than this. As such, you may not be disappointed.",5,1,3,30 March 2006
August Rush," an orchestra of intuition awaits you
","I headed off to see a movie last night & it turned out to be this 'August Rush' I had never heard of! It turned out to be to watch a masterpiece of intuition that would appeal to the sensibilities of a truly romantic heart & soulful spirit! I thought it was going to be an 'Oliver' updated story early ... and it does have similarities to 'Mr Holland's Opus' at times ... and it does jump around ... but it comes together like a jigsaw puzzle! As to be expected, it's a bit predictable at times, but it is a movie with a beautiful heart it dips into at times, with magnificent musical blending that weave into the philosophy & wisdom & lives of its emerging characters! ... And their heartful unspoken wishes of heart & soul! ... As I have noted to be found as particularly significant times in life! ... like moments of romantic bliss ... like moments of immense & heart-breaking grief ... like moments of searching for something you cannot easily express ... or don't fully understand ... that may be dream or hope or foolishness in the eyes some others cannot understand! It's all here to enrich your heart & spirit!!! ... !!! A little contrived & unlikely in how it emerges but in so doing, it encourages the viewer into a sense & hope of intuition!!! In my own case, I found further proof of such experiences I have occasionally been enriched & privileged to receive at key moments in my life!!! ... even when a song came on the radio as I began to drive home afterwards, it seemed PERFECTLY appropriate that the song was one I liked better instantly ... with lyrics 'when you get caught between the moon and New York city, best that you can do, is fall in love!' ... I think I'll always like this song better for this coincidence in the eyes of some! ... As for the movie I rate it ... !!!!!!!!!!+",10,2,3,13 August 2008
The Island," a fine look at reality, as well as into the past & future
","I saw this movie despite a respected critic panning it. What I found was a wonderful but somewhat frightening world presented, remarkably like our own real-world existence. Where liars & cheats have often taken up the highest positions of power & prestige, yet seem to often have their power & prestige by deception of those around them. They mislead & deprive the broader populace with remarkable success thanks to their treachery & the trust of others loyal or indifferent, that they exploit. They are aided in their quest by the apathy of the broader world's peoples, individually indifferent to the plight or suffering of others, as long as they are not personally suffering.Yet as this thoughtful movie production presents, the world at large is, time & again unexpectedly the victim of its own misplaced trust. Mostly with no time or opportunity to complain or correct or communicate their suffering, without tragedy or death that may be nothing to do with the victims themselves. As such, it is a reminder of holocaust type worlds in history, of wars fought in the name of unjust causes & propaganda nothing to do with the reality of situations they claim to speak of with such words as 'freedom'.The Island, as presented in the movie is indeed a Utopian concept, but one that is merely an illusion to defraud, both the clones in their netherworld & those who think they have bought their freedom to extended life in their material world of the rich & privileged. As such, it typified too the modern world of science in mindless experiments, at suffering to victims that they are apathetic of. Yet too, the governments & churches of this world, Christian or otherwise, each often have their own agendas far from the good of the broader populace they claim to represent or fight for.As such, the police can be an enemy of a multinational-type corporation who claim to represent its clients, yet this company considers itself free to spy on or exterminate even clients, paying lip service to truth & justice along the way, merely giving its victims a false but temporary sense of security. They have tools to make themselves look like police with interchangeable labels & highly coordinated operations benefiting no one but themselves. They have uniforms & powers to control or operate to kill by such hierarchy of authority, while they exploit & abuse the trust of those that obey them. By contrast, they betray & kill without conscience. Their view of the ultimate evil in a human victim is to 'question'. So finally, by a worldly voice who dares to help the protagonists, the simple but sad reality of his message is 'Trust no one!' While at times, this movie is a little far-fetched in some of its action sequences, it has so much going for it in its modern day 'David & Goliath' style battle for justice & truth & integrity against all odds! Look past its minor flaws & dare to look into a bleak world that is sadly very close to reality of today, then go back to the world around you with your eyes open, to its dangers on the one hand, to love & trust & friendship & justice on the other.",9,3,5,31 January 2006
