Howl's Moving Castle," One of the Best Movies Ever!
","Another great movie from a great director - Hayao Miyazaki. In his usual aesthetically pleasing fashion, he conjures a fantasy realm beyond the viewer's wildest beliefs, and he somehow manages to shoehorn this majesty onto a single DVD! I liked the chemistry between Howl and Sophie, which is one of the central elements to this story; at first, Howl is fussy about his appearance, and he makes Sophie cry when they have the argument. Eventually, though, Howl learns to cope with his altered appearance, and he and Sophie develop a relationship with each other. It is a storyline that is almost like Beauty and the Beast in a sense; in both instances, you have the man in the relationship who has been 'dehumanized' or turned into a monster, while you have the woman who wants to bring out the man trapped inside the monster. Some of the other characters, like Calcifer and Turnip Head, provide plenty of comic relief in this film, which further helps to engage the viewer. A must-see for any fan of animation, Hayao Miyazaki, fantasy, steampunk, or anyone who is a fan of great cinema.",10,1,2,17 April 2015
American Sniper," Best Movie of 2014, and it should have won more awards!
","Why are so many people complaining about this movie? I saw this movie with a friend in the movie theater, and I found it to be an engaging movie. It is about a man who decides to fight for what is right and to help his fellow men in the heat of battle (whether or not the Iraq War is justifiable is a moot point here, and is thus irrelevant, for this is not a movie that is intended to be preachy, but rather one that dissects life from the point-of-view of Chris Kyle). I am personally against the Iraq War, but I still loved this movie, and I still have a very healthy respect for those who fought in that bloody conflict! 'Based on a true story' movies are usually not my cup of tea, either, but I still loved this movie. More movies should be like this.",9,5,8,27 June 2015
Jurassic World," Not quite as good as the original, but still awesome
","I watched this in theaters this month with friends and family, and I was endlessly captivated by this movie. Even though it was not quite as 'original' as the 1993 classic, 'Jurassic World' still has a lot of action and suspense. I especially liked the part at the end where the Velociraptor, the T. Rex, and the Mosasaurus unite against the Indominus Rex, especially since, throughout the movie, one gets the illusion that the Indominus Rex is an unstoppable killing machine. I thought that they would have to go nuclear to kill the Indominus Rex! There are also homages to the original movies throughout the movie as well, like the animated DNA guy used in the original 1993 'Jurassic Park', as well as the 1992 Jeeps that are used in the movie! I highly recommend this movie for the action, suspense, and killer dinosaurs!",8,0,6,27 June 2015
Castle in the Sky," One of the Best Movies of Any Kind - EVER!
","A perfect 10 out of 10! Laputa is such a magical movie that I would have to rank it alongside the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 version), Beauty and the Beast, and Jurassic Park in terms of the best movies ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is an artistic genius. Laputa has an engaging plot, likable characters, aesthetically pleasing art, and a good balance of adventure and comic relief. Colonel Mushka makes for a great villain to watch on screen. Most importantly, there are also philosophical, ethical, and social messages behind the art, action, and adventure. It shows how militarism can ruin the beauty of the world. It shows how a madman seeking power places everybody in danger. To quote Sheeta in the movie, 'No matter how advanced your technology is, no matter how powerful your weapons are, the world cannot live without love.'",10,2,3,17 April 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best Movie Ever, Bar None
","The entire Lord of the Rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. This whole trilogy was the reason why I became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. I remember seeing The Two Towers and The Return of the King when they were respectively being released in theaters. Both of the movies blew me away. They were unlike anything I had ever seen in my life. This was a driving force to me, because now I wanted to read not only the Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien books, but also the R. A. Salvatore and Dark Sun World books. This was such an influential movie to me, and I hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. Good acting, epic battle scenes, convincing dialogue, well-done settings, and an awesome story all comprise the entire LOTR trilogy. I say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre, first baptized by Lord of the Rings!",10,2,5,24 January 2015
