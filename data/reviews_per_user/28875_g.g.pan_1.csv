Requiem for a Dream," Makes TRAINSPOTTING look like a Disney film.
","This film has some incredible performances, including an Oscar worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn, incredibly rich cinematography (and a bold visual style), AND an amazing soundtrack. But man is it depressing. It's almost physically exausting to watch. It makes TRAINSPOTTING look like a Disney movie. It's like being trapped on a slow boat to Hell, without a good reason to be there. If you have to see this film, have a cocktail first, you're gonna need it.",Null,1,1,17 October 2000
