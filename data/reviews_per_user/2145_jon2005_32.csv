Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible III
","Once again the Mission: Impossible franchise has got a new director, this time TV director JJ Abrams, and it has only improved matters. I've never been a huge fan of the second film, but love the first, especially as it really feels like a spy film  there's barely a shot fired throughout and it requires some effort of thought. What I don't like about the second film is the lack of a team, or at least a team that has some proper role instead of sitting on the sidelines.This, fortunately, is one of the many things about the new Mission: Impossible that has been fixed. It has also been given a more human element  this time Ethan Hunt has a fiancé, and we get to see the non-IMF side of the character. Granted, these scenes are not numerous but they come in mostly later into the film, and it is a part of the franchise that thus far had been missing. Better still, JJ Abrams shows himself to be a very competent action director, and gives us some scenes that rank amongst the series' best. Particularly stunning is an air vs. ground assault set on a bridge, where Hunt and his team must fight off a plane and a helicopter full of troops from the ground. The cast all excel themselves as well. Tom Cruise is as excellent as ever, showing both the spy side and the gentleman side of his character with conviction. Also good are Hunts' team (comprising, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who have more to do this time round and are always on hand to back Ethan up. There's also a scene stealing Simon Pegg, who plays the office computer geek, and adds plenty of fine humour to proceedings. The standout has to be Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, Owen Davian. He is genuinely creepy and utterly ruthless; when he threatens Hunt's fiancé, we feel like he really means it  he is definitely one of the more memorable villains we have seen for a long time. Another bonus is the relation to the title. Unlike the first two films, this one really does seem like an impossible mission  Davian is always one step ahead, and even when you think things are heading in IMF's favour they're not. It makes you wonder just how they're going to succeed when they are up against such odds, and keeps the tension high.There are, however, some niggles which after a while begin to really bug the viewer. First up is the camera, which utilises the increasingly popular 'shaky cam'. This is OK to an extent, if used clever and liberally, but the whole film seems shot with it, even the more dramatic scenes, which could really do with a more static camera. It's a problem because it becomes very noticeable, and thus infuriating. It also means the action scenes can at times look muddled, which is a shame because they really are good. The locations, spanning Rome, Shanghai, and Berlin, are exciting but don't serve the story  each sequence could be substituted for anywhere else with no loss to the overall plot, and this seems odd. Why set a scene in the Vatican when it is really unnecessary?My final negative is the introduction scene. I won't give anything away, but it's one of those 'flash forward' scenes that show you what is coming up. It is annoying because the viewer is left waiting for that scene to come around. All scenes such as this annoy me though, so it's down to personal taste.I still can't decide whether it is the best of the trilogy or not. Whilst the action is great, it feels so distant from what Mission: Impossible used to be that it is more of a generic action film than a true spy film. It is a good film, and shows us what is possible from the franchise, but it's not quite there yet. Hopefully, if there is a number 4, it will get it all right.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,1,2,24 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin
","Lucky Number Slevin has a cast to die for. It has not just A-list actors, but good A-list actors who are all at the top of their game. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect great things from them. For the most part this is a very accomplished thriller, but it just lacks that extra something to go the extra mile.It could actually be the cast themselves. Josh Hartnett is good in the title role of Slevin, a man from out of town who, after an episode of mistaken identities, finds himself under pressure to pay a lot of money to two rival kingpins. However, the other cast members  Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, even Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley  feel like they're operating on autopilot. They never seem to be stretching themselves to deliver something truly great.Part of this also stems form the dialogue; you can tell that this wants to be a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film with sharp dialogue and witty pop-culture references. It doesn't work as well as it should though (although I do find that even Tarantino can start to sound pretentious after a point), and a lot of the dialogue feels forced, although it's clearly meant to be smooth and sound natural.It really isn't all bad though. These negative points are actually relatively small, all things considered, and don't ruin the enjoyment of the film; they are more niggles than outright irritants. The film is actually very stylish, and its retro-70s look does wonders as it gives the film a fresh feel, certainly making it stand out from the usual run-of-the-mill thrillers. Also Lucy Liu is brilliant as the only innocent character present, whose riffs with Slevin are fun and gives the film a certain lightness to it; a real bonus as it is otherwise a very cold film.As with many films of this kind, we know everything will not be as it seems to be, and Lucky Number Slevin is no exception. Its inevitable plot twist feels a little contrived  it's not nearly as clever as it likes to think it is  and the payoff is not as worthy as we deserve by this point, but it is the journey that matters most and it is, for the most part, very enjoyable. However, one cannot help but feel that, with the presence of such a great cast that could have been made of this  it seems to be trying too hard to impress, rather than being a lot more natural and trust in the quality of the actors it's got.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,5,15,22 May 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead
","This great comedy, amusingly described by the poster as 'a romantic comedy. With zombies', comes courtesy of the crew who also gave us the excellent TV series Spaced. To be honest, the film can feel like a TV episode that has been stretched out, and this would probably be a problem if the film wasn't so damned funny! It may be low-budget, but this is a film which is to be watched for the gags, almost as if the zombies were mere coincidence in the story. With the simple premise that Shaun is a loser who is virtually a zombie stumbling through his life and who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, suddenly finds himself the only one capable of saving his (few) friends when zombies take over. There's a fantastic scene where Shaun is walking to the local shop and back, whilst in the background you see the zombies taking over, all the while without Shaun noticing. It's simple, yet remarkably effective. The story is all in the writing, and it certainly shows. Shaun's first reaction to seeing a zombie is priceless ('Oh my god she's so drunk!'), and his best friend Ed (Nick Frost) is definitely worth a mention as the only person who is more of a loser in life than Shaun. The film does begin to stall whenever they attempt a 'serious' bit, but the jokes are flowing like the beer in the Winchester Pub they are trying to reach. It's not a particularly gory film, only in one scene towards the end does it get a bit bloody, but the film succeeds so well because it proves that it doesn't have to be gory to get attention. This one is definitely worth a few viewings  you will not be disappointed. Rated: 8.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9,2,5,22 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","When Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was released in the summer of 2003, it was a breath of fresh air in the world of blockbusters, managing to be light-hearted and fun, whilst adding a touch of horror and buckets of humour. Unfortunately, Dead Man's Chest has taken the route of many sequels; disguise the fact that it is not fresh anymore by making it look prettier. And that is probably the best way to sum Dead Man's Chest. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not as good as the first.Most of the cast have returned, and this is actually one of the films' problems. At the end of the first film the cast had all separated, and so the sequel needs to find ways to bring them all back together again, and this results in a plodding first half hour which mounts up as episodic and badly thought through plot devices. Even Commodore Norrington returns, and his entrance and role in the film, whilst is interesting in its own way, is (at least for the moment) needless. Also needless are the return of Ragetti and Pintel as the (unnecessary, given the fact that Jack Sparrow is the source of all the humour) comic relief, who really aren't that comic at all.The point about Norrington brings up the next big fault. As it is the first part of the two sequel story, Dead Man's Chest is not a film that can stand up on its own; it is only half a story. This may mean that come May 2007, all the various plot points will make sense, but at the moment they are all too far-stretched to makes a whole lot of sense. There are also really too many different plot strands to last its two and a half hour running time (which is itself about half an hour too long).There are good points about the film, of course. The effects are nothing short of staggering (although some of the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman are not quite as good as the rest), especially Bill Nighy's Davy Jones who has a multi-tentacled beard. Nighy himself is good in the role, but Davy Jones never seems as menacing or, quite frankly, as good as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. Also good is Stellan Skarsgård as Bootstrap Bill, Will Turner's father. Will is a little darker but Orlando Bloom lacks the gravitas to pull off such a character turn. Knightley's Elizabeth Swann is also different, showing a more pirate side to her actions, at least making her a little more exciting even if Knightley herself doesn't entirely convince.The star is once again Depp's Jack Sparrow; even though, like the whole film itself, his act is not as fresh, he is given enough to work with so that most of the humour he creates lands well. His entrance is another classic moment, and his ability to run away as well as he can swagger is often hilarious  he even manages to build on his role from the first film.There is plenty of action, and although it can be thrilling, it feels a little too over-the-top to truly impress at times. However, much of it is well handled, and injects a little more fun into proceedings, just when the audience begins to think that the film has begun to take itself too seriously to be fully enjoyable. It is now down to film number three to see whether the franchise is strong enough to stay afloat; the last ten minutes of Dead Man's Chest has three plot twists that at least will make us come back for the answers next summer. Overall, whilst it is enjoyable enough, it is certainly not a patch on the first, and the third entry in the series has a lot of work to do to restore audience faith in it.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,3,5,15 July 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Ice Age: The Meltdown
","The sequel to 2002's Ice Age has managed to recapture the magic of the first film, whilst beating off most recent efforts into CGI films that didn't come from Pixar. This time around the three friends Manny, Sid, and Diego must join their newly formed herd to escape the valley they are living in, as the ice is beginning to melt, and threatens to flood the valley.Like last time, there is no grand plot here (the first being based on another journey, this time to return a child to its family), and it merely serves to introduce new characters and create laugh-out-loud situations for the trio to overcome. Of the new characters, all are competent (Queen Latifah's Mammoth-Possum-wannabe is good) but never take the lime-light away from our original heroes, which is as it should be; although I did particularly like Will Arnett's Lone Gunslinger Vulture, a rather apocalyptic vulture. All the personalities are back, as is the bickering between them  slightly more playful than last time.Some standout scenes include Sid's initiation into a tribe of fellow Sloth's, and the origins of whack-a-mole with the possums  all the episodes are loosely connected by a plot which is there to serve for convenience, but this doesn't matter as the film is inventive enough to look past structural failings and just enjoy it. It has increased the fear factor somewhat  the group have to evade two nasty looking sea creatures that have been thawed out by the melting ice, and these scenes, although thrilling, can be scary for younger viewers.Ice Age: The Meltdown keeps its individual style of animation; at times crossing between its general cartoon-look and then throwing in some genuinely brilliant effects  the underwater shots in particular, and also the effect of the animal's fur after they leave the water are very nice. But it's through the cartoonish style that Ice Age: The Meltdown manages to keep its charm, and there is plenty to go around.Finally, Scrat is back trying to get his acorns. Used in the first film as more of an advertising ploy, Scrat gets much more screen time in the sequel, as his quest to retrieve his precious acorn against insurmountable odds creates situations that get progressively more hilarious as the film goes on, and provides many of the films true laugh-out-loud moments. At 90 minutes the film is trim and so doesn't outstay its welcome, knowing when enough is enough to keep it all fresh. It's a wonderful sequel that all ages should enjoy.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8,6,6,22 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2
","No one can deny that 2002's Spider-Man was excellent. It had everything that was required for a top superhero film  great characters, great script, great action and great effects. The story of the all-too-human Peter Parker who, because of a freak accident (aren't they all?!) became Spider-Man, and after the death of his uncle decides to heed his advice and fulfil his responsibility to protect people with his new-found powers. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up to mess things up, but it all worked out (reasonably) well in the end.To write a synopsis for the sequel, I could just settle for 'see above'. The story behind this film is pretty much the same as the original, but then again when the result is this good, a 'more of the same' attitude is not necessarily a bad thing. There are obviously going to be some changes, and this time Peter begins to lose his powers instead of gaining them. This gives a nice little twist to the story, and also provides most of the films lighter moments (Spider-Man taking the lift to get down from a building), and throughout this shows how comfortable director Sam Raimi is with his source material. Also fully present and correct is the good-hearted scientist who, because of an experiment gone wrong, becomes a mad bad-guy. However Alfred Molina must be given credit, as he is a much better villain than the Green Goblin was (and not a stupid mask in sight!), giving the right amount of menace to the film; he almost steals the show from right under Tobey Maguire's web. The rest of the cast are also excellent, their characters evolving just as you would expect them to after the first film.However, unfortunately it cannot be said that the sequel is actually better than the original; it is clearly its equal, even though has better acting, better effects and a better villain. The problem comes slap-bang in the middle of the film, just after Peter has decided to give up being Spider-Man and start his life afresh. The set up becomes repetitive  his powers fail him in exactly the same way (in mid-air) a total of four times. He even goes into a burning building just like last time to save a kid; though this time he is without his powers. Once he gives up his responsibilities, the film seems to dip into some kind of soap, with Peter trying to win Mary-Jane back. This results in some quite trite dialogue, and the whole act is far too long, prompting the audience to have doubts as to where this is all going.But it is all saved by a relentless final act, where Spider-Man realises he has to do what he does, and goes to kick some ass. And does he! The action scenes beat the originals' hands-down, and special mention must go to the showdown on the train, which is accelerating out of control. They are expertly shot and edited, giving any other film of 2004 a run for its money in the excitement stakes. It's non-stop pace is just what the film needs after the slow middle section, and it clearly shows that this franchise is definitely going somewhere great. If only that middle had a little more attention paid to it, then this could have quite possibly been a 10. However because of this, and it's 'more of the same' feel, no matter how good it might be, just puts the top score out of reach.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9,8,11,22 May 2006
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz
","With Shaun of the Dead, the Edgar Wright-Simon Pegg team created a wonderfully funny fantasy that was universally loved. The big question was, could they follow it up with another hit? And the answer is: of course they can. Hot Fuzz is extremely witty and action packed, and although it may not be quite as high as Shaun of the Dead in the realms of action-comedy, it is certainly not far off.This time around Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, the antithesis of Shaun; a London policeman that is so good at his job it makes everyone else look bad. Because of this, his superiors decide to relocate him to the village of Sandford in Somerset. There he meets the bumbling but well-meaning Danny (Frost), and after a series of accidents, soon begins to suspect that the village is hiding something. As always, the humour is in the writing instead of just in visual gags and, like Shaun, it is very well written. However, the buck has passed from Simon Pegg onto Nicholas Frost  this is because Angel is such a serious, straight-faced guy that the humour relies on other people to play off him, rather than let him be part of it. But Frost succeeds admirably, proving himself as a vital member of the creative trio. Danny is naïve but constantly trying to prove himself, his good nature often conflicting with Angel; he is always asking about the city life: 'Have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?' he asks. 'No' deadpans Angel. 'Have you ever fired one gun whilst jumping through the air?' As such, Pegg has little to do other than be the butt of the jokes but, like any good buddy film, he lightens up soon enough to get back to the Pegg we all recognise. The action scenes are well handled in the capable hands of Edgar Wright, but they do lack the sophistication of the best action films that really make you want to be there shooting the hell out of stuff along side the good guys. Also, when the action kicks in towards the end, the comedy gets sidelined, the laughter stemming from the extremes of action violence rather than the clever writing, and this makes the tone feel slightly uneven, the film unable to balance all its elements as effectively as we would hope.Still, the reason why Hot Fuzz is so much better than most other parodies/homages is because it doesn't need to drill in any aspect of its references. Whilst it openly refers to action film such as Bad Boys II and Point Break (Danny shows these films to Angel during the film), the cleverness results in not heavy-handedly referencing its sources, instead making them a more subtle 'guess-the-movie' style of parody (notice the Tony Scott editing style during the processing of arresting youths, for example). Some fine cameos from some of our best comedians and TV stars, along with a great pantomime performance from Timothy Dalton as the obvious bad guy, adds to the mix with great charm, and along with some great set pieces will ensure that Hot Fuzz, although not quite as creative as Shaun of the Dead, will still become one of the finest comedies of recent times.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8,1,3,4 April 2007
Troy," Troy
","The arrival of Troy heralded slightly unfair expectations  all the critics expected it to be just like Gladiator. But why? They are not the same. Let's get this cleared up right now  they're not set in the same period, the same country, nor are they about a similar topic. One is about a war, the other a personal vendetta. One is made up, the other is based on stories told over 3,000 years ago. In fact, one could almost say that the only things they have in common are sandals and swords. Oh, and remarkably everyone speaks English. Which is helpful.Troy is a much more epic film than Gladiator, and this clearly shows in its impressive production values, whether it's the awesome sight of the 1,000 ships sailing across the Aegean Sea, or the brutal battle scenes  everything looks right. However, whilst this is all well and good, the problems stem from the source material itself.The credits claim the film was 'inspired by The Iliad', and here is the first problem. The film is historically inaccurate, and this is most obvious towards the end. The Iliad is the story of Achilles, and does not involve the infamous Wooden Horse, or even the sack of Troy. These are covered in later epics The Odyssey and Virgil's The Aeneid. It's as if the director never read these works, and made up the rest of the story as he went along. Not that it makes too much difference to the story, but those familiar with the epics will feel cheated. Also the motives for the war, whilst they made absolute sense in the society in which the stories were first told, don't hold true anymore. In the epics the stories were concerned with heroes, honour and love. That this war was started because Paris stole someone else's girl just doesn't sit well with a modern audience, and so they cannot relate to these heroes. It doesn't help with the fact that the audience doesn't know which side they should be rooting for  there are in the epics no real 'goodies' and 'baddies', merely two nations each with their own heroes. The director has to take time every now and again to reiterate the reasons for the war, that of Paris' love for Helen, but tries to give a more believable reason by giving Brian Cox's character of Agamemnon a more imperialistic bent, deviating further from his source.I've managed to make Troy seem like a disaster, but it is in fact far from it. If the audience can just accept the reasons for the war, then there is little problem in enjoying the rest of the film. The beginning is slow to get going, but once Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana) have their one-on-one clash, the film reaches a momentum it does not lose. The battle scenes easily rival any seen on the big screen to date, and most of the cast do an impressive job in portraying their heroes in varying degrees of suffering. Honours should be given to Eric Bana for his role as the suitably regal heir to Troy, who suffers the wrath of Achilles in a simply choreographed yet remarkably compelling clash, and to Peter O'Toole who plays Hector's father and king of Troy, Priam. Also, contrary to most critical response, Brad Pitt plays the character of Achilles with a suitable display of bravery, power and shows one hell of a temper, even though after his fight with Hector his motivation for staying is lost. Orlando Bloom's Paris is a little weak, turning into Legolas-without-the-wig towards the end, and Diane Kruger's Helen lacks interest, but otherwise the cast are fine. Aside from a few niggles - including a fairly clunky script which does the film no favours - and an extensive running time, Troy is an enjoyable film, which deserves to sit high up in the ranks of sword-and-sandal epics.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,5,10,22 May 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow
","Ronald Emmerich returns after a 4 year hiatus to bring us his next disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, a CGI marvel but, like his other films, too clichéd and thin to be taken seriously enough. Now we all know that films such as Independence Day (1996) and Godzilla (1998) aren't designed to be taken seriously  they are the ultimate in 'popcorn' movies  but audiences are generally not content with a blockbuster anymore unless it shows a little character, or a little plot to pad the film out a bit. Sadly, this is exactly what The Day After Tomorrow lacks.The film starts with Dennis Quaid trying to persuade the world that, unless kept in check, global warming will make the polar ice caps melt and the world would be struck by 'superstorms' all over. This, needless to say, would be bad. He says it could happen as soon as in 100 years, except he miscalculated somewhat - it'll actually happen in a few days. Just before it all starts his slightly estranged son (Jake Gyllenhaal) flies to New York for a school competition where, unbeknownst to him, is where the centre of one of these superstorms will end up. Then the storms start, and after a quick 'up yours!' and a 'told you so!' to the American government, Quaid sets off to New York to get his son out of there. Meanwhile, his son is trapped in the New York Public Library, trying to stay alive long enough for his dad to reach him.And that's it  the plot in, just about, it's entirety. I've summed it up in 150 words. Yet Emmerich has made a 2 hour film stretching this story as far as possible. It's not exactly a bad story or script, and certainly not as clichéd as Independence Day (although it does have its moments, especially where some wolves escape from their cages  guess when they turn up? Just as Jake Gyllenhaal leaves the library and is completely defenceless, of course...), it's just that there's not enough story/plot to fill the time. Of course, this is where the special effects come in, and they certainly do hit you like a tornado hitting LA (wait a sec). There are 3 major set pieces for these effects: the aforementioned LA tornadoes, the flooding of New York, and then the 'superfreeze' which we see affect both New York and England. And what special effects they are! They may not always be photorealistic, but they are close enough to the real thing to begin worrying when it starts to rain when you leave the cinema. The film has set a new standard for disaster movie effects, and Emmerich has once again proved that he is more than capable of destroying the world whenever he wants to, and in any way he wants to. He is definitely more confident in his destruction than in his characterisation scenes, which to be honest feel heavy and forced, although all the actors do pull off a good job with the script they are given.The best part for me was actually what was lacking  a single man who could save the day. Not even Bill Pullman or Bruce Willis can stop this apocalypse, and this is shown when Dennis Quaid draws a line through the middle of a map of the USA and tells the government quite plainly that no one north of that line (which includes New York) can be saved, and that every one else must be evacuated south, towards Mexico. The film does have an optimistic ending (we see lots of New Yorkers coming out of the buildings they took refuge in when the rescue helicopters arrive), but the implied off-screen death toll is catastrophic, which makes this film feel a tad more real than Emmerich's others, as if this really could happen. The effects are fantastic, the plot spread too thin, but it is still a worthwhile piece of entertainment, and recommended to be seen, even if only once.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,0,0,22 May 2006
The Prestige," The Prestige
","The Prestige is another example (as if one is needed) of director Christopher Nolan's talent behind the camera. Here he has crafted an intimate film that feels like a blockbuster with such a natural flair for solid storytelling that I would have no difficulties in saying that he is - despite only making a handful of films - one of, if not the, best British filmmaker around. The film concerns two magicians in turn-of-the-century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) is on trial for the murder of Robert Angier (Jackman), and the film slowly unravels the story of Borden's and Angier's friendship that, after a tragic accident that leaves Angier's wife dead, turns into a bitter rivalry. When Angier sees a trick of Borden's that he describes as 'the best magic trick I have ever seen', he becomes obsessed with discovering Borden's secret. Of Nolan's' films, The Prestige is most like Memento, at least in terms of its narrative structure. It is chronologically mixed up, forcing the viewer to pay constant attention to what is going on, as it can take a while to work out exactly when a particular scene is set (there are no subtitle clues or such like). This can prove slightly disorientating at first, but it is just another way for Nolan to keep his audience guessing, and keep the suspense up. Indeed, the constant build up of suspense feels in many ways like a well crafted horror film, with the film drenched in period atmosphere and misdirection. On the topic of period, The Prestige is also noticeable for not forcing the time period on the audience. There are no sweeping shots showing us the grandeur of Victorian London or any such thing; the camera is constantly focusing on the characters, not their surroundings, and this combined with the use of a hand-held camera gives the film a near-claustrophobic feel, accentuating the mood still further. Performance-wise, both the main characters give the best performances of their careers  Jackman especially showing depth that his recent blockbuster films have not allowed him to do. His portrayal of Angier first evokes our sympathy, but his descent into obsession quickly makes us reconsider who our loyalties lie with. Borden, who seems to be the clear-cut villain of the film, begins to steal our sympathies away from Angier despite knowing that he is certainly no better a person than Angier becomes. Of the supporting cast, Michael Caine is as strong as ever, and David Bowie's odd choice of casting is let go by his steely characterisation of Nikola Tesla. Only Scarlett Johansson disappoints with a dodgy English accent failing to give her role any spark. But her role is small and thus not a great dent to the film. The film seems so based in a fictional reality that the more fantastical scenes that crop up (involving the real life character of Tesla and his involvement in Borden's/Angier's tricks) seem to go a little too far; stick with it though, and the result is an incredibly well constructed tale with brilliant performances that really will keep you guessing right up until the end. The bad points? Well, like any magic trick, once you know the secret, the trick becomes less special. In fairness to Nolan, the audience has to know the big secret for the film to make any sense. However, as if the film was a magic trick, the ending takes something away from the rest of the film. It's not that it cheapens the film  indeed, the ending is handled quite expertly  it's just that one wishes the trick could stay and wonder us for a long time to come, rather than be revealed. It's a shame that films can't do this like true magic can, because otherwise The Prestige would be on it's way to being the perfect ten.

Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve
","Ocean's Eleven (2002) is an awesome film  fact. It's got class, plot, good characters (more impressive considering the number of people it involves), humour, and tons of style. And whilst the sequel brings back everyone from the original it is, to be blunt, not as good. It is good, just not as good.But this has nothing to do with the cast, which are still the high-point of the film, whether it be the general bickering amongst the group or George Clooney's and Brad Pitt's near telepathic conversations, and everything they had to make the first film so entertaining has been preserved here  it is evident that the cast and crew had a huge amount of fun making the film. All the newcomers are excellent as well, particularly Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Europol agent and former lover of Rusty's (Pitt). So there can be no complaints about the cast.Where the complaints lie (and it must be said that whilst compared to the first film this is not as great, it is still better than most of the films I've seen recently) are in the plot, and the general look of the film. The plot is a little rushed, and seems almost just an excuse to get the gang back for another round. After a rather effective scene with Terry Benedict threatening each member of the group individually, the film jumps to Europe (Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris to be specific), and this constant moving around can feel a little disorientating compared to the original.Also, because there is not much of a time frame for the team, there is no time to plan  and therefore show  the elaborate heist. This sense of urgency is punctuated by the use of a shaky camera, but this just alienates the audience from the sense of style from Ocean's Eleven. It also gives the feeling that the whole team just aren't as smooth as they were last time. The sense of timing is a little confusing as well, as it keeps jumping from the past to the present and back again. Finally, the real problem is (and I don't think I'm really giving anything away) that there is no big heist here, at least not in comparison to the lengthy and elaborate heist from Ocean's Eleven. And unlike last time, instead of one big twist  and we all know there's going to be one  it is broken up into several smaller twists which deadens the impact somewhat.However, as I said above, Ocean's Twelve is a good film. The above complaints are justified because we know what this cast and crew are capable of. So in that respect it is a bit disappointing; but there is plenty to enjoy and it should keep you well entertained. The humour is still very much there, probably even amplified this time around, with several laugh-out-loud moments; including one surreal, though fairly amusing scene, where Tess (Julia Roberts) has to get involved and impersonate Julia Roberts! It comes across as a little too much like a pantomime but is still fun nonetheless, especially when she runs into old 'friend' Bruce Willis.The joy about Ocean's Eleven, and therefore Ocean's Twelve, is that it never takes itself too seriously, allowing the audience to sit back and enjoy the fun which, although not on a par with the original, is still damn fine entertainment.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/ Re-viewing:I think Ocean's Twelve caught me on a good day, because I can now see how much the quality dips in the second dose of Danny Ocean and pals. The Julia-Roberts-being-herself scene - described in the main review as 'fun' - is actually very painful and embarrassing to watch. The whole adventure seems like an excuse for the cast to come back and just have a good time amongst themselves; the problem is that they seem to have left the audience out of their group, ensuring that all the obvious excitement on screen is not translated in a way the audience can truly latch onto. Let hope that Steven Soderbergh can recreate the magic from Ocean's Eleven in time to make a difference on the recently announced Ocean's Thirteen.Re-rated: 6/10",7,1,2,22 May 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix Revolutions
","With The Matrix Reloaded considered a general disappointment, Revolutions certainly had its work cut out for it to bring the trilogy back up to the heights of greatness. Unfortunately, it fails. Whilst not a catastrophe of a film that it was first made out to be, it is nevertheless the lesser of the three films. The story picks up straight after Reloaded ends, being as it is one story cut in half. We learn that the Zion fleet has been destroyed, and that the machines have resumed their tunnelling towards the last human city, while Neo's mind is trapped in a place between the machine world and the Matrix, his body lying in a coma on board the Hammer. This time, the Wachowskis have opted for a basic war film - without much of the philosophical banter that threatened to stall the second film - the centre of which is the machine attack on Zion, whilst Neo and Trinity go off on a mission of their own. The main problem with the film is the sidelining of major characters, particularly Morpheus, who spends the film sitting in Niobe's shadow, as they rush towards Zion. To relegate the best character in the series to such a small part is just asking for trouble  and the film does suffer for it. The actual battle in Zion is well done, however. It is one of the most impressive sci-fi battles made, and yet not a single major character is involved, which makes the whole sequence seem a little shallow. It is also far too long, so whilst it is visually stunning, it starts to get a little monotonous in the end, which is a shame considering the amount of time and money that must have gone into making it. Neo this time, particularly in the real world, seems more human than he did in the last film, especially when he is viciously blinded, in a clever little twist, by the real-world Smith. As he and Trinity fight their way through to the machine city, he shows us a vulnerability not seen since the first Matrix, which is a welcome break from the soulless Neo he was last time. Another change in the film is the oracle, played this time by Mary Alice. She still gives out her usual cryptic responses, but it is never explained (in film terms  the original actress died before filming was completed) why she has changed. Herein lies Revolutions' biggest fault  unless you have seen the Animatrix and have played the video game Enter the Matrix, much of what you see on screen is not explained in full. Only when you have experienced the full range of the Matrix brand will you be able to understand the film in its entirety. It is a perplexing decision that the Wachowskis made a film to such a specific audience, without a thought to those fans who didn't go out and do all the research into the other mediums. But what of Agent Smith? By this time, he has managed to assimilate the majority of people in the Matrix, and has polluted the system so that it literally starts falling apart. Only Neo now has the power to stop him, and come the final confrontation, the audience is rewarded by a kung-fu mega-fight that is everything we hoped for after so much build up. Unfortunately, it is too late to save the day, as the film ends leaving us with more questions, and a sense of overwhelming incoherence in the film's quality; at once it is both visually stunning yet physically empty. We are left with a war film that is just too full of clichés, and has an ego too big to be justified. As a film, it just about stands up on its own, but as a sequel to the best action film of the 90s, it is the biggest let down of the year.Rated: 6.5/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6,0,0,22 May 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","Part road trip movie, part satire, Little Miss Sunshine is an absolute gem of a comedy, rightly lauded at the Sundance Film Festival, combining the traditional elements of road trips with plenty of dysfunction, and more than a few surprises. It focuses on the Hoover family and their stressed filled lives as they cross the country in their VW van to take the youngest child, Olive, to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Firstly, there's Dad, who's a failed motivational speaker, obsessed with 'winners' to the point of driving the family insane with his mottoes. Then there's Mum, whose pent up emotion is hidden by her need to keep sane and her family together. Firstborn Dwayne has taken a vow of silence until he's old enough to go to the Air Force academy, having read Nietzsche extensively. Grandpa was thrown out of his retirement home for using heroin, and now mopes about being suitably cynical ('I can take heroin, I'm old'). Uncle Frank is a depressed, gay, failed-suicide who is drifting through his life no longer caring about anything or anyone. And finally there's little Olive, who wants so desperately to be in the pageant, despite not being shallow enough, or indeed pretty enough.The whole cast are outstanding  none of them can be faulted or accused of scene-stealing given that this is perhaps one of the best screen ensemble casts in memory. Olive (Beslin) gives an especially wonderful performance, particularly in the pageant talent competition at the end, so staggeringly inappropriate. The film is also heart-stoppingly funny. From one-liners through choice background details and embarrassing episodes, there is something memorable to see in every frame, and the cast pull off all comedic timing with such skill one wonders how a film can be both this funny whilst also being so moving, bringing us to truly care about what is probably the most dysfunctional family seen on screen. The film is mostly set on the road, and all the episodes that come from it, keeping nicely with the tradition of road movie (leaving people behind, vehicles breaking down, diner stops) whilst surpassing them all in humour and characterisation. The beauty pageant itself is, quite frankly, a scary satire on the lengths parents will go to fulfil their children's dreams. We see heavily made-up kids supporting bad fake tans and inappropriate clothing doing acts that mums think are sweet but are a paedophile's dream (we actually see one at the pageant, who is funnier than he has any right to be). The irony being that Olive's act is the height of what the pageant is trying to be, and manages to disgust all the parents who can't see beyond their own hypocrisy. There's not a lot else to say about Little Miss Sunshine other than to say that in an ideal world it would be seen by everyone. It's a small film that manages to leap out of the big screen because it is so well constructed, through the laughs, the pace and the tone, that it is a near faultless comedy, and probably the best of 2006.

Over the Hedge," Over The Hedge
","Animated films are being made ever more frequently, and, like any genre, the quality of the films have their ups and downs. Over The Hedge shows us not only how far CG animation has come, but also how potentially destructive the genre can be to itself. With expectations raised so high by quality films from Pixar, or films like Shrek, each time a new animated film comes along we once again expect that extra bit more. There has to come a point where the films can no longer match the hype we place upon them, and Over The Hedge feels like it could be the start of this.That's not to say that Over The Hedge is a bad film  its not. It is good, and the audience's enjoyment of the film could possibly be measured by how engrossed in the CG animation scene they are  the more films of this kind they have seen, perhaps the less they'll enjoy it; this is not down to the quality of the film itself, but more because it is such a run-of-the-mill, seen-it-all-before kind of film.I will reiterate though  it is not a bad film. It is mostly average though because, despite the charm of the characters and the attractive look of the film, the structure is so blatantly predictable; the mismatched group of animals, the climactic chase, all-star voice cast, even the character's themselves  the manic one, the cautious one, the cocky one  are all present and correct. And that is why, for me, the film didn't reach the peaks of other animated films. It seems to be playing the safe route, not taking any chances and just emulating (although, it must be said, sometimes improving) what has come before.The cast do have considerable charm. Bruce Willis seems to have cut himself lose and really gone to town on making his character, problem-causing raccoon RJ, an enjoyable one. Other highlights include Steve Carell as manic squirrel Hammy (a total scene stealer) and Omid Djalili as a Persian Cat and the guardian to the suburban household that the animals are trying to steal the food from. However, other members of the cast are not really used to their full potential, but the focus is never on them for too long.The animation is, as one would expect by this point, faultless  but there is really no excuse for it not to be  and the style is more riotous then other films, which at least gives the film a visual distinction from other CG films. The humour is good but the film really only starts picking up in the second half  the first half drags a bit and takes too long to get going, again making the film stall. However, there are some stand out scenes, such as the views from space (where we see the exaggerated effects the animals have on the suburb) and a hilarious scene featuring Hammy's caffeine-augmented speed, which is so fast time seems to stop for the rest of the world.In short, the film should be perfectly enjoyable to children, but adults will be harder to please. Over The Hedge is not a bad film, but I feel that the producers need to make something more original, something that goes against  or at least plays with  our expectations. Making the same films with a different cast each time is beginning to get old, and it is a shame but I suppose it had to happen eventually.Rated: 6.5/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6,1,1,5 July 2006
Van Helsing," Van Helsing
","With The Mummy (1999), Stephen Sommers showed us that he could make a film that had character, plenty of CGI, and was just plain fun. The sequel was not so good  less plot, worse CGI, and not so much fun. So a step down, then. The pitch for Van Helsing must have seemed brilliant to studio bosses: take the three biggest horror characters of the 1800's (namely Dracula, the Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster) and shove them together with a hero who, whilst originally was just a mild-mannered doctor, is now a kick-ass monster hunter. What could possibly go wrong? I'll tell you. The problem is that Van Helsing seems like a continuation of the Mummy series just with a different story: virtually no character, massive amounts of (not that great) CGI, and little fun. It's yet another step down for the director who, although has proved he's up for plenty of action, cannot put any life into it. Hugh Jackman appears to be the perfect lead for the role of Gabriel Van Helsing, but he never gets the chance to give depth to his character  as soon as he kills one set of baddies, he's off to kill some more. He can handle the action well (but we already knew this from the X-Men films), and could probably handle any real drama that should have been inserted into the film, but the director just doesn't seem to want us to know anything about any of the characters, he just wants to see them fight, which is not enough. I couldn't help but think that if things had been taken a little slower, the film could have been made that much more interesting  less would have been more in this case. It's as if Sommers is afraid to take a breath lest the audience realise how hollow the film really is.The film was also pitched as a horror/action film, and yet there is not one moment that provides a genuine chill or cheap scare, although it is very dark (it's mostly set at night  I didn't mean atmospherically!) Admittedly some of the action scenes and sets are convincing, and the film does have good production values, but once again it seems the budget has gone towards all the CGI, and not on the script or story. With each film, Sommers seems to include more and more monsters, as if he is trying to outdo his last film in terms of effects. This is a prime example of the 'quality not quantity' adage, as the more CGI there is, the less real it looks. The action scenes quickly become repetitive and although start off original and good, end up being a bit of a bore. And really, how many times to we have to see the lead characters swing on a rope in front of a castle? It's just not necessary.Overall, it's a real shame that the film turned out this way. It really needed to be either a slower horror film, or an action film which did not feel the need to rush through at such a pace that the audience are afraid to blink lest they miss something. Stephen Sommers must learn how to do character first, action second, if he's going to keep a fan base going; relying on visual effects alone just isn't enough for us anymore.Rated: 5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",5,2,3,22 May 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Alien vs. Predator
","Ever since it's conception, the very thought of having two of the best franchises in sci-fi cinema come together to kick the crap out of each other was one of the best ideas to come out of Hollywood. A decade later, when the film was finally made, the results are slightly less than were expected. The Alien Vs Predator franchise has been going for some time. The comic books were very well received (and still are) since their creation in 1989, and since then they have spawned two video-games. It was inevitable then that a film would one day be made. After being tossed around studios for a bit, responsibility for the film fell to Paul W.S Anderson, who had a background in video-game-to-film projects. And here was the first mistake: Anderson was responsible for both Mortal Kombat and the more recent Resident Evil's, both of which were a bit, well rubbish. It seems odd that studio bosses would put their faith in someone who made two bad video-game-to-film films. Still, they did, and the result is a fairly passable, yet wholly unsatisfying film.The reason is this: Aliens and Predator are great films, the pinnacle of the sci-fi genre. That means, as this film combines the two, that it has to be rated against them both. If there had been no Aliens or Predator then the score for this film would possibly be a bit higher but as the first two films were so good, this seems very second rate in comparison. Not that it's all bad. The moment we first see an Alien and Predator face off is great, the moment which has been a long time coming and that we've all been waiting for. It's a bit too hastily edited, and it's hard to see sometimes exactly what's going on  it's all too zoomed in  but the audience is too immersed in the scene that these are minor niggles. Also, the final fight between the last Predator and the Queen is an adrenaline filled, action packed showdown, which does end the film on a bit of a high. It is just that the rest of the film is let down by a lack of any real tension in the build up, a script that is too full of clichés, and (this may sound a bit odd) too full of humans. With the title Alien Vs Predator, you would have thought that it would be mostly about them with humans just kind of in the way a bit, but it is actually the Aliens and Predators which take the back seat. This is a real shame, especially as most of the under-developed characters are only there so that they can get killed off in gruesome ways. Sanaa Lathan is good enough as the lead, though unsurprisingly comparisons with Ellen Ripley from the Alien films will surface and quite simply, she's not as good. The film is shot well and really looks the part, and the special effects are fine  the Aliens in particular have never looked so good  but the now obligatory action film slo-mo goes a little too far. Still, it's not a totally bad film; it's just that it can in no way compete with the original films. It has to be said though, and raises the score up a bit because of it, that the Predators are, and always have been, awesome!Rated: 6/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6,2,4,22 May 2006
Cars," Cars
","The latest offering from Pixar is at two different ends of the scale, as it is both a disappointment and a success. Firstly, the disappointment: Pixar has taken a well worn genre (the old dog and rookie upstart routine) and instead of breaking through the barriers that constrict the genre, they have merely allowed themselves to follow its guidelines to a tee. It has thoroughly predictable characters and plot line and, at least to start with, the character of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is annoying and cocky as hell. It's not a good start.Yet the film still ends up being a success. Why? Well, mainly because it is Pixar  since when have they given us a bad film?  and they know how to make films that last. Cars succeeds because although it stays within its genre constrictions, it plays with them enough to stay entertained. Add in some genuinely funny jokes and the best animation and graphics yet made and it's clear why Pixar still lead the pack in the animated film stakes.But whilst Cars is a good film, it's not quite up to Pixar's highest standards. Naturally, the animation is staggering and once again resets the bar (how many times has that phrase appeared in reviews this year?!). Yet the story telling is not as refined as you might like. For a start, at two hours long, there is some unnecessary padding that could easily be removed. Also, as mentioned, the storyline is predictable enough so that there are few surprises. This makes the film seem a little more like style over content, which is not what Pixar is about.The voice cast are all suited to their roles  Owen Wilson does cocky young thing in his sleep, and the use of Paul Newman as grumpy ex-race car Doc Hudson is excellent. Bonnie Hunt is McQueen's love interest Sally, and does her job well, but the problem is none of them seem inspiring or inspired. They're good, and they create a comfortable atmosphere, but not a vocally thrilling one. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) makes most of the jokes, and this adds a great deal to the otherwise straight laced story. The thrills come mostly from the visuals  the races are excellently done  and some neat touches are provided but sly alterations to real life (there are no humans in this world), such as a scene where McQueen and Mater go 'tractor tipping'.The character of McQueen starts off as annoying, yet we know this is only because the more cocky he is, the greater his inevitable redemption will be. The story pans out as predicted but because of the magic of Pixar it remains thrilling throughout. So, by Pixar's standard, Cars is (hopefully) a minor glitch in their otherwise outstanding record. By the standards of the rest of the CGI films we have been given recently, it still stands at the top of the pile.Rated: 7.5/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,0,1,4 April 2007
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider
","The latest effort from Marvel and Daredevil director Mark Steven Johnson is a loud and messy film that, whilst it has some merit, has too many flaws that weigh it down. Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Storm, a stunt rider who, as a child, makes a deal with the devil (Fonda) to save his father's life. Later on in life he must uphold his end of the deal  he must become the next Ghost Rider, acting as the devil's bounty hunter to rid the world of Blackheart, the devil's son, who has just returned to take over the world.Cage is clearly enjoying himself as the oddball Storm  laughing at chimpanzee kung-fu and drinking jelly beans from a cocktail glass is his natural way of life  as he should be given he is a life-long fan of the comic book this is based on. However, the other cast members don't quite fit in: Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (as a graveyard caretaker who acts as a mentor to Storm) both seem to be acting in a far more serious film; Eva Mendes is obligingly cute but does nothing other than pose as background scenery as Storm's childhood girlfriend; Donal Logue provides comical side-kick responsibilities in the same way that Jon Favreau did for Daredevil; and Wes Bentley brings as much menace to the film as an Andrex puppy.In fact, the villains are all non-threatening and highly non-entertaining. When they are on screen the film stalls, and given that Blackheart is the reason for the Ghost Rider's existence that means the film stalls too often. Blackheart just comes across as camp, whilst his potentially cool and evil henchmen merely provide more imaginative ways to die. The films best bits don't involve the villains  Ghost Rider outrunning the entire Boston police force on his flamed-out motorbike is a highlight  and when Cage gets to be cut loose the film picks up. Also on the plus side, the effect of Ghost Rider, with his flaming skull, looks amazing, and the effects of CGI flames have been pushed to a new level. Sadly though, the rest of the effects are lacking and, come the finale, are reaching into Van Helsing territory  too many effects that are not developed enough to convince. Storm's transformation in the Ghost Rider is meant to emulate the pain from An American Werewolf in London, and the first transformation does, but after that Storm changes instantly and without any effect on him; we are not given the rules that define the Ghost Rider's world, and a lack of consistency is clearly noticeable.Designed to be simple popcorn entertainment, Ghost Rider simply isn't as much fun as it should be. It has too many elements that quite simply do not work, making it a loud noise of a film that does not belong with other Marvel films of far superior quality.Rated: 5/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",5,3,7,4 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," The Last Stand
","When director Bryan Singer left the X-Men franchise to make Superman Returns (2006), he was replaced by Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, Rush Hour), much to fans' dismay. However, the result is easily as enjoyable as the first two in the series, and despite several flaws which were not as destructive as one might think they could be, Ratner has kept the spirit of the franchise to deliver an action filled and twisting conclusion to the trilogy.This time around, humans have developed a mutant cure, and although not compulsory, many mutants want it. Magneto, however, believes this is the first step of the human-mutant war he is always preparing for, and so creates the Brotherhood in order to find the source of the cure (which is on Alcatraz Island) and destroy it. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned, this time as the worryingly powerful Phoenix who, torn between her two personalities, is talked into joining Magneto's army, which the X-Men must now help the humans defeat.It sounds very action packed, and it is. It is these scenes that are the most competent and confident, and are the highlight of the series. Finally, we are shown the full potential of all the X-Men's powers in the mutant standoff on Alcatraz, and the X-Men are shown to be the real heroes they are. It is the best climax to a superhero film so far, and is inventive with its display of mutant powers and the humans adapting to Magneto  their weapons are plastic, for example.On to the flaws and, whilst it may sound like I'm damning the film, it turns out that although some of these flaws are large, they didn't affect the overall enjoyment of the film as I thought they might. Firstly, the film is too short and contains too much. Both the Phoenix storyline and the cure storyline could have had a film each, but they are adequately combined, although it is the Phoenix storyline that suffers most from this  we never see enough of the Phoenix and her turmoil, and she is not as involved at the end as one would like. However, the scene at Jean's old house make up for this, and it has to be the most shocking and well-handled scene in the film.Secondly, there are too many characters. Bryan Singer managed to juggle all the characters the most effectively, but The Last Stand doesn't; and this isn't helped by its shorter running time (1hr 45 compared to X2's 2hrs 15). Whilst we focus in on many new characters, the established characters miss out (Cyclops, Rogue, Mystique, even Jean Grey). Worse, the new characters aren't all that effective  Ben Foster's Angel is utterly irrelevant, and Vinnie Jones is an obscene casting choice for Juggernaut. Kelsey Grammar's Beast, though, is absolutely brilliant, perfectly fitting the role that calls for calm judgement and more than a dash of feral ferocity. It is a shame that Rogue is sidelined, as she is the only mutant we already know that feels the cure is a good thing, and more could have been made of her feelings towards it.As said, The Last Stand is actually a very good film, and there is enough going on that the flaws pass by without affecting the overall result. The themes of terrorism, genetic engineering and stem cell research that the film makes links to makes it relevant to today's political world. The acting throughout is fine, the highlights still being Wolverine and Magneto (and so good are they that they are both getting their own spin-off films).A point that struck well in this film was the deeper exploration of Xavier's and Magneto's relationship than the other two films allowed. It is interesting that they both essentially want the same thing, but want it in radically different ways. The moment where Magneto scorns Pyro for disrespecting Xavier was an especially nice touch.Overall, one feels that The Last Stand was not quite as developed as it could have been, and it certainly needed to be longer to better juggle all the characters and sub-plots. But it is still an accomplished film with some stunning action scenes and is a fitting conclusion to the X-Men trilogy, if never quite reaching the peaks of X-Men 2.Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8,2,3,28 June 2006
Hellboy," Hellboy
","Hellboy is one of DC Comics' less widely spread, but just as popular, franchises (they also do AvP, amongst others). It has a strong cult following, but is not as universally recognised as other comic book series like Spider-Man or X-men. This is what is wrong with this film, which was widely released to a mostly Hellboy-naïve public.I have to admit that I have not seen many of the Hellboy comics, but from what I have seen, the film seems to stick to its source material admirably. The problem is that it sticks a little too well  fans of the comics will probably love it, but the rest of us might feel a little left behind, as if the film wasn't made for us. It is also fairly surreal in its visuals, so that non-fans might be thinking 'what the hell?' for much of the film, what with its references to other dimensions and strange magic. Other comic books, whilst not really way up there in the plausibility stakes, still take place in our universe and make them seem that much more real. Hellboy does take place in our world, but the introduction of other dimension and more surreal goings-on makes it feel too different from what we're used to. Normally I'd praise a little originality and going against the norm - God knows that Hollywood needs a good dose of that, but with this it makes the whole experience lose something, maybe a bit of the audiences' respect. However, I fully understand that writer/director Guillermo Del Toro couldn't deviate too much from the comics without upsetting the fans, and it was for them that the film was made. Anyway, to the film itself. The plot revolves around the demon Hellboy, who was conjured by the Nazis but rescued and brought up by the Americans. Now he works/fights for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, led by his rescuer Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). They discover a plot by Rasputin to allow a squid-like monster to enter our dimension and destroy the world. Hellboy and his gang of mutants (including an amphibian and a pyro-kenetic) must go on a mission to stop him. Ron Perlman is fantastic in the role of Hellboy, and the other cast are good enough, but the problem stems from a dodgy script and lacklustre action scenes. The heavy use of CGI does not help matters as it is clearly not up to the standards that other films have reached, and the film is too heavy on the editing side that is ends up being a mess. This is a real shame as the director was also responsible for the much better Blade II, which handled all its action scenes very well. The film does start out quite promisingly, with an entertaining sequence of the stopping of Rasputin and the discovery of Hellboy. From there the film keeps its momentum until about half-way through, at which point it all starts going downhill. The potential for the film was good, but it just could not keep its head above the water. This results in the audience not really caring about what happens in the end, and it is only because of the loud noises that we are prevented from falling asleep. There is, however, one excellent scene in which Hellboy is talking to a young boy about his feelings towards Liz (Selma Blair), which perfectly sums up Hellboy's character and wise-cracking humour. But it is not enough to save the film, and with Hellboy 2 already green-lit, hopes are not high for a redemption of this comic-book franchise.

The Incredibles," The Incredibles
","Pixar's sixth feature-length film is a very different approach to what they are usually associated with  instead of going with the 'cute and funny buddy-movie', they have instead gone for a more action orientated approach, resulting in an unfamiliar yet no less entertaining film.The story centres on the Parr family, consisting of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl  who were forced to go into a superhero relocation programme when the weight of the American legal system crashed down on them after Mr. Incredible is sued for rescuing a man who didn't want to be saved from jumping off a building  and their three children. Fed up with working in a dead-end job as an insurance clerk, Mr. Incredible longs for the good old days of saving lives and stopping villains. When a message comes through asking for his help he finds himself unable to resist the call to duty, but finds himself and his family in more trouble than he thought.The inspiration for The Incredibles is obvious, as it takes off from just about every superhero film ever made, and sometimes it is even possible to guess exactly what film was the inspiration behind a particular scene. However, what the story lacks in originality is more than made up by its personality. The film is quite stunning to watch, raising the bar yet again for computer animation to follow (putting even Shrek 2 in second place), and the action scenes are all incredibly well put together. The script is also excellent, and although it is primarily an action film, the comedy that Pixar is so famous for has not been left out, with some truly laugh-out-loud moments dotted throughout the film (special mention must go to Edna, a 'Q' style character voiced expertly by the film's writer-director Brad Bird).The Incredibles does not, however, try to give too much to the audience by simply piling on action-scene after scene relentlessly; it's too clever for that. In fact, after the beginning sequence, the superhero powers and costumes are not really showcased again for most of the first half of the film, allowing a slower paced introduction to the Parr family's new life. This is probably where the adults in the audience will find the most memorable scenes  it is a clever satire on the American legal system and an amusing take on suburban life, playing more like a domestic sitcom than anything else. Both halves of the film, although made up of almost separate genres, mould together perfectly and result in a satisfying film to watch, which will certainly entertain all age-ranges. It may not be as classic or as funny as Pixar's other films like Toy Story, but it certainly proves that they are capable of more than just repeating their usual buddy-movie formula and provide some variation to their work.

","Garden State is one of those rare treats  an independent film that is not immersed in its own ego, and doesn't feel the need to show off some great new artistic effect to show you how clever it is. It is actually a very simple film; nothing complicated, nothing too showy. The reason this film works is the same reason that all films should work  an excellent script and strong performances all round. It needs nothing else, because these two facts alone raise it above most of the independent film scene's best, let alone the limp-by-comparison Hollywood efforts.The story revolves around Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff of TV's Scrubs fame), an actor from Los Angeles who returns home after nine years to go to his mother's funeral. Andrew has been on medication since he was 10 to numb his emotions, after a childhood accident. As he leaves his medication behind, he finally begins to show some true feeling for life as he revisits old friends and meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a free-spirited woman who leads Andrew to reconsider whether his life is as bad as he thought.The three main cast members  Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Andrew's friend Mark)  all excel in their roles, without a flaw in sight. The biggest surprise is Natalie Portman who, after her emotionally-dead acting in the Star Wars prequels, shows what a great acting talent she is. All the characters are utterly believable, and this is helped by a script (also written by Braff) that is full of little quirks, yet also heaps on clever observances on real life. It also contains some razor sharp comedy and surrealism (a knight at the breakfast table, for one), that shows Braff as a man of many talents, able to infuse a serious story of rediscovery with quick bursts of humour.Garden State also looks amazing, with great cinematography which gives the film its atmosphere, mixing colours to portray the blandness of Andrew's LA life with stronger down-to-earth tones which makes Andrew's journey seem that much more realistic to the audience. We cannot help but be carried along with him as we await to see what results will come of him meeting so many people without his medication affecting his emotions. This is coupled with easily the best soundtrack of any film in 2004; it lifts the atmosphere up even higher, as it is not relegated to the background like many scores are, but instead is always present in the audience's mind. It is almost as if the soundtrack is another character in itself.If there are complaints to be made about the film, it is that towards the end it seems that the moral of the story  that life is what you make of it  is hammered home a little too forcefully. Also Ian Holm, although excellent as Andrew's father, doesn't really have a big enough role, and we are left wanting to see more of Andrew's relationship with him.But overall, Garden State is a very accomplished debut; a heart-warming drama that captures your attention from the word go.Rated: 9/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9,2,4,22 May 2006
The Last Samurai," The Last Samurai
","A note for the uninitiated: this is not Braveheart (1995) in a different guise. Instead, this is a far more sophisticated piece of art, a film that makes history a subject well worth investigating further. With the Last Samurai, director Edward Zwick has created a film perfectly showcasing heroism at its fullest. Tom Cruise stars in (arguably) his finest role to date, as the American Captain Nathan Algren, who is captured by the samurai warriors he is training the Japanese army to defeat. At first reluctant to explore the new world he has been pulled into, Algren slowly begins to see that perhaps these samurai are not the 'barbarians' that he has been led to believe they are. Usually when you see a Tom Cruise film, the mega-star status shines through instead of the character he is playing, but in the Last Samurai Cruise has presented himself admirably, as the viewer is sucked into the samurai world with him. He at once shows strength and bravery, but also compassion and a weakness of spirit, not to mention a fine sense of humour, usually directed at his samurai guard, 'Bob'. Algren's development from a drunken waste to a samurai himself is utterly compelling, and comes through at its best when the samurai village is attacked by ninja's, and Algren instantly decides to side with his captor's leader, Katsumoto.The film wastes no time getting to the point of Algren's capture, but when he gets to the samurai's village, the film takes its time showing the samurai's way of life, and many people may think that this is where the film begins to drag, but this is not the case. Throughout much of his time in the village Cruise says very little, but his silent wonderment at the samurai life gives off a dramatic effect unreachable by many effects-driven blockbusters, and it is this part of the film that Zwick shows off his talents as a director. However, the real star of the show is Ken Watanabe's samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is the perfect actor to play a character driven by the need to keep up the ways of his ancestors, and to stop Japan being pulled into an industrial revolution, however futile this may be. He is the true embodiment of the samurai code, never giving up, and sticking to his principles even in the face of certain defeat. Watanabe is a hugely convincing actor, making you want to root for him all the way, despite the fact that the samurai are actually fighting against the emperor.This film is an action film, though. Whilst there is plenty of drama, Zwick proves himself to be an admirable action-director, whether handling the large battles of the samurai versus Japan's army, or the more intimate one-on-one fights that Algren is involved in during his time in the samurai village. The screenplay is very well written; not surprising as it was co-written by John Logan, the writer for the immensely popular Gladiator. Cruise is well backed up by the supporting actors, including Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall, in a film that has been carefully crafted rather than slapped together, producing a film that, despite its relatively unimpressive box office success, is still one of the finest mainstream films that has come out of America for a long time.

The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code
","The controversy surrounding The Da Vinci Code hardly needs to be introduced. It seemed that very few people were actually going to give the film the benefit of the doubt, while most would criticize it before seeing it. Of course, many more of these critics had not read the book either, and so were pleasantly ignored by the 60 million and more people who went out and bought the book.When I read the book, I accepted it for what it was  a pulp novel. The kind of book you take on holiday to read while you're at the airport. It wasn't wholly convincing, but I thought it was great fun to read, and very cinematic in style. The writing wasn't classic, but the pace of the novel was such that these points could be overlooked. It wasn't surprising that a film would be made given the book's success and despite initial critical reaction what we are given is, while not perfect, a solid adaptation of the book that will at least give the audience plenty of food for thought.This is no National Treasure though. If you're looking for adventure and daring action then look to that film. This is a different beast, instead preferring the slow build up approach to story-telling - it is to the mystery/thriller genre what V for Vendetta is to the action genre. Most of the important parts of the book are when the characters are sat around a table talking. This immediately doesn't sound like it could translate to the screen that effectively, but there are enough nice touches to keep the audience interested.First of all, the story itself, whilst not necessarily historically accurate, it is still absorbing and it genuinely makes you wonder about the truth behind the religion. There are also some nice visual flairs, including some well shot flashbacks, and the way Robert Langdon (Hanks) visualises the unscrambling of the codes is a great way to show the inner workings of is mind. At first it may seem silly but there is very little choice as to how to portray someone thinking. Hanks himself is passable in the role, but is not really given anything meaty to do. However, the same can be said of a lot of the cast, and this is purely down to the fact that the plot is moving too fast, and giving out too much information, to be able to dive into character exposition. Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing is wonderful as a slightly eccentric English Grail expert, and gives a lively performance, which helps considerably given that most of his role is to explain everything to Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Tautou). Paul Bettany plays against type to play the murderous monk Silas, and he will make you wince with his self-flagellation scenes. The other cast members are all satisfactory but nothing special, again because of the speed of the story.There are a couple of chase scenes which are supposed to be tense, but they turn out rather lacklustre, and one scene near the end comes off as daft (no spoilers, but people get saved by a pigeon, of all things!). The plot may be hard to follow at times, especially if you haven't read the book, so full attention will be needed; however, if you have read the book, the film sticks very closely to the story, omitting some parts for timing reasons, and it is now that we realise why the Da Vinci Code is how it is  the film-makers couldn't do much else with it, as the tone and content of the book has to be retained for it to be a faithful translation: what suffers in the book suffers in the film.Overall, The Da Vinci Code is worth seeing, if only to see what all the fuss was about. If I was the Catholic Church, though, I would be more concerned with the religious violence portrayed in the film than with the outcome of the plot, which can try all it likes to challenge established dogma but most likely won't succeed because people know the book and film are fiction. Keep that it mind when you see it  don't take it literally and chances are you will enjoy it that much more. At two and a half hours it is a tad too long, and can be confusing to first time viewers, but it is definitely thought provoking, and a mostly worthy adaptation of the book.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,26,50,24 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Reloaded
","Hype is a film-makers worst enemy. As showcased by the disappointing The Phantom Menace, hype can seriously damage a film's, or a series', reputation. Such is the case with The Matrix Reloaded. After the truly inspired Matrix sprung up out of nowhere in 1999, the sequels had such a huge expectation placed on them, in no small part by the films producer, Joel Silver, that it was naïve to believe that they could turn out a film as fantastic as was promised. And that's exactly what happened, because the Matrix Reloaded, despite several excellent moments, just does not have the originality or style that the original did. Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Carrie-Ann Moss have reprised their roles as Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, but whereas last time they all seemed so human, now they seem to have had their humanity taken away, particularly in the case of Neo, who seems just as soulless as the machines he is fighting against. It's a real shame, as it was Neo's humanity that made him such a fascinating character in the first film.The beginning of the film does not help matters either. We start off very promisingly with a dream sequence, which shows off the extraordinary bullet-time effects that made the first film such a breakthrough. But within five minutes it's over, and we are left with an overlong introduction to Zion, the last human city, and to the increasingly complicated plot. The Zion section has to be the real low-point of the film, and as it is at the beginning of the film, that sense of disappointment seems to run through the whole two and a half hour running time. Once it is over, though, the film really starts to shine, and the enormous budget can be seen taking effect. Here we have everything that made the first film great magnified ten times, as Neo unleashes his Agent-stopping powers on 100 Agent Smiths, and a hall full of vampires, not to mention one of the longest and most impressive freeway chases currently on film. This middle hour is the films' saving grace; it is a magnificently choreographed kung-fu-fest, showcasing the great combination of computer effects and live action that few films have utilised successfully. On top of this is a rip-roaring powerhouse of a soundtrack that keeps the atmosphere strong throughout the film, being both a fine example of a rock soundtrack and giving more mellow pieces, keeping the mood without being melodramatic. Once the final chapters come in, however, we end up back where we started  disappointed, and this time utterly confused. Repeated viewings are necessary to understand all of what the Architect says in his (now infamous) thesaurus-straining speech, and it does not help that we will not find out the answers to all the questions posed until the final instalment, released a full six months later. It's a real shame that the Wachowski brothers seemed to miss what made the original so great, and throw in too much philosophical nonsense to try and pad things out, as if they were making the script up as they went along. Whilst the centre of the film is a stunning achievement, the beginning and end just shows how much work will be needed for Revolutions to redeem the Matrix name. Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:Having seen this many more times now, the flaws are more obvious. Sure, it looks good - stunning, even - but because this is a sequel it necessitates comparison with the original; and it is simply not as good. The original had a great idea that sat so well on its own, but the sequels complicate matters needlessly. Also, the first time I saw the film the effects looked great, but now with more time to evaluate them some already look dated and fake. The freeway chase, which seemed so cool the first time, has been surpassed many times, even by the likes of films like Bad Boys II (2003). It all looks like a well designed video game (ironic, I know) but it just does not immerse the audience like the original film did. It's still very stylish; it's not all bad, really, it does have some truly excellent parts, but it's also not a patch on the original. Could have been more, and should have been more.Re-rated: 7/10",7,1,2,22 May 2006
The Fountain," The Fountain
","When watching The Fountain one realises that there really is nothing like it. The closest relative to Darren Aronofsky's latest film would probably be 2001: A Space Odyssey. But whereas 2001 deals with issues like technology, evolution, the universe, and pretty much everything, The Fountain feels more down to earth because it deals with more personal, though no less expansive, issues: death, and love. It's because it deals with these topics on an individual level that The Fountain is a more effective film at provoking emotions and truly makes you think about the nature of love and life, whereas 2001 distances itself because of it's scale; it tries too hard to be an all-encompassing epic. The Fountain is not as epic as it first appears, but is a very intense and personal film.The film's cast is small, centring on the two leads in three time periods. A 15th century conquistador (Jackman) is on a mission for the Queen of Spain (Weisz) in the Mayan jungle, searching for the Tree of Life, as presented in a book that Izzi (still Weisz) is writing in the present day for her husband, Tommy (Jackman). Tommy is desperately trying to save Izzi from the cancer that is slowly killing her, just as in the future, Tom (Jackman again) is trying to save the Tree of Life by regenerating it in the heart of a dying star.The film will raise debates as to its true meaning for a long while to come, each section being dissected as theories are put across  what is real? Are they the same people?  but to concern yourself too much with that during the film will make you miss the beauty of what you are watching. The three time periods are referenced nicely in the film's visual flair  the candles in the Queen's throne room looking like the stars outside the future Tom's bubble ship  and the film's cinematography is nothing short of outstanding. Using micro-photography of chemical reactions in Petri dishes as inspiration for the special effects produces some fantastic imagery, and combining this with another of Clint Mansell's beautiful scores allows the viewer to literally float through the film, allowing it to absorb into us. Providing the performance of his career, Hugh Jackman is an unexpected though absolutely perfect choice to portray the obsession that all three Tom's go through, each on their mission to cheat death. Tearing through the first four stages of grief  denial, anger, bargaining, depression  whilst Izzi has already reached acceptance could potentially make Tom a character to dislike rather than support, but Jackman's performance instead makes us truly feel for him, trying obsessively to cheat death and find a way to keep Izzi alive. Rachel Weisz also proves a fine choice to bring out the seemingly one-dimensional character of Izzi/Isabel and gives her a life in death that centres the film. Together they gel so well, making the missions of all three Tom's both believable and necessary. The Fountain does not provide us with all the answers  if indeed there are any answers to satisfy on the subjects of love and death  and that is absolutely the point; each viewer will get what they want out of it, whether they see the simple love story at its centre, or the larger picture that surrounds it. The Fountain is an experience, one that needs to be explored rather than explained, and in sheer power of emotion is easily one of the finest experiences that can be seen on the big screen  and it needs to be seen on the big screen, if only because it allows the viewer to absorb it fully, and be engrossed in the atmosphere. It's one of the most beautiful and thought provoking films one is likely to find this year.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9,0,1,4 April 2007
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds
","With War Of The Worlds, Steven Spielberg shows us what he has learnt from over 30 years of film-making. The film has all his best moments rolled into one package  it has the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (1998), the intensity of Jaws (1975), and the very best of effects he has been involved in. But it does have a problem and that, strangely enough, stems not from the director but from his source material. Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a dock worker who has custody of his children for the weekend (screaming youngster and rebellious teen, naturally). He's not the world's best dad, but fortunately his parental inadequacy is put on the bench when aliens come and invade, wanting to both destroy and harvest human beings. And this is some invasion  for a good half hour the audience is subjected to an invasion of such ferocity that comparisons to Saving Private Ryan (1998) will come up, and be totally valid. In an interesting little twist from the H.G.Wells book, these aliens have been here all along, buried under the earth waiting to be reactivated. When they come up out of the ground, they tear apart cities like paper, and use their death rays to exterminate humans with such speed and viciousness, that the audience really forgets to breathe for the entire sequence; it really is astonishing. Then things go in a different direction  we move from big destruction to an intimate, almost in the realms of a horror film, sequence. Our heroes are in a basement with Harlan Ogilvy (Robbins), and the aliens come into their hiding place. A Martian arm (though curiously we are never actually told that they are Martian) comes down to search the basement, with the survivors having to move around to stay out of its sight. It is reminiscent of the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park (1993), and is all the better for it. Mixed in here is the conflict between Ray and Ogilvy; Ray wants to hide, Ogilvy wants to fight. There is an immensely tense scene where Ray and Ogilvy are fighting over a shotgun, whilst trying to stay as quiet as possible, so the Martians in the next room don't hear them. It gives the film real power over the audience, as we are kept guessing all the way. H.G.Wells' book has been updated for the 21st century and, on the whole, this is a good idea. It gives us some perspective and modern relevance  the first thing that Ray's children ask about the attacks is if they are terrorists  and with the aliens' shields, the whole situation seems utterly helpless. We see the military swept aside so easily, their counter-attacks ineffective. We see a crowd of people fighting Ray over the one remaining working car. Spielberg also gets some great shots in there too  highlights include a ferry being tipped over in the Hudson river, and a train with all its carriages on fire speeding over a level crossing. It shows Spielberg's rarely seen but strong potential for darkness. The difference between War Of The Worlds and many other disaster films is that here we don't see any authority  no presidential reactions and such like. This is very much the tale of one family's survival and the invasion from their point of view. Ray is not a hero, and the only time he is forced into a situation when he has to become one is when he is trying to protect his daughter; it is sheer desperation that drives him. Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Ray as a hopeless father, but also powerless to stop events that are shattering their lives  he simply does not know what to do; so he runs with the crowds. Dakota Fanning is likewise excellent as his daughter Rachael, although she spends most of the film screaming. There is not much time to really get to know the characters though, which is a shame as it makes the Ferrier family seem rather distant, as if the writer thought 'this could be anyone'. Maybe that was the point, but it distances the audience somewhat. The Martians are well done, keeping their tripods from the book (rather than ships like the 1953 film version) but updating them to look more technological and menacing. Arguments about the impracticality of tripods are pointless  no one really cares as the film is too involving to spend time thinking about such things.The problem comes at the end. Spielberg has never been that great at endings recently, but this ending is not all his fault. He sticks to the ending from the book, which is something that even Wells enthusiasts have never been too pleased with. Almost as soon as the attack comes, it is over. It is hard to believe the cause of the Martian demise, but Spielberg would have had little choice but to keep the ending if he wanted to keep the film as War Of The Worlds and not just any old invasion film. At just under the two hour mark, the film keeps you gripped all the way through, with some stunning effects, edge-of-your-seat tension and good old fashioned explosions. This is Steven Spielberg's 'greatest hits' collection, and it all comes together extremely well. Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7,3,6,22 May 2006
The Last King of Scotland," The Last King of Scotland
","From documentary director Kevin Macdonald comes a gripping thriller about a young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) who heads to Uganda to work at a small village hospital. Whilst there, he meets the general who has just taken control of the country, Idi Amin (Whittaker). They hit it off immediately, and Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and adviser. Unable to resist the lure, Garrigan agrees, but soon learns that Amin, although high-spirited and funny, is also a violent dictator, and realises he cannot stay in Uganda anymore.Much like Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, The Last King of Scotland attempts to provide an unbiased portrayal of Idi Amin, showing both his good and bad sides in equal measure. It doesn't try to judge Amin, but it has no need  his dictatorship is obviously based on terror, but he is shown not just as a monster, but as a person; he is still a human being, after all. In fact, as the film is shown from Garrigan's perspective, Amin comes across at first as a thoroughly likable personality, and his violence is hidden from Garrigan for a long time, partly through design, but also through Garrigan's own naivety.Forest Whittaker is truly a tour de force, and there is no finer person to play Amin than he. He is a riveting screen presence, and keeps the character of Amin fascinating to watch, and to follow his emotional breakdowns and outbursts is enthralling. His is arguably the finest performance by an actor to portray an historical figure, and he alone is what makes the film worth watching. However, the other cast members are not weak. Indeed, James McAvoy shows almost as much talent playing the arrogant, naïve but well-meaning Garrigan, and even as events spiral out of his control, his decisions are given an air of authenticity by an actor also at the top of his game. The entire film is lead by these two central performances, and there is not a moment where one of them is not on screen, which means the audience is gripped from start to finish. These performances also have the power to allow the audience to ignore the ever exaggerated turns of events that control the film towards the end  the situations become harder to swallow, but these are minor niggles that can be easily overlooked. It is at times frustrating to see Garrigan behave as he does  he is hardly helping himself as he begins to learn of Amin's true nature before starting an affair with one of his wives (Washington). His punishment upon the discovery of this affair is brutal, fully playing on its 15 rating and making us feel Garrigan's pain. However his ignorance is a key part of his character  so much so that he refuses to spy on Amin for British intelligence  and frustration gives in to pity. Director Macdonald uses his experience in documentaries to give the film an authentic feel, and he certainly knows how to present both sides of an argument. That he is capable of creating so much tension also proves that he is a talent to watch beyond the documentary circle. The Last King of Scotland is a fantastic watch, with the ability to absorb the audience into the experience. A great biopic, and an exciting thriller.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9,1,3,4 April 2007
Casino Royale," Casino Royale
","It's a bit of a catch-22 situation watching the new James Bond film. What keeps bringing us back to watch them are the combination of outlandish fantasy and a sense of comforting familiarity  the Bond films are basically the same theme with slight variations, but this is what makes them appealing. With Casino Royale the filmmakers have gone a different direction; in fact, references to Batman Begins are not too far off the mark as this new Bond, like the new Batman, is grounded in reality. What is lost is the sense of the familiarity  with the new direction comes a completely different feel for the film. The fact that many of the old Bond-isms are gone is both good and bad. There are few gadgets here (a good thing  Bond was becoming too over-reliant on his get-out-of-any-situation gadgets) and no Moneypenny. In fact, anything that can be classed as a distraction from telling a grounded story has been cleared out. Even the glib one-liners have been toned down, though not lost  there is still a lot of laughs to be had from watching the film. The filmmakers have, perhaps, gone a little too far with it though. The absence of the Bond theme is frankly confusing, given its almost revered status amongst theme tunes. Indeed, with its emphasis on reality, Casino Royale has lost the fantasy element that, whilst ridiculous, was nonetheless ridiculously entertaining. Because of this, the film feels less like a Bond film than perhaps it should.That said, Casino Royale is an excellent film. For all the naysayers, Daniel Craig is a brilliant lead, capturing Bond's growth from slightly naïve, arrogant and cocky new 00 agent through his descent to stone-cold killer, via heart-melted lover. His development is believable as he learns from his mistakes and, by the end of the film, has grown more like the character we already know and love. This is helped by the supporting cast who all bring to life their respective characters, but particular mention must be made to Eva Green, playing Vesper Lynd. Her chemistry with Craig is electric, the screen buzzing with energy when they are together, so that their initial power play that then turns to mutual love is a joy to watch. Without these two great actors, the film would have surely stalled.The style of the film is also a new development for the re-energised franchise. Beginning with a black-and-white prologue where we see how Bond earns his 00 status (cleverly incorporating the moment where Bond turns and shoots towards the screen) the film is given a welcome darker atmosphere. It's also a lot more brutal than previous instalments  this Bond bleeds, and after a fight is next seen sporting bruised knuckles. Coupled with a leg-crossing torture scene makes this Bond seem less invincible than the others (after all, Bond always wins  we're just not so sure if everything will really turn out OK in this one). Another interesting angle is of the villain, Le Chiffre (played with cold menace by Mads Mikkelsen), who has as much to lose as Bond himself, thus making him both more vulnerable and more vicious. The stunts throughout are jaw dropping, especially a free running section in Madagascar, in which the comparison between the runner's skill and grace and Bond's practicality is both clever and amusing. All the stops have clearly been pulled out  the sequence at the airport could easily have been the climax to any other action film  and the result is a fast paced, if maybe a little overlong, and well conceived film; any filmmaker who can give a poker game plenty of tension must be doing something right! Overall, this Bond film is in a different league than its predecessors. Any franchise that has been going for this long can only survive by reinvention, so in the long run this may be a good change. At the moment, Casino Royale is an excellent film, just maybe not the kind of Bond film we were expecting, though in a refreshing way (catch-22, remember?!). But in a world of films like The Bourne Identity and Mission: Impossible, Bond must grow and adapt. And he has done so with skill and style. It may not be the Bond we are used to seeing, but I get the feeling that this new Bond will not be difficult to get used to.

300," 300
","Zach Snyder, the director of the latest Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation, 300, is not under any illusion as to what kind of film he is creating. Taking the backdrop of a real battle, that of Thermopylae in 480 BC where a group of 300 Spartan soldiers held back the entire Persian invading force for three days allowing the rest of Greece to prepare themselves to fight back, he has decided not to go for an historical film, like Troy, but reverse that films' intentions. Whereas Troy took a mythological story and tries to base it in history, 300 takes an historical event and tries to mythologize it. And Snyder wants us to know that from the start: he says himself that he had no problems with changing material from Miller's graphic novel or from history in order to make the film 'look cooler'. So we get giant elephants and rhinos, diseased priests, Persian Immortals who look more like ninjas, and the Persian god-king, Xerxes, who's a modest nine feet tall. History be damned, 300 is here to have fun.The visuals are, of course, the films main selling point. Taking its cue from the other Frank Miller graphic novel recently come to our screens, Sin City, 300 is mostly effects work  indeed, all of the backgrounds are effects, and the film has been given an antique tone that fits with its style, making it look like a visualisation of a story that an ancient bard such as Homer might have told round a roaring fire (speaking of bards, there's one in 300 with a goat's head). The visuals are pretty faultless, staggering even, leaving the only criticisms to come from the story and direction.The plot is thin, and will be known to most by now  the Persians invade and 300 Spartans, led by their King Leonidas (Butler) go to hold them off, whilst at home his wife Queen Gorgo (Heady) tries to get the corrupt Spartan council (headed by a slimy Dominic West) to send the rest of the army to help. The set up doesn't take too long so that the meat of the film, the actual battles themselves, take up the majority of the film. It's an absolutely storming middle act that impresses with its style and its excitement. One draw back is the overuse of slow motion, which can be great in small doses, but here is employed to excess. Still, it serves its purpose  to show how violent the film is. We see every sword thrust, every limb be carved off its owner, and there's no convenient close ups to distract from what we are meant to be seeing  death. It's comic book violence, and so is not violently shocking, but it's strong nonetheless. Of the cast, Gerard Butler manages to convince as a leader, his face showing the conflicts running through his mind  bow to the Persians and live, or fight them and probably die. It's the Spartan way of life to be a soldier (as told in the first few minutes of the film) and his decision, though a hard one to do is an easy one to choose. The other Spartans are a little generic 'hard men', with six packs and eyes gleaming, but some attempt is made to inject some humanity  a son looking for his father's recognition for example. The other noteworthy character is the giant Xerxes (Santoro), a man who believes himself to be a god, and who actually isn't that much of a bad man  his offers to the Greeks are genuine (he doesn't want to fight if he doesn't have to) promising Leonidas power and riches if he were to bow before him. He is above normal rules for villains; despite his appearance, he is not a cartoon villain, he is a mix of menacing and kind, so it is hard to pin him down. It is a somewhat surprising angle to take, but works in the film's favour.Overall 300 is a lot of fun, though not without its flaws. But it is a film that knows what is wants to be, and so in its intentions 300 is a success. It's a visual feast, and in this case it is enough to support the film; the plot is barely there, and most of it is based on real events anyway. The only surprises the film can throw at you are the liberties it takes with history, but these just serve to make the film most imaginative and more thrilling. By the time Leonidas has made good the promise he makes to Xerxes (we won't spoil it here for you), you'll be under no illusion as to how hard the Spartans are, and how cool it would be to be one of them. Don't think too much about it, and 300 will leave a good impression.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8,1,4,4 April 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy
","With the first film, The Bourne Identity (2002), Matt Damon showed the world that he was a believable action film star. The Bourne Supremacy is certainly a match for the first film, yet it also feels so different (more on this in a mo). However, it still shows that this is a franchise that can easily stand up to any other spy film, even the long running Bond series. But this is a different kind of film than Bond's various outings. There's no quick one-liners, no endless array of women to pick up, and no high-tech gadgetry. Instead, director Paul Greengrass focuses on the character of Bourne as a person, someone who can feel both physical and emotional pain. He may seem cold at times, but is certainly far from being emotionless. And unlike many spies in films, he can be hurt; he falls on his leg at one point, and has to limp through the rest of the film. This all adds up to a character who feels so human, like it could be anyone you pass on the street. It makes you care about what is happening to him, and also makes you wonder whether all will end up fine in the end, like the Bond films always do; you know Bond will triumph and there will be no consequences, whereas with Bourne you're not quite sure if all will go quite so smoothly. As with the last film, the action scenes are mostly short and brutal; Bourne has a very physical approach to dealing with the people on his trail. These climax in an extremely well shot car chase through Moscow. Whilst it is an awesome scene, with realism highest on the agenda (none of this fake laws-of-physics-stretching stuff that seems so popular in Hollywood), it does seem a tad too long, and you end up wanting it to finish soon so your brain has some time to catch up. But this is a small point to make, as the rest of the film is so well paced, without feeling the need to bung in an action scene just because there hasn't been one for almost ten whole minutes, like so many films (stand up Van Helsing, we're talking about you). If there is one complaint to be made about The Bourne Supremacy it is that it doesn't feel as fresh as the first film. In Identity, the audience are as baffled as Bourne about his true identity, and that was one of the attractions of that film  we really didn't know what would happen next. With the majority of his memories returned, we now know what skills Bourne has, and what he would do in certain situations. What made the first film so good was the fact that we didn't know what skills he had; the scene where he uses martial arts on the police for the first time, and his own reaction to what just happened was typical of what made the first film so appealing.However, the cast are all of high standard, especially Joan Allen and Brian Cox as two CIA bosses vying for control of the situation. Franka Potente makes a brief return as Bourne's love interest and is the source for his emotional trauma, but it is Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne which is definitely the stand out here. Ironically, even though he is the lead character, he has the least to say in the film, instead relying on shots of him quietly brooding and contemplating his next move to make us feel sympathy for him. This, and the original, is certainly the most intelligent and well-crafted spy film for ages.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:The score for The Bourne Supremacy was always a bit of a tough one. I felt that although it should be an 8, the fact that it was not as fresh as the first film brought it down. However, having viewed it again I think that it does thoroughly deserve a score of 8. If anything, it is even more intense than The Bourne Identity, and director Paul Greengrass' use of the shaky camera gives the film a gritty, real-life feel that complements what the film is about. Although I still can't decide which film I prefer, I think they are equally as good as each other, and both deserve the same score. With The Bourne Ultimatum due in 2007 - again with Greengrass directing - my hopes are high for a stellar spy trilogy.Re-rated: 8/10",8,3,4,22 May 2006
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta
","Based on Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel, V for Vendetta is set in a post-nuclear world, where Britain is run by a fascist government which sets limitations upon the freedom of it's peoples in true Nineteen Eighty Four style. A man named V (Hugo Weaving), uses terrorist tactics to try to show the people of Britain how they have fallen into passive acceptance of this regime, starting by destroying the Old Bailey, then publicly announcing that in exactly one year he will destroy the Houses of Parliament. Along the way he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who he believes can help him achieve his goals.V for Vendetta has turned up at an interesting time. Indeed, with the news mostly concerned with terrorists and dubious politics, it seems apt that a supposed blockbuster film should come along and try to get us to think about exactly what the hell is going on with our world. People have associated the film with Iraq, North Korea, and Nazi Germany, despite the fact that it was written during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister. Alan Moore himself has disassociated himself with the film because he believes it has been twisted from its original intentions, but it seems right to do this  if people are going to get a message across, it needs to be relevant to the day and age that the message is concerned with.The real focus is V  is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? It depends on the perspective taken. From Adam Sutler's (John Hurt) government's view, he is a terrorist, but he soon opens peoples' eyes to become their freedom fighter. But the methods he uses are dubious  destroying famous landmarks, packing an underground train with explosives (particularly relevant for Britain now) and strapping explosives to himself. This is clearly a film that wants us to think.And it does. In fact, audiences have been deceived by trailers that show V for Vendetta to be an action film. In reality, there are less than ten minutes of action throughout its two hour run time, but this doesn't matter as the rest of the film has been carefully structured to keep the audience interested without the need for slo-mo violence. The key to its appeal is the characters, and here the actors all stand out. Natalie Portman is the right kind of actress to portray Evey (although her English accent suffers, sometimes horrifically, but it is a reasonable attempt), and shows her vulnerabilities very well. Stephen Rea's detective is a world-weary man, frustrated by V's ability to avoid capture, again carried off with aplomb. The star is of course Hugo Weaving as V who, being masked all the way through the film (he never reveals his face, emphasizing his existence as an idea rather than a person), has to rely on physical and vocal actions to portray emotion, which he does extremely capably. His voice is perfect for V  understanding and passionate, yet with a slight hint of craziness.There are some faults  Britain loses the grimy feel that was given to us in the graphic novel, instead looking plain and perhaps too much like today's London. Secondly, sometimes the film feels too heavy handed in its message, coming across as clumsily preachy. Also, V's introduction is, from the script's point of view, extremely heavy handed and could potentially put viewers off the film. Stick with it though, and underneath the blockbuster you'll find a film that is both daring us to challenge our way of thinking, and also managing to entertain.Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8,2,3,22 May 2006
