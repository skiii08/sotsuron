The King's Speech," A good period piece
","Tbe king finds his voice (The Kings Speech)is a feel good movie about a man who finds his voice and along the way finds the strength to be king. The movies plot is King George VI(Colin Firth)has a speech impediment and his wife(Helena Bonham Carter) seeks help from Lionel Logue(Geoffrey Rush)who takes on the case. The story tells how he becomes king and finally finds his voice to lead the realm into war.The film looks good and much detail is made to make it feel like the 1930's the acting is top notch especially Geoffrey Rush's part. the downside is that the subject material is just not all that exciting, to me the movie comes across something I would see on Masterpiece theatric/Grade C-",7,0,0,7 May 2011
Black Swan," a journey into madness

Black Swan is a riveting tail of a dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who gets the lead role in Swan Lake/ leading up to her debut of the show she becomes more paranoid eventually loosing her grasp on reality.

The Birth of a Nation," A piece of history
","Watching this movie is like being placed in a time machine and being transported back to 1915. I was absolutely shocked that president Wilson thought this movie was historically accurate. The first half was fairly true to the civil war, but the second half is complete fiction.The movie is about 2 families one northern the other southern. The kids are great friends and it shows how the war and reconstruction affected both of them.The movie was the first feature length feature film made in Hollywood. Griffin used the most advance techniques available at the time, and really helps keep the interest of the movie going. The racist overtones of the movie is a look at what was acceptable in parts of America just prior to WWI. It is strange by the time this film was made the klans power was waining, but prejudice was still so commonplace, otherwise the film would not have grossed as much as it did.",7,0,2,20 March 2011
Inglourious Basterds," A good but not great film
",Quentin Tarantino's alternate take on World War 2 is a mix of the old Hollywood western and B movie gore fest. The story has 2 plot lines one is Shosanna Dreyfus / Emmanuelle Mimieux(Mélanie Laurent) who escapes being killed by Col. Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz) she then makes to Paris where she inherits a cinema which is chosen to premiere a propaganda film where all the top Nazis are in attendance and Shosanna plans to burn down the place killing all the Nazis. The other story revolves around the Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt) who are tasked to kill Nazis. They get wind of the premiere and plan to kill all the top party officials.The film has a feel y spaghetti western with parts of old spy movie thrown in. The movie is way over the top in showing violence a Tarantino trade mark. I must say the first scene is the best one where we really get to see Waltz shine as an actor. The movie does drag in a few places with a lot of dialog in French and German. Overall I enjoyed the film but it is not my favorite Tarrantino film.Grade B,7,0,1,14 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Not bad for a Skell
",Robert Downey Jr. is again brilliant as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. While not as fresh or interesting as the first Iron Man this movie has much to recommend. The pacing is good and the characters are brought to life with some very good acting.Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role has Pepper Potts and has a love/loathing relationship with Tony. Again there is a list of bad guys Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke)who plays the main antagonist. His main beef with Tony is that his father was cheated by Tonies father. The other bad guy is Tonies industrial rival Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) who wants to get his hands on either Ivan(who has the knowledge to build an Iron Man suit) or one of Tonies Iron man suits to sell to the military. There is also a secret organization the Avengers headed by Colonel Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson)who sends Natalie Rushman(Scarlett Johansson)to protect him. This is the basic set up of the film.What works well in this movie are good special effects and solid acting on all parts. The fact that Iron Man is vulnerable and actually getting sick from the poisons of being Iron man makes Tony act with abandonment which helps move the film along. Some of the disappointing parts of the film is that transitions seem unnatural and some of the charm that endeared us to Tony in the first film.Overall grade B.,7,1,2,5 May 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," OK popcorn movie
","Good action with some nice art direction is what you get with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The acting is adequate for this type of popcorn movie and the story is old and been done many times before so don't expect any surprises.The stories main hero Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an orphan who is adopted by the King of Persia, he along with his brothers are fooled into attacking the holy city of Alamut (a real place in Iran) by his uncle Nizam(Ben Kingsley) who desires a magical dagger that can turn back time. The dagger is suppose to protected by a guardian of the artifact Tamina(Gemma Arterton) who also becomes the love interest of Dastan. Nizam murders the king and frames Dastan for it who escapes with Tamina. Dastan has to clear his name and learns about the dagger its history and his uncles treachery. OK so I know this sounds like a million other action adventure flicks and with just adequate acting this movie comes off a little light a popcorn movie that is forgettable. Nothing about this movie is memorable it's not irritating just nothing special.Grade C-",6,0,1,23 April 2011
The Expendables," Typical Hollywood action flick
","The Expendables is a very typical Hollywood action flick, nothing more and nothing less. I wont bother going into the story because it really is inconsequential to the movie, just to say it is cliché and basic having been done 100 times before. The movie is fast paced and really moves along so it is not to boring and before you know it it's over. You will probably have a hard time remembering anything about the movie after viewing it. It's really that much fluff. The best part of the film are the shoot outs and explosions which are really load and really big.Grade C-.",5,5,11,6 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A fairly enjoyable film
","Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows part I is an enjoyable film. The production values are first rate and the 3 main lead actors have really matured.To be honest I have never read the books(I'm a little to old to be reading Harry Potter) and I've only seen the first film in the franchise. This film moved along at a good pace I did not find it boring it did slow down in the middle a bit, but it allowed me to understand the characters a little better, and it set up for the 2nd part quite well.Grade B",8,0,3,12 May 2011
54," 54 A look back
",54 is the story of the famed New York night club by the same name. The movie was OK at best. The main problem is that the characters do not live up to the excitement of the famed club.The story revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillipee) WHO is a Jersey boy and lands a job at the club. He is soon promoted by Steve (Mike Meyers). I have a problem with this for what boss promotes someone to bar tender with no previous experience. Well Steve is skimming money from the till to hide it from it from the IRS. In the mean time Anita who works in the coat check (Selma Hyak) is aspiring to be a singer.While Meyers gives a very good understated performance as Steve the rest of the characters are only marginally interesting. So the movie just kind of winds down to the eventual conclusion. Making this a rather forgetful movie experience.,6,1,1,25 March 2011
No Strings Attached," Ashton Kutcher still can't act
","One of the most hum drum movies ever produced No Strings Attached is a lackluster comedy that plods along to its very predictable ending.The story revolves around the friendship with benefits between Adam(Ashton Kutcher) and Emma(Natalie Portman). They try to keep up this purely physical relationship but it is not long before the emotional attachment kicks in. The rest is predictable.For a romantic comedy there are very few laughs in this film and Ashton Kutcher is one of the most one dimensional non actors to ever become a star, every film he plays the same slacker trying to find love. There is little chemistry between the 2 principals in the film which makes for a dull film. Only worth seeing on Saturday night at home.Grade D+",4,3,5,12 May 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A guilty pleasure
",A stylish visually enthralling film with one very silly story and even sillier characters makes this my guilty pleasure. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World stars Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim who breaks up with underage high schooler Knives Chau(Ellen Wong) to be with Ramona Flowers(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who has a tendency to change hair color every other day and who is also emotionally disassociated with anything or anybody. Well Ramona has baggage in the form of 7 evil ex-boyfriends who Scott must battle to the death with.The movies strong points are good graphics with exceptional use of editing and cutting to intensify the film. The downside is that the films silliness sometimes threatens to smother this film into mediocrity Grade B+,8,1,5,16 May 2011
Kick-Ass," A Superhero flick with interesting twist
","A nerdy boy becomes a super hero who first get his ass kicked and then kicks some bad boys ass. Which in itself isn't so new but this movie has a few twist to make it interesting.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a nothing guy who has a hard time getting any attention in school. One day he decides to buy a super hero costume off the internet and dubs himself Kick Ass. His first attempts at being a hero are absolutely inept but he gets the local media attention and Kick Ass becomes a well known man about town. He stumbles upon a father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) super hero team who are after the towns bad man(Mark Strong).This movie is extremely violent the way Robocop was, but here most of the violence is done by 11 year old Hit Girl. The movie does get clichéd in parts and the beginning is a little slow but once this movie gets going it's a real ride. B+",8,3,7,16 April 2011
Transformers," An acceptable summer flick
","transformers an average summer popcorn flick. I must admit I have never seen the show or played with any of the toys so my review is strictly about the film based on its own merits without any comparisons to other Transformer merchandise.The story is a very basic good guys vs. bad guts with the Autobots as the good guys and the Decepticons as the the bad guys. These guys had a war on their home planet over the control of a mystical cube the Allspark. Well the Allspark made it to Earth and Megatron of the Decepticons found it but he got encased in arctic ice. Well the protagonist Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) grandfather found the Megatron and on his glasses Megatron engraved the location of the Allspark. Well the Autobots come to earth to get the Allspark and protect Sam while Megatron and Decepticons try to get it.The good points of the film are the action sequences which come fast and furious, the film editing and the sound effects. The technical aspects of the film are all first rate and it looks like a big budget summer action flick. The bad parts are week dialog between the characters, lack of character development, and I found many of the non principals so cartoonish like they came right out of a kids cartoon.Grade C+",6,0,3,25 May 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Good visuals bad story
",Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland is very appealing visually but this just can't make up for such a worn out bland story to go with it. Inst looks like he is trying hard at fantasy epoch with a cast of strange characters and the whole hodge-podge dosn't add up to a decent movie. I would have preferred to see a smaller but quirkier movie with this odd assortment of characters. Instead we get a Disneyesque story with rather flat characters. This could have been so much more. I thought the ending to be so hokey I laughed at it. I do like the idea of the major power players in wonderland are all women though.grade: C-,8,0,1,22 April 2011
Avatar," Does the art work remind you of Roger Deans album covers
","If only this movie had a better story to tell. Avatar by James Cameron is a visually stunning film with some really great CGI, and the world of Pandora is engrossing but the story is so pedestrian that it makes it difficult to watch the movie 2 plus hours.The basic story is one of a disabled veteran Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who takes over his brothers role of a Nivi (the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora). Colonel Miles Quaritch(Stephen Lang) uses Jake as a spy to gather information about the Nivi. Well Jake is found by Neytiri(Zoe Saldana) and she will become his teacher in the way of the Nivi and they also fall in love, Jake goes native and it becomes the colonel's task to destroy the Nivi to help some greedy earth corporation. The problem is that besides Jake and Neytiri all the other characters are sock one dimensional cartoon types particularly the evil corporate manager and the colonel. The story is rehash of several others and the environmental message is played way to much with a heavy hand. Am I the only one but the floating mountains seem to be a rip off of Roger Deans album covers from the 70's I thought I was looking at my old vinyl copy of Yes Songs. I was expecting to hear Close to the Edge at any moment.Grade C+",6,3,5,11 May 2011
Rio," A pleasant experience
","Rio is a pleasant kids matinée film. There is nothing here particularly new or surprising, but the kids will love it. The high point for me for this movie was the nice animation of the colorful birds flying to Latin music.Blue is a blue macabre(who does not know how to fly) the last male of his type who is captured to be sent to some place in the USA. He falls off the truck and is found by Linda who adopts Blue as a pet. 15 years latter Doctor Borbosa comes from Brazil who has found a female blue macabre and wants to breed the pair to help keep the species alive. So off to Rio during Carnival to get the pair of birds to hook up. The problem at first Jewel the female bird is very fightsy and wants nothing to do with Blue. Well that night a smuggler of exotic birds steals the pair and binds their feet together. Later that night the pair escapes. The rest of the movie is about the 2 birds trying to get unbound, Linda trying to get Blue back and the smuggler trying to get the birds back. The rest is rather predictable.The movie is a nice kids flick but nothing more. The story is neither interesting or new, the characters we have all seen before. The kids will love it but the adults will probably be looking at there watches waiting for it to end.Grade C+",6,0,1,25 April 2011
Inception," A very good action flick wrapped in an interesting concept
","Christopher Nolan one of the best directors working today has made an action masterpiece made more interesting being wrapped in a good science fiction scenario. The action is well paced and believable in the context of the world in which it happens which happens to be a dream world.The story is about an interesting operative Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is not allowed back in America because he is accused of killing is wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who keeps showing up in the dream sequences. To get back home to his children Cobb must implant an idea into Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) mind.At heart this is an action movie no unlike one of Nolan's favorite bond flicks On Her Majesties Secret Service which also sported great skiing stunts and mountain snow fortress. The story has enough plot twist to keep the viewer on his toes, and the editing is superb in building tension.A very exciting and intelligent film, Grade A-",9,1,6,31 March 2011
Ben-Hur," Still good but not aging well
","Ben Hur must have been a spectacle for 1959 and the film is not aging well. The look, direction, and acting style all scream 1950's epic. The director's style of long scenes with few cut aways gets boring really quickly if you are more use to modern day style. The acting is overly dramatic with a score that while good plays up the emotion like a soap opera, and the special effects particularly the fleet shot using miniatures does not look good at all (it might look better on a big screen theater than my laptop) but Star Wars did a much better job with models. The chariot scene though is really good and this is most of the action of the film.Grade B=",7,3,10,27 May 2011
Toy Story 3," A good kids movie
","To start off my 9 year old loved this movie. I thought it good for a kids movie. The action and the story kept me interested the chartists are endearing, and the message is a good one. Being blind in one eye makes it impossible to experience the 3d effect so for me the story has to hold me. The only down part is the dark moments in the movie while dramatic and moving still might be a little to frightening for the real little ones. For this and a rather pedestrian story I've seen before I downgrade it a bit.This is the first Toy Story movie I have seen and it endears me to the franchise. I really like the toy chartists I thought they were all done extremely well makes this movie a keeper. B+",7,1,2,20 April 2011
The Social Network," Welcome to Face Book
","The Social Network works on so many levels making it one of the best if not the best movie of 2010. This movie is about so many things but mostly about Face book and the man who started it. This is David Fincher best film to date and he is probably on of the finest directors working in Hollywood today.The movie is not laid out in linear fashion but told through a series of flashbacks. The movie starts with Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg) trying to impress a young woman but comes across as a complete jerk. He has a web page Face Match but soon gets in trouble with Harvard's IT department for breaking into their systems. At this point some rich students with their idea of a social network for Harvard students gets in touch with him and he agrees to help them develop their web page. He takes some of their idea and develops his own web page that will become Face Book. This will cause friction and a law suit which drives the story. In the meantime Mark needs cash to develop the software so he goes to his friend Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield) for some cash and makes him CFO of the business. Well the site takes off and eventually he meets up with Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake) who in a way help mentor Mark and help himself along the way. He causes friction between Mark and Eduardo and the rest is history.This movie is about Face Book but also about relationships, loyalty, hero worship, the viral nature of the internet, and the business of internet. All actors give really great performances which makes this a most enjoyable movies Grade A",10,0,0,23 April 2011
