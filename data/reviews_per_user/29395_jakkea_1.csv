Requiem for a Dream," Shocking, amazing, awesome, etc: Requiem For A Dream.
","There is something I have been telling my friends & family for a few months now. I have been telling them that there are three directors to watch out for, from America. The first is Harmony Korinne. The second is Paul Thomas Anderson. And the third, is Darren Aronofsky, whom debuted 1999 with the movie Pi, and made this movie; Requiem For A Dream.The first time I saw Pi, I was... Not shocked, but amazed. I thought to myself that Aronofsky never, despite Pi being his first movie, will do anything better than this (Pi). I couldn't be more wrong.The first time I saw Requiem For A Dream, I was shocked. Thrilled. Amazed. F*** Trainspotting, this is how it IS. And Basketball Diaries? C'mon, that's a feel good movie! The direction by Aronofsky is sheer brilliance, (and so is the acting, of course, especially Ellen Burstyn). The photography, is amazing and so is the music. Actually, it's just been a couple of hours since I saw it, and I haven't really landed yet, so to speak.All I can say is that this motion picture probably changed my life, today. 'Cause, you see, I will never, ever, touch a drug in my entire life after this. But the movie isn't only about drugs; it's about addiction, and Aronofsky shows that in a brilliant way. A word I (almost) never use when I describe movies and/or music, is art. But this movie truly is art. Art in the way that you can't get it out of your head, no matter how hard you try.And the last 15 minutes of this film is the most powerful sequences I have ever seen in a movie.Requiem For A Dream is THE best movie of the 30th century, so far.",10,1,2,29 April 2001
