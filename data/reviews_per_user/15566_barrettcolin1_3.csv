This film also features Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, and John Hamm. It is also directed by Zack Snyder This movie left me smiling the whole time i was watching it. The whole concept of Baby Doll fighting giant Nazi Zombies to get a map or fighting giant monsters with a samurai sword and then another monster comes out with a machine gun amazed me. This movie had a huge twist at the end and it made me want more. Some of my friends didn't even get the twist and i had to explain it to them. The reason why they didn't get it is because they went to the bathroom at an import part. This movie is like Inception you have to pay close attention. If you liked the other Zack Snyder movies (300, Watchmen) than you will Love this movie",6,5,10,22 April 2011
Cars 2," Cars 2
","Lightening McQueen (voice by Owen Wilson) and Tow Mater (voice by Larry the Cable Guy) take it overseas to compete in the very first World Grand Prix to see who is the world's fastest car. Unfortunately, the road is filled with an overwhelming number of bumps in the road, detours and unthinkable surprises especially when Mater becomes involved in his own 'wild' adventure. The excitement takes on a new level when Mater finds himself torn between helping his 'best pal' Lightening McQueen win the high-profile race and assisting in a top- secret mission orchestrated by Finn McMissile, a British super spy (voice by Michael Caine) and the attractive spy-in-training Holley Shiftwell. The images of the cities visited are amazing as is McQueen's incredibly fast sprawling races. 'Will your kids enjoy the movie and have fun?' Absolutely, however the theme, catch-lines and content is more appropriate and understood by adults. In the end, the uplifting message that you'll take from this movie is 'Be Yourself'Ranking = (7.5/5)",3,0,1,7 July 2011
