The King's Speech," An Unusual & Inspiring True Story of Stammering King George VI... Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were splendid to watch!!
","THE KING'S SPEECH – CATCH IT ( A ) The King's Speech is an unusual & enchanting experience, its nothing like I have seen before. I have seen numerous movies and shows depicting the English monarch but nothing like it. It's a very humorous and delicate look into the Life of Stammering King George VI. The delicate disability of King George VI is told in very humorous yet sensitive way. Kudos to the Director and screen writer who presented Otherwise Dry subject in a very humorous way so the viewer can enjoy the whole process of it. Colin Firth as King George VI is spot on, Colin Firth has done numerous memorable roles in his life but his portrayal of King George VI is nothing like we have seen before. The King's anger, anguish, emotion, joy, love and hesitate has been brilliantly portrayed by phenomenon Colin Firth. I truly believe that Colin Firth will win Oscar for his SpeechLess performance about Stammering King George VI. Colin Firth also got lucky to have Geoffrey Rush playing the tutor's part. O'God, his Witt was impeccable. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make an Unlikely pairing which is hardly ever seen. Helena Bonham Carter stays on back but provide the utmost strength to Colin Firth's character. It's good to see her after a long time as from decades she is been playing over the top Gothic roles. Guy Pierce and Eve Best were good. On the Whole, The King's Speech is a fresh breeze into the Cinematic British Monarch Obsession, which will never get old, so, it's good to see new takes on British Monarch's Rich famous history.",9,4,7,24 January 2011
The Avengers," Finest superhero movie ever
","The Avengers – CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D.",10,30,57,21 May 2012
Black Swan," Black Swan is the most intense, erotic and passionate movie of 2010. Outstanding
","BLACK SWAN – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Black Swan is the most intense, erotic and passionate movie of 2010. Most of the time it happens that the psychological thrillers take time to throw the psyche of the movie to the audiences but Darren Aronofsky didn't play safe from the moment we are introduced to Nina (Natalie Portman) the ballet dancer, her psyche or mental state is thrown at us as she passes through the mirrors & feels somebody is following her. From there I knew that I am in for a treat, it's not the typical psychological thrillers we see normally every year. From first scene till the last scene, I was on edge of my seat and towards the ending I literally forgot to blink or even breathe because it was such a complex, intense & mind boggling thriller that I didn't wanted to miss a second of White Swan Battling Black Swan. Though during the Nina's psychological condition gets worse & even for me it was hard to understand what real & what's not? But the acquisition of 'Black Swan' theater in the end created a spell over me and the moment Natalie Portman performance the Black Swan sequence I was literally stunned to see how gracefully or I should say aggressively she transforms into the Black Swan. I don't have perfect words to describe Natalie Portman's portrayal on Nina, she brought the elegance, the beauty, the intensity, the exoticness & the pressure of Ballet dances into the Life. Her portrayal is so honest that it actually makes you wonder what actually Ballet/Ballerina or even dancers have to go through preparations for reaching to PERFECTION. Natalie Portman completely deserves all the accolades, awards this year, she earned every bit of it & I can't wait to see her taking her Golden Globe & Oscar award. Mila Kunis was a pleasant surprise of the movie, she was right parallel to Natalie Portman because where Natalie brought the intensity, and Mila brought the sweetness to the movie. The chemistry between Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis is exceptional. Mila Kunis also deserves all the accolades & awards nominations. Vincent Cassal was cut throat Brilliant, it was amazing to see hoe he arose exoticness in Nina & then suddenly left her hanging there in Aww of him. Winona Ryder's cameo was nicely presented and she never disappoints. Barbara Hershey as over stepping & sensitive mother of Nina Sayers is incredible. Ksenia Solo as Veronica did a fine job. Benjamin Millepied as David/Prince of 'Swan Lake' is an exceptional ballet dancer. It was just spell biding to see him gliding with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. Sebastian Stan and Toby Hemingway provided the perfect good looks required at the bar sequence. Overall an exceptionally intense, passionate and erotic movie and its worth watching for dazzling performances by Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis.",10,7,15,22 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates are saved by the Mermaids.
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Pirates of the Caribbean returns with another Jack Sparrow's mystical venture. It introduces some interesting new characters and stories, the characters are enjoyable but the screenplay is loose. The best thing about the Pirates4 is the Mermaids, the entrance of the Mermaids has to be one of the best scenes in the entire Pirates Franchise. The first time someone decided to present the scary still beautiful side of the mermaids. Johnny Depp is drunken funny himself, we are kind of use to it. Geoffrey Rush is repetitive as well. Penelope Cruz is good but she didn't look as athletic as the character was. Though, chemistry between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz is really interesting. Among the new batch we Sam Claflin as the charming kind of priest religious guy and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as the captured Mermaid is serene. The weird thing was that they were supposed to be the new Orlando Blood and Keira Knightely but sadly they didn't get many dialogues or scene separately to shine. Gemma Ward as first emerging Mermaid is absolutely gorgeous, her entry and enchanting voice will be engraved in my head for long. Overall, Pirates are saved by the Mermaids. The Mermaids are the most fascinating part of the Stranger's Tides. I defiantly would like to see more parts as promised because it was enjoyable and there is lot of things can be done with these characters.",7,1,2,12 September 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Homes returns with the Bang!
","Sherlock Holmes – A Game of Shadows – CATCH IT (A-) Guy Ritchi yet has directed a finest Sherlock Holmes movie, which defiantly requires multiple viewing. Though, the story is less complicated compare to the first Sherlock Holmes movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law bromance is the highlight of the franchise. Their awesome chemistry completely elevates the movie. Noomi Rapace makes her Hollywood debut after critical and commercial phenomena Lisbeth Slander Aka. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Noomi Rapace did a decent job as gypsy magician but I think she is capable of more greatness. Rachel McAdams makes an impressive cameo and reminds yet again why we all Love her.Overall, Sherlock Holmes another impressive movie and cannot wait for Sherlock Holmes 3. And in the end I must mention the Slow Motion sequence of Firing/Bombing in the woods will gives you Adrenaline Rush. Simply Amazing.",8,1,2,16 April 2012
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch is a Sucker, but if you like the Punches & can surpass the idiotic story of all time. It's bearable.
","SUCKER PUNCH – CATCH IT for (Production Value/Fights/Graphics/Oscar Isaac) & TRASH IT for (Idiotic concept of all time) ( C+ ) Sucker Punch starts with a girl (BabyDoll) losing her mother and in attempt to save her sister from step-father she kills her younger sister and end up in mental asylum. Now the plot is simple that BabyDoll tries to escape from mental institution along with 4 other trapped girls. Now, Sadly Mr. Snyder used his own mind to make it like a blow up 'Michael Bay Bayhem'. His BabyDoll goes into a fantasy world at her lobotomy that 'she is a dancer/prostitute' in a club, now she is trying to escape from this club along with other 4 trapped dancers. BabyDoll fantasies another fantasy world in which she was told that she has to have 5 things to get out of club (Map, Fire, Knife, Key & SPOILER (herself). First of all, why a 20years old girl thinks that she is a prostitute and trapped in a club rather than a psychopath trapped in mental asylum. That's just utterly weird. Secondly, she goes into another imagination in her imagination, I think Snyder was applying the Inception effect over here but it didn't work at all. We can accept that instead of in dirty clothes and dirty mental asylum Babydoll thinks she is in a Club in beautiful dresses and whatever happened in her fantasy club is happening in mental asylum. But we can't image how she goes into another imagination and fights Giant Monsters, Shadow Armies, Dragons and Robots. That's where it spoils everything. The only made me go through all this craziness was the graphics, fights and production value. There is no doubt that somehow studios believed on Snyder weird concept and spend around 80million dollars on this movie with bunch of girls in skimpy clothes fighting and dancing. Emily Browning was perfect as BabyDoll. No doubt she looks stunning but she doesn't have many dialogues and when she gets some it wasn't very convincing. Abbie Cornish (Sweet pea) along with Jena Malone (Rocket) are the only girls who stood out as an actresses, I have seen Abbie and hear about her from time to time but this is the first time I'll remember her and would love to see what she brings to Madonna's W.E. Vanessa Hudgens was awful. She has been good as teen in HSM movies but as an Adult she disappointed again after Beastly. Jaime Chung was okay. Carla Gugina was really good. Oscar Isaac is a star to watch out. I was highly impressed by him in Agora & Robin Hood and now its delight to see what he brings to Sucker Punch. He was some of the good things in the movie. Overall, Sucker Punch is a Sucker, but if you like the Punches & can surpass the idiotic story of all time. It's bearable.",4,0,4,30 June 2011
The Expendables 2," Do I have say something?
","The Expendables 2 – CATCH IT (B-) The Expendables are back and this time it's personal... Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren),Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) -- with newest members Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. (RT) There is nothing new about the expendables except it's funnier than the before and not in a bad way. The performances and action was as expected. Though just like the last time even this time you forget why so many explosions and why? In the end, every action lover will watch it so go watch it and get explode.",5,1,2,22 October 2012
The Young Victoria," worth watching for Emily Blunt and the whole Victorian Set up.
","THE YOUNG VICTORIA – CATCH IT ( B ) The young Vitoria is one of the period movies which isn't about throne or fight the Queen to save her throne, it's more about Coming of Age Teenage drama. Based upon the true story of Queen Victoria the movie's substance is fascinating, romantic and there are moments in the movies which really touches you. The cinematography, sets and costumes deigns are top class. The only thing I didn't like that it was slow and the story was way too simple to present a live of Queen Victoria. Emily Blunt is a soul of movie, she adopt the persona of the young Queen with utmost perfection. Emily Blunt is one of the few actresses who are extremely talented and thanks God that in Hollywood talent doesn't get wasted. Rupert Friend got his first major role as the Prince of Queen Victoria and he performed really well. He was charming and really strong in front of Emily Blunt. This movie is worth watching for Emily Blunt and the whole Victorian Set up.",6,3,4,31 July 2010
Marie Antoinette," Disappointing Sophia Coppola's vision
","Marie Antoinette – TRASH IT (C-) Marie Antoinette the Beheaded Queen of France's story is nothing but an incredible journey. He journey starts from innocence in Austria and end up being one of the most fashion icon and most hated Queen of her time. Now Sophia Coppola's version doesn't do any justice to her story or life. She may have been able to capture her fashion scenes and costumes but a great story needs a great story teller. Unfortunately it lacked a great story teller. Sophia wasted major portion of the movie in Marie Antoinette' unconsummated married life and it becomes tedious after 30mintues. Kirsten Dunst is good as Marie Antoinette I wouldn't say great as she didn't had much to do except wear huge clothes and dress up pretty. Jason Schwartzman is wrongly cast as French King. Not only he is that great of an actor but a King or then French that's little too much. Asia Argento relives her Mistress role of 'Une vieille maîtresse'. Jaime Dornan is a good looking lad and CK billboard's all over the world proves that. Overall, Marie Antoinette's great story is lost in Sophia Coppola's terrible screenplay and direction. Who knew that a woman directing a woman's life was 'Bad Idea' all together?",2,0,1,26 June 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," I love Resident Evil:AFTERLIFE, I was on edge of my seat the whole time
","RESIDENT EVIL:AFTER LIFE – CATCH IT ( B+ ) I love Resident Evil:AFTERLIFE, I was on edge of my seat the whole time and watching Milla Jovovich as Alice reminds me off how much we love her. I still remember the Red Hot costume of hers in Resident Evil 1 and after that it's a history especially with this one, which has become the highest grossing movie among all the Resident Evil movies. So I thing the whole Gang will be coming back . Yahhhh . Mila Jovovich is the best female Action actress after Angelina Jolie though Angie has proved her Action Heroin Status in different Action movies where as Milla is stuck to Resident Evil franchise only, but that's okay we still love her. Ali Larter is the second most important essence to the Resident Evil franchise and I loved her in T.V show Heroes though I still think her role was never shaped up the way it should have. (who cares now as the show is canceled). Bravo for bringing WentWorth Miller, everyone love him and thanks God he is the part of the this franchise. Boris Kodjoe and Spencer Locke seems like permanent part of the franchise too, not bad at all. Shawn Roberts is really cool villein and I think he will be returning too next time, which is Awesome! Overall it was a great fun to watch them fight zombies and evils yet again, can't wait for them to fight again.",7,2,6,10 October 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," wasn't bad or good it was just alright
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter – CATCH IT (B) Abraham Lincoln as the Vampire Hunter comic book has its beloved fans that have been following this twisted concept from years. In my opinion I never thought this subject matter to be fascinating at all. The movie rapidly covers Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States' life from his childhood till almost demise. During that he discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them. Tim Burton's name behind this movie did create some expectations but when the promos went online everyone knew its pretty generic movie with no stamp of Tim Burton. In the whole movie there were two big scenes where CGI was required heavily and sadly it wasn't that impressive at all. Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln did a nice job but sadly he could not bring anything to the character. Dominic Cooper is good as always. Mary Elizabeth Winstead looked pretty and did a fine job. In the end, it wasn't bad or good it was just alright and good times pass.",6,1,2,22 October 2012
Se7en," I saw Se7ev too late I guess, its 2010 and its been 15 years since its been released
","SE7EN – CATCH IT ( A- ) I saw Se7ev too late I guess, its 2010 and its been 15 years since its been released, so I suppose when it came out it was the sickest and brutal thing ever though now Saw and other torture movies have finish the brutality limit. Still its one of the most decent thriller I have ever seen. Morgan freeman is incredible as ever. Brad Pitt is always a treat to watch and yet again he showed why he is the top actor of Hollywood. Gwyneth Paltrow didn't have much scoop but still she leaves strong impact Kevin Spacey is good. Overall nice thriller which I saw too late and I already could guess whats going to happen next but still David Fincher proved that he has his own vision and no one can mess with that. Bravo.",9,0,1,22 September 2010
Iron Man 2," I am actually stunned to see that How Lame and Cliché Iron Man 2 was
","IRON MAN 2 – CATCH IT ( B ) I am actually stunned to see that How Lame and Cliché Iron Man 2 was I had really high expectations after watching the promos but sadly Jon chose a very Cliché story 'A son looking for revenge plus another cliché plot line was Tony Stark thinking he was never good enough for his father or his father hated him'. These two stories, every other revenge movies always have. I am surprised how someone could choose such cliché story for a Comic Book Hero. We knew everything what's going to happened Next. Robert Downey Jr.'s wit and wicked portrayal of Iron man is really enjoyable and this time Don cheadle also rightly stand next to him. Gwyneth Paltrow as usual did a good job. Scarlett Johansson looked Hot as ever and she looked good thin seems like she shed some pounds for this role. Mickey Rourke was a cool villain and Sam Rockwell was truly amazing as devious enemy. Samuel L.Jackson show up to set a plot for The Avengers movie. Anyways it's a time pass good movie from whom I expected some shocking twists and cliff hangers in the end but it never happened and director played really safe by bringing the cliché story. Overall watch it for once that would be enough.",5,1,2,5 September 2010
The Hunger Games," Its Jennifer Lawrence who Holds the movie with her incredible portrayal of Katniss Everdeen
","The Hunger Games – CATCH IT (B+) Based upon the popular YA Novel 'The Hunger Games' about post apocalypse world, where America is split into 12 districts and every year two under 18 participates from each district participate in the deadly game of survivor to death till only one left alive. The Hunger Games has taken world by storm ever since its sort out to the Next Twilight Franchise. I've read the first chapter of the novel and I must say it's indeed one of the best foam of literature I've ever read. Now back to the movie, The Hunger Games starts really fast and within minutes it establishes the New World for us & the reason behind conducting the Hunger Games every year. Once Katniss Everdeen volunteer herself as a tribute to save her sister the movie gets little slow as we expect the hunger game to start sooner but in that time director took time to establish the new world and people of the Capitol. Who have become heartless & cari-creature of the nature, they enjoy in suffering of the young adults. The movie really picks up once the Hunger Game starts and from there till the end there is not a single dull moment. I also think that by not showing a single scene from the Game sequences in the promotional campaign has helped the movie a lot. As we don't have a single clue what will happened in the movie once they enter the arena. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a perfect choice, she is innocent, naive yet strong hearted. There are moments in the movie when you see how incredible artist she is ... whether at the Reaping, when she volunteer herself or when she remembers how Peeta had thrown burnt bread at her in the rain when she was starving or when she attacks Peeta after he says he had crush on her or when she climbs the tree to save her life from other tributes or when a young tribute dies in her arms. There are many moments like these which showcase her enormous talent. Now let's talk about Josh Hutcherson Aka. Peeta, I think Josh is a one note actor who always played lonesome/misfit whether it's Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids are Alright or now The Hunger Games. I wanted Peeta to be someone who can stand next to Katniss at least in physicality... at times he looks really shorter & immature in front of her. Though he played his part well so I won't say he was bad but a perfect casting for Peeta would have taken that actor to stardom like R-Pattz. Liam Hemsworth had rarely any screen time but he was very calm & settled. Alexander Ludwig, Leven Rambin & Isabella Fuhrman as villainous tributes were great. Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz & Wes Bentley were great. Overall, the Hunger Games is a good movie which stands strongly upon Jennifer Lawrence's shoulders. It's not a typical formula love story and the ending doesn't leave a single clue for the sequels so it would be really interesting to see how story progresses with these characters for those who haven't read the books yet.",7,2,10,24 March 2012
Elizabeth," Almost perfect
","Elizabeth – CATCH IT (A-) After watching King Henry VIII's chronicles in magnificent The Tudors (1-4) back to back. I wanted to give Tudor Dynasty the perfect ending with watching Elizabeth & Elizabeth; The Golden Age. Watching Elizabeth after finishing 'The Tudors' was a perfect idea as it takes you back into whom exactly Elizabeth was and what exactly happened with her mother & father's life. Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job as Queen Elizabeth she was young, vibrant and the Virgin Queen. All the supporting cast did their part with utmost perfection. But the credit for the movie defiantly goes to Shekar Kapur and Cate Blanchett who made us believe in the Queen.",8,0,0,4 June 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Sloppy yet entertaining at least I didn't got Bored though at times I wanted to punch the director!
","PRINCE OF PERSIA-the sands of TIMES – CATCH IT ( B- ) I was really excited when the movie was in the making; it had everything a 200 million dollar budget, Jake Gyllenhaal and Jerry Bruckheimer's touch. But when the 1st promo came online I was disappointed as the CGI graphics were cheap and it didn't looked appealing at all. Now finally I saw the movie and I found it really sloppy as far as the story goes and premise yet entertaining. It's just when you know that it isn't worth it and don't have much expectations anymore and watching just for the sack of watching Prince Of Persia, it happens! Jake Gyllenhaal, well physically he looked the part but with fake British accent he didn't quite nailed it (I am confused why director thought that Persians have British accent) anyways you can see he has put lot of effort in the movie though. Gemma Arterton, I am not a fan of her, I found her quite boring from the beginning yet she manages to show some spark in this movie. Jake and Gemma's chemistry is cold at times and at times it looks real as cunning people. The best person in the movie was Alfred Molina, who knew that he can crack some good jokes and bring a cheerful performance in action movie like that. All the other actors were fine. Overall Prince of Persia is a big disappointment and especially in the ending retreating all things we watched from last 2hrs is quite pathetic. Still watch it for non-stop silly Desert Ride, don't think about it, and just watch two beautiful actors on some mindless desert adventure!",4,0,1,20 August 2010
Ted," FUN Flick, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in it
","Ted – CATCH IT (B+) Wishes coming true in Hollywood movie are not a new concept; we have seen plenty of movies where wishes come true and do something magical into the wisher's life. What brought change in these movies is defiantly is the r-rated comedic genre. Since the blockbuster success of The Hangover and previously Judd Apatow's factory movies Knocked-Up and 40 years old virgin have given Hollywood a hope that a person can make millions over r-rated movies these days. Ted is also one of those wishes coming true movie but with its R-rating and a teddy talking nasty made is hilarious and entertaining. I would not say that it's the finest R-rated comedy but it sure is entertaining. Mark Wahlberg is great in Ted, many people think that Ted steals the show but if you watch carefully you will realize that Mark Wahlberg went out of his comfort zone and at times totally outshine Ted (Seth MacFarlane). Mila Kunis is gorgeous; I think that's why she was in it. The supporting cast is good Jessica Stroup was wasted; poor girl needs to leave 90210 and start auditioning for movies. In the end, it may seem like a one man or teddy show but it's not. It defiantly a fun flick with a funny idea.",7,2,4,4 December 2012
Black Book," An outstanding Dutch Nazi Thriller ...
","Zwartboek - Black Book - CATCH IT (A) Zwartboek is a Dutch movie about a young rich Jew woman hiding in Holland during World War II. Zwartboek is truly a masterpiece in regards of creating a thriller covering the Nazism & brutality of World War II. From start to finish, Zwartboek brilliantly explores a life of a woman in hiding & then working as spy for the resistance. The great thing is the tables are turned for poor her even when the World War II is over as she is labeled as Nazi Spy. This almost 2 and half hour a movie keeps on edge of your seat. The direction, screenplay, performances & production value is top notch. Carice van Houten's performance as Jew woman in hiding & spying for resistance is outstanding. There are some truly cringe worthy moments in the movie which truly makes you admire her as very few actresses would go that far to be humiliated. All the supporting cast along with Michiel Huisman did a great job. On the whole, Zwartboek is highly recommended Nazi thriller. Catch It!",9,2,4,28 June 2012
127 Hours," Claustrophobic True Story of Trapped Aaron Ralston is Brilliantly told!!!
","127 HOURS – CATCH IT ( A ) I was really psyched about watching 127 Hours, extraordinary true story and Oscar Buzz was enough to create immense interest in me. The movie starts with A.R.Rahman's magical & spellbinding powerful music. The whole movie is like a quality product, which never for a second let you feel boredom. Sometimes it gets really hard to watch the One person's agony on screen but just like Buried, 127Hours also did a commendable job in engaging the audience. Here, 127 Hours gets more applause as it's inspired from a true story. There were two completely different scenes which left me Speechless. James Franco Jumping into Canyon with Kate Mara & Amber Tamblyn creates exhilarating feeling inside me, it makes you wanna jump along with them. The second most favorite scene is Obviously James Franco Amputating his own Arm...It takes really a Big Heart to go through the whole scene; I can imagine why people fainted during that scene. It's undoubtedly James Franco's finest work, I don't have words to express his portrayal of Aron Ralston. There are hundreds of emotions he has shown to us and keep us immensely engaging. He truly deserves an Oscar Nod, I haven't seen Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine), Colin Firth (The King's Speech) yet, but I have seen Jeff Bridges (True Grit), Nonetheless Jess Bridges was outstanding in 'True Grit' but what James Franco brought to 127 Hours, it happens in Ages. Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn and Clemence Poesy were Charming. Overall, it's a terrific movie with amazing combination of exceptional direction by Danny Boyle, Extraordinary Music by A.R.Rahman, Breathtaking Cinematography by Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle AND Oscar worthy performance by James Franco.",9,0,2,10 January 2011
"I Love You, Man"," I must say the dialogues of the movie makes it work big time
","I LOVE YOU, MAN – CATCH IT ( B ) Its one of those movies which sometimes makes you laugh really hard at sometimes you fell like what the hell just happened? I must say the dialogues of the movie makes it work big time, though its cheap and things like you never want to hear about but C'mon that makes it different and funny. I really liked Jason Segel, he played his role so laid back and with an ease that it comes off very natural. Paul Rudd is getting pro at comedy, I liked him but at sometimes he gets little over the top. Rashida Jones did a fine job and she brought freshness to the movie. Andy Samberg, Jaime Pressley is Hilarious. Overall a great buddy movie which can be enjoyed a lot.",6,2,4,6 August 2010
Just Go with It," Sandler and Aniston share a good chemistry, which makes it funny and enjoyable. Brooklyn Decker is smoking hot
","JUST GO WITH IT â€“ CATCH IT ( B ) Just like all Adam Sandler's movies, 'just go with it' is a slapstick comedy and hilarious. In most of Sandler's movies, you don't have to think a lot about the story and just try to enjoy the movie with family. This one does the same just like Grown Ups. Sandler and Aniston share a good chemistry, which makes it funny and enjoyable. Brooklyn Decker is smoking hot & brings a lot of freshness to the movie. Cameo by tennis player (Andy Roddick â€“ Brooklyn Decker's real-life husband) was nicely placed. Nicole Kidman does something out of her element and surprise in a good way. Her hula dance with Jennifer was Hilarious. Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck were cool kids. Overall, it's a complete family entertainer which is silly at times but still enjoyable.",6,2,4,6 June 2011
Orphan," great movie, giving something new to this genre.
","Orphan - Catch It (A) I joined the Orphan band wagon really late since I already knew the ending twist thanks to my brother. So, finally after 3years I decided to watch it. Surprisingly even I knew the end twist, it was very effective and I almost forgot about knowing the end and starting enjoy the incredible performances of Vera Farmiga & Isabelle Fuhrman. Orphan is an example that if you get good actresses to do horror/thriller movie they'll bring something of their own which you rarely experience in regular horror/thriller movies. Vera Farmiga as grieving mother gave an incredible performance. Her breakdown moments are worth watching. New young Isabelle Fuhrman is truly a remarkable as how she pulled such a difficult demented role. The Peter Sarsgaard did a fine job along with the kids. In the end, Orphan is a great movie, giving something new to this genre. The direction, smart writing, real Winter Locations & superb performances make it a memorable experience.",9,1,2,22 August 2012
Match Point," Seduction ends on a brutal note
","Match Point – CATCH IT (A-) I started watching Match point in 2006, when it first came out on DVD but somehow the DVD was cracked and couldn't finish it. Now after 7 years I remembered, downloaded and watch the remaining 2nd half of the movie. To my surprise I always though it's a story of seduction, wealth and infidelity but never hardcore murder is a big part of the puzzle. Woody Allen's movies are hard to understand and this was my first Woody Allen's movie. I think it's kind of very real and honest and unusual. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is superb in playing creepy man. Scarlett Johansson is amazing, not only she is stunningly gorgeous but she acted really well. Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode are nice. Overall, Match Point was a great surprise for me as I though it's just a seductive movie.",8,2,3,24 May 2012
The Last Song," After watching this movie I finally realize why people are fed of NiCholas Sparks's Novals transition into movies
","THE LAST SONG – CATCH IT ( B- ) Well the movie isn't bad neither its boring, the only thing lacking this time is the story & the way story have been told we have seen this Million times nOw Miley Cyrus is not as Bad as people say she is in ...t...he Movie I think it's a Big leap from Hanna Montana Avatar though still she needs to work on her Expressions and dialogues during emotional scenes Liam hemswOrth is good looking guy... An Actor? Well he was O.k, he didn't had to do much this time... I think Only buzz he is been getting is because he is Dating Miley in Real otherwise people would have forgotten him Gregg Kinnear and Kelly Preston were good & ya Miley has an Annoying brother in the movie Ohh I hate his voice.. Yuck Nwayz catch it in spare time... Time will goes by!",5,6,9,28 July 2010
Dear John," if you are a Tatum or Seyfried Fan. Watch it but The Note-Book Wanna Be does disappoint.
","DEAR JOHN - CATCH IT (If you are Amanda Seyfried & Channing Tatum fan) ( B- ) I've been waiting for Dear John since I've heard about the movie, But unfortunately the movie didn't quite live up to the expectations because of poor Direction and Writing plus Characterization because while watching the movie its hard to See the Character's Transition from Teenagers to the Mature Soldier or housewife. & some how it was hard to adjust what Amanda's character does? The Only thing make the movie a worth a Watch is Channing Tatum who just Wow me with his sensitive portrayal of a soldier for whom its hard to express emotions, his finest performance till date. Amanda Seyfried is Charming and surprises with every new movie and shows that she has the most potential to be a Next Big thing. Every time she comes on Screen she just shines on the Screen, which is incredible for a young Actress like her. Overall if you are a Tatum or Seyfried Fan. Watch it but The Note-Book Wanna Be does disappoint.",5,0,1,31 July 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," surprised that it got snubbed by Oscars.
","The Adventures of Tintin: The secret of Unicorn - CATCH IT (A-) Steven Spielberg has directed a very fast phased venture which doesn't take a breath even for a one second the moment it starts. The Adventures of Tintin is highly famous book series around the world & making it in real animation with real actors makes it an enjoyable adventure. Voice overs by Jaime Bell, Andy Serkis & Daniel Craig are superb. the talent cast provides perfect physicality for animation like this. The movie has the perfect touch of Steven Spielberg, which doesn't bore you leaves you excited for next venture. I hope the next installment comes soon. I'm still surprised that it got snubbed by Oscars in 2012.",8,0,2,25 February 2012
The Expendables," The expendables truly justify its genre, the pointless action movies of 80s Van Damme,
","THE EXPENDABLES – CATCH IT ( C+ ) The expendables truly justify its genre, the pointless action movies of 80s Van Damme, that's another thing that Van Damme refused to be part of this movie. Sylvester Stallone used every action move he knew and learned over the years, his direction was lousy just like the movie. The only thing exciting about the movie is watching all action heroes together and the fights for some sequences it works but the ending sequence was too much I had to cover my ears; it was that much noise. Sylvester Stone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts did decent Job. Cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was OK as Arnold was there to tell that he wants to be the president of USA. In girls new girl Giselle Itie stands out, she did a fine job. Charisma Carpenter was O.k. Overall a full on action pointless action movie. So watch it because I know you will Anyways considering the United Action Heroes in One movie.",4,5,12,1 September 2010
The Way Back," The cinematography made this movie worth a treat from snowy locations to deserted deserts.
","THE WAY BACK - CATCH IT ( B- ) The Way Back is interesting look into the journey of polish prisoners escape from Siberia to India. The whole movie is interesting as a documentary, the whole time I was hoping to see some dramatic twists and turns, which didn't come. Its indeed a really good movie but sometimes you want the movie to be a movie rather than a documentary. The direction and performances by all stars is really good. Ed Harris, Soairse Ronan and Colin Farrell were by far the best. The whole movie is shot beautifully on exotic locations. The cinematography made this movie worth a treat from snowy locations to deserted deserts.",Null,0,0,25 August 2011
Megamind," Another animated movie on the lines of 'Monsters Vs. Aliens', 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', 'Bolt' and 'Despicable Me' which are Colorful but Not Funny AtAll!
","MEGAMIND – CATCH IT (B-) MegaMind is another pointless animation, which is colorful and bright but not funny at all. Animated movies have become biggest earners over the years and somehow it gave some studios the reason to make an Animation movie, whether it's necessary or not. MegaMind's story is taken from all superhero movies all together and there is nothing new ATALL. The romance between MegaMind & Roxanne Ritchie was very typical and dramatic for Animation genre. The only think kept me engaging was the bright & Colorful Animation that's all. The voice talents of Will Farrel, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, David Cross and Jonah Hill are rightly used. Though, Brad Pitt didn't have much scoop. Overall, it's another animated movie on the lines of 'Monsters Vs. Aliens', 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', 'Bolt' and 'Despicable Me' which are charming & Colorful but Not Funny AtAll!",5,2,8,10 January 2011
The Town," The Town is a great, edge of the seat thrilling, emotional and memorable ride.
","THE TWON – CATCH IT ( A ) Wow Ben Affleck directed another exceptional good movie after 'Gone Baby Gone'. From the first scene till the end, The Town keeps you on the edge of your seat. The thrill, excitement, fear, aggression and emotions are well presented in the movie. Boston car chase scene and the ending was captivating, I was literally holding my breath the whole time. Ben Affleck, after a really long time shine on the screen not only as director but as an actor too. Jeremy Runner gave a brave performance after 'The Hurt Locker', he truly kept me captivated and though he is playing a Bad Guy, you still feel bad in the End for him! Rebecca Hall was the emotion and love in the movie, I think standing up next to Jeremy Renner & Ben Affleck is in itself an achievement. Blake Lively, I'm a huge Gossip Girl fan and initially its hard for me to take her out from her Glam Doll Serena Van Der Woodson Avatar but soon she just rip off that image with her Southern Boston Dirty body language. Though, she didn't have much scope in the movie but still she gave power house performance in her role. Jon Hamm did a good job along side Owen Burke, Slaine and Chris Cooper. Overall The Town is a great, edge of the seat thrilling, emotional and memorable ride. One of the best movie about Bank Robbers. Must Watch it!",9,3,6,5 December 2010
Underworld Awakening," Better than 2nd & 3rd, surely will buy ticket for next installment too.
","UNDERWORLD: Awakening – CATCH IT ( B ) Underworld started before Twilight, True Blood and the Vampire Diaries phenomena hit us. I loved the first Underworld movie because it was completely something new and unique. From cast to its look it stands on itself and like resident evil introduced a completely different genre. Good thing about this underworld is Kate Beckinsale returns with some vengeance and Scott Speedman is still alive. Theo James, India Eisley and Kris Holden-Reid are good addition to the franchise. Underworld is about 88mintus, which is really short but fast. I enjoyed the whole movie but the only thing I didn't enjoyed was the CGI effects of Lyons, they were really tacky. On the whole, Underworld: Awakening is a better installment than the 2nd and 3rd and I'll surely will buy he tickets for next installment too.",6,2,7,27 February 2012
Tangled," Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel.
","TANGLED – CATCH IT ( A ) Tangled is undoubtedly the most charming movie by Disney. It brings the fantastical story of Rapunzel into live again. It's surprising to see that decades have passed by still Disney manages to bring it's beloved stories in totally new enchanting look, which makes them seems like totally new. Tangled is magical blend of humor, music, love and horror. On one side makers have wonderfully achieved bring the magical hairs of Rapunzel into life and on the other side the ending of Tangled is heart wrenching and one of the most daring in Disney movies. Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel. Mandy Moore's bring a lot of character to Rapunzel; it was so fascinating to see how she plays with her voice in scenes. Though, on screen we are watching an animation but her voice makes it as believable as any living human. Zachary Levi also did a good job as the thief/hero of Rapunzel. The scenes between him and maximum the White Horse are hilarious. Overall, Tangled is one of the most fascinating and charming animated movie, which takes you into a magical fantastical world.",9,2,5,3 April 2011
21 Jump Street," Entertaining
","21 Jump Street – CATCH IT (B+) Channing Tatum is shinning this year with The Vow and now 21 Jump Street. And surprisingly he is not wooden anymore. 21 Jump Street is super funny at times unreal Jonah Hill famous in school? Noway!Channing Tatum is charming and fun... and Jonah hill. I think he is still funny though he is not Fat anymore. The thing is when he was Fat, he was cute and funny but now he looks creepy and funny. This is not a good combination. Dave Franco is Evil and good. This guy should get more meaty roles. He is fun to watch. Brie Larson and Elle Kempner are good.On the whole, 21 Jump Street is a hell of roller-coaster ride. Go Watch it.",7,3,5,20 June 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," A good decent attempt but I think Thor was much Better and Entertaining.
","CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER – CATCH IT ( B ) Captain America is the latest super hero hitting the screen from the Avengers' world. After Iron Man and Thor, it was Captain America, whom everybody was eying for because eventually Captain America leads the Avengers to their Ultimate Journey. The movie is the beginning of Captain America's fantastical journey so it was enjoyable but I wanted more solid action in the movie. Especially while watching in 3D, the Shield needed to be more useful in fights than it was showed. Captain America got one thing right for sure, Chris Evens. His physique and American charm is perfect for the movie. And the most important thing is it was nice to see him leaving the cockiness from his acting and presenting a more vulnerable side. Hayley Atwell is good as strict British lady but I always felt that just like Rebecca Hall she lacks the Super Star Charisma. But for the movie she was perfect. In other cast Dominic Cooper, Hugo Weaving, Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and Sebastian Stan are impressive. Since, we have seen Iron Man1-2 and Thor, it's a must see. Otherwise getting into the Avengers without seeing anyone of those won't be a great idea. A good decent attempt but I think Thor was much Better and Entertaining.",6,0,2,11 September 2011

","HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1 ( B ) Deadly Hallows is the darkest and longest potter movie till date. On one side it was nice to see every aspect was covered with minute details but on the other side it got little stretched and boring. This time again, it was more story and less magic. At one point I thought I'm watching Lord of the Rings rather than Harry potter as the last scenery seems just like it! The graphics used in telling the story of Three Deadly Hallows was truly fantastic, I was just lost in beauty of those graphics. Excellent Job! Daniel Redcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint did a fantastic mature job as actors. Overall, deadly hallow was an almost a perfect part 1 towards the ending of our Beloved Harry Potter.",6,2,3,3 April 2011
American Psycho," An Open Ended Cult Classic
","American Psycho– CATCH IT (A-) American Psycho is a cult phenomena and I have been hearing about this movie since its release but somehow never been able to watch it until now. The American Psycho revolves around a wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, gratuitous fantasies. American Psycho goes deep into the mind of human psychology and deals with the pressure of society to be perfect. The direction and writing of the movie is spectacular and it's brilliant to see that it's directed by a woman. That's why the all sexual and killing parts are more ecstatic than gross. Don't take me wrong defiantly killing someone with chainsaw is gross but it's not shot chainsaw massacre sort of gross. The movie is great till the final act where it leaves you tangling between what's real and what's not. Christian Bale is super as American Psycho caught between living perfect life and his darkest desires. There is sense of believe in everything he does and this whole attire, his physique was close to perfection. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Jared Leto were good their parts but on the whole it was a one man show. American Psycho is a cult classic and if you like movies with open ending. Watch it!",8,1,2,13 August 2012
Coriolanus," powerful yet not for common audiences
","Coriolanus â€“ CATCH IT (B) Ralph Fiennes adopts William Shakespeare's least loved novel 'Coriolanus' for his directorial debut. Fiennes does adopt the modern era but also decides to keep the old English dialect for the Coriolanus. This decision made its really hard for common people to understand the movie. Even for me it was very hard to understand the movie. It took almost 30minutes for me to start actually understanding the dialect, characteristics and story of the movie. Once I was able to understand then I started to admire Shakespeare's least appreciated novel and Ralph Fiennes violent adaptation of Coriolanus. Ralph Fiennes is a veteran and once again he proved how brilliantly he can handle a complicated role like Coriolanus. Portraying a man, whom who nation hates is a difficult task. Gerard Butler is above average, he doesn't have the acting caliber to stand in front of Ralph Fiennes. Vanessa Redgrave is a legend, she is brilliant in every single scene. It's a pity that Academy Awards completely ignored her performance in the movie. Jessica Chastain is amazing though she doesn't get much scope. Overall, Coriolanus is a great attempt but could have been more effective if it was made for understating for the general public. As for common people it's really hard to catch the old English dialect.",6,3,8,14 May 2012
Hugo," Good but Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating...
","HUGO – CATCH IT ( B ) It's really hard to describe Hugo as it's not one of the CGI children movies. It's more complicated and to be honest more mature for children. The story may involve a kid living and hiding at the franc train station but it's not for kids. Hugo is directed by Martin Scorsese and has great production value. From its train station to costumes everything is simply stunning. I must say that Mr. Scorsese has worked really hard on the detailing about the era. The movie showcases the time frame and look which we don't see that often in such aesthetic way on screen. Chloe Morets and Asa Butterfield did a fantastic job as well Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer. For me Sasha Baron Cohan was the best as after watching him playing and living characters like Ali G, Borat, Bruno and now Dictator. It's just so good to see him acting like a normal actor. As far as the movie goes it's a good movie but as great to be remembered. The problem with the movie is that Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating enough. It's not the kind of story we like to see for two hours on cinema. If Martin Scorsese didn't direct this, it would not have been that much appreciated. Overall, it's a good movie but I would not recommend to someone at least.",6,0,2,5 March 2012
The Orphanage," The Orphanage is another Spanish master piece
","El Orfanato(THE ORPHANAGE) – CATCH IT (A ) The Orphanage is another Spanish master piece. It's the perfect combination of Horror, thriller and mother's efforts to find her Son. It literally has spooked me many times and the ending is so shocking that it brought tears into my eyes. One of the best Horror movies I have ever seen. The main credit to goes to the Director, writer and to very talented 'Belen Rueda'. Her performance was captivating and makes you not move your eyes from the screen. She shared all the emotions perfectly form Joy, sorrow, grief and terror. The second best performance was by the Kid 'Roger Princep' Oh God he is really CUTE and his performance was truly excellent. Fernando Cayo did his part well as grieving father and husband. Overall an excellent master piece produced by Mr.Guillermo del Toro! He is truly genius and bringing horror in completely different form!",9,1,3,7 August 2010
Salt," it's all about Angelina Jolie + Action + No-Substance and fortunately or unfortunately all three things came true.
","SALT – CATCH IT ( B ) From the promos we all knew that it's all about Angelina Jolie + Action + No-Substance and fortunately or unfortunately all three things came true. Salt starts with the bang and the banging doesn't stop during all 1OO minutes. I think there was a strong story but director didn't gave much thought to it and just try to cover the whole movie with action rather then emotions and substance. If he would have given a slight thought to the provocative substance he had in the script then this movie could have been another 'Bourne Identity trilogy' for Hollywood. Anyways the only thing that saves the movie from sinking is Angelina Jolie and its not that her acting was powerful, but actually she was pretty plain on emotions even when her husband gets killed in front of her, for whom she does everything in the movie. In fact just watching her doing all the cool stunts makes it worthy of watching plus the story is little complicated so you want to know what's actually happening. All other actors were just there and said their dialogues. Overall a very clumsy movie yet Angelina Jolie Rocked it!",6,0,2,18 August 2010
The White Ribbon," 'Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear'
","Das weiße Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte - 'The White Ribbon, a German Children's Story' – CATCH IT (A+)Das weiße Band is a German movie about almost 50 years old former teacher (presumably on verge of World War II), who is thinking about the strange events, happened in his village of Eichwald north of Germany just before World War I. To his believe the children in the village are the generation of Germans who became Nazis. The movie runs in flashback where former teacher tells about different series of incidents take place in the village of Eichwald. These incidents starts with A horse trips on a wire and throws the rider; a woman falls to her death through rotted planks; the local baron's son is beaten and hung upside down in a mill; parents slap and bully their children; a man is cruel to his long-suffering lover and sexually abuses his daughter. People disappear. The teacher, who courts a nanny in the baron's household, narrates the story and tries to investigate the connections among these accidents and crimes. What is foreshadowed? Are the children holy innocents? God may be in His heaven, but all is not right with the world; the center cannot hold. (IMDB) It won't be wrong to say that The White Ribbons is one of the creepiest movies of all times. This Black&White venture didn't rely on screams, graphics, blood or torture to create creepiest. The creepiest relies in the people and children living in the village. They are obscure and living duel lives in front of public and behind doors. There are many moments in the movie which will literally put audience in shock and disbelieve. Some of the most bizarre scenes have to confrontation about masturbation between Pastor and his young boy who is entering into adolescence. Later for vindictive divinity, every night as punishment he ties his eldest son's hands to prevent even the possibility of nocturnal masturbation. Then there is a widowed doctor who engages in unthinkable practices with his 14-year-old daughter. Besides that the beating the Baron's young kid and torture upon midwife's special child makes you squirm. Michael Haneke has directed a beautiful movie about complex subject matter. As one critic rightly said 'Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear'. All the children are truly the star of the movie. I have to mention these names who were absolutely incredible Christian Friedel as the school teacher , Leonie Benesch as Eva, nanny to the baron and baroness's twin babies , Ulrich Tukur as the baron, Ursina Lardi as the baroness, Marie-Louise Fion Mutert as Sigmund, their oldest son , Burghart Klaußner as the pastor, Steffi Kühnert as Anna, the pastor's wife, Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara, their oldest daughter, Leonard Proxauf as Martin, their oldest son, Roxane Duran as Anna, the doctor's daughter , Susanne Lothar as the midwife . The ending of the movie is ambiguous as the teacher himself doesn't know what happened to some of the people or who is behind the torturous events. But if you read between the lines and watch carefully you'll understand who can actually do that and Why? An Absolute Remarkable piece of Art, movies like A Separation and The White Ribbon makes me love foreign cinema.",10,0,2,25 June 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dragon Tattoo is excellent but not a Masterpiece like Swedish pehonomanan
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo – CATCH IT (A-) The Novel and Swedish version' Män som hatar kvinnor/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' with Noomi Rapace is a worldwide phenomena. There is no doubt that this is one of the most complicated and complex novel hitting the shelves last decades. Presenting the novel with all its complexities to the big screen is challenging, the Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev did a fantastic job with the first novel into a feature movie. Now it was David Fincher's turn to adopt the novel for American audiences with Rooney Mara and transfer into something close to or surpass the original phenomena with Noomi Rapace. Now I defiantly can say that David Fincher has done a fantastic job with American 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' but I cannot say that it's better than the original. Original is a classic masterpiece and Noomi Rapace deadly portray of Lisbeth Slander will go down in the history. If you compare both movies there is some difference like the characterization of Lisbeth Slander and Mikael Blomkvist. In Swedish version Lisbeth is fierce and doesn't show her emotions to anyone. Though in American version Lisbeth is more emotional and in the end her chasing down to Mikael Blomkvist shows her romantic side which was missing both in books and Swedish version. Maybe it was more David's attempt for American audiences to except her. I don't think it was a bad think because it gives it a decent romantic angel which is never a bad thing. Other major difference is Swedish Mikael is looks older though American Mikael is the roughed hot man in his best age. No wonder American Lisbeth falls for him. Noomi Rapace is indeed the winner as Lisbeth but it doesn't mean Rooney Mara is in anyway less. She did a fantastic job as Lisbeth Salander, her Oscar nod and stardom is totally worth it. Rooney Mara has shown how an average looking girl can crush all the odds of success. Not for a second she looked like a starlet, she defiantly lived the character really well. Daniel Craig is really charismatic and pin perfect as Mikael Blomkvist. Robin Wright is alright. Joel Kinnaman has non speaking part. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard are great in it. Overall, David Fincher has directed an excellent movie in all aspects. The Girl with Dragon Tattoo has detailed and intriguing story and enticing performances to entertain us.",9,2,7,26 March 2012
Shrek Forever After," Shrek 4everafter is way way funnier than the Shrek 3:the Third.
","SHREK 4EVER AFTER – CATCH IT (B+) Shrek 4everafter is way way funnier than the Shrek 3:the Third. I think a perfect ending to the franchise. This time we get to see another side of our beloved characters which was really fun. I think the most humor is provided by the Donkey & Puss in the boots. Heads Off to Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas who brought a incredible and much needed humor which was totally missing from the Shrek 3. John Meyers and Cameron Diaz did fantastic job as always with their vocal talents. The graphics & colors of the movie was simply mind blowing. I think the world Shrek went into Shrek 4 was as entertaining as the world we introduced to it in Shrek 1. Everyone should watch it, highly entertaining and hilarious.",7,0,0,28 November 2010
Bad Teacher," Great Concept, poor execution... Cameron Diaz saves the day!
","BAD TEACHER – CATCH IT ( C+ ) Bad Teacher is not as funny as it is in the promos. The best thing about the movie is that Cameron Diaz is as good or should I say Better than she seems in promos. Bad Teacher's premises Is really interesting and R-rated humor makes it blunter. The only thing it's lacking is characterization, if Cameron Diaz character had more characterization then movie would have been brilliant. Cameron Diaz is truly amazing as Bad Teacher, this role is truly for her and she proved yet again that she is one of the best female lead comedians around. Justin Timberlake provided the perfect freshness and weirdness. FYI watching real life Xz Justin Timberlake Dry Humping Cameron Diaz was really Awkward. I don't remember watching dry humping in movies like Ever and then between JT and Cam, never imagined that! Jason Segel didn't get much scope but Lucy Punch was hilarious. This girl has potential if right character is provided. Overall, Bad Teacher is a good concept but poorly executed. Cameron Diaz saves the movie for me. Flawed but Worthy.",5,1,4,23 August 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-man gone Darker for better or worst?!? Read Below ;)
","The Amazing Spiderman – CATCH IT (A-) The anticipation for Spiderman movie was building from the time when Sam Raimi and Tobey MaGuire walked out of the franchise because of their creative differences with Sony. After that Sony decide to make a more Gothic and true to its origin Spiderman after huge critical and box office success of The Dark Night rises. Eventually Marc Jacobs, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone joint the reboot. The comparison between the original and reboot Spiderman movies is obvious. Marc Webb did try to make Spiderman as dark as he could have done and Andrew Garfield is defiantly is very talented. He did an impressive job as Peter Parker bringing the emotions which we rarely seen in comic book movie heroes even though he lacked the innocence of Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker. Emma Stone is nice as always even with her blonde locks. Sally Fields, Martin Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Chris Zylka did a fine job. Though I have to say that Indian actor Irfan Khan was completely wasted and we never get to see for whom he was working and even though in deleted DVD scenes we see Lizard killing him in the tunnels but still no answer for the person he was working for. Finally, after watching the Amazing-Spiderman , I think the first Spider-Man movie was better as it had naive peter, cool organic webbing (even-though I understand the logic behind mechanical webbing) it was natural and animalistic or should d I say Insect-listic of him. The Amazing-Spider man was smart, witty and mouthy from start so when he got powers it was like Cherry on the Cake. The first one has better Villain the Green Goblin as it was rooted within the friendship of young Harry none-the-less Lizard was very real and graphics were spot-on but his logic to destroy and make everyone a Lizard was weird. Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone both played different comic-book characters so comparison is not fair and since both Peter's had good chemistry with their girls. And now let's talk about ending there is no doubt Spider-Man's ending was Great from accidentally Green Goblin and leaving him his home and Harry walking in on him to saving Mary Jane and Kids at the same time to leaving Mary Jane for ever at funeral and from Mary Jane finding out he is spider-man with the Kiss. Everything was in big Spectacular way. So I did love The Amazing Spider-Man but the winner is Spider-Man Indeed!",8,5,10,3 December 2012
Goon," Voilant, crud & high octane
","Goon – CATCH IT (B+) Goon is based upon the autobiography Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey by retired ice hockey enforcer Doug Smith. Goon is a high octane Canadian movie and it literally gives you an adrenaline rush. The gore, violence, crud humor and scary ice hockey is screaming for it to be an ultimate boys flick. Sean William Scott as outcast innocent yet crazy headed bouncer becomes ice hockey enforcer is great. He really buffed up and seemed like work really hard to keep him it undertone. French/Canadian actor Marc-André Grondin is simply superb. His hot headed jerk performance makes me watch his previous French movies. Jay Baruchel is same obnoxious. Alison Pill is sweet. Liev Schreiber is great as enforcer though he doesn't have much screen time but he does his part well. Overall, Goon is a great sports movie with lots of fights, violence, crud behaviors and everything a manly sports movie should have. I loved it!",7,1,1,28 May 2012
No Strings Attached," O' I ♥ Natalie Portman, Thanks God, Ashton Kutcher was not Annoying or Self absorbed!
","NO STRINGS ATTACHED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) No Strings attached is a pleasant surprise, considering the RomCom cliché story I thought it's going to be boring but adult humor and amazing chemistry between Natalie Postman & Ashton Kutcher makes it enjoyable. It won't be wrong to see that Natalie Portman's entry in RomCom makes it worthy of giving a shot in first time. I think if it had a regular romcom actress it would have been a dead e.g Katherine Heigl. Ashton Kutcher is not annoying like most of his movies, he was sweet and not self-absorbed otherwise his last offering 'Spread' left a bad taste in my mouth. Kevin Klein, Ophelia Lovibond, Lake Bell, Olivia Thirlby, Greta Gerwing, Ludicrous, Jake M. Johnson and Ben Lawson etc were great in their supporting characters. Overall, if you like Adult Humor and decent performances than this one is for. Enjoy!",7,1,3,6 June 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Wrong Casting of Micahel Cera and Marry E.Winstead was major let down in Great movie like that!
","SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, Oh a great movie tank on B.O because of its lead cast. That's just terribly sad. Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is a totally different experience I ever had while watching a movie. It's hilarious and totally blows your mind. I think this movie could have been lot better if Michael Cera wouldn't have been in it that was not his movie role at all. I just can't believe how come Michael Cera can be a heart breaker? Look at his face C'mon. He wasn't even playing geek like all his other movies. It's not that I hate Michael Cera, I actually loved his previous work but watching him in movie like that was just bad, because with some new or other young guy, this movie could have touched skies and made Millions on Box Office. people are just fed of Michael Cera, playing same role and doing the same thing, it's like someone put him from Arrested Development in Super Bad, then transfer into Juno and other crap movies he did in between and then into Youth in Revolt (another good movie victim of Michael Cera's presence) and now Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. The other miss cast of the movie was Marry Elizabeth Winstead, C'mon, I was against her ever since she got signed on, she is pretty but not drop dead gorgeous like it required in the movie plus she looks like mother to Micahel Cera in the bed room scene. Above all she has Zero chemistry with Michael Cera on screen. Two Wrong choices totally tank the movie. All the supporting cast is just simply Marvelous 'director got his casting 101% right here'. Kieran Culkin was outstanding and scene stealer as gay roommate of Michael Cera, he stole every single scene he was in it. Alsion pill, mark Webber and Johnny Simmons as entourage of Scott pilgrim did a fine job. Ellen Wong as the 17yrs old Scott's girl friend was amazing, how she transforms from innocent teen into jealous teen and then into the fighting teen was Amazing. Anna Kendrick was sharp and sweet. Brie Larson was really good as Envy Adams. Other stars who shine were Erik Kneudson, Ben Lewis, Nelson Franklin and Aubrey plaza. Now let's talk about the SEVEN Evil XXXXXXX and fights with them. 1. Satya Bhabha, the fight was simply incredible and here you realize that the whole movie is just like a game and the moment the other person gets defeated he will transfer into coins for Scott means more points. The whole fight was really intriguing though the Indian dancing and singing was little over the top. 2. Chris Evens, well Chris Evens is always incredible and it's so good to see him in new look and that heavy voice. His fight was really funny and amazing though it was hard to accept how Michael Cera beats his Seven Duplicates. Anyways he was the Hero so it happens! 3. Brandon Routh, Woww that was really Amazing, all Vegan thing, and firing Eyes was just incredible plus Brie Larson was also in this segment. The fight was really cool. I loved it. 4. Mae Withman, she was really spooky and her fight between Marry Elizabeth Winstead was freaking Awesome. (I still wished they had some other actors rather than Michael & Elizabeth). It would have been a Master piece. 5 & 6. Keito and Shota Saito as the Katayanagi Twins, that was simple Outstanding, you have to see the Musical Battle to know how incredible it looked on the Screen. Wow :-O 7. Jason Schwartzman was creepy and his fight was really cool but the thing I hated in the whole movie was that fight. Michael Cera Dies and comes back to life to use his last 1UP like in games, that was just too much, because till then we believed that its imaginative fights are replica of what we are watching means the exaggeration and then there is another Game 'Michael Cera's game replica' in the end, that was another let down. If it would have been finish off as it was suppose to it could have been more incredible but still it's a movie that is nothing like you have seen before. A worthy of watching Again and Again! P.S Michael Cera did a good job in the movie but it's just we have seen hundred times doing him same acting.",7,2,10,31 October 2010
The Duchess," Another brilliant movie of Keira Knightley. Must watch it!
","THE DUCHESS – CATCH IT ( A ) The Duchess hooked me up from the first scene. It is based upon the true story of Duchess of Devonshire. The whole period era is brilliantly portrayed in the movie. The best part about the movie is that it never lets you bore because the story is so intriguing that you are completely hooked to it. Keira Knightley is truly The Best young Actress around, in every movie she has proved how great and legendary she actually is no-wonder why the whole world is crazy about her. She looked stunning, nailed of the corsets and acted marvelously. Dominic Cooper is a Darling! He is charming and you want them so badly to be together but unfortunately they never did in History. Ralph Fiennes played his part with utmost easiness and grace, which required for the role. Hayley Atwell played her part which such decency that you can't hate her. Charlotte Rampling as Keira's mother did a fine job. Overall this movie is perfect for period drama lovers, another brilliant movie of Keira Knightley. Must watch it!",9,0,2,8 August 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tom Cruise is the MAN!
","Mission Impossible 4 : Ghost Protocol – CATCH IT (A) MI4 is indeed the most ambitious of all the MI movies before, this movie reinvents the whole franchise. The whole credit goes to Tom Cruise and Brad Bird to reinvent the franchise with a solid story, action and more importantly characterization. The action sequences are the highlight of the movie, every action sequence made me jump off my seat. Tom Cruise climbing the Burj Al Arab will remain the most dangerous action sequence ever done by an actor in history. There are no words to describe in this sequence. All I can Tom Cruise is the Man! Jeremy Renner is a welcome addition in the IMF, he is charming and has the potential to take over the franchise if God Forbids Tom Cruise ever decide not to return. Paula Patton is incredibly hot. Simon Pegg is hilarious. I think IMF finally got a perfect team for Ethan Hunt. Anil Kapoor, Michael Nyqvist, Samuli Edelmann & Lea Seydeux were the perfect nemesis. Overall, MI4 is one of the best heart pumping action thriller I've seen in recent and I just can't wait for MI5 with the same cast.",9,1,3,9 April 2012
Mr. Nobody," one of the best cinematic experience I ever had, everyone should watch it with an Active mind only.
","MR.NOBODY – CATCH IT ( A- ) Mr. Nobody is like a dream, a fantasy which came into life. Its one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen still it's not as confusing as Memento was. Mr. Nobody is really confusing and starts off with a 118yrs old man on the Mars looking back at his possible 3 lives. Confusing? Once you get the idea that it's about an old man who remembering his 3 possible lives with 3 women based upon his decision to live with his Mom or Daddy after their separation, and then the audiences will understand the whole concept. The editing of the movie is really confusing because we are shuffling between different parts of Nemo's life from Age 9, Age 15 to Age 34. Once we know what life belong to which female lead then its all clear, the audiences have to be active to understand and joint the puzzles back. The cinematography and color scheme of the movie is out of this world, it's simple yet very dreamy and imaginative. Jared Leto plays Mr. Nemo Nobody in Age 34. In all 3lives and in Age 118, he did a pretty fantastic job but I did feel like that Jared Leto is a Pretty man and looks gorgeous on screen with his blue eyes but if the director would have chosen some seasoned actor that movie could have gotten great recognition, actually more then its receiving. The budget of the movies is around $58 Million, which is a great investment on non-bankable actor like Jared Leto. Thomas Byrne (Nemo Age 9), the kid did a fine job with his big blue eyes. Laura Brumagne (Anna Age 9), Léa Thonus (Elise Age9) & Anaïs Van Belle (Jean Age9) looks really cute in the movie. However the Nemo who stole the show was Toby Regbo (Nemo Age 15), he was truly astonishing. His big blue eyes and his incredible acting chops in both three possible lives with Anna, Elise and Jean can be visibly seen. I think if he gets right roles he will be next Big Star in the making. Juno Temple (Anna Age15), she is one of the talented British actresses around who made her name with supporting roles till now. The chemistry between Toby Regbo and Juno Temple is the soul of the movie; all the scenes between them are beautifully shot and are brilliantly acted by them. Diane Kruger (Anna Age 34) looks pretty and acted well. Sara Polly (Age 34) was fantastic as neurotic wife of Nemo. Clare Stone (Elise Age 15) did a decent job and gave a nice characterization to Elise's character. Linh-Dan Pham (Jean Age 34) & Audrey Giacomini (Age 15) didn't have lengthy roles but they did a good job. Natasha Little as Nemo's mother looks really pretty and she acted really well. The only criticism I had was the ambiguous ending, though too me it seemed like Anna's life was Nemo's real life because the shot between Nemo and Anna in Age 34 re-uniting Again is shown in the end. Anyways still its one of the best cinematic experience I ever had, everyone should watch it with an Active mind only. You will love it!",8,8,14,28 August 2010
Insidious," To have a complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.
","INSIDIOUS – CATCH IT ( A ) Ever since I saw first trailer of Insidious, I knew there was something special about it. Then after its release slowly and gradually it got the critical acclaim and became one of the most successful movies of the year. Insidious cost on $1.5 million and it has so far earned over $76 million, which is a great achievement. Finally, I got the chance to watch Insidious all alone in a dark room. Wow, it literally scared the sh*t out of me, there were moments where I was holding my heart just so I can pass through those scary moments. The best thing about Insidious is it deals with a new supernatural element 'Astral Travelers', which rarely we see in supernatural/horror movies. The director made a great choice to cast Patrick Wilson & Rose Byrne as grieving parents whose son falls into Astral Projection state. Both Wilson and Byrne are famous in indie circle but not on the international level, which makes us really easy to relate to them. Plus both have proved their talent in various movies. Ty Simpkins as Dolton was adorable and impressive, after his innocent face on the poster sold out the movie perfectly. Besides the lead stars, the supporting cast Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell did an amazing job. In Insidious lots of contribution goes to make-up artist & set designer who created the horror with minimal special effects. Brilliant! Overall, to have complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.",9,6,10,21 June 2011
Schindler's List," Masterpiece
","Schindler's List – CATCH IT (A+) Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. (Wiki) Three hours long black & white movie is remarkable in itself. As the whole time you feel like you're in that time zone and not watching a movie but a history in told in the most brutal natural formal way. I was completely surprised when read on end credits that it's direct by Steven Spielberg. The director who mostly directs big fantasy movies from years. Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler as the cunning but sweet hearted man is magnificent. This proves why this man is so well respected and maybe now he has moved to Action (decent) genre we all know what exactly he is capable of. Ralph Fiennes as egoistic Nazi is as despicable as despicable his actions were. In other words he was Incredible. Ben Kingsley is a legend. Overall, even though its 2012, when I finally saw this great Oscar winning movie it's totally worth your three hours.",10,15,23,4 June 2012
Kick-Ass," Brutal, HardCore & Almost Perfect
","KICK ASS – CATCH IT ( A- ) I've been waiting for Kick Ass Since last Summer, because it just the genre I like Comic book, Hardcore, Brutal & SeXxy. KiCk Ass surely Live up to the 95% Of my Expectations, there are some Flaws which can be Cover, Because sometimes it goes Over the top & little Unbelievable. But still it manages to bounds you because Of its strong cast & Script. AarOn JohnsOn is Amazing, Adorable & Cutest Thing On the planet. He is Geeky & Stupid, which is just Adorable. We Love Our Heroes to be Charming & he is Indeed. He is Geeky when he is in School & Kicking Ass when he is Literally Kicking Ass. But its ChlOe Moretz who just stole the ShOw with her Amazing HIT GIRL Avatar, she is so Charming & Adorable that you instantly fall in Love with her & when she starts KiCKing Ass as hit Girl, she literally Blow you Away with Cute FaCe & Body to move like a Weapon. That's Incredible. Nicolas Cage is BIG DADDY is Awesome, I never liked em Besides National Treasure,Face Off & Con Air But he surely is hell Of an Actor. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is good but somehow he didn't looked like Mark Strong's Son. Mark Strong is great as a Villain Again after Star Dust, Sherlock Holmes & now KiCk- Ass, he is the New Best Bad import from U.k.Lyndsy FonSeca is Cute as the love Interest of Aaron Johnson Aka. KICK ASS. Overall a gr8 move to enjoy. Must CATCH IT.",8,4,8,31 July 2010
Unknown," It's not Taken but very close. Little long but the suspense was indeed Something no-one has expected!
","UNKNOWN – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Unknown is pretty good attempt in reviving the success and method of Taken. Liam Neeson has somehow strongly emerged as an action hero thanks to immensely successful surprise blockbuster 'Taken'. Unknown is also as thrilling as Taken was and filmed in beautiful foreign locations but the only thing I didn't like personally was the length of the movie. The story which could have been easily told in 1/2hr movie was told in almost 2hrs. Anyway the suspense was worth it though I think some of the action chase sequences were force just to cash on Taken. Liam Neeson was a perfect choice and trust me he has our sympathy. It's very rare to see an action hero a brilliant actor as well. So, in this case Hollywood as well as the audience is lucky to find him. Dianne Kruger is fantastic. Here I really want to talk about January Jones, she was Ice-Cold (though this is not the movie, she is playing Emma Frost). My memory of January Jones's acting is very forgettable. First time I saw her in 2003 in 'American (Pie 3) Wedding'. And after almost 4 years she became household name in USA with her performance in critically acclaimed 'Mad Med' (Which I yet have to see, so can't comment how great she is in Mad Men). Considerably her critical acclaim she must be brilliant on Mad Men but here she was Gorgeous yet Ice-Cold or maybe she was supposed to be like that as he role required? I'm confused. Overall, it's not Taken but very close. Little long but the suspense was indeed something no-one has expected!",7,0,2,16 June 2011
Children of Men," Its not as great as they say it is! BEWARE
","CHILDREN OF MEN – CATCH IT ( C- ) Children for Men, Well I've been hearing about it since its been released. So, from last 4 yrs I thought I'll watch it but because of Clive Owen I was not interested at all. Well to be honest I don't like him at all, he has always disappointed me in every movie except for CLOSER! Let's talk about movie now, well it's a good attempt but it's not a classic as most of the critics and people suggest. The movie had its moments but I though everything was happening so fast that at one point it seems like too much. 1st Julianne Moore dies, 2nd then the people KEE is living with from months are evil, 3rd Michael Cain powerful security system villains finds in one night which looked like they all living in the same area, 4th out of the blue Mariam gets taken away and get killed obviously, 5th the whole villains gang enter into the refuge camp with full own guns, how even did they pass the security?, 6th in the end the whole army cease fire and gaze at the baby and then suddenly start fighting again and no-one report or try to snatch the baby out from them. Now that was just unbelievable. 7th Clive Dies thanks GOD and 8th we even don't know for sure weather people Kee is going to are even good or not. Anyways it's my Opinion. Clive Owen is like as always fed of his life, this time he actually had the reason to be Julianne Moore is delight as always. Clare-Hope Ashitey was a disappointment; I didn't felt her emotions at all. Overall catch it for its grittiness, the time flies by at least it doesn't let you bore!",2,12,19,31 July 2010

","Män som hatar kvinnor (The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo) - CATCH IT ( A ) Its one of the best thriller, shocking, brutal and riveting movie I've seen in recent times though its 2/1 hrs long but still there is not a single moment you feel bore or wondering what's happening, its powerful that you wont take your eyes out of it The Direction is top notch but it's the haunting performance of NOOMI Rapace , which just captures you and don't let you move Other Powerful performance is by Michael Nyqvist, he is totally into the character and is a brilliant actor I loved the Mesmerizing picture of the missing girl Harriet Vanger (Julia SpOrre) it's not less enchanted then MonaLisa trust me on that! A Brilliant master piece should not to be missed in any case.",9,16,23,28 July 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The boy in striped pyjamas is one of the most painful & mesmerizing movie I've ever seen on Holocaust.
","THE BOY IN STRIPED PYJAMAS – CATCH IT ( A ) The boy in striped pyjamas is one of the most painful & mesmerizing movie I've ever seen on Holocaust. The movie starts slow and it gives us time to understand the whole scenario and premise of the movie. The best part of the movie that it has successfully captured the emotions, fears and commotion during World War II. There are little little things in the movie which indicates the seriousness and violence happening around in Germany. Asa Butterfield (Bruno) provides the utmost innocence & charm to his character and it's his brilliant portrayal which left me speechless in the end. Vera Farmiga is heavenly talented and exquisite. Her elegance and brilliant performance leaves a strong impact. The real surprise for me this time was Rupert Friend, I always think of him as just Keira Knightley's finance but again and again he proved me wrong. first in 'The Young Victoria' where he stand next to Emily Blunt neck to neck & gave a superb performance and now in 'The Boy in Stripped Pyjamas' he completely left me speechless, he was so powerful & brilliant in his expressions, dialogue delivery that I was actually stunned every time he screamed in the movie. I think he is absolutely underrated & I hope he gets his due very soon in Hollywood. Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) and David Thewlin did a respectable job. Overall its one of the movies which made me cried my eyes out its powerful, brilliant and superbly acted. Everyone must take time to watch this brilliant piece of cinema.",9,2,3,17 December 2010
Brave," Red Haired Princess wins hearts
","Brave – CATCH IT (B+) For the first time Pixar decided to make their main protagonist to be a female character. Brave is not like a typical Pixar movie it's more like Disney' princess story though their princess is not naive as usually Disney's princess are. She is Brave & willing to fight for what she wants.The other thing which makes Brave unusual is that it's about a mother, daughter relationship rather than a love story and this is a rare thing for a princess's movie. As usual the animation and especially the red curly hairs are amazing. Brave maybe little weak in story but is sure entertaining. Overall, I would say Brave is stunningly gorgeous and a must seen.",7,3,5,10 December 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Emily Blunt & Matt Damon's electrifying chemistry makes you forget the happy-yet-disappointing dopey ending.
","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU – CATCH IT ( B ) The Adjustment Bureau is a difficult & different. It's not a usual sci-fi movie with lots of special effects and action, its Romantic sci-fi where the hero is fighting with the time/faith to get the girl he loves. It won't be wrong to say that the studio & director has tried their best to make the movie as simple as they can, because even in first 20mints when the bureau appears you understands their method about keeping people on their path so they can be a great help to the world. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt share electrifying on screen chemistry. I've never been Matt Damon's fan though I've always admired his work since 'Good Will hunting' to 'Ocean Eleven' & 'Jason Bourne' franchises to recent note worth roles in The Informant & True Grit. Even with all those big and noteworthy movies, I can never imagine Matt Damon as romantic lead but he still did impress me. Emily Blunt is gorgeous & very talented. Emily Blunt's unlikely pairing with Matt Damon and somehow it work wonders here. Their first meeting in the gent's bathroom is brief but their chemistry just electrify the screen and you can believe why he fight so hard for her. The only thing heavily disappoint in the movie is perfect ending. The ending came off dopey & made the whole experience sort of disappointing. Well they say sometimes the happy Ending ruins everything. Overall, just before last 5mintes the whole movie is immensely enjoyable.",6,0,1,16 June 2011
The Artist," Jean Dujardin & Bérénice Bejo are the soul of the movie...
","The Artist – CATCH IT (A) The Artist relives the charm and cinematic beauty of the silent/mute movies of 1900. You know that the movie is great, when in 40minutes of the movie you barely realize that it's a mute or black & white silent movie. The beauty of the Artist relies purely on their artist's Jean Dujardin & Bérénice Bejo's innocence & Michel Hazanavicius affectionate direction. As far as the story of The Artist is very simple as it's about the ups & down of a superstar. The arrival of talking movies send the mute arrogant super star George Valentine into darkness as he refuses to accept the change in the cinema. The new struggling actress Peppy Miller now becomes the superstar, but she still has strong feeling for George Valentine as she secretly tires save him every point of his downfall. This simple story is told magnificently on the convex like a novel. Oscar winning performance by Jean Dujardin is worth praising. He literally lives the life of George Valentine and never let us realizes that it's been shot in 21st century. Bérénice Bejo is a charmer and she excels in all emotional & comedic scenes. Brilliant. Overall the Artist is something completely refreshing and new for our generations. And I can understand for all the accolades and awards.",9,2,4,19 April 2012
Rio," Rio is bright and colorful but just not funny enough. Still exotic birds and locations keeps us engaging.
","RIO – CATCH IT ( B ) Rio is colorful and delightful but very predictable and not funny enough. The thing we as adults love the most about animated movies these days is that it amuses children along with adults. In case of Rio, it cannot be said, because this was made strictly for children, there is nothing humorous for adults in it besides looking at exotic locations and feathery birds. Rio is visually fantastic and mesmerizing. It won't be wrong to say that the production team has out done their graphics in capturing the true essence of the exotic birds and locations. Blu is voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and I don't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. The whole time it was Jesse Eisenberg we were listening too and not for a second he tried to change his voice to make a unique one for Blu. It was suitable but we will never know what someone else would have brought to the table. On the other hand Anne Hathaway was incredible as voice of Jewel. Not for a second it felt like Anne she really amazed me. Will I.M & Jaime Foxx has to be my favorites next, there combo was great along with George Lopez. Leslie Mann was good but Rodrigo Santoro's character was weird and very amateurish nerdy. Besides the first and last dancing song I personally didn't enjoyed other numbers in the movie. Overall, Rio is a fun entertainer for kids and families.",6,5,8,5 July 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," It should Win Oscar.
","HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON - CATCH IT This is undoubtedly the best movie so far, Its just Amazing. though through the promos the movie looks One Dimensional like its the same story Dragons destroyed the villages and then One Dragon becomes friend... with the Hero and Blah Blah Blah... But its more then that. Simply Incredible bx they showed us that the Dangerous dragons are friendlier and can be the Cutest creatures on planet. I loved everything about it. I can watch over and Over Again and Can't Waite for the Squeal. :-) Every One should watch it Right Away. I truly hope that this movie win and Oscar for presenting something entirely different and hilarious.",10,2,3,2 January 2011
Limitless," Bold & Refreshing, Bradley Cooper & Neil Burger made it intriguing and exciting.
","LIMITLESS – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Limitless is refreshing, it's one of the few movies which takes you along with it and you feel that you totally understand what Eddie is going through or feeling. Heads off to Neil Burger for using two cameras for before & after effects of drugs. That was a brilliant move which made the movie more relatable and understandable. This is a story about Eddie (Bradley Cooper) finds a drug which can make his mind function 100% rather than 20% as normal human beings. Now the story is how to get benefit out of it and how to save this drug from other peoples as he is not the only one relying on it. I won't go into details how he got it or how he use it because you've to see for yourself how nicely and believably they have translated the medicinal element into the story. My top 3 moments in the movie is when Bradley Cooper have the pill for first time and 2nd when he goes to his X brother in law's house and try to find it (it was heart pumping and I wanted him to find it before police come in) and my 3rd favorite moment was when Abbie Cornish goes her home to pick the pills and gets stock by a stalker and then she has to take a pill to save her life. That was just heart pumping. Loved it. Bradley Cooper certainly stole the show with his charming, powerful performance. I loved him in Alias and was extremely upset when he died. Now watching him again on big roles is really good though I thought he came off as cocky in The Hangover & especially A-Team. He was so good in the movie that even his cranky voice didn't bother me this time. Abbie Cornish is good though I still don't know why Hollywood is fascinated by her? It's just like I can never understand fascination with Sienna Miller. Robert De Niro is good in a supporting role. Overall, it's a must see movie of the season, trust me it's interesting.",7,0,0,16 June 2011
Thor," Thor with His Mighty Hammer does Wonders, I wished it had more fights.
","THOR - CATCH IT ( A- ) I've been eagerly waiting for Thor, ever since Chris Hemsworth has been set to play the role of God of Thunder. Unfortunately, just like all summer movies, I wasn't able to watch Thor in cinemas. But now it's out on DVD and I got my hands on it. Wow the movie starts with the Bang, the director doesn't shy away from throwing Thor right into our faces. Though, Thor is not The most popular Comic Book Icon and Chris Hemsworth is a complete newcomer. The director Kenneth Branagh presented the Asgard world with so much conviction that it didn't look strange at all. Thor with his giant Hammer is something to watch. The charisma and arrogance Mr. Hemsworth carries is Commendable. Marvel got the Perfect Thor and Loki. On one side Thor is perfect God of Thunder, Loki is a perfect mischief Child. Tom Hiddleston did a fantastic job in playing Loki. I was completely stunned by his honest emotional and devious portray. Natalie Portman is delightful; it feels good to see a girl in a movie. Who you really adore, that totally boosts up the screen. After winning an Oscar, Natalie Portman is on heights. And this role added an additional Blockbuster in to her lap. I hope she returns for Thor 2, because only then it will be more convincing to see Thor coming back for Jane. Though apparently, Thor will return to earth in 'The Avengers' with all other Marvel Heroes. So, it'll be interesting to see how it all set up together. Kat Denning did make me laugh with her on liners. Besides them Jaimie Alexander did stood out as she looked Stunning as Sif. Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Jean Russo, Idris Alba, Clark Gregg and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye are really good. With all perfect casting, performances, CGI, the only thing lacking in the end was Big Earthly Action Sequence. The town looked too small and fake to be real. There were barley few people when they though Loki send a Robotic thing to destroy them, it was little unconvincing. So, overall, Thor almost Lives up to expectation and I can't wait to see Thor 2 and Thor in 'The Avengers' movie.",7,0,1,28 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," depressing and haunting
","There will be Blood – CATCH IT (A) The buzz surrounding Paul Thomas Anderson's Scientology-esque Film 'The master' is getting bigger and bigger. This led me to watch his previous Oscar nominated movie 'There will be Blood' which I was somehow not able to watch (I don't like Daniel Day-Lewis, don't know the reason) over the years. There will be Blood is a hardcore look into the life of a oil man in 19th century played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sitting through There will be Blood is one of the darkest experiences of my life. The Gothic background score and dark performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and creepy Paul Dano were more than I had ever anticipated. The direction, background score, screenplay and performances of the movie are simply outstanding. This is nothing like we see on regular basis. It takes lots of courage and heart to direct something so dark and bizarre that it makes you question everything around it. Daniel Day-Lewis well deserved Oscar winning performances is haunting and memorable. This man surely knows how to divulge into dark roles (Scratch NINE out of your head right now). Paul Dano is so good that you want to hate him from bottom of your heart. I have never hated a teen since that whinny little ***** boy from 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close'. In the end, There will be Blood is a depressing and haunting story of family, greed, religion and most importantly oil. Highly Recommended!",9,2,4,10 September 2012

","Ice Age: Continental Drift – CATCH IT (B+) What we can say about Ice Age, love it or hate it you will go and watch these crazy fun animals surviving the Ica Age. The first movie was excellent but after that we all know what to expect from Ice Age franchise. And let's be honest so far they have delivered their best. The story may not be that refreshing or something extraordinary but they do manage to make us laugh and involve in their adventures.The voices by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Peter Dinklage, Wanda Sykes, Heather Morris, Drake and Nicki Minaj.In the end, I enjoyed Ice Age 4 but just like the previous installment in the end it was little too loud but hey it's a kid's movie so I think it OK.",7,5,6,10 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Johnny Depp's most terrible movie in recent years
","Dark Shadows – TRASH IT (C) A good movie adaptations or remake is the one, which is for everyone whether they know or not from where it was adopted. Dark Shadows is not only a corny adaptation of the famous US soup opera but it is also doesn't stand alone as a movie on its feet regardless of its original source of material. I think everyone knows about this Vampire Soap Opera or if you don't you can watch its trailers. Let's talk about the movie, It won't be wrong to say that this the worst collaborative effort between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, even though I was not a huge fan of the Chocolate factory but still that was entertaining and had heart to it. This time Tim Burton's heavy soap opera direction looked flawed and pretentious. Johnny Depp's performance is always a treat to watch in Tim Burton's movie but this time he was just pale Gothic looking caricature delivering lines. The only good thing about Dark Shadows is Eva Green and her witchy smile. This woman looks marvelous and her evil antics with supreme confidant steal the show. Chloe Grace Moretz is undoubtedly the most promising young star but this time she had few funny lines but twist in the end just makes her look completely silly. Bella Heathcote is gorgeous but she doesn't get much scope in it. Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pfiffer alright as always but there is nothing interesting in their characters. In the end, it's a disappointing big budget summer movie with stealer cast and horrible characterization.",3,1,2,5 September 2012

","INCEPTION – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Wow A Dream in a Dream in a Dream in a Dream. Shocking right? But trust me that's all Inception is about! Who thought that our dream world can be so fascinated, I think only Mr. Christopher Nolan did! Sometimes a movie is so gripping and intriguing that you forget to take a breath and trust me missing one moment from this movie is like missing out on the whole story and concept. The thing I loved about the movie was how beautifully and simply Christopher Nolan explained his Dream world to us without presenting it in confusing or disturbing way. Christopher Nolan proves that he is literally par excellence and his work speaks for him too. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio was a Brilliant choice, his performance was really impressive yet Again. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shine this time around and his Gravity fight was Wow Wow and Wow, I can watch that fight hundred times, it was just simply one of the most Amazing fight sequences ever pasteurized on cellulite. Ellen Page was impressive and stands out among all male ensembles. Marion Cotillard as the deceased wife of Leo was Amazing, it's so good to see her every time in Big movies like Public Enemies, Nine and now Inception. She stands out in all these movies in front of Bigger and Senior names than her. Tom Hardy is such a fantastic new Breeze into the movie, it was his first major big Hollywood movie and he doesn't disappoint at all! Ken Watanabe did a decent job. Cillian Murphy is a pro and never disappoints. Dileep Rao, Lukas Haas. Tom Berenger and Michael Cain were good. Overall Inception is a Mind Boggling, Incredible, Outstanding and Brilliant Modern Master Piece. The Dream in a Dream in a Dream in a Dream... Wow :-O . WATCH IT! P.S – The ending was not a Dream – Michael Cain",10,1,8,1 November 2010
Rango," Rango is a delightful surprise out of its creepiness. It's funny, utterly disgusting and highly entertaining.
","RANGO – CATCH IT ( B+ ) I hate lizards and watching a movie about lizard's adventure was one of the toughest things to do, believe it or not I practically shut it down 3-4 times as I couldn't bear to watch a Green lizard on screen. But eventually, I got over it and then I really started to enjoy it. It won't be wrong to say that it's full of ugly looking creatures/insects/reptiles etc. in a movie ever. Now, if I surpass my hatred for the rats and reptiles etc. These filthy creatures also make this movie unique and amusing. After The Ring & Pirates trilogy, Gore Verbinski impresses us with his direction again. He rightly uses the voice talents from ever adoring Johnny Depp (who made us to Love Pirates & kind of Green Chameleon), to Isla Fisher as Deserts Iguana to Abigail Breslin as Cactus mouse to all other supporting weird ugly looking creatures. Rango is a delightful surprise out of its creepiness. It's funny, utterly disgusting and highly entertaining.",7,1,3,3 July 2011
Centurion," A good attempt which could have been great!
","CENTURION Â– CATCH IT ( B ) Centurion is one of those movies which try  to cover its flaws with heavy violent action sequences. The best part  of the movie is its locations and cinematography, I was amazed by each  and single frame of the movie, they have shot at some of the most  beautiful unseen locations and it makes the movie a treat to watch. I  hoped that if the screen play would have been as strong as the  cinematography of the movie is. Michael Fassbender is the hottest star right now after Hunger, Fish Tank, Inglorious Bastards,  Eden Lake, 3OO and now Centurion he surely has made a Big place in my  heart as an actor. Though this movie didn't justice to his acting  abilities but he surly did cover it with great sword action sequences.  Olga Kurylenko did a fine job though she played a Mute Character still  with her looks and fighting sequences she proved yet again why she is  been most favorite for action roles. Imogen Poots looked really pretty  though she comes in last 30 minutes still she leaves a good impact. All  the other men were good and supported the movie really well. Overall a  good attempt which could have been great!",Null,28,56,12 August 2010
Prometheus," Its a Sci-fi Adventure not Sci-fi Horror (Don't get confuse)
","Prometheus – CATCH IT (A-) Prometheus is one of the most anticipated movies of 2011. Prequel/sequel speculation has been started from years since Ridley Scott showed interest in directing a sci-fi adventure. Prometheus is about a team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. After viewing Prometheus I realize that it's a sci-fi adventure movie not a sci-fi horror like Aliens. Ridley Scott took us back into that world but this time with completely different agenda. This time the explorer went to space to find the source to humankind in simple words they went to find GOD. Prometheus is one of those movies which doesn't answer any questions and leave all questions unanswered in the end. Sadly there are not answers in the movie either like Memento or any other confusing movie you would recall. The production value, CGI and cast are simply fantastic in Prometheus. While watching Prometheus even though you don't get any answers to what's happening and where they are exactly. You still enjoy the movie because of strong set up and performances. I would defiantly agree that the story was very bleak and incomplete. And I wished they worked hard on the story and on the purpose of what they are trying to sell us. Noomi Rapace got worldwide recognition for her stunning portrayal of Lisbeth Slander in 'The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo' trilogy. Breaking off of that strong image is a hard task and Noomi Rapace is trying her best. She was good in Sherlock Holmes 2 but her character didn't have any importance in the movie. This time she gets to shine and no one can deny from the fact that she stand on her own and the dissection scenes are extremely powerful. (Though I don't understand where everybody was when she was running in pain to Charlize Theron's room for dissection of her stomach?). Michael Fassbender is simply outstanding. He is such a raw talent and Hollywood is lucky to have such an amazing talent who does everything with perfection. Charlize Theron as the woman trying hard to find the answer to her mission millions miles away from earth is amazing. This is undoubtedly her year as Evil Queen in 'Snow White and the Huntsman:' and now in 'Prometheus' she is simply amazing. Logan Marshall-Green has a structure to be anything, he is just amazing looking man. If a good script provided he can do wonders with it. Guy Pierce, Idris Elba and Sean Harris are good in their respective parts. Overall, Prometheus fails to answer any questions but it's the whole set up that intrigues you and even though you may feel little irritated in the end just like me you can wait for its sequel.",8,1,5,1 October 2012
Despicable Me," Despicable Me is just like Bolt & Cloudy with the Meatballs, which are entertaining but just not FUNNY.
","DESPICABLE ME â€“ CATCH IT ( B ) Despicable Me is a good animation experience but not great. I feel the story was repeated hundred times before. When you get the privilege to create an animation world, where you can introduce whole new world all together, creators should have used that privilege to full extent but they didn't. Despicable Me fails in that department, the yellow miniatures thumbs are really funny & cute but besides that we didn't found anything funny or exciting in the movie. Despicable Me choose two repetitive stories, 1) One guy wants to bring another guy down on any means. 2) An angry man somehow becomes caretaker of Orphans and in beginning he hates them and in the end he becomes the dutiful father figure. So, we have seen this million times before on Big Screen and on T.V, So, when the movie was over it was almost forgettable for me because when you're watching it, it's all colorful and Bright but once it's over, you don't even remember it. Besides that it's very one dimensional, I mean its all about the villainsÂ… What people or government thinks about the villains or about capturing them? They just announce on T.V that someone has stolen Egypt pyramid or Moon? That's all? Their is nothing mentioned about people or government living in that villains world. Steve Carrel is admirable for his Russian accent (I think it was Russian) and Jason Segel did well as the villain in PJs. Despicable Me is just like Bolt & Cloudy with the Meatballs, which are entertaining but just not FUNNY.",6,1,4,5 December 2010
X-Men: First Class," Almost Perfect
","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS – CATCH IT ( A- ) X-Men: First Class introducing into the friendship of Professor-X and Magneto. The movie starts with their childhood, where we see how one lives a perfect life and other tormented. We have been aware of story and believes of Professor X and Magneto. They have been clearly showed in previous X movies. The X-Men:First Class is a really good movie which some great action sequences specially in the end and where all young mutants get attacked by Sebastian Shaw and his disciples. The movie did a really decent job in presenting each mutant and its talent plus in bringing variety of youngsters all together. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbeder complemented each other to the fullest. Though, I felt we didn't get to see them spending much quality time which indicate the true friendship. Michael Fassbender has this power to adopt every role, this man never disappoints. He shines through his roles. James McAvoy was a perfect choice to play Mr.Nice & Naughty Professor-X. after the lead mutants, Jennifer Lawrance Aka. Raven Aka. Mystique got the best scope in showing her adjustment with being BLUE. Stepping into Hot shoes of Rebecca Romijn is a huge deal. We have been seeing Mystique unique, tall and sexy. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like her but she sue is great actress. I think she was better human than Mystique in this movie. Nicholas Hoult is charming as geek but as Beast, well he was more of a wolf than a Beast. Lucas Till is stunning in swinging flames. I just love his heavy voice since Hanna Montana. Zoe Kravitz is sweet little sultry Angel. Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee is cool, he get to do some amazing stunts. Edi Gathegi as Darwin, Jason Flemyng as Azazel, Álex González as Riptide were good. Now lets talk about other cast Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert is top on the weird CIA Agent. Oliver Platt as The Man in Black was right out of 'The Big C'. Kevin Beccon as Sebastian Shaw is pretty good. He wasn't as strong but he was wicked. January Jones as Emma Frost is Ice-Cold and apparently if too be believed she is Ice Cold in real life too. I think it won't be wrong to say that this girl has become the 2nd most hated actress in Hollywood after Katherine heigl. Their imagine in media is not shaping good. Anyways just like in Unknown she was Ice cold in this movie too and luckily she was the Perfect choice. So, the X-Men: First Class is almost perfect movie with some great action and performances but still their was something missing just like in Thor. There is something missing in movies that has not been able to made them A 101% Perfect Roller coaster ride. P.S Cameos by Rebecca Romijn as Mystique – older, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Sasha Pieterse as Teenage Girl by the aquarium are appreciated And I was shocked to see Brendan Fehr as almost Nonspeaking Communications Officer's role.",7,1,4,28 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan does it again!
","The Dark Knight Rises – CATCH IT (A) It won't be wrong to say that The Dark Knight Rises is the most anticipated movie of the year. The anticipation begun the movement you finished watching the incredible The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan has not only taken Batman to another level but he somehow changed the whole concept of comic hero and gave them more edge and Gothic attire. The Dark Knight Rises is about the aftermath in Gotham City after death of Harvey Dent and disappearance of the Batman. It's been eight years since Batman disappeared and now a masked man Bane with an evil agenda is taking over Gotham city. Christopher Nolan is a genius and for a movie which runs 165 mints he makes it engaging and very entertaining. Even though it was very hard to understand what Bane was staying most of the time, still its whole Christopher Nolan's notion that makes you excited. Christian Bale is great as Batman yet again and has proved that he is best Batman ever lived. The movie gives lots of dimensions to his character and from grim to Batman to injured and imprisoned. His character goes through a lot in this Batman movie. After Heath Ledger as Joker, Anne Hathaway undoubtedly the best thing happened to this Batman franchise. Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle steals the show just like The Hulk did in The Avengers. She excels and presents a very excellent combination of action, humor and emotions. The only thing sad is that we won't be able to see her in future as Jewel thief Selena Kyle or Catwoman. Tom Hardy as Bane is perfect, he has the physique for it but Bane's character is complicated and in the end it seems like a fizzle. You see this brutal hardcore man the whole time fearing him and in the end it's revealed that he is nothing but a puppet doing everything on the name of unspoken love. Joseph Gordon Levitt is good even though he did annoy me in the beginning since he was almost in every single shot but in the end his true identity in the Batman world is revealed and you wonder what it would have been seeing him working along Batman. Gary Oldman, Marion Cotilard, Michael Cane, Juno Temple, Josh Pence, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are good in their respective roles. In the End, The Dark Knight Rises is a great entertaining movie. Even though, the movie is flawed and features one of the most horrible deaths of all time. Still Christopher Nolan has been able to capture the true essence of Batman and also made us sit and get anxious throughout 165mints. I must say the last scene brings a full fledged smile on your face and you just cannot stop cheering. Highly Recommended!",9,4,10,5 September 2012
Toy Story 3," Toys on Big Adventure! never Disappoint
","TOY STORY 3 - CATCH IT ( A+ ) Every time I see Toy Story movie, I wonder what next the creators can have stored for us and to be honest I get stunned every time, it was very recently I saw Toy Story 1 & 2 in 2010, So, I was very excited for the Toy Story 3 and finally I got my hands on it. When it started I wonder what will they do now but trust me the creators know what they are going into and they give us what we want Toys on Big Adventure! Every moment from first till last a person keep wondering what will happened next? as the things take unexpected turn every other moment. The Toy Story trilogy have been as engaging as any thriller/adventure movie can be. I loved every part of it and can't wait for them to make another Toy Story because their story can be enjoyed by everyone whether kid, young, adult or old people.",10,1,1,24 October 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," disappointing venture
","Elizabeth: The Golden Age – TRASH IT (C-) After watching Elizabeth it was hard to believe that the same director can make such shallow, tedious Elizabeth movie. Everything we fall in love with Elizabeth was gone in this movie. Nonetheless Cate Blanchett was superb and astonishing as she was in Elizabeth but it's the mediocre script which wastes so much time on mockery and love story between the pirate, the Queen and her Lady. Abbie Cornish is overrated, she is boring and even as Queen's lady she doesn't have the elegance. She is sure pretty but not elegant. Clive Owen is misfit and I actually don't really like him. I don't think he ever gave a Hit movie. And this man has worked with Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Keira Knightely, Nicole Kidman and here with Cate Blanchett. I mean he has worked with all big directors and actress but never sure shot hit in years. Overall, don't waste your time on this disappointing venture. The only thing good is Cate Blanchett and the costumes.",2,0,0,4 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Charming & Delightful... Great family adventure movie
","Moonrise Kingdom – CATCH IT (A) Moonrise Kingdom is a breath of fresh air in mist of highly glamorous and commercializes Hollywood. There is very few family adventure movies are made these days. As no one has the time to work on their characters and bring something pure out of their heart but Moonrise Kingdom changes that and bring something so delightful that it's hard to imagine that it's a Hollywood movie.Moonrise Kingdom is set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. This shakes everything in a calm town where hardly any incident happens so various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down. Wes Anderson has directed a delightful, funny and intelligent movie which is beyond all typical clichés. It brings back the innocence of first love and to do anything for your first love. The performances by young newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are simply great. Their non famous faces, innocence and curiosity bring freshness and honesty to the movie. Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and all the scout kids are simply brilliant.It won't be wrong to say that Moonrise Kingdom is the most delightful, playful and innocent movie of 2012. There are very few movies which makes you feel good about life in general. Highly Recommended.",9,2,4,2 October 2012
RED," Red completely justified to its Slogan 'Retired-Extreme-Dangerous'. Thumbs Up!
","RED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Red completely justified to its Slogan 'Retired-Extreme-Dangerous'. The whole movie plays out really cool, funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action, Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a non-stop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED, I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit, Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! Mary-Louise Parker is adorable, after watching her racy/funny side on 'WEEDS' from almost 4, 5 years; it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch, the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Mary-Louise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious; I never knew this man can be so funny, his moves, dialogues thus every thing was great, and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess, though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren, who just simply stole the show, seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable. She brought the utmost charisma to the team of RED. The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban, his tux made him move like 007 & he gave an utmost completion to the RED team, the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox, Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!",7,82,115,19 October 2010
Looper," Looper is a surprise scifi winner, not ambiguous like Prometheous
","Looper - CATCH IT (A-)Looper turns out to be the most surprising and suspenseful sci-fi of the year. The shock value definitely relies in strong screenplay and performances by all actors. The director who brought the best out of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Brick almost a decade ago has done it again.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is getting better and better which each release. Emily Blunt is an unusual casting for playing southern mother trying to protect her child but I think it's really refreshing to see her doing something contemporary and not indie. Bruce Willis is great this time around. In supporting cast Piper Perabo, Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels, Noah Segan and young kid Peirce Gagnon did a fine job.In the End, Looper is an interesting concept and much much easier to understand. With some really interesting twists and turns it's quite entertaining.",7,2,5,11 December 2012
Footloose," Kenny Wormald & Julianne Hough will surprise you
","FOOTLOOSE (B+) The Remake of 1984's Classic had trouble from the beginning. Zac Efron quit the project & then Chace Crawford was shuffled aside along with director. I always thought Chace Crawford was a good choice and when the promos released, I hated Kenny Wormald but after watching the movie last Night, I think 'Kenny Wormald' was indeed the best part of the movie. Playing cocky is tough because you start hating the character, but Kenny Wormald played cockiness with such an ease & confidence that you would like him to succeed in his mission for abolition of laws against dancing & music. Kenny Wormald's is a born dance and his dancing skills can easily be seen in Footloose. Besides Kenny Wormald, the second surprise is Julianne Hough as I've seen her dancing & music videos but never thought she is so pretty. Julianne Hough looked sweet & damn sexy, she completely radiates through the screen. Not only she is a fine dancer, but a fine actress too. Overall, Footloose is fun flick, with fun country music & dancing. worth watching.",7,2,8,12 February 2012
Get Him to the Greek," Well it's the most Hardcore, Raunchy and Neurotic thing ever.
","GET HIM TO THE Greek – CATCH IT ( B- ) Well it's the most Hardcore, Raunchy and Neurotic thing ever. The hardcore dialogues are so heavy that they are thrown directly on your face and trust me you won't resist laughing you're A** out. sadly just like Judd Apatow recent flicks this also goes out over the top in-between and does things in the end, just to make it more genuine which is sad because when the purpose of Russell band and Jonah Hall is to have fun why to over bored us with friendship and care dilemma. Anyways, Russell Band is Hilarious and Raunchy as you have never seen him before (though I hate to see Katy Perry marrying that Drag Queen), Jonah Hill is funny and Adorable but C'mon loose some Weight he was too big for the screen. Seriously, you are booking jobs but it doesn't mean you just keep growing into a Fat Cow. Rose Byrne is like never before, she is Nasty with Capital N, who knew that sweet looking girl like Rose Byrne can say and do nasty thing like that.. It was just Mind Boggling. Elizabeth Moss is really cute and refreshing. Love her. Kanye West is the MAN, he was funny, hilarious and simply DOP. His Mind-f****ing theory was Hilarious. Overall it's a fun movie and if the director wouldn't have gone over board with the characters and cut the movie in to ½ hrs instead of almost 2hrs, it could have been more effective but nonetheless watch it for some of the sickest things you have ever seen on Celluloid. Hey did I mention 3∑ between Russell Band, Jonah Hill and lovely Elizabeth Moss. Hilarious. LOL.",5,2,7,22 September 2010
300," Spectacular
","300 – CATCH IT (A) 300 is a trend setter which not only introduced a new technology but took the gore and violence to next level. I saw 300 when it was released in bits and pieces but now finally got the chance to watch the complete movie from start to finish. Well I've to say I was blown away it was indeed something spectacular and even after 6 years still no one has done anything like it. Even though Spartacus TV show does have managed to capture the essence in its budget. Gerard butler, Michael Fassbender, Lena Heady, Tom Wisdom, Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro did a fantastic job. The main hero of the movie was defiantly Zack Zynder & graphic designers. They created a new world for us just like Star Wars, Jurassic Park or Avatar. Now I simply cannot wait for 300: Battle of Artemisia with Sullivan Stapleton, Evan Green and Rodrigo Santoro reprising as Xerxes.",9,6,10,11 June 2012
Easy A," Easy A is the Most Smartest Teen movie I've ever Seen...Its Xtremly Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box. Emma Stone Rocked it!
","EASY A – CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!",9,53,99,28 November 2010
Rockstar," Victim of Incomplete & Bad Editing
","Rock Star â€“ CATCH IT (C+) Rock star is one of the most confusing incomplete movies ever made in India. The story is simple but the presentation and execution is way confusing. The movie shows life and love of rock star singer of a different kind. During all 2 and half hours, it jumps forward 4years then comeback 2 years then again jump forward 4yeas then 2years back then again 4years forward and 2years back. Two things only stand out in the movie, A.R.Rahman's fabulous music and Ranbir Kapoor's superb performance. That's the only reason to sit through 2 and half hours of rock star. Nargis the new girl didn't look Kashmiri or married or even anyone from Indian cultural values. There is no characterization to her character, whether she is married or not she lives the same life. Poor direction, poor ending in hurry and wrong actress casting makes rock star dreary most of the time. Overall, watch it for its music and off course Ranbir Kapoor.",4,1,4,30 April 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Entertaining...
","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted – CATCH IT (B+) Madagascar is another franchise like Ice Age which has captivated audience's attention worldwide. By comparing both the franchises we are able to see the loving creatures fighting for their survival in unlikely circumstances. In Ice Age they are fighting the natural disasters and in Madagascar they just want to go back Home and funny thing is they don't know which one is there home after living so long in the ZOO. Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe where they are relentlessly pursued by the fanatical Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). As a means of getting passage to North America, the zoo animals purchase a failing traveling circus as they become close friends with the staff like Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), Gia (Jessica Chastain), and Stefano (Martin Short). Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is. I think Madagascar has gone better with each installment, as their characters develop more and more. I had really fun time watching them trying going back to the ZOO. The new characters were funny and welcome addition. And have to admit fanatical Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand) character was something really impressive. In the end it's another fun movie about our favorite characters and cannot wait to see them on another fun adventure.",7,2,3,10 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Impressive Writing... Nice
","The Cabin in the Woods - Catch It (A-) The Cabin in the woods is a smart horror movie rewriting the horror genre and showing how much people love to see other people in torture. Over the years people have forgotten that we're not any different from the people we see in movies like Hostel, the Tournament or now Cabin in the Woods. where people pay to see other people in torture just like us. As it's obvious from the name Cabin in the Woods, it's about a Cabin isolated in the woods visited by 5 friends representing our modern characterized social stigma on today's generation. The Athlete 'Chris Hemsworth', The Whore 'Anna Hutchison', The Scholar 'Jesse Williams', The Fool 'Fran Kranz' & The Virgin 'Kristen Connolly'. The movie doesn't hide anything from the start as it's begins with the people sitting in some laboratory watching 5 friends getting ready to leave for vacations. This somehow nicely allowed to bring humor in horror and made it really funny at times. This is called smart writing. The performances by all five actors Chris Hemsworth, Jesse Williams, Anna Hutchison, Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz and others in basement are good. In my opinion the movie is almost great till the end. In the end the reason behind all of this torture suffering or sacrifice gave it a supernatural twist from the psycho/scientific one. But anyways On the whole, the movie is really twisted and entertaining. Must watch it!",8,0,4,22 August 2012

","THE RUNAWAYS – CATCH IT ( B ) An Erotic movie on The Runaways band, it looked like Autobiography, which is kind of good and bad too. At one point it's too much of Darkness, and watching Dakota Fanning doing drugs and Sex is Disturbing. Overall Good attempt. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were the stars of the movie, acted really well and looked like Cherry Curry and Joan jett. Amazing. Give it a shoot it's not the usual Hollywood movie it's darker and Rock N Roll! if anyone is interested in the documentary about Olden Teenage Rock and Roll its for them. though I really would have loved if the story was bit more sharper!",6,0,5,31 July 2010
The Social Network," Its David Fincher's smart direction, Aaron Sorkin's sharp screenplay & Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today!
","THE SOCIAL NETWORK – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Undoubtedly, 'The Social Network' is the most fascinating movie of 2010. In the beginning it was hard for me to get grip of the movie as the dialogues are really fast, smart & clever between Jesse Eisenberg (Mark) & Rooney Mara (Erika) and then there was three things happened simultaneously, A Harvard College life & two case proceedings. Once I got the grip of the movie after 15minutes then I actually started to enjoy it plus I realize how smart the writing, direction and editing have been done. Every scene, dialogue & actor comes on screen are captivating. Its David Fincher's smart direction, Aaron Sorkin's sharp screenplay & Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today! Now let's talk about wonderful performances by talented young cast.Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg): I've always found Jesse one note of an actor, who plays geek or dorky and always acts the same in every movie ever since Cursed (Horror), Adventurland (coming of age comedy) or Zombieland (Thriller/Comedy) but this is the first time he plays genius, evil, jealous, liar & manipulative geek with utmost perfection. I think it was a huge huge jump from his previous performances. In every scene, he was so convincing in whatever he says & does that you actually believe that he is the ultimate evil genius. I truly wish he gets the Oscar nod because he justly deserves it. Andrew Garfield (Eduardo Saverin): When I heard Andrew Garfield signed on to play 'Spider Man' I've got my hands on his previous notable works and I saw 'Boy A' he was superb in the movie. I loved his performance so much that I started watching his other movies like 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' & 'Red Riding: In the Year of Our Lord 1974'. In all his previous movies he was Brilliant. Now in The Social Network, he again proved that he is superbly talented & the ultimate British talented lad in Hollywood. His performance is so brilliant in the movie that, I was actually rotting for him the entire time and hated Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg). Andrew Garfield will defiantly get an Oscar nod for his honest portrayal. Armie Hemmer (Cameron Winklevoss/Tyler Winklevoss) & Josh Pence (Tyler Winklevoss): Armie Hemmer got me do WOW every single time he was on screen, he was par excellence. I remember Armie Hemmer through his stint on Gossip Girl, at that time I found him very mature for his age and the reason was his strong voice and looks. Now after watching The Social Network, I have realized how good actually his voice is and that it actually made the 'Winklevoss Twins' so strong, believable & 6.5 foot tall. I think Armie Hemmer should get big rewards for his performance as both Twins. Josh Pence was the 'Blonde Winklevoss body' but later on digitally they put Armie's face on his body. Still I am mentioning him here because he deserved to be mentioned. Justin Timberlake (Sean Parker): Justin Timberlake was great, in 5 seconds you completely forget that he is JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & he becomes Sean Parker only. I loved how confidently he acted as Sean parker, who is fast, mean & cunning. No wonder he is been getting so many accolades for his portrayal.Max Minghella (Divya Narendra): Max has relatively small part as compare to all other actors but still he was significant part of the whole story. He was natural as always. Rooney Mara (Erica Albright): Rooney Mara was Amazing, strong and Sharp. She was in the first Break-up scene and then came for two more scenes only and still she leaves a strong impact. I loved her expressions where she finds out Mark has written awful things about her on his blog. She was flawless, can't wait to see her as Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.Brenda Song (Christy Lee): Brenda Song was hot, adorable & nothing like London Tipton of 'The Suite Life on Deck'. I pleasantly surprise to see her in such adult role & defiantly want to see her more. Loved her!Dakota Johnson (Amelia Ritter), Malese Jow (Alice Cantwel), Rashida Jones (Marylin Delpy), Joseph Mazzello (Dustin Moskovitz), Patrick Mapel (Chris Hughes), and Trevor Wright (Josh Thompson): They were young & Hot simple as that! Overall, a fascinating true story told in a fascinating & captivating way. A must see by everyone who is addicted to Facebook or not! A sure Oscar contender & Winner. (Inception & Black Swan can have a hard time).",10,0,1,19 December 2010
In the Land of Blood and Honey," First half is great but falls flat in 2nd half, still recommended!
","In the Land of Blood and Honey – CATCH IT (B-) Angelina Jolie selected the most controversial topic as her directorial debut. A movie about a Bosnian woman falling in love and revenging Serb soldier. From decades there have been many movies about World War I and especially World War II but we rarely see movies about Bosnia War or any war specifically involving Muslims as victims. The Bosnia War is one of the most prejudice wars against Muslims in recent history in which the world just stood there and watched it. They intervened but the damage was already done, Serbs with lesser quantity ruling the Muslim Bosnian territory. The first half of the movie is truly eyes opening it shows how Serbs attacked Bosnian houses, massacred their men and then took their woman to make them as their whores and camps workers. They humiliated the women in front of everyone and treat them as trash. It opens your eyes when you see the humility women have to suffered during the war, not only they lost their men, husbands, children but have to lived as Serbs sex slaves. As the first half is strong the second half is extremely week as it shifts its focus of the war to the love between Serb and the Bosnian woman. In most of the scenes we see them talking and just making love. Maybe Angelina Jolie didn't have much budget to capture the Bosnian movement to suppress the Serbs so she shot second part mostly indoors. Anyways it leads to a disappointing and dull ending. The performances by lead actors are commendable. Zana Marjanovic as the Bosnian woman is great, this role is really tough and required an actress who can pull off. She did a great a job in bold role like this. Goran Kostic as Serb soldier is good but I don't find him that good of an actor to be in lead. I think this made it more like an unattractive pairing and the chemistry is all right between them. On the whole, making a movie about such sensitive subject movie is commendable and I truly wised if Angelina Jolie made the second half as appealing as the first half. Still watch it to understand what Bosnia has gone through during its civil war.",5,3,13,3 July 2012
The Fighter," The Fighter is a Crazy Dramatic look into the life of Dysfunctional family of Mickey Ward. Highly Entertaining.
","THE FIGHTER – CATCH IT ( A ) The Fighter is truly a pleasant surprise for me as wrestling or boxing movies have never been my forte but it's good to see that it's more about dramatic dysfunctional family rather than just Boxing. The True story of Irish Mickey Ward and his brother Dick 'Dicky' Ecklund is a really inspiring. The best thing about the movie is that its fast paced and clever, there are no loose or slow moments in the movie. Mark Wahlberg played Mickey Ward with utmost dedication and essence. Christian Bale, what an actor he is, in every movie he becomes the character and in 5 seconds we completely forget that he is the BATMAN. He not only lost his weight for the role but he also lost sophistication too, which was highly required for Dicky Ecklund. He truly deserves all the awards and accolades.. Besides Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, the women of 'The Fighter' are also the True Fighters. O'God Melissa Leo is Spot On as Agonizing Mother; she looked so effing real that it's unbelievable. Its not like we haven't see roles like that it's just What Melissa Leo brought to the role was Commendable. Amy Adams yet again gave a brilliant performance as Mickey Ward's girl friend. The way she stand up in front of Mickey's mom and painful 7 bit*h sisters was Outstanding. Whenever she opened her mouth it amazed it. Bravo! The Se7en sisters were fun to watch. Overall, The Fighter is a Crazy Dramatic look into the life of Mickey Ward. Highly Entertaining. Must catch it!",9,2,3,24 January 2011
