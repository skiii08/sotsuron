Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," rolling on the floor
","me and my buddy have a thing - we laugh at anything anywhere anytime. All we need is a push - a weird expression or a dumb innocent person - and we're off laughing like those clowns in circus. We both ofter gather together at least once in a month to watch comedy movies in theaters or at home. I tell you, people hate us when we're at the theaters because we qiss the audience off with our giggles and comments even at a touching moment in a film.About this film- it was a blasting start for us- we burst into laughter the moment we saw his face and heard his accent. We laughed at his people, place, accents, etc absolutely everything. We paused the movie and kept rolling on the floor laughing, then we rewind the scene and again laugh till our bellies begged for mercy.This is one of the best comedy films. I'd give it 20 out of 10 ratings if I owned this website. It took us 3 hours to finish the movie after all those pauses, rewinds and pukes. Oh yeah, we threw the burgers out we ate while watching the movie.This is a must watch for cool guys like us who make fun of people's accents, behaviors and dumbness.",10,2,3,5 August 2012
Horrible Bosses," decent comedy
","In the beginning, I had had a mindset of thinking less of these actors being together, I was really doubtful if it could be a good comedy movie. But when I began to watch, it went more and more interesting and at the end of the movie I texted to 9-10 friends of mine and told them to watch the movie.Once again, Jason Sudeikis did his best. According to me, he doesn't need be the supporting role for the likes of Adam Sandler or Gerard Butler to be successful. He seems well established and we all are expecting more of him in coming years.Once again Jennifer Aniston looked stunningly hot. The plot was good. Many funny moments in the movie were really hilarious. I am not gonna post spoilers for those who are yet to watch the movie. It's worth watching 3-4 times. :)",10,1,3,23 December 2011
The Butterfly Effect," Best Movie ever
","I bought the DVD thinking of it as a children movie with a little bit mystery. I am 20, though I love children movies. When I started to watch the movie, I found it a little confusing. It was 1 AM when I started to watch the movie, and oh my god...when I finished watching...I was absolutely gone mad!! HOW IN THE WORLD CAN ANYONE THINK OF SUCH A STORY?? All the time lines and blackouts were so perfect!!!The movie was playing on my mind for couple of days after. I always tried to think what I would have done if I were in place of him.Seriously...I don't have enough words to explain what I feel about this movie. It's worth watching 4-5 times. 10/10 from me!! :)P.S. I'm sorry for my poor English. I just wanna say the movie is perfect all the ways!! It's my most favorite movie. :)",10,1,3,19 May 2009
P.S. I Love You," Better than the book. It's a must watch for true lovers.
","I had read the book quite a while ago. But it didn't make me cry that much I needed. I was also fantasizing about Gerry to be Ashton Kutcher and Holly being Lindsay Lohan.When I came to know that Gerrard and Hillary were selected as the main characters, I was happy!! And I also found it a little funny because their nicknames are just as the characters do have.The first scene of the movie was cool. 'We fight we break up, We kiss we make up'. I loved the movie right then and there.The most beautiful part of the movie was there shot on Wicklow National Mountains Park. Their first kiss was amazing. Also the scene when Holly cries in her mom's arms is quite touchy and I was in tears.After some days I bought the DVD and I swear I've seen the movie more than 10 times. I've cried most of the times while watching.You might be wondering why a 20 year old hunk is saying all this. But guys, I love to cry! I love to get into deep emotions. And I believe in true love. I haven't kissed any girl yet. I want everything to be perfect.In short I'm waiting on an Holly to come in my life to make it beautiful. :)",10,2,3,31 May 2009
Thor," i loved the movie
","I started to watch the movie with a little less expectations, because of the earlier horrible movie called 'Almighty Thor'.In fact this movie turned out to be superb. The actors were average, except Tom and Natalie, because they're really good. We all knew the story, but it was worth watching again.The animation was good, considering the low budget of the movie. But I think the director sucked, because the script was amazing, and he lacked in creativity. I usually rate any movie with 10 stars, but I rate this one 9 only because I think that I could have directed the movie better if I had this amazing script and animators.Watching this movie was a good experience.",9,4,8,5 September 2011
300," I watched this movie more than 10 times
","First time I went to see the movie alone in some good multiplex theater, and it was worth it!! I loved each and every second of this movie. The actions movies with passion and a bit emotion are always successful. I had some great expectations and the director made it worth watching the movie at all. Gerard has been my favorite actor and I found him really cool in his new Avatar in this movie. This is a must watch for all teens and dudes. I really don't have enough words to explain how I feel about this movie. I haven't seen any other film better than this one. Thank you director, thanks a lot. Keep making more movies like this one. I am waiting for the next sequel of this movie. I guess it's gonna be interesting.",10,2,2,22 May 2009
