The Blair Witch Project," The hype was far greater than the movie; still OK
","I'm sure you already know what this movie is all about.  You've probably read reviews like 'the scariest thing since the exorcist.'  Not quite, but it's different.  If you haven't seen it on the big screen, don't bother. You can wait till it gets released on video.  The entire movie is shot with 16mm cameras and it would actually be better on the small screen.",7,0,0,10 August 1999
Fight Club," Fincher punches you in the nose, kicks you in the ribs, tells you a joke while he's picking you up, and hits you again.
","I've never had a movie experience like this before.  Creepy, dark, brutal, funny and ultimately dangerous and subversive.  This movie is a complete and total affront to the Western capitalist system we live in.  Many feminists I know have argued that it is a disgusting 'dick flick', a testosterone overdose, but most viewers will see much more to this movie.  Pay extra attention!  There are subliminal messages in the first act that flash for a split second.  Keep your eyes peeled.",10,0,1,23 October 1999
Memento," Sure it was good, but. . .
","This movie is definitely worth watching.  Interesting, different, absorbing and even funny.However, what I was trying to figure out after walking out of the theater was not the confusing plotline (It's easier to follow when you know what to expect), but rather this: would the movie be interesting if it was not presented backwards.Although it's a good effort, I can't shake the idea that this movie is more of a gimmick than a serious study in relativism, as many will have you believe.",7,0,2,30 April 2001
Alexander," Stone tried too much
","How do you make a film about one of the greatest generals of all time leading a dazzling military campaign that led to the conquest of the known world? If you're Oliver Stone you don't. Instead you treat your viewers to an intimate psychological profile of the man: how he thought, what moved him, what were his dreams and aspirations. Sound boring? That's because it is. But that doesn't mean that it's not interesting. If anything, Oliver Stone proved that he has the balls -so to speak- to push the envelope, scoffing at -mostly American- viewers' latent homophobia. Well, historical evidence seems to point that he was in fact bisexual. Why is that a big deal? Mainly because Stone allowed it to become a big deal. For crying out loud Oliver, he wasn't just a bisexual -or 'pansexual'- King who loved another man. He conquered the freaking world and all you offer us is two battles. Gloriously directed as they were, they are not enough to give us a sense that Alexander was in fact 'Great'. Stone let Alexander the person dominate the film, when he should have balanced him out with Alexander the soldier. In anticipation for the Final Cut DVD, I'm giving this a 7. Then I'll adjust my vote accordingly.",8,0,0,13 February 2007
American Pie," Teensploitation movies are getting better
","I can understand the industry's latest fixation for movies with teenage actors aimed for a teenage audience.  But I never understood why they had to be so lame; don't they respect teenagers' IQs?Not that I expected sophistication from this genre of movies but a little more originality than throwaways like Varsity Blues and Cruel Intentions. Something started with Go and now there is American Pie.  This movie is still very much juvenile but I found it drop dead funny.  Countless masturbation and sex jokes and high school pranks, it makes me miss my high school days.  It's fun to shut off your brain once in a while and just have some fun at the movies.  This is a good comedy.",7,1,2,17 June 1999
No Man's Land," Only just short of great
","Once in a great while you walk into a theatre with low expectations and you leave pleasantly surprised. 'No Man's Land' was like that for me.Superbly written and directed, 'No Man's Land' deals with a complicated subject with stinging humor and great moments of drama. My only reservation is with the character that spends the length of the movie lying on his back on a mine. I can't help but think that this movie would be a masterpiece if only the writer/director had made an effort to make him more sympathetic. As it is, I didn't feel very sorry for him. Still, a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Tanevic and yet another fine product of the former Yugoslav school of cinema.",8,7,14,12 March 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Entertain us!
","One scene in this movie sums up the entire experience of 'Moulin Rouge': The gleeful throng gathered at the Moulin Rouge/nightclub dances frenetically to a techno beat and breaks out into a chorus from Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Here we are now/Entertain us.'  Kurt Cobain had something like this in mind when he wrote that song.  Today's audiences would flock to see any piece of crap that is promoted.  Not only that, they will eat it up and call it ice cream.I'm not sure if Baz Luhrman made this movie deliberately to raise this rather intriguing issue or if this is simply the worst movie ever made.  At times it feels as if he's poking fun at the indulgent, extravagant excess that is today's pop culture or if he is a part of it.  Maybe it's both.  I found this ambiguity interesting and watched the entire movie, even though half the audience walked out during the first twenty minutes.  If anything, the positive comments on this board prove that people today will put up with anything to be entertained.  See this movie and judge for yourself.",5,2,4,12 June 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Perhaps Kubrick's most humanistic film.
","I was skeptical about Kubrick's willingness to explore human feelings and desires, but he does it in this film.  Definitely a film that fits well in his repertoire, I'd say it even completes it.  Kubrick fans will not be disappointed, neither will Tom Cruise fans.",8,0,0,16 July 1999
Bring It On," In all fairness, it sucked.
","If you want to make a movie about cheerleaders, make it campyand silly.  This movie takes itself and cheerleading too seriously.  Imean, come on!  And the bad-girl cheerleader chick?  Puh-lease. And the supposed racial commentary with the sixties-era-likesegregated inner-city black high school being exploited by thequintessential evil white oppressors?  In a CHEERLEADERMOVIE?  It would make any right-minded person, with any racialsensitivity, cringe.Predictable and brain-dead.  That's always a recipe for good, cleanfun.  But the makers of this movie somehow managed to spoil thisbrew.",5,0,0,2 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," Worthless if you've seen the original
","It's hard to comment on this adaptation objectively if you've already seen the terrific 'Abre los Ojos.'  It's hard to make an already well-told, well-directed and well-acted story any better, and that was Crowe's most challenging task.  It was a lost cause to begin with.  See the orignal if you haven't already.",5,0,0,19 December 2001
Any Given Sunday," It's third and long. Very long.
","And Stone doesn't convert.Stone is always good at writing and directing engaging drama.  There's always a strong conflict of ideas in his films and this one is no exception.However, he's going way over-board with his camera antics.  I can understand the hand-held camera shots at the line of scrimmage, but he does the same with nearly every scene.  C'mon, do we really need hand-held close ups of Pacino when he's having a simple conversation with Quaid.  After a while you feel like pulling a Jamie Foxx and throwing up in the theater with all the motion sickness.My other gripes about this film are petty and not worth mentioning. Overall, I felt like Stone settled for a field goal rather than going for the TD.",7,0,0,27 December 1999
Goodfellas," Scorcese's best
","What a great movie!  Immediately engaging, this movie grabs you from the throat right from the start and never lets go. Through the eyes of Ray Liotta's character, we are introduced into a dizzying world full of memorable characters.The mafia world is at once glamourized, as the young Liotta grows up to become a prominent figure in the family.  Then his dream starts to fall apart as that world of glamour and easy money collapses on him.  Similar in its theme to Scarface, this movie is a level above Stone's masterpiece, more stylish, very nineties and comes with a killer soundtrack.Although you should watch this movie for many reasons, Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro alone are worth the rental price.  Their characters are simply unforgettable.",9,0,0,11 April 1999
