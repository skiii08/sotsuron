The King's Speech," Kings are made of flesh and blood.
","Kings are made of flesh and blood. This is my first feeling after watching the movie, I know he is an ordinary person, with the same emotions as ordinary people, facing the changes of the country, his own stammer, George vi was under great pressure, thanks to a good doctor, a good friend to face with him.

The opportunity of film festival decides to buy ticket to appreciate god again, as expected as the improvement of the mind, basically can see a movie. Compared with Pitt, I like NORTON more. I am impressed by NORTON's handsome appearance and excellent acting. The score of the movie is great, and the script and narrative technique of the ghost director are indeed outstanding.

Shakespeare in Love," See the beauty of language in Shakespeare's plays. Shakespeare was not deep and grave, and he was very promiscuous.
","The plot is particularly attractive, never seen the story of romeo and Juliet, through this film finally know what this play is about; Joseph fiennes was much handsomer than Shakespeare himself; I feel that films and TV series made in Britain are well made and attitude determines success or failure.

Argo," It's a wonderful movie. It's a pity that the ending is known at the beginning of the story.
","The fact that the film won the Oscar for best film was partly political. But regardless of the external factors, it is still commendable that Ben has created a perfect arrangement of what actually happened in history. Whether it is the early planning and preparation for the plan, or the hostage rescue behind, Big Ben has the audience's mind firmly fixed in front of the seat. The spicy and interesting lines, the skillful and sophisticated rhythm control, the style of editing, the meticulous costumes and props as well as the suspense atmosphere are all outstanding parts of the film.

About Time," No matter how you wear it, you might as well live in the moment
","I believe that everyone has an emotional side when they look at things, especially for me who watches this movie after turning off the lights late at night. Rachel ' s character in the film is really the ideal of my ideal girlfriend. After reading other comments, I understand how profound the truth is, but I admit that I have not really realized it in reality. Maybe I have not experienced enough. But for me now, It ' s really exactly the same as the man ' s idea when he was 21 years old, so that he resonated and replaced himself. It ' s sad but at least warm, and I really hope to meet her",9,0,0,12 May 2020

Capote," Cold blood painting biography.
","Film version. Marvel at the performance of Philip Seamus Hoffman. The sissy between the gestures is different from his image in other movies. Going home, Youtube searched Capote's own reading voice and TV program screen, and was even more shocked by Hoffman's performance like a god, the sound was perfectly restored, and Capote's narcissistic vanity and tangled self-blame were performed, which was convincing! This is the biggest highlight of the film.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Forrest Gump," Inspriational film
","Don't care about gains and losses, don't demand immediate rewards, stick to commitments, value emotions, and maintain positive humanity... These are the truths that forrest gump tells us. Perhaps, for gump, the only advantage is 'quick legs', but we all forget another point, mother's strong character and gump's persistent attitude, rather than utilitarian planning, may be the key to real success. Inspirational film, worth recalling.",10,1,1,8 April 2020

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," It's a good movie. It reveals human nature.
","As a classic remake, planet of the apes rises below the original core, adding family and growth elements to the story from another side, a good script structure.

The Shape of Water," The cool - toned monster movie wraps up a warm fairy tale.
","The Oscar for the best is indeed a very unique beauty, which no one outside the top would have made so beautiful. The use of color is very interesting, those casual changes will let us slowly detect the heroine's mood changes.

A Beautiful Mind," Beauty in heart, life in hand, love is all logic and reason. The real heart.
","In fact, I really thought that the hero was working for the secret service. The appearance of the room full of cobwebs and newspapers made it difficult for people outside the movie to accept that kind of shock, let alone the wife of the person involved. Luckily, Nash meets the beautiful Celia, who gives him a home on earth so he doesn't get lost in another world.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
12 Years a Slave," Bear watching
","He is restrained enough to be ingratiating, but conveys the deepest emotion through the most frugal lens; Sometimes you are kind and sometimes you are cruel. This is clearly Solomon's story, but why each character is so real. The two-hour viewing forced me to think more about freedom, race and its impact on America than I had in the previous 22 years. There is no subject matter that is not good enough.",9,0,1,14 April 2020
The Green Mile," A very moving masterpiece
","A very moving masterpiece. He USES their love for each other to kill them. Every day is like this. I feel the pain of the world. It seemed to me to be a kind of heart, a kind of compassion, very moving, that people are so stupid, to hurt in a loving way. The parents' love for the dead girl turned to hate for John, and even asked for more killings. It is really a very good contrast, so many wars in human history are not the same, the aggressors to love their country to exploit other countries, defenders to love their country to fight to the death, in fact, are in the use of love to kill people so there is war. The compassion and wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas is true love. They can suffer injustice when necessary and sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. John, this is the path of bodhisattva. amitabha",9,0,0,18 April 2020

The Shawshank Redemption," Timidity puts you in jail, hoping wish you will be free.
","It feels like I am watching a real thing happening in front of you. It doesn't seem to be acting at all. It is not surprising that this is a movie until the list of crew members at the end of the film comes out. The genius of the mind, the familiar business ability, the perseverance of perseverance, and the determination to bear the burden of humiliation eventually led to a perfect escape that lasted for 20 years.

Deadpool," A 'hypocrisy, justice' antonym of the anti-hero of the hero movie.
","A 'hypocrisy, justice' antonym of the anti-hero of the hero movie. A good, sharp rhythm, just a good, nothing else. It also doesn't pay much attention to the plot, but it's much better than suicide squad. The key reason is that the characters are real and cute. Throughout the 'second person' dialogue, has maintained the audience and the protagonist of the close relationship (no wonder not to introduce, this is the right college entrance examination questions). The villain is a little flat, but it doesn't hurt.",8,0,2,16 April 2020
Green Book," Very good. The story is sweet and ironic.
","Very good. The story is sweet and ironic.
With racial discrimination as the theme, the traveling performance reflects that no matter how famous black people are, they are not free from unequal treatment.
