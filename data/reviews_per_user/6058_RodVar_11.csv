The Avengers," One word: AWESOME!
","The film is perfectly crafted in every way: Acting, storyline, image and sound. A real triumph! What a summer blockbuster should be! It sets a very high standard for upcoming superhero or comic-book movies. The characters are well developed and very well acted. All the cast did an amazing job in their roles. Each actor completely owns the character and only makes them more interesting an appealing to the audience.The story is interesting , smart and entertaining; it never gets campy or boring. Tons of well-placed punchlines; never forced or stupid. The action sequences are amazing and perfectly placed in the plot, there are no unnecessary placed fights and/or special-effects.Directing and editing are absolutely top-notch! You can see that there was flawless communication of the direction the movie wanted to take. The visual and sound effects are eye and ear candy! Nothing short of outstanding! The score really stands out, it is the final addition to the Avengers team. This is one happy fan! Thank you Mr. Joss Whedon! I loved every second of this movie! It had only been out for five days and I'd seen it three times already. Go see it! I promise you will leave the theater wanting to see it again!",10,1,5,4 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Good summer movie!
","This was a much better portrayal of the book than it's previous installment. Of course, modifications were made, as it happens from every book-to-film adaptation. The pace of the film is agile and adventurous. It has a few very predictable moments, but in the end it's a fun and good story. Hanks' performance as Robert Langdon is much more relaxed, I suppose he feels more comfortable in the character. The visual effects are unbelievable, it really looks like Vatican City. It makes one wonder if the Vatican Archives are really like. The score is more than outstanding, I propose a standing ovation for Mr. Hans Zimmer!I would recommend you watch this film if you're looking to have a good time and live through an incredible adventure.",8,1,4,9 June 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash Bad Rep!
","I had a blast watching this film! Non stop fighting, roaring and smashing! The CGI HULK looks a lot cooler, more detailed and more believable than the one in the 2003 film. Abomination was truly CGI beauty! The story is a lot more agile, less cerebral and scientific, which is something you expect from a Comic Book movie. Plus, there is a really evil and threatening villain this time.The performances are terrific, not to say that the one's in the previous film weren't, they were also amazing. But this story allows the characters to be a bit more human, you actually see the actors smile from time to time.There's a lot of cool bonuses in the film, like Bill Bixby making an appearance on a channel showing 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father', Lou Ferrigno's Cameo and the fact that he is the Hulk's voice, the show's 'Lonely Man Theme' being played when Bruce arrives in Mexico, Tony Stark's Cameo (Robert Downey Jr. is the Man!) hinting an Avengers or Civil War movie, and the ever present purple pants (you've gotta have the purple pants!) I highly recommend this film, Louis Leterrier did an outstanding job!",8,4,8,17 June 2008
Star Trek," Even if you've never heard of Star Trek, you'll enjoy this!
","This is truly an original way to introduce a whole new generation to a series of characters that could have never been known to them. It also sets a new and faster pace, non-stopping action from beginning to end. The visual and sound effects blew me away, especially since I got to see it in a private screening the sound was through the roof.The new story is smart, strong and inventive. It was the only believable way to get Leonard Nimoy in as Spock, (those of us who knew his character were really happy to see him) but what a way to do it. The new cast is excellent, especially Zachary Quinto as Spock, Simon Pegg as Scotty, Eric Bana as Nero, Zoe Saldana as Uhura and I was pleasantly surprised with Chris Pine as James T. Kirk.I really loved the films that starred the original cast, some more than others, but really enjoyed them. But I was never a fan of the TV Shows, since never really got into them, I didn't really know much about each character's back story. Even though this is a different story, it's was cool to learn a little about where they came from.To J.J. Abrahams and to this new franchise I have only one thing to say.. 'Live long and prosper!'",9,1,7,9 June 2009
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's best film to date!
","I had never even heard of Edward D. Wood Jr. prior to this, but now that I've watched both 'Glen and Glenda' and 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', I can see why they've built a fan base. They remind me of Mexican wrestling films, of course they're terrible but you cannot deny, there's just something about them...I found this film to be an absolute and very underrated treasure.Martin Landau won an extremely well deserved Oscar for this film, his performance is superb! Johnny Depp should have at least gotten a nomination.Outstanding wardrobe, makeup and art direction, Tim Burton knows his crew and through his films one can get a glimpse of his unique vision of the world.Enjoyable from beginning to end, a true 'Tinseltown Movie' Masterpiece!",9,0,0,18 July 2008
Man of Steel," Superman for a new generation! Good stuff!
","I really liked Man of Steel! It was a fresh take on the story of Superman, with strong performances from all the actors and a less campy story. Visual and sound effects were outstanding and new soundtrack was definitely in order. (note: I am a fan of John Williams' score, but a new scope on the origin of Superman required something completely different). Don't get me wrong, I loved Superman: The Movie. But as we saw with Superman Returns a few years ago, that concept is a bit outdated for a 21st century audience. This movie is a complete thrill ride. Performances are great: Henry Cavill really deliver's as the last son of Krypton, you can feel the inner struggle that the character goes through. Russell Crowe Kevin Costner and completely embrace the essence of both their characters as the true mentors of Clark/Kal- El. Diane Lane does an excellent Martha Kent and I really enjoyed Amy Addams as the new gutsy and go-getting Lois Lane (no more damsel in distress). Zod is excellently portrayed by Michael Shannon, a solid performance. Go see it, you'll be glad you did! I recommend 2D",9,1,4,18 June 2013
The Orphanage," Now THIS is terror!
","I truly enjoyed this movie, from beginning to end. I literally jumped in my seat like five or six times, my heart was racing all through the movie. I don't know any of the director's previous work, but you can clearly see Del Toro's influence on the film. An awesome storyline and a superb, though brief, performance by Geraldine Chaplin, (I didn't know her Spanish was so fluent). I highly recommend this film if you want to get scared, you will get your money's worth and so much more! I was completely spooked on my way home from the theater. Only a few movies have really dealt with ghosts properly in the last few years: The Others, The Sixth Sense and of course Del Toro's own, The Devil's Backbone... This one is right up there with them!",9,3,8,20 February 2008
The Dark Knight," A Heroic Work of Art!
","I was so excited and waited so impatiently for this movie to come out, ever since the first trailer came out in December 2007, I was in a big hurry to see it. This is truly one of the greatest sequels that have ever been made, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I couldn't believe the quality of the story, the cinematography, make-up, wardrobe, and art direction, all works of art. But the tone that Christopher Nolan gave to this piece is outstandingly dark, sinister and even more reality based than the first one. (if that could actually be said about a super hero movie)The actors' performances were wonderful: - Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman once again shine (as both actors always do) while reprising their roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox. - Maggie Gyllenhaal was a better choice for Rachel Dawes (you can actually believe she's a tough woman). - Aaron Eckhart truly takes over the role of Harvey Dent/Two Face and makes it real (he makes the coin bid not seem forced or campy). - Christian Bale takes the dual role of Bruce Wayne/Batman to a whole new level, you can feel the character's pain and struggle to do what is right, his inner struggle to remain incorrupltible. - But Heath Ledger's performance can only be described in one word, INCREDIBLE! He truly brings to life what the Joker is all about and makes him even more twisted and evil. It is a pity that he has passed on, but he left a final mark that no one will forget. Thank you Christopher Nolan for this film, I can't wait to see what comes next...",10,3,7,24 July 2008
Up," Another home-run for PIXAR!
","PIXAR has done it again! They've mixed in: a funny idea, state-of-the-art animation, wonderful characters and a heartwarming story.This movie is really a triumph. Starting with Carl and Ellie's love story and their life together and continuing with Russell, the good hearted little boy who really just wants to help Carl; you really embrace the main characters in an incredible way in the first few minutes of the film. I'm not going into any further detail about the plot, wouldn't want to ruin it for anybody.The animation is flawless, the amount of detail that they go into is unbelievable, it is incredible how now you can actually almost feel textures. A perfect example of this is when you see Carl's stubby two day beard. Amazing! This movie is for big and little kids as well, I went to see it with a buddy of mine from work and we laughed through the entire film, and we're both in our 30's.This film is, without a doubt, one of PIXAR's best yet!",10,3,7,9 June 2009
The Happening," I regret to say...
","I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan for a long time. I've admired and highly enjoyed, all of his previous feature films, yes I have seen them all. I remember when Lady in the Water came out, it was critically bashed and audiences did not like it much. I agree with most people, it does not compare to his previous films, but I really liked it and I bought the DVD. The fact that this was his first attempt at the fairy tale genre is debatable.However, I regret to say that in the case of 'The Happening' I must agree with most critics and audiences, IT IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE, at all. The story has lots of holes in it. We don't know anything about the character's back stories, yet they talk about certain issues the audience doesn't know about, like if we had had the information all along.I respect both Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel as terrific actors, I love some their work prior to this (I can't say all of it because I haven't seen all their movies). But their performances in this film leave much to be desired: Mark Wahlberg is not that bad, but a lot of his lines don't make sense or seem forced into the story. Here's an example: When the old lady, who just threatened him to leave her home, is about to kill herself and he says 'You see, I'm a teacher...' HUH? But we've seen him deliver outstanding performances before ... Basketball Diaries and The Departed to name some. Zooey Deschanel is like on a trip through the whole movie; and not not like person who is shocked by what is going on, but much like a little someone who is on something. I don't know why, she is so great in so many other movies.I'm also sorry to say that Ashlyn Sanchez's performance is terrible, and she had been great on her small but highly important part on Crash.I hope that M. Night Shyamalan's films take turn for the better with his next one.",2,11,23,16 June 2008
Iron Man," Best Marvel Comic-book Movie!
","This movie truly captures the nature of the comic book. The story works, of course, it's not identical, but is a great adaptation, and is interesting even to people who have never heard of the character. The characters are wonderfully performed, Robert Downey Jr IS Tony Stark, such a great talent, this man rocks! Gwyneth Paltrow is a terrific Pepper and the chemistry and sexual tension between them really works. The movie industry's purpose is to entertain and this movie goes way beyond that...It's a awesome ride! The special effects are mind-blowing and the cinematography is great. I remember really enjoying the cartoon while growing up, thank you Mr. Jon Favreau for making the film adaptation making me feel as excited as I did back then. THIS IS ONE HAPPY FAN!",10,1,3,14 May 2008
