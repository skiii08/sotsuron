Minority Report," Hackneyed and Easily Predicable
","It is so sad that the hackneyed and easily predicable 'twists and turns' in the storyline seriously detract from what could have been and I was expecting to be, a great film. The concept was fascinating and interesting; the acting was on point; the cinematography looking amazing; and the sound design perfect. What really got me and made me mad and have issues was the old Shtick - trusted friend is the bad guy. It was further completed with the bad guys exposure at his own award banquet. This has been done time and time again and has become so well know that it is not a plot twist anymore. It was really to bad because I do feel with more originality, and less exploitative, this could have been a compelling, interesting thoughtful provoking movie.",2,7,12,27 January 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," One Great Thriller
","Here we have one of those rare franchises that constantly gets better and better. The great thing about it is that Director Paul Greengrass is back and better than ever. He brings more realism and technique in this sequel than he did in the last film. Matt Damon has gotten older and into the character more perfectly to where he seems to be living the role and realistically the character. I can't really picture anyone else in the role at this point. David Starthairn is just magnificent and Julia Stiles was surprisingly quite excellent. The chases sequences are some of the best, and the like it or hate the shaky cinematography â€“ it does exactly what is necessary and right on point. The intent is to be agitated as you watch the film, which is exactly the point. The intent is to feel and experience what Jason Bourne is experiencing and feeling. The cinematography technique works brilliantly. I have always felt that one of the possible issues for people, as it was for me, was that my expectations were extremely high. This is by far the best of the trilogy, and one great thriller. I loved the fact that the film was not over the top and is so grounded like a documentary.",9,3,3,27 January 2013
Casino Royale," Recharged
","Talk about a recharged the series!!!!! Casino Royale brings James Bond back to life, with severe density, extreme darkness, and even a strong reprisal for a franchise that had unnecessarily strayed from its origins.All the human qualities that were lost within the former super suave and seemingly immortal 007, is now given new meaning with Daniel Craig's James Bond. He is exactly what the character is suppose to be - brooding and frightening as any true killer who is 'licensed to kill'should be. James Bond finally has a deep background, a significant past, and exact reasons for why he does what he does. With Casino Royale, the franchise series seems to no longer just an excuse to give the movie going audience pointless and mindless thrilling action rushs with no reason at all. Not to worry of course because action scenes, though not as many as the older films, are nevertheless just as exhilarating. This would all not have been possible and been utterly chaotic, if not for the amazing direction and oversight from Martin Campbell. The great thing is that all the tongue and cheek humor is still so prevalent in many, many scenes and the screenplay is so very strong. We all know it is going to be a sequel and there is no issue about it, but things have, and will continue to adapt and change for the new world order Bond. In this case, the change looks bloody good in Daniel Craig.",10,2,4,27 January 2013
