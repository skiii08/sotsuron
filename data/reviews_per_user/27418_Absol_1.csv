Requiem for a Dream," Good Film that will be considered great by the wannabe film intellectia
","Very dark and depressing tale of the destruction of lives because of drug abuse.  Very well made and very moving.  Jennifer Connelly is beautiful as always.The self appointed movie intellectia will consider this a masterpiece. They will say it spoke to them and was the most powerful movie of all time. While a great film, the story is cliche ridden as individual's lives collapse (see any movie where the lives of the characters collapse).  We've seen it all before.  Aronofsky has further advanced his place as the current leader of the cult of the 'We're different but in our difference we're the same' crew.All in all:  3 stars.  Worth the money.  Good film.",Null,0,0,14 December 2000
