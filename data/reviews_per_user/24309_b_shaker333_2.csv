Black Swan," Black Swan is a must see event!
","I can't describe what I saw. Days later its all I can think about. In all of its creepy crazy goodness I found myself pleasantly lost in this movie, gripping my girlfriend's hand like a little teenage girl grips that of her boyfriend's during a cheesy Saw movie.To say this movie was anything short of phenomenal is a gross understatement. There is a reason it is nominated with 13 Oscars, and I guarantee it will win at least half that for a reason. Never has a movie (and I consider myself quite the movie buff) captivated me so much afterward and during. If you have a desire for great movies, and appreciate the art form and quality of movies. This is one movie you can't miss.Take me to heart on this, because I have never endorsed another movie like this or been this adamant about a movie before. But quote me on this 'If you can only see one movie all year, Black Swan is the movie.' I'll probably never watch it again because it took so much out of me, and is not much of a re watchable movie unless you're really sick in the head, but everyone has to watch this movie once. Don't deny yourself the joy that this movie will bring you. You'll regret it if you don't.",10,0,2,5 February 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino Delivers!!!
","I must admit when I saw the preview for 'Inglorious Basterds' I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with 'Pulp Fiction.' I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until 'Inglorious Basterds.' What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since 'Pulp Fiction.' Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for 'Inglorious Basterds!'",10,487,955,23 August 2009
