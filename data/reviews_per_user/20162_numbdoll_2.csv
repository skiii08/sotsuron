Requiem for a Dream," the best movie ever !
","This movie is a masterpiece. Its about two young men, a girlfriend and a mother. Its about drug-addiction, money, life and dreams.Its well done, cool special-effects, and you can really feel what the person in the movie feels. If you ever been a drug-addict, you will feel it even more. I really, really recomend this movie!!!",10,1,2,7 May 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece!
","It shows how life can be when people chase a beautiful dream in the wrong way. Its very intense to watch. You can feel what they feel, its very good effects and so on. People who have 'been there' can defenitly feel it more intence. And the music improves that feeling EVEN more. After the movie and you heir that music, you will think of this movie and feel those feelings, for sure.It gives an very unplesent look at drugs, and its NOT overdone in this movie. I know it isnt! Just so you know.Well, my final words.. See it!!! Its perfect!",10,0,1,2 January 2004
