Ford v Ferrari," Great movie
","I couldn't care less about auto racing, but this movie had me from the first scene to the last.
Damon and Bale are fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",9,1,3,21 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Pleasantly surprised
","Great star wars movie. This movie moves pretty fast, so strap yourselves in. So there really should be no surprises with the direction of where this movie heads. Really i have no complaints at all. I thought the director did a great job capturing the star wars feel. The acting was performed well, unlike the prequels which were cringeworthy. The worst thing about rogue one is that they did not release any deleted scenes. beats the force awakens by a LOT. If i had to rank the sw movies it goes like so. 5,4,6,RO,3,7,2,1",10,0,3,23 June 2017
Knives Out," Great cast
","I love classic whodunnit movies. This is not a classic whodunnit movie. About halfway through the movie they revealed whodunnit. Then throw in a stupid twist in the end for no reason.
It's also hard to get over Daniel Craig's southern accent.",5,2,3,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Just awful-spoilers inside.
","I really wish i had liked this movie. I really love the star wars movies, and was so disappointed. There really was not much, if anything that i enjoyed about it. First of all its the longest Star Wars movie clocking in at 2.5 hrs, add in the 30 mins of trailers and commercials and your investment is a long three hours. 
 Visually it was great, storyline was imho very forced and did not feel fluid. The script was just bad.
 There are some really lame segments in the movie. Finn's little adventure with new character rose was one of those segments. Just boring and unnecessary. Rose character is again a waste of time and shouldn't have even had a role. She feels forced, takes away from finn
Leia flying through the vacuum of space is one of the worst things i have ever seen in a star wars movie. 
The way snoke dies was pathetic.
The way luke dies is even worse.
Humor is forced and unnecessary. Unfortunately there is a lot of bad humor in this movie. 
Benicio del toro is a great actor, he did a fine job as a slicer, but was a waste of time on the big screen. 
Domhall Gleeson is a good actor, but he has not performed in the role of Hux. 
Rian Johnson might be able to shoot a great film visually, but writing a star wars script is not his thing. its as if he shoved too much info into this movie, and a bunch of it could have just been removed and it would have flowed much better.",2,0,0,15 December 2017
