Captain Phillips," Great
","Such a great movie , i watched it 4 months ago and i can still remember how great tom hanks was. It was absolutely the movie of the year. It made me cry .. I loved how they didn't only showed the dark side of the Somalians, i mean, its one of those movies that makes you think how could the surrounding environment, the level of education, the cultural and economy affect on people make the really that desperate. you cannot hate them for being bad, its not their fault. its one of those movies that make all your senses turned on for most of the time.It was brilliant",10,0,2,17 April 2014
A Star Is Born," sweet, simple, deep
","Something simple and sweet, and very smart choosing such a storyline that touches almost everybody's dream. Finding someone out of nowhere to believe in you more than you believe in yourself and all you ever wanted just happen like a dream. And within that storyline there were cases that have been overviewed differently, went into different direction than expected or than like any other modern movie.Commitment, when literally most of movies, books, TV shows, songs ... has become about breaking up relationships not only partners even family from the very first thing that happen or from just nothing. That ' i wanna be free find myself ' circle. I love how they presented love in such a real way where you cant see each other's flaws and you support each other .. love stories are just about perfection and fantasies but in real life love is a commitment and it needs more than emotions and attraction to last.I have always wondered why in talent shows, a person would audition with this big song and steals everyone's heart with his/her voice and personality and everything .. and months later, another hit song come and catches your ears and you listen to repeatedly for until another catchy song sticks in your head and your are like ya here is another pop star i wonder how long they will last before all that Hollywood drama gets them ... like where is that real original person/soul i heard in that talent show audition ? this movie has showed how cruel this music industry world is, how they shaped Ally not her outlook only but even her music .. the difference or the deep distance between a real song like Shallow and the other catchy hit song ' why did you do that ' is exactly what music industry does to all those talented souls.When Ally told Jack 'its not your fault, its a disease' after he embarrassed her in the most important moment of her life in front of the whole world. if it happens in real life nobody in million years will forget that, think about the media, the public... oh my God it will kill them. watching that scene I just thought ya this is it like i was waiting for the moment that will break them..Alcoholism and addiction being addressed as diseases not just problems has a meaning. like any other mental or physical disease that affect human behaviour and living with a sick person is just .. requires a lot of patience. And she didn't do that out of gratefulness or blinding love she actually understood he's sick.its the little things that made this movie real and touching.Leaving the movie i felt like .. you know when there is thing that is almost perfect but this ' almost ' part annoys you because .. you don't know, there were just too good to be true but they weren't or was that to made a certain point in life. These movies that strip certain characters, show you all their colours not only black and white, not only what you watch in an interview or read in tabloids you see the real person not the person that media shaped are just .. they change you.out of ten I might give it a seven, because of that annoying 'almost perfect' part. but what's pretty about it after reading many reviews in different platforms the 'almost' thing was completely different every time I read a review unlike many other movies where the flaws are too obvious.",7,2,4,8 November 2018
World War Z," It's missing lots of things , poor writing
","I didn't find it interesting. you're writing about an international war it got to be better than this it got to have some politics arguments 2 parties or more fighting for a clear reason. but using zombies was weak, it's like fighting with wild animals. you know you are smart you know their weakness hit them on it. and that magical thing that injection that came out to end a pointless story ! that was very poor !If there was something good it was the actors and actresses . there was no clear argument in it, no message no mystery nothing. and that part about choosing middle eastern people to be killed without giving a minimum amount of value of their lives is another poor point.",2,0,2,6 May 2014
Divergent," Predictable, poor
","I went to the movie without watching a trailer or reading about it so i had no expectations . from the begging the story was kind of so predictable. you could see where is it going. even though the movie had plenty of action, romance and drama. there were missing parts like they didn't tell us what happened to the rest of the world after the war that we don't know any details about. the society was so dystopian. he idea of dividing people into 5 frictions, at a certain age they test them to find where they belong even though they could choose something different. and friction before blood ! and those who didn't fit anywhere have to live their rest of their lives homeless useless. The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years. I gave a 6 because i find the directing and the cast were good, they made the movie stand out. I found Theo one of the best parts in the movie.. I mean lets be honest, they had to choose a good looking actor and make his this perfect to attract audience.",6,2,3,27 April 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," it was really good
","I'm not a big fan of super hero's movies. but i quite like this one. when it comes to the technical part, the images, sounds, filming and directing stuff it was great.but when it comes to the story, it was a bit twilighty. it was a love story more than a superhero's one. i found my self emotionally involved with the characters and their relationship more that the action part which is the whole movie based on. I mean, I like the new version of spider man i find it more realistic, I liked peter and how he added a great sense of humour to the character. even Gwen and Harry they were great.",7,7,21,16 April 2014
Joker," missing something(s)
","We've been waiting for this movie ever since we knew about it, and when they premiered it in Venice, Italy at the festival it got eight minutes standing ovation so I went with really high expectations, I believe the only good thing about it was Joaquin Phoenix .. almost all the actors did a great job.But the director Over dramatized in such a desperate boring way it's like ' give me the goddamn Oscar I deserve it ' but you don't ! Because the writing was awful and there was no psychological background there wasn't even original joker comic books background .. very poor quality of conversations and character development ..most of the 2 hours wasted on dancing and nothing .. we wanted more, more background more talking less dancing more sense !!It was like a live action superhero kind of movie poor writing amazing directing expect there was no action so the directing was just too desperate ..",6,5,10,17 October 2019
Furious 7," movie dedicated to Paul walker
","what can i say , i expected less but i was surprised to that new level of action i saw . for the whole time i couldn't catch my breath . its adrenaline packed its like watching a semi final soccer game . and obviously the movie was dedicated to Paul Walker may his soul rest in peace. they made a hero out of him he was the one coming up with plans and doing lot of action sense probably more than vin diesel him self. i loved it , some may find it failed but it brought a whole new level for these kinds of movies. the directing , filming , sound effects and everything was good but ya it involved lot of violence sense like more than what it needed to be that at a certain stage you forget what is the movie about whats the story ..",8,0,2,14 April 2015
