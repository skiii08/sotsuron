Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," let down by the acting and characters
","the plot is rather good and so is the direction some scenes feeling very epic but i think its the lame characters and acting that let this film down, none of the characters have the charisma of Han solo or Darth Vader, but that was not the main problem it was jar-jar he is the most annoying creation ever and should burn in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . another thing is that i didn't feel exited like i did with the old movies it wasn't the plot that was pretty good but it was the actors all but Liam neeson (qui-gon)seemed out of place and to uncomfortable in there roles which is a big let down because all the actors from the old films seemed so alive and involved (it probably is because its mostly done on blue screen). id give this film 8 as it wasn't as good as id hoped but had a few redeeming quality's like Darth maul and Yoda still being a puppet.",10,1,2,3 May 2005
