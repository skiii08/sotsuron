Sucker Punch," Zack's wild and crazy plundering of movies he likes
","At the Pitch Meeting, somewhere in LA, Zack Snyder and a Studio Boss...SB: Hey, Zack, man, I loved your Watchmen and 300 movies. Whatchya got for us today, dude?ZS: Well... Charlie's Angels had 3 hot babes. I think there should have been 5. And the Matrix had 2 alternate universes, there really should have been 3. More is better, right?SB: I can dig that.ZS: And I liked that Tarantino multiple movies in a single movie thing that he did with Grind House, recently.SB: Yeah, but that was too high concept. We had to chop them back into separate movies.ZS: That's because Quentin made them too separate. What you need is to mix them up in the same movie, and keep the running time under 2 hours.SB: So, what are these separate pieces then, Zack, mi amigo?ZS: Well, I don't want to over-simplify, but one reality is kinda like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. But with hot, semi-naked chicks, instead of Jack Nicholson and an overgrown Indian.SB: OFOTCN was a great movie... but I always thought something was missing. And what else?ZS: I think a bit of Moulin Rouge... but with a psycho pimp and some Kung Fu.SB: Man, you are one crazy dude, I always thought there should have been more Kung Fu in Moulin Rouge!ZS: And then a bit of Kill Bill.SB: But Bill's dead.ZS: Yeah, I know... but I found someone who looks just like him! Isn't that cool? And then I added some giant robot samurai!SB: Whoa, most excellent, dude! The kids are crying out for giant robot samurai! Are you throwing anything else in here, or are you done already?ZS: Well, those are just the main realities. But we have some adventure worlds, too. I got some stuff happenin' on a high-tech train with a bomb and weaponized androids. And a world war I adventure which is kinda like Inglourious Basterds, but with hot, semi-naked chicks in my kill squad, instead of a bunch of Jewish dudes. With German soldiers as zombies driven by clockwork and steam. And then a bit of fantasy-style Lord of the Rings with Orcs and Dragons, but with hot, semi-naked chicks on a quest, instead of those ugly little Hobbit dudes.SB: Man, you are really pushing the envelope here, Zack! It sounds wild and exciting, with, like, remakes of every cool movie of the last 20 years! Um... not to be churlish, but does it have a story too?ZS: Of course. There's a hot, semi-naked chick, framed for a murder she didn't commit by her evil stepfather. And then she bonds with her fellow inmates, and teaches them self-reliance and stuff. Although it's not very useful, 'cos she gets most of them killed. Except one. Who finds freedom with Bill. And there's some quests, not for a ring, but for a map, fire, knife, key... which sorta help get them out of wherever they are. And some really bad dudes. And lobotomies. And did I mention the hot, semi-naked chicks? I'm going for boots, thigh-highs, little skirts, and plenty o' cleavage.SB: Zach, you crazy sob! Let's do it! I got $75m to make it! Is that enough to include a ton of CGI and the hyper-real look you did with 300? And a really loud rock / pop / rap soundtrack?ZS: Absolutely, man. Oh... and make it $82m, and I'll get Don from Mad Men to add some class.SB: This is so crazy, it might just work!GJ: And it did. Don't ask me to explain why, but it was kinda fun. I guess the hot, semi-naked chicks helped it along. Just don't over-analyze it, or expect anything highbrow. I feel bad admitting it, but I liked it.",8,7,17,4 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Only the churlish would complain!
","I saw this at a free preview in Singapore, so reviewing it seems like the least I can do. More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes! Even the AC/DC soundtrack was OK (and I loathe AC/DC, they're so last century).If you liked Iron Man, you'll like Iron Man 2. What more do you want, buddy?",10,18,37,3 May 2010
Just Go with It," ridiculous plot... but very funny, and surprisingly heart-warming
","The plot is utterly ridiculous, but I'll try to summarize anyway, just for giggles: A successful plastic surgeon (Sandler) is a horndog who wears a wedding ring because it helps him score with chicks. But then he meets a Cute Young Chick (Decker) who he wants to have a relationship with... but she finds the ring in his pants, and goes nuts because she won't date married men. So the Good Doctor makes up a marriage (to his Kind Assistant, played by Anniston) and impending divorce (because of her infidelity with Dolph Lundgren, but not THAT Dolph Lundgren). And Cute Young Chick now wants to meet the (soon to be ex) wife, just so she can check he's really telling the truth. It happens all the time, I'm sure.Now, if you can believe this (it's Anniston, after all), Kind Assistant is a Plain Jane, so now the Good Doctor has to take her for an Extreme Makeover, so she can look like a well-maintained Hollywood Wife. Then the two girls meet, it goes great... but, at the end of the evening, Kind Assistant gets a call from her kids, and forgets the role play. So, now, Cute Young Chick thinks the Good Doctor has kids... and now she wants to meet THEM, to see if he's a good father.The Crazy Kids extort the Good Doctor in return for pretending to be his children, and get a bunch of acting classes, video games, food... and a family trip to Hawaii to swim with the dolphins. If you've stayed with me so far, you can picture the sunshine and beaches of Hawaii, with the Good Doctor, his would-be girlfriend the Cute Young Chick, his fake wife, the fake wife's fake boyfriend, the fake Dolph Lundgren. And, of course, the fake wife's real kids, posing as the Good Doctor's fake kids.To add to the fake-ness, Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews show up as a third couple, Kidman being the hyper-competitive bitchy high school friend of Anniston's, who's a pretentious fake. And Mathews as her boyfriend and inventor of the iPod. He's fake too, because he's not the inventor of the iPod, and he's gay, so not much use on the boyfriend front. Now, Kind Assistant is playing awful about-to-be ex-wife of Good Doctor around Cute Young Chick... but is forced to play real Kind Assistant around Kidman and Mathews... with wonderful marriage to hugely successful Good Doctor, as a bit of relationship one-upmanship.Maybe it's better if you think of it as a farce.While there, Good Doctor realizes that Crazy Kids and Kind Assistant are the ones he loves, rather than Cute Young Chick. I bet you didn't see that one coming.The kids are great, a deadpan boy (Griffin Gluck), and an aspiring actress girl (Bailee Madison), putting on a Mary Poppins English accent, with extra helping of Dick van Dyke. Luckily, they have some very nice awwww, ain't kids adorable moments.Anniston does a really great job of being kind and lovable. Dolph Lundgren (Nick Swardson, a Sandler regular) is a hoot as Anniston's fake boyfriend, with some kind of Schwarzenneger-ish German-ish accent, as a dot-com sheep entrepreneur. Brooklyn Decker just has to be cute and sweet, and she does a pretty good job for a model. And, given that she's an SI cover girl, she did well at being cute, but not too smoking hot to be involved in all these shenanigans.And Sandler ties it all together, with the usual Sandler shtick. But better than usual, and much more genuine. He's a bit more grown-up, and a bit more toned-down, than most of his roles.The Sandler/Anniston connection is very sweet and believable, and it's what carries the film. Overall, I think this is one of the best things I've seen both Anniston and Sandler do. It was a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable couple of hours. It's a great date movie with lots of sweetness and romance, with a bit of Sandleresque stupid stuff going on to keep the guys distracted.",8,4,8,16 April 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," worth seeing just to gaze lovingly at liv tyler
","I saw this over Christmas in London, having just trekked my ass up to my parents as the dutiful son... said happy christmas... slept fitfully on the floor... then trekked my sorry ass back down again to London. In other words, I was a bit shagged... and I found myself nodding off in the early introductory (or is that transitional, given this is the second?) section.Nevertheless, things perked up considerably, and I managed to stay awake until the end... even allowing that it was some unfeasibly long period of time.There wasn't enough sex for my taste, but, hey, I'm a sex-and-violence rather than sword-and-sorcery kinda guy. Liv Tyler was, for her short time on screen, transcendentally beautiful, albeit in a soft-focus kinda way. It had me thinking that rockstar sexual congress with a playboy model isn't enirely short-term gratification.As as everyone else says, the fighting is fun, and Gollum isn't half (or even a tenth) as annoying as some other CGI characters. Naming no names, but I think you know who I mean.I'm not convinced this is Top 5 movie, but it's definitely very good. I'd give Liv's breasts 9.5, and the movie as whole a 9. Actually, to avoid misleading anyone, this is a family (well, it's a bit dark, but fundamentally not terribly offensive) movie, and I don't think they show anything below Liv's luminous face.",Null,0,0,3 January 2003
