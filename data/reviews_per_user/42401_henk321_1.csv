Black Swan," Weird movie
","This is a weird movie. Apparently their is something terribly wrong with the main character. First she is chosen to do the leading role in the ballet Swann Lake. Not much of the structure of this ballet is shown in the movie. No build up of essential moments in the performance of the ballet. No artistic theme to develop which would have made a nice ballet movie. No, the emphasis is laid upon the weird experiences of the girl who is to dance the leading role of Swann Lake. During the announcement that she will be dancing the leading role you can see her delicacy and understand why she was chosen. You seen inner beauty, a maturity, which couldn't in any possible way go together with a derangement and madness of the girl, which will later develop. Do her feelings of guilt of pushing the older ballerina out of her job make her see her fingertips bleeding and peeling the skin of them? OK she is dominated by her mother, but then the discrepancy of having to dance a mature role and possessing a lot of young girls doll's. She is certainly not a crazy adolescent. Is she getting crazier because her college put some drug in her drink? What are we made to believe? So is her delicacy and maturity which came with practicing ballet for years only a thin veneer? Not something she built up her own? This is the discrepancy in this movie. The movie could have a nice ballet movie, where difficulties were to overcome, with maybe an accompanying love story and all would end in a beautiful, artistic performance. Now we're made to believe that sticking a piece a glass in herself makes her perform excellently. 'Made it perfect' as she said herself at the end heavily bleeding. We don't see so much of this perfection because there are only Incoherent fragments of the performance. Do you think she will perform again? I don't think so. She won't be asked again. A pity that a movie about weirdness and madness couldn't have been one about artistry and beauty.",1,10,16,5 May 2011
