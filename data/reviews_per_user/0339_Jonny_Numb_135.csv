Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Killing us softly with his song
","SPOILERS (only for those who have not seen Vol. 1) At the time of its theatrical release, 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2' was something I probably wouldn't have bothered to see (due to my own dim appraisal of the previous installment), if it hadn't been for two friends who persuaded me otherwise on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was actually impressed with how much I liked the concluding part, and now that I've viewed both films twice, Vol. 2 feels that much stronger.To recap: The Bride (a convincingly bad-ass Uma Thurman), the sole survivor of a wedding-chapel massacre carried out by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (led by David Carradine's Bill), awakens from a four-year coma to find her unborn child gone (assumed miscarried), and vows vengeance on those responsible for the massacre (should I mention that The Bride was formerly Bill's top assassin?). She has successfully slain Vernita Green aka 'Copperhead' (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii aka 'Cottonmouth' (Lucy Liu)along with dozens of henchmenby the time we meet up with her in Vol. 2.What I still find most admirable about this closing installment is (again) how Tarantino subverts audience expectations. Vol. 1 met its peak in a complicated, visually spellbinding scene where The Bride takes on The Crazy 88s (a gang consisting of dozens of black-masked assassins) in a multi-level Japanese restaurant. One would expect the denouement of Vol. 2 to consist of many scenes as potent and intense, right? Well, that 'literary quality' I praised in my review of Vol. 1 comes on even stronger in the last half, allowing dialog and backstory to fill in plot-gaps and further develop the trio of central baddiesBudd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine)who were little more than ciphers before.Tarantino develops an intimacy among this quartet, consisting of double-crosses, broken bonds, and revealed secrets that strengthens the story as a whole. And it surprised me how Tarantino's development sheds the skin of homage and irony that punctuated Vol. 1, venturing into territory that carries a genuine emotional impact without downplaying the cost of human life. Death's sting is very much felt here, and you may be blind-sided at how moving it is. And the film's most understated gagthat Bill is really just a jilted lover acting out of extreme jealousycarries an unexpected honesty that enriches the layers of his character.Don't get the wrong ideathere is still a formidable amount of impressive action on display, including a brutal flashback wherein The Bride is trained under the 'cruel tutelage' of a martial-arts existentialist by the name of Pai Mei, and an incredible sequence where The Bride and Elle have a showdown inside the narrow walls of a trailerbut Tarantino seems more interested in tying all the threads of plot up into a satisfying package, at which he is pretty damn successful. The long-mooted 'showdown' between The Bride and Bill is drawn-out and surprising, though the final result (baldly announced in the film's title) carries an effect contrary to what most will expect.Both movies combined, 'Kill Bill' is a superior entertainmentquite possibly the best cinematic offering Tarantino has given us to date.",8,2,4,15 June 2008
Vertigo," So...where is the masterpiece I've heard so much about?
","(Spoilers. My advice: read them and save 2 hours of your life.) I watched 'North by Northwest' not too long ago, and found it to be a grueling chore; Hitchcock spun a continually jerky screenplay into an equally jerky, emotionless film. Cary Grant was completely miscast as the wisecracking wrongfully accused, and James Mason was utterly wasted in the role of the heavy. I picked up 'Vertigo' based on the recommendation of a coworker, and while I went in aware of the film's highly-esteemed reputation, I tried not to let that influence my opinion.Turns out it wasn't a problem at all. For all its glowing praises, 'Vertigo' is an incredible bore, actually a more grueling view than 'North by Northwest.' Once again, Hitchcock spins a convoluted--and, quite frankly, uninvolving--plot well past its welcome: retired P.I. Jimmy Stewart (warbling more than a turkey) is enlisted by a wealthy industrialist to find out what's eating his eerily remote wife (Kim Novak); when said wife commits suicide, Jimmy spies a female who is a dead ringer for the deceased; he becomes involved with the doppleganger, only to discover that she is the same woman, who was the co-conspirator/lover in the industrialist's scheme to off his wife. The End.'Vertigo' would have been better titled 'Slow-Go,' as it stretches the very fabric of celluloid to its breaking point--the whole story feels padded, which wouldn't be so bad if the dialog were interesting and the characters not so lethargic. But Stewart's neurotic, obsessive detective had me nodding less than an hour in, and Novak's drugged delivery didn't help, either. That the duo possess no chemistry is the ultimate kiss of death for this pseudo-noir.The film only comes to life when Hitchcock shows off his then-innovative (now dated) technical flourishes, as illustrated in the disorienting 'vertigo' POV shots, and an out-of-the-blue dream sequence that doesn't serve any discernible plot function, but is interesting to watch.Overall, though, 'Vertigo' is uninteresting to the point of tedium. As of late, I have been wondering whether Hitchcock was really all he was cracked up to be (I love 'Psycho' and 'Frenzy'), or if, like Stanley Kubrick, he merely caught the eye of those pretentious lovers of style and technique, and spun a legacy from it...",3,28,50,1 July 2006
Black Swan," Dark Beauty
","Darren Aronofsky has a thing for ambiguity. For those who like their films to leave some food for thought once the credits roll, he has a way of subverting our expectations, making us question all that happened before giving us a coda that inspires its own set of queries. What really happens after that final shot in 'The Wrestler'? What transpires the following day in the lives of the junkies who have hit bottom (but still remain alive) in 'Requiem for a Dream'? Just what the heck is 'The Fountain' all about? For most of his career, Aronofsky has toyed with viewer expectation, and while his works up to this point have never approached the out-there, sexually provocative dreamscapes of David Lynch or the deeply distorted psychoses conveyed through the eyes of Roman Polanski's tortured protagonists, 'Black Swan' comes pretty damn close to capturing a claustrophobic waking nightmare on film. Slim on character history or any sort of background detail, Aronofsky weaves the tale of Nina (Natalie Portman, in a role of equal parts beauty and visceral horror), a young ballerina who lives with her unhinged, washed-up mother (Barbara Hershey), and pines to take the lead in her troupe's production of 'Swan Lake.' When she snags the part (under the menacingly perverse and perfectionist eye of director Vincent Cassel), her waking life spirals into a hallucinatory madness that is at first subtle, but becomes increasingly otherworldly as the curtain nears. Things are compounded by Lily (Mila Kunis), the thrill-seeking Yin to Nina's naive Yang, who may have ulterior motives in befriending the newly minted lead. Aronofsky established his camera as an invasive stalker as he followed Mickey Rourke around (with sometimes uncomfortable physical closeness) in 'The Wrestler'; with 'Black Swan,' he uses physical closeness to not only push us up against the fatigue and dissolution of his characters, but to immerse us in a unique sphere of activity (the last film I recall using ballet as a focal point is Dario Argento's 'Suspiria'); the result is a film that is always in a state of motion -- sometimes fluid, sometimes jerky; but always progressing toward something. True to its title, 'Black Swan' is centered on the darkness of the soul, the dark motives of men, and what people do in the name of perfection; it is a troubling, stylistically assured masterpiece that would make a great (and near-equal) double feature with Polanski's 'Repulsion.'",8,1,5,10 January 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Guy in suit + funny accent = hilarity (right?)
","It was refreshing to scroll down and see a non-rave spotlight review of 'Borat,' one of the most inexplicable comedies to come along in quite some time (well, it equals this summer's 'Knocked Up'). Like Judd Apatow's latest, I spent most of 'Borat' staring on, sporadically laughing (there are maybe 3 good 'lawls' here), but mostly wondering what the hell critics and viewers alike were (and still are) thinking. I believe all my laughter (if not all, then 90%) came during the mock-dinner etiquette sequence, which has some low yet effective humor. But therein lies the problem with a film that many have mistaken for 'comic genius': as Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen), from Kazakhstan, is a 'bumpkin' touring the United States, it gives his naive reactions to things free reign to pull in the low-brow humor, while sending off the 'clever' allusion that its lowbrow execution is mired in intellectual 'intent.' Sure. And seeing as how Borat's naive reactions are, indeed, intended as punchlines unto themselves, I wound up hating this one-note joke of a film.",3,5,9,6 July 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Pulp Suspects: The Usual Fiction
","John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in 'Lucky Number Slevin,' a groan-inducing title for a groan-inducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good half-decade of hibernation, yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suck-pump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the now-drained Tarantino Lake; Jason Smilovic penned this too-familiar tale of criminals with oh-so-enigmatic names (The Boss, The Rabbi, Slevin) speaking in a torrent of pop-culture clichés (James Bond, Norman Rockwell, Andy Griffith, and Alfred Hitchcock get shout-outs), involved in some oh-so-wacky, oh-so-ironic, oh-so-postmodern shenanigans, and director Paul McGuigan put the frantically-edited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis (whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter) and another character during the opening scene, it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and 'Slevin' just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously self-aware ciphers, and following the plot is pointless, since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on (via dialog and flashbacks where--yup--information that was withheld is now revealed!), because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case, 'Slevin''s unusually excellent cast would (at least somewhat) redeem the film, but veterans like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat, unmemorable script; meanwhile, Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness, but precious little sympathy. Actually, the one smidgen of talent on display in 'Slevin' might be McGuigan's ability to squander a cast most directors would kill for--now THAT is a true achievement. For those who have never seen a good crime thriller and would like to look 'hip' and 'with it,' have a ball with 'Lucky Number Slevin'; the rest of us will be re-watching 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Pulp Fiction.'",1,35,78,8 December 2006
Requiem for a Dream," gives new meaning to 'a true cinematic experience'...
","There are many fine montages in 'Requiem for a Dream,' edited rapidly and done repetitiously in a way that conveys a point explicitly within a few seconds (whereas most movies would take the more conventional, straight exposition route); however, some of these montages whiz by to the point where they lack clarity. For instance, there is a scene early in the film where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto with a Brooklyn accent) and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans in a non-comedic role) are shown hanging around a closed carnival booth after dark--we see hands pull something from behind tires (and also what appear to be garbage cans) and then rip open clear plastic pouches of cocaine or heroin while car alarms blare over the soundtrack. Maybe I'm not astute enough to realize what is going on (are they stealing and selling car stereos to help finance Marion Silver's (Jennifer Connelly) break into the garment business? what?), but that leads to my overall impression of 'Requiem for a Dream': the details of the plot are consistently choppy, but ultimately irrelevant. Like the drug-addled culture it at first panders to, then thunderously condemns, 'Requiem' is more about the propulsive powers of addiction than a straightforward narrative--in essence, any narrative that emerges is an outgrowth of the characters' actions, and in the end, things are wrapped up in a bleak, downbeat way (really the only possible conclusion that can be reached). Co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky (who cut his teeth on the stylish but showy black-and-white psychodrama 'Pi') uses every stylistic device imaginable to convey the escalating effects of addiction (passages of drug use are signaled by montages of prepping heroin works, rolling blunts, and excited cells in the bloodstream); anyone who has had even a passing infatuation with illegal substances will be surprised at the accuracy with which this is conveyed--Aronofsky's decision to speed up or slow down film, use a fisheye lens, steadicam shots, or even show waves of heat rising from a closed refrigerator, successfully hypnotizes the viewer in a manner as gripping as a dissolved drug. The characters, and the paths they have chosen (including Ellen Burstyn--who really WAS robbed of an Oscar--as a widower who becomes addicted to diet pills) are compelling, misguided, and all too human; their rationale for remaining hooked on the substances that ultimately determine their downfall is a fascinating mix of human loyalty, commitment, and betrayal. Aronofsky's visual attentiveness doesn't detract a bit from the finely-wrought performances on display, and rather complements the characters and heightens our own cinematic high. Its overriding theme aside, 'Requiem for a Dream' is an artistic triumph and a masterpiece of cinema that is better experienced than described.",9,0,1,7 August 2005
Sucker Punch," Fascinating, Frustrating, and Hard to Shake
","Several days after viewing it, I have come to the conclusion that I like 'Sucker Punch.' I *think* I like it, anyway. At the very least, I have been unable to shake its alternatively bleak, exhilarating, and brazenly energized imagery from my frontal lobe. Coming from director Zack Snyder (who co-wrote the original script with Steve Shibuya), the notion of calling this film a vanity project is redundant, as Snyder is the whiz kid who gave us Green-Screened visual feasts like '300' and 'Watchmen' (graphic-novel adaptations that, in the case of the latter, came very close to perfection) -- films that gorged themselves on a unique kind of visual beauty. The difference between a technical auteur like Snyder and the soul-dead commercial hackwork of, say, Michael Bay is a reliable core of character and plot to push the visuals along with a sense of purpose, no matter how disparate. Which is what makes the initial machinations of 'Sucker Punch' somewhat jarring -- set in an anachronistic, parallel-universe America, where Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent away to an all-girls asylum after attacking her grotesque pervert of an uncle, she is covertly signed away (by an equally lecherous orderly) and set to receive a trans-orbital lobotomy at the end of five days, thus setting into play an imaginary world that may be her only chance of salvation. Old-world notions of psychiatry, patriarchy, and the role of women in such a repressive society is not where Snyder's interest lies, though he does create some distinctive (if not particularly well-drawn -- probably the film's biggest flaw) female ass-kickers, literally battling it out against unfathomable odds. Like Terry Gilliam's oeuvre on a dose of David Lynch mindbender, 'Sucker Punch' is a largely self-indulgent work -- frequently chaotic, but mostly fascinating; Snyder's interest in cohering the various combat sequences (which run the gamut from a steampunk vision of WWII, a Medieval siege, and a futuristic train populated by android assassins) into a consistent narrative is minimal at best, instead opting for an epic, 'bigger is better' mentality that reinforces the film's 'against all odds' schematic (it may not be subtle or original, but the driven vision of it all makes it fly). Like Gilliam's undervalued 'Tideland,' 'Sucker Punch' is destined for cult status -- and, unlike Tim Burton's lame interpretation of 'Alice in Wonderland,' is never boring.",7,5,10,11 April 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Riveting
","In '3:10 to Yuma,' there is a cheeky simplicity to the plot that portends a much greater complexity--by setting up the story of crippled Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose last shot at saving his foreclosed ranch and winning his family's respect is by helping transport notorious criminal Ben Wade (the coolly controlled Russell Crowe) to the titular train, it becomes a meditative character study on the always-blurry line between the outlaw and the working man. '3:10 to Yuma' reminded me fondly of 'The Proposition,' another neo-Western founded on a plot that was also deceptively simple, only to have painted a multi-layered portrait of humanity by the film's close. As Evans, Bale evokes a 'stubborn' demeanor hiding a stronger will, and by the climax, he has persevered in becoming a man bound by a credo of lawful determination; Crowe, who is not quite his opposite, maintains the slithery reptilian charm of an outlaw who has been educated by his trade, but possesses and empathy and morality all his own. The film is at its strongest when these two developing characters share the screen, and the climactic sequence is as cathartic, exhilarating, tragic, and as strangely uplifting as anything I've seen so far this year. Director James Mangold brings an appropriately rustic, washed-out look to this thrice-told tale, and uses the camera as an instrument for putting us within the action. Yet while the violence comes in furious, mean bursts, it ultimately is a sidetrip to the psychological battle of wits taking place in the foreground. '3:10 to Yuma' is one of the year's best films.7.5 out of 10",8,2,4,12 September 2007
Catch Me If You Can," bubblegum fluff, in self-important Spielberg dressing
","Imagine 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' retold as a 1950's beach-blanket flick (hot sports cars, bikini babes, parents unaware of their out-of-control, freewheeling children) and you have 'Catch Me if You Can,' another Spielberg flick that's in love with its own imagined sense of importance.  Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father.6/10",6,0,3,1 August 2003
The Hangover," Fear and Laughter in Las Vegas
","More than once in my life, I have been accused of lacking a sense of humor, and lately I've been wondering if that's really the case, or if American comedy has become a sad case of settling for less (and just praising it more). I still don't get the fascination with Sacha Baron Cohen's outrageous publicity stunts masquerading as 'films'; nor do I manage many laughs at the efforts of box-office juggernaut Judd Apatow. My decision to see 'The Hangover' was influenced by two factors: the praise some casual acquaintances had given it; and a genuine lack of anything else interesting playing. With a Sunday-afternoon audience of probably 30 people, I found that the American comedic film--not to mention my sense of humor--was more than alive and well. Directed by Todd Phillips ('Road Trip'), 'The Hangover' is the tale of four friends: cocky elementary-school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper); meek, whipped dentist Stu ('Daily Show' correspondent Ed Helms); WASPy groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha); and his mentally deficient future brother-in-law, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), who trek to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party the night before he's set to tie the knot. After a rooftop Jagermeister toast that commences the night's activities, we flash forward to the next morning, with the friends' hotel suite in disarray (including a tiger holed up in the bathroom), and Doug nowhere to be found; while trying to remember what happened the night before, our trio of suddenly sober man-children embark on a quest that is as hilarious as it is unpredictable. Instead of a straightforward narrative where all the comedic beats are telegraphed in advance (such is the fate of most films of this sort; and the story is admittedly nothing new), John Lucas' and Scott Moore's screenplay mines the sort of surprise and revelation that marks a good mystery thriller (which the film could have easily been played for), transforming each punchline into an uproarious zinger as a result. One of the best films I've seen this year, 'The Hangover' is also the funniest Hollywood comedy in ages.",8,2,4,26 July 2009
The Ring," a Hollywood remake done right
","I saw 'The Ring' last summer and thought it was a splendidly-designed and carefully paced thriller, but I was also disappointed that the movie tied up all its points a bit to cleanly (some more ambiguity would've been welcome to keep the viewer on edge, but I suppose that's minor).  Well, I recently saw the inspiration, 'Ringu,' and was thoroughly unimpressed by it, so I decided to give the American version another look and, by god, it is a little better than I initially gave it credit for.  With a welcome infusion of COLOR, pace, more accessible dialogue, engaging characters, and some fantastic special effects (which translate surprisingly well to the small screen), 'The Ring' comes out victorious (granted, it's not a long-standing classic for the ages, but it is diverting).  Another factor is the intricacies of the plot--whereas 'Ringu' merely set up a spooky concept (mysterious videotape that kills a person 7 days after viewing) and didn't build much around it, the American version has a more complicated narrative that induces some genuine heart-in-throat intensity.6/10",6,2,4,29 July 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," a great technical achievement...and?
","The years have not been kind to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'  It was hailed unanimously at the time of its release as a 'dazzling technical achivement', etc. and I'm not going to complain about that aspect of it.  The craftsmanship in blending live action with animated characters is superb, but the movie has little else to offer.  Of course, I was a little kid at the time of the movie's release, and I think what impressed my easily-amused mind the most was the atmosphere of real-life fantasy the filmmakers had created--not the story.  Upon a recent viewing of WFRR, I found myself generally unimpressed with it, and often just bored with what was happening on-screen.  Meticulous attention to technical detail can only drive a movie so far before the viewer gets suspicious of its other attributes.  The humor is often loud and forced, and some scenes are so melodramatic and sappy you could pour them on your pancakes.  The plot plays out like 'Chinatown Lite' and finds a good (if exaggerated) villain in Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom. But 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' will always be remembered for its attention to technical detail, not its plot.  And I can't complain about its craftsmanship--living in an era where digital computer graphics have rendered film animation a simple, even lazy task, it's refreshing to see something that obviously took a lot of effort to put together.  'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is more a pop-culture artifact that a seamless cinematic masterpiece, which is a shame considering its potential.4/10",4,12,28,17 March 2003
Se7en," Could very well be the best serial-killer film ever made
","Some cinephiles give praise at the altar of Hitchock; others worship Kubrick or Scorsese. Personally, I'm a David Fincher fan, and see him picking up where they left off. Easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of 'Seven,' possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons.What Fincher pulls off--and pulls off brilliantly--is a straight-faced, serious approach to a concept that could have easily devolved into camp or slasher-flick excess. On initial glance, the notion of a serial killer who picks his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins seems like the type of tongue-in-cheek fodder for a low-budget '70s or '80s exploitation item; even the tag line ('Seven Deadly Sins--Seven Ways to Die') sets the tone for a straightforward, mainstream thriller.What a surprise, then, that 'Seven' is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind ('The Silence of the Lambs' follows close behind). Even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after 'Alien3' (1992), Fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut. I hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, I haven't seen one since). Nor have I seen a director take as many commercially-averse risks within such a short career--'Fight Club' (1999), despite a short theatrical run and polarized reviews, has become to young-adults of today what 'Easy Rider' was to the Flower Children in '69.Granted, the amount of respect I've given 'Seven' has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do I see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece. At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?). While Brad Pitt's performance might inspire hoots of derision from some, he is actually pitch-perfect as the young, idealistic Detective Mills--this isn't Brad mugging the camera with his good looks for 2 hours; on the contrary, his counterpoint to Morgan Freeman's worldly, jaded, and cynical Somerset makes the movie. And once the killer is captured, these 3 characters share an entrancing conversation within the confines of an unmarked police car; sure, we get to hear the killer's explanation for his crimes, but it is in the tones and reactions to what is said that the sequence conveys a disturbingly chilling power. (It may seem moot at this juncture, but I will say nothing of the killer's identity, save that it was a choice casting decision that paid off wonderfully.) Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.Which brings me to one of the most surprising--and refreshing--aspects of 'Seven': the way in which it relentlessly plays against audience expectation. Like the murderer's motive, this is not a film of happy endings but lessons learned (in the harshest way possible). To those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, 'less is more' (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen).While I could gush at even further length about 'Seven,' I think I've made my fanfare more than clear. It's an introspective, compelling film that manages to mine terror and pathos from those daily transgressions we all view as 'common.' And it established David Fincher as a director of great (and continued) promise. Kudos.",9,1,2,16 November 2006
Star Trek," Even for the novice, 'Star Trek' is worth beaming up
","I walked into 'Star Trek' a near-complete novice: years ago, I tried watching its various television incarnations, only to be met with an indifference that didn't encourage subsequent viewing; similarly, I am also oblivious to the television/film work of director J.J. Abrams. So to say I entered the theater with nary an idea of what to expect would be an understatement. But I'm glad I did. With a keen eye for eye-catching special-effects, coherently-edited action, and fully developed characters (with a surprising amount of gleefully tongue-in-cheek moments), 'Star Trek' not only sets the bar for this summer's explosion-laden, big-budget blockbusters, but could very well be one of the best films of 2009, period. The notion of tearing down the well-established mythologies of iconic characters and franchises in favor of a fresh start (Christopher Nolan's Batman films come immediately to mind) is a sometimes-risky venture, depending on who's at the helm; luckily, Abrams and co-writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman find a happy medium that will appease fans and newcomers alike. The villain this time out is a Romulan ruler named Nero (Eric Bana), seeking vengeance against Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), who he alleges responsibility for the destruction of his home planet; in the meantime, Abrams gives welcome attention to his characters' backstories, from James Kirk's (Chris Pine--'Smokin' Aces') posturing as a James Dean-esquire rebel, and Spock's persecution for being half-human and -Vulcan. While the story is intricate enough to avoid lazy summer predictability, what really elevates 'Star Trek' (in addition to its mind-blowing effects) is the personalities and emotional dilemmas of its characters.",8,3,13,25 May 2009
Citizen Kane," The deterioration of idealism
","It is impossible to sit down and watch a movie--especially when that movie is 'Citizen Kane'--and not be lulled by the windstorm of praises surrounding it. The trick is to not let that influence your individual critical assessment (which is nearly impossible in 'Kane''s case). Orson Welles' tale of Charles Foster Kane, who inherits a fortune as a young man, presides over a successful newspaper, uses his political clout to run for office, romances two women, and dies alone with a literal castle filled with priceless art, is a story that still has relevance today. Welles' character study is fascinating in the way it captures the idealism of youth, and how that erodes into complacency and--in Kane's case--disenchantment; one of the characters makes a keen observation of the millionaire at middle age, making the claim that he can only accept love on his own terms, that he thought he could 'give' the public truth and freedom. Being a 25-year old male who was not too long ago a gung-ho liberal, 'Citizen Kane''s presentation of this unacknowledged self-interest that snowballs into bitterness is striking. The stigma that follows Kane is his own inability to be satisfied by anyone or anything.The pseudo-documentary style in which the film is presented seems very cutting-edge for its time, and translates well to our modern age of tabloid journalism. But what's more ingenious is the framing device: a reporter is interviewing Kane's coworkers and lovers in the wake of his death, investigating his dying words ('Rosebud'). Who or what Rosebud turns out to be is something that has been satirized on episodes of 'The Real Ghostbusters' and 'Tiny Toon Adventures,' among other places, but I will keep my lips sealed for those who are unaware. In another film, it might have produced unintentional laughs, but in 'Citizen Kane,' the revelation it portends is shattering.I really didn't have high expectations for 'Citizen Kane,' in spite of the reputation it has earned through the years. I often think that younger generations (myself included) are going to become increasingly detached from the perceived 'classics' of cinema as time progresses (in a way similar to how the elder critics are detached from current cinema). I was skeptical at 'Kane''s overly typical beginning, but became increasingly intrigued as it progressed, to the point where I was genuinely affected by this tragic character's decline. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it still remains a finely-crafted piece of work.",7,1,3,18 April 2006
Memento," An Engrossing Puzzler
","A lot of filmmakers have gotten their big breaks on the foundation of films that are, upon closer inspection, more stylistic than substantive...and while there's nothing wrong with an overly stylistic film, its accolades can erode with the passage of time, especially if there isn't much under the glossy surface. What's interesting about Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is how its stylistic touches are synthesized within the narrative itself; furthermore, the backwards-flowing narrative also becomes an extension of our protagonist's robotic, detached, and 'system'-oriented way of living. Guy Pearce plays Leonard, an average man who loses his short-term memory after his wife is murdered, and embarks on a quest to catch and kill the guy who did it; he holes up in a fleabag motel, tattoos clues on his body, encounters a downtrodden bartender (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a man claiming to be a cop (Joe Pantoliano), all while flashing back to a extended phone conversation wherein he tells the tale of a man with a similar condition. As played by Pearce, Leonard is like a postmodern vision of the 1940s noir detective, a perceptive Everyman driven to find closure; his performance is properly detached, only randomly showing traces of normality, but Nolan's structure cleverly plays like a visual extension of Leonard's mental processes, putting us in the midst of his search. Moss provides solid support (and sheds her 'Matrix' persona gracefully) as the noirsih femme fatale, and Pantoliano keeps us guessing as the mysterious 'Teddy.' While many other films have borrowed 'Memento''s structure since, few have made it feel so justifiably vital to the credibility of the plot overall--to 'start' at the very end of a story and move backward to the beginning is a daring move, and Nolan is confidently aware of how the preceding events truly gives the conclusion its impact.",7,0,2,18 February 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Long, Gory, and Not Quite Glourious
","Taking its basic inspiration from a subpar '70s actioner (same title, but spelled correctly) by Enzo Castellari, Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' is the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers scalping Nazis at the end of World War II...or maybe it's about the plot to kill the officers of the Nazi high command at the world premiere of a propaganda flick at a small French art theatre...or maybe it's about sitting around in a pub, trying to guess what cultural icon is written on that card pasted to your forehead.To say 'Basterds' takes the 'scenic route' to its inevitable conclusion would be a vast understatement. There is almost too much nuance, subtlety, and craftsmanship to absorb in one sitting, but in its own novel-like way (like the 'Kill Bill' films, this is also divided into chapters), it all comes together, somehow.An avid disciple of trash cinema with an undeniable knack for recycling said trash into creations of originality and cinematic slickness, Tarantino's love--first and foremost--is his characters...and their ability to jaw away on subjects ranging from crucial to superficial. Critics hailed this approach most notably in 'Pulp Fiction,' Tarantino's 1994 breakthrough. But by the time 'Death Proof' rolled into theaters as part of the 'Grindhouse' double bill in 2007, many seemed burned out by what had, at that point, become formulaic (scenes of winding conversation juxtaposed against moments of shocking violence). Those disappointed by 'Death Proof' are not likely to be won over by the ambitious–yet garrulous–'Basterds.' Neither will those who have viewed the 'Basterds' trailer (a shrewdly assembled string of highlights from the film's scattered--yet potent --action scenes) expecting a slam-bang fiesta of Nazi scalpings and bodies riddled with machine-gun fire. As exciting as it would be to see Tarantino truly cut loose with a scuzzy, exploitative homage to his forefathers, I think that duty will be forever be supplanted by frequent collaborator Robert Rodriguez ('Planet Terror'; 'Sin City'). Still, Tarantino has pulled off quite a feat with 'Basterds': he has made an art film that will play on nearly every screen in America, has the misspelled taboo of its title to draw in the curious, and makes sure most of the film's dialog is spoken in an array of languages (French, German, broken Italian)–that's right, this is a film that, for the most part, is READ. The opening-day crowd I saw this with expressed audible displeasure at the near-constant barrage of subtitled dialog. 'C'mon, when do we get to see more scalpings?' it seemed to cantankerously demand.As a period piece, 'Basterds' is aesthetically interesting in that it straddles the line between the tropes associated with low-budget independent film-making and infuses them with a distinctly mainstream slickness (by comparison, this fictionalized take on the fall of the Third Reich and the end of WWII boasts a better plot and more excitement than last year's fact-based 'Valkyrie'). The result is an oft-confounding collection of seemingly disparate events and characters (including frequent flashbacks that, puzzlingly, lack any sort of context), but I can't deny the sheer genius of certain passages, and the way the climax doesn't shy away from upending the proceedings in an unabashed orgy of blood and madness.Above all else, the film is a showcase for Tarantino's distinctly well (some would say over)-drawn characters. Frequently, he will bring the story to an unexpected halt to give a newly-introduced face a monologue that shades in every nook and nuance, often before said character is unceremoniously blown away minutes later. While the result is an arrhythmic pace in a film that could have easily benefited from some dialog clipping, it also portends a depth that goes largely unseen in our attention-deficit era of film-making. And while Brad Pitt earns top billing as Lt. Aldo 'The Apache' Raine (and is perfectly serviceable in the role), the film contains standout performances from Melanie Laurent (as the Jewish survivor of a Nazi raid, who runs the aforementioned French art theatre and conveys a detached, ice-cold beauty) and especially Christoph Waltz as Third Reich Colonel Hans Landa, whose ingratiating smile and laugh portends a darkness that's nothing short of horrifying (don't be surprised if he snags a Best Supporting Actor nod at next year's Oscars).",7,6,15,23 August 2009
Underworld," after 2 strong acts, 'Underworld' derails
","Well, what's good about 'Underworld'?  The direction is solid, the cinematography is excellent, and the sets and costumes are well-conceived. This is basically glossy pulp that doesn't pretend to be more than it really is; filled with visual flourishes (borrowed from 'The Matrix,' a movie I hated), it doesn't make too many worthy demands of the viewer to keep up with the story (a war between vampires and werewolves, and the possible cross-breeding of the two), which is fine by me.  The acting meets the standards of the genre, and the dialogue--as silly as it sometimes is--is kept to exposition and exclamation.  The CGI transformation effects are wisely excuted partly in shadow or darkness, making them somewhat effective. However, after the first two exceptionally strong acts (where I was fully prepared to dub this film the most fun I'd had since seeing 'Ghosts of Mars' in the theater), 'Underworld' devolves into a final sequence in which the film's credibility is worn thin, as vampires and werewolves run down corridors firing weapons in every direction, so much so that I found myself forgetting what their actual objective was.  Basically, the movie could've been 90 minutes and a cult masterpiece, but at two full hours, it's simply overextends its welcome.6/10",6,0,0,25 September 2003
Coraline," Dazzling and Beautiful, Macabre and Hideous
","Underneath all the conceptual quirkiness of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' was a story about characters finding and accepting their true identities (lesson learned: Halloween and Christmas just don't mix). Adapting Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name, director Henry Selick also turns 'Coraline'the tale of a disenchanted young girl who retreats to a fantasy worldinto a character study whose appeal stretches past its obvious '12 and under' demographic. Above all, the film is a visual feast (even more so in 3D) of ceaselessly imaginative imagery that runs the gamut from dazzling and beautiful to macabre and hideous. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a blue-haired, sarcastic preteen who moves to an isolated rooming house with her cold, distant parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman); her only 'friend' is a gawky neighbor boy who furnishes her with a button-eyed doll that bears a striking resemblance to our heroine. In an act of boredom-curbing exploration, Coraline discovers a hidden door in the house that acts as a gateway to a flipside world, where seemingly perfect dopplegangers of the people in her 'real' life possess button eyes, but are ominously attentive and caring. Parallels to the works of Lewis Carroll and Bill Watterson are apt (Coraline gets worldly advice from a talking feline), and what complements the stellar imagery is the metaphoric intelligence of the story: 'Coraline' is a dark fantasy, but its anchor is the mature revelations of its main character and the familiarity and sanctity of the family unit (while admirably abandoning any tendencies toward cloying, melodramatic Family Values).",8,0,3,4 March 2009
Dawn of the Dead," a remake that has no right to be good (but is anyway)...
","Not too long ago, Hollywood rode high on the crest of the teen-horror revival (begun by Wes Craven's 'Scream') as a glut of winking slashers designed to make us nostalgic for the franchise staples of yesteryear('Halloween', 'Friday the 13th', etc.) became the main attraction at multiplexes the world over. Not surprisingly, what at first looked like a trend proved a mere fad and fizzled out in a fraction of the time it took to put Freddy and Jason down. These films were little more than self-conscious showcases for vapid pretty faces with little in the way of acting talent, and CGI-approved gore that made one nostalgic for hand-made FX.Therefore, with Hollywood running low on creative ideas (what else is new?), the teen-horror infatuation was abandoned (or perhaps more accurately, 'transposed') in favor of 'remake mania.' In hopes of snaring both the curious and ignorant, those charming studio executives have shamelessly gone for the throat--especially in the horror genre--in cranking out one soulless remake after another. We're at the point now where there's a direct correlation between using horror remakes as an excuse to launch the film careers of music-video directors, and the results are accordingly shallow product. This raises the question of the necessity of remakes, especially remakes of films that, in most regards, leave no room for improvement and at best will only be perceived as failed hackwork? Why not create a good film out of one that is a piece of unredeemable garbage? Paradoxically, the films of Ray Dennis Steckler or Ed Wood, while incendiary, low-budget, and considered by many to be awful, still attract a cult following that would be just as upset as those who loved, say, George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' and were slack-jawed in horror at the notion of it being remade.With every reason to be skeptical and expectant of a rotten retread in the best-case scenario, Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' takes all the money-grubbing remakes of late (hello, 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'!) to task, and in turn shows what a good remake should be. (At the very least, he shows a reverence that is seriously lacking in the horror genre.) As if aware of the sheer inability to match the wit, intelligence, and horror of Romero's original, screenwriter James Gunn (who previously scripted Troma films) takes the skeletal structure of the original and infuses it into a modern telescope. As before, we are introduced to the survivors of a plague that has swept the world, seeking refuge in a shopping mall. As opposed to the blue-faced, slow-moving zombies of Romero's original, the dead of 'Dawn 2004' are rotten-faced speed freaks who dash crazily after humans who let their guard down. The details of the plague are left appropriately vague--Snyder is less concerned with the cause than he is with knocking you out of your seat (which happens time and again); whereas Romero's film was a more relaxed meditation on consumer culture, Snyder seldom allows time for the audience to catch their breath, as he is staging one elaborate jolt after the next. Oddly enough, this method consistently holds up, and while it can easily be decried as skimping on the depth of Romero's original, it glues you to the screen all the same, and in my opinion, that is a different kind of success.Granted, when the survivors start piling up, few ever get out of the first dimension, but dimension is irrelevant so long as the 1-D characters are given splatterific deaths (I was surprised the chainsaw dismemberment didn't give this an NC-17). After all, within the first few minutes we can pretty much tell who will be around at the climax and who won't. Perhaps there was more CGI used in this film than I noticed, and Snyder's gritty style (which employs a certain dank paleness) obscured it a bit; in any case, the zombie and human kills, and the way they are photographed, is presented with a rollicking intensity that few films of late have shown. 'Dawn 2004' is what '28 Days Later' would have been had it jettisoned its preachy plot. Whether the decision to make the zombies fast-moving savages was an effort to create tension or appeal to our attention-deficit society, it works on both counts.Ultimately, 'Dawn 2004' is an example of a remake done properly, even though I still have the vaguest notion of what a remake really should be. No, it doesn't come anywhere near Romero's social statement, nor his dynamic precision in presenting believable, everyday characters, but it entertains, it frightens, and is bloody fun to watch.",7,0,1,29 March 2005
Iron Man 2," Ambitiously Bigger, but Better?
","My memories of the original 'Iron Man' are generally limited to the notion that I had a good time watching it, and that, for a big-screen translation of a popular comic-book property, it was more cohesive and clever (and boasting a far finer cast) than its less-successful Marvel brethren (think 'The Punisher' and 'Incredible Hulk'). While it didn't come close to touching 'The Dark Knight' (which is probably an unfair comparison for two wildly different superheroes), it was entertaining in a breezy, thrilling manner that got good mileage out of Robert Downey Jr.'s infectious, snarky charisma. 'Iron Man 2' continues this cycle with consistent results: the action sequences are frantic and fast-paced without being incoherent; the cast well-chosen (with a barnstorming Mickey Rourke stealing the show); and the integration of CGI convincingly rendered. As both a continuation of the plot threads and character arcs in the original and as a standalone film, 'Iron Man 2' is a solid, consistently entertaining effort that cements one-time indie darling Jon Favreau (who wrote and starred in the cult classic 'Swingers') as the directorial antithesis of Michael Bay's sloppy, migraine-inducing action style. That being said, there is a nagging sense of lack within the proceedings, as though screenwriter Justin Theroux ('Tropic Thunder'), in an attempt to outdo the original, crammed in as many characters and subplots as possible simply to keep the film busy; while there are many Howard Hawks-ian comedic exchanges that recall the screwball comedies of the 1940s and '50s (many belonging to Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts), there are just as many characters who feel less than necessary (despite their considerable appeal, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson don't have much bearing on the film's outcome). If 'Iron Man 2' is flawed for this reason alone, then that still makes it better (and certainly more ambitious) than most of this summer's blockbuster fodder.",6,0,2,31 May 2010
12 Monkeys," palpable tale of apocalyptic dread...
","'12 Monkeys' is a relentless zigzag of a film with a twisted plot of unexpected turns...it launches us into the future (in this case, 1996) and the past (in this case, 1990, or sometimes even earlier) with such jerky frequency that 'the present' is difficult to discern. Of course, this type of disorientation is typical of director Terry Gilliam, whose films are often marked by an unbridled visionary wackiness that threatens sensory overload (just check out his adaptation of 'Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas'). With '12 Monkeys,' though, a more somber tone pervades as confused, possibly schizophrenic time traveler James Cole (a properly detached Bruce Willis) enlists the help of psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) to stop an organization--known only as 'The Army of the Twelve Monkeys'--bent on carrying out an apocalyptic plan. Or is all as it seems? Perhaps it would be too generous to put '12 Monkeys' on the same pedestal as a vague, thought-provoking work like 'Eraserhead,' but I cannot deny the David Lynch-quality this film possesses. With a nonlinear structure and a story where every detail seems to contribute to a larger whole, the movie easily invites multiple viewings and interpretations. Gilliam's trademark usage of odd camera angles and his fixation on eccentric characters is ever-present, but the maturity of the telling is a marked departure from the norm--this is a downbeat, fearful vision of the end of the world (Brad Pitt's manic spoiled rich-kid is less a source of comic relief and more a chilling reminder of the escalating insanity of the tale) that offers no easy answers.",7,1,2,4 September 2005
Shaun of the Dead," stilted British horror-comedy
","The critical phenomenon 'Shaun of the Dead' inspired is baffling. I saw it in the theater, found it a lightly diverting item with a touch of humor amid the horror (the romantic and domestic drama isn't nearly as successful), but nowhere near the brilliant masterpiece horror fans and mainstream critics were hailing it as. Maybe I have a bit of resiliency towards thick-accented English romps, but 'Shaun of the Dead' feels dramatically awkward and stilted in its humor (it plays out with a hand that's more heavy than incendiary); even the zombies and their ensuing carnage lack grit and terror. That being said, this homage to George Romero's 'Dead' trilogy has its moments, as we follow thankless twentysomething Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his deadbeat roommate Ed (Nick Frost), as they navigate through an unexplained zombie plague...so that Shaun can reconcile with his estranged girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield). In the end, its pervasive sincere charm and some clever in-jokes (Shaun works at 'Foree Electronics,' for instance) keep 'Shaun' watchable, but the premise is ultimately funnier than the movie itself.",5,1,5,25 August 2005
12 Angry Men," riveting psychodrama
","The thankless job of jury duty and the confined room where a verdict is decided serves as the basis for '12 Angry Men,' a riveting psychodrama in which a dozen anonymous male jurors quarrel over a murder suspect's innocence (or lack of) on a hot summer day.  Henry Fonda plays the only sympathetic juror, who, in a domino effect, cites evidence and speculation to not only influence the verdict, but to have the others stray from mob mentality and form their own conclusions.  The way in which the film progresses, using a boy's life to springboard into issues of morality and even racial prejudice, is very clever and well-done, complemented by strong ensemble acting.8/10",8,0,0,28 June 2003
Hostel," this 'Hostel' is little more than a glorified roach motel...
","Some critics with delusions of philosophical grandeur have gone the old 'cautionary tale' route in justifying the excesses of Eli Roth's tediously grueling sophomore effort, 'Hostel.' And while I would be inclined to agree that it IS a cautionary tale, it is certainly not in the same context. By my count, we learn 3 important lessons over the course of 90 minutes: 1) Quentin Tarantino will attach his name to any 'hot' piece of crap that purports to push the boundaries of genre cinema; 2) Harry Knowles and his ilk are clearly commissioned by companies like Miramax and Lions Gate to provide laudatory blurbs in order to help boost box office; and 3) the hype surrounding Eli Roth and his 'craft' is still seriously unfounded.In spite of the praises of a drunken Peter Jackson and recommendations from several friends, I found Roth's debut feature, 'Cabin Fever,' to be a maddeningly obnoxious romp lacking in script, redeemable characters, and any sense of style. You might argue that I'm being overly analytical, that I can't 'enjoy' a movie for what it is, but you would be wrong--the worst offense of 'Cabin Fever' is a total lack of joy in its execution of horrific events and gushing gore.So, is 'Hostel' (a homonym that becomes less clever the more you hear it) an improvement over Roth's previous effort? Not really. While more technically proficient and a bit more developed in story (which isn't saying much), it ultimately remains an experience that is more exhausting and tedious than horrifying and suspenseful, despite the grisly subject matter.The story, such as it is, follows 2 American fratboy types and their Icelandic buddy on a backpacking trip across Europe. That none of these guys are ever clearly defined as characters leaves us to view them as a trio of sexist, homophobic jocks who would be getting pounded in the pit at Ozzfest. While on a train to Slovakia, our heroes encounter a foreign businessman who eats salad with his fingers (har har), insisting that 'Man has lost his relationship with food' (an apparent double meaning is at work here, but I'll be damned if I know how it ties into this movie). Once in Slovakia, our zeroes check into a posh hostel where they are accosted by a duo of Euro-bimbettes; T&A ensues, thus signing away whatever life insurance policy these idiots have. As our fellows gradually and vaguely disappear, it becomes apparent that an underground syndicate of traveling businessmen are paying hefty fees to torture and murder youths in an ugly abandoned warehouse. Or something.While the setup promises great things for an overachieving gorehound, the reality of 'Hostel' is very disappointing. That we care nothing for the characters is the first problem; the clunky, uneven pace that provokes frustration when events should be jetting along is another; and the incredibly awkward attempts at humor (including a gang of renegade Slovak children) are distracting and throw the movie even further from the base of 'realism' it so desperately wants to capture.If Roth has improved his craft on a technical level, it is ironic that this is another factor that works against 'Hostel.' In a movie going for gritty horror, the settings certainly smack of a 'bowels-of-hell' squalor, but the orchestral score, combined with acting that is too deliberate and studied to convey a mood of real consequence, sinks the intended effect. Whereas the recent 'Wolf Creek'--with its unrefined acting, soul-deadening night sequences, and no effort made to explain its madness, heightened the experience to terrifying effect, 'Hostel' is constantly reminding us: 'It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie...' 'Hostel' does have its gory moments, though they're set against such stark lighting (or encapsulated in momentary edits) that they're sometimes hard to make out; while the violence is plentiful and done in Grand Guignol fashion, it left me feeling cold and indifferent. Compared to, say, 'Saw II,' which has a justification--no matter how contrived--for its madness, 'Hostel' is simply a shock show that condenses its confused 'point' in a speech given by a nattering businessman before he applies a blowtorch to his victim's eye. One can almost imagine Roth emphatically saying, 'This is the kind of awful stuff that goes on in the world! See? It's all justified!' Which, of course, is like saying 'The Devil's Rejects' was justified...Perhaps the most savage and nihilistic moment comes at the very end, where our lone surviving hero (minus 'dos dedos') murders the foreign businessman from earlier in the film, thus giving a hollow rush of vengeance that doesn't blur the line between tormentor and tormented, but instead shows the film's hypocritical standpoint on human rights. As if, by killing ONE of the sadists, the black-market torture trade will magically come to a screeching halt. The resulting conclusion I drew from this is that we're pretty much all scum, and have 'lost our relationship' with what makes a quality horror film anymore...'Hostel' is a testament to that.2.5 out of 10",3,1,1,30 January 2006
Public Enemies," Soulless Disinterest
","All the elements are in place for a can't-miss masterpiece, to the point where the generic title ('Public Enemies'? seriously?) seems to be misdirecting us away from the inherent awesomeness that just has to be contained within. The cast? A central trio of bankable faces (Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard) rounded out by a sprawling cast of notable character actors (Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and Stephen Dorff, to name a few). The director? Michael Mann, who has made a name for himself as a meticulous craftsman of cinematic worlds of cops and robbers. Add a period setting pulled from factual events, and the formula for critical praise and box-office success would seem minted. But like a bank robbery gone awry, 'Public Enemies' never quite connects: while certain sequences are nothing short of brilliant (two separate jailbreaks come to mind), the characters themselves never transcend one-dimensional types, which, for a film that runs 140 minutes, is simply inexcusable. In his most one-note performance since the 1995 bill-payer 'Nick of Time,' Depp slaps on a generic Southern accent and a sharp smirk as John Dillinger, whose fearless criminal audacity is ultimately buried under the weight of Mann's frantic technique. Bale suffers the same fate as Melvin Purvis, a committed G-Man who comes across as a gloss on his '3:10 to Yuma' character, albeit with all the character's complexities stripped away. And Cotillard is little more than pretty window-dressing in Mann's typically masculine world. At first, there is some intrigue to the director's technique: obviously using digital video to film a period piece set in 1933, and using claustrophobic close-ups to pinion the viewer within the action, Mann wants us to be accomplices to his anti-heroes. Unfortunately, for as good as Dante Spinotti's cinematography is, Mann's relentless shifting, sweeping, and shaking becomes such a nuisance that it begins to actively erode any entertainment value 'Public Enemies' may have; factor in the fluorescent-bulb quality of DV (and its ugly grain in darker scenes), and you have a film of beautiful scenes and images that is a literal pain to watch. But therein lies the paradox: if we feel nothing for these characters, then even the most beautiful imagery would go nowhere toward redeeming 'Public Enemies' as a whole.",5,1,2,19 July 2009
Madagascar," familiar territory revisited
","By now, we've seen this story so often (told in various forms) that it's barely worth repeating, but I'll deviate from the temptation to simply start my critical engine and recap for those who've arrived late in the game: when a zebra named Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), domesticated by city life, decides to break free and head to the wild on his 10th birthday, his friends (consisting of a lion, hippo, and giraffe) react strangely, but wind up going on an adventure as they are captured and shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, which leads to the ever-important message of undermined friendships ending in tragedy. 'Madagascar' actually has many funny moments (a quartet of scheming penguins are given too little screen time), but the targets of parody ('American Beauty'; 'Chariots of Fire') aren't likely to connect with a young audience, and the voice actors seem confined to familiar shtick (Chris Rock in particular seems to be phoning in his performance), which does nothing to help the stale familiarity of the plot and the fact that there's nothing overly distinctive about this film, especially in the wake of 'Shrek' and 'The Incredibles' (pinnacles of both storytelling and computer animation).",5,0,1,7 October 2005
Oldboy," an unusual yet mesmerizing revenge fable
","I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole 'Asian Extreme' phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always 'makes the bloodlust grow fonder.' 'Oldboy' takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to 'Oldboy' was a stupefied 'huh?' It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, 'Oldboy' is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's 'Deep Red.' However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of 'Oldboy'--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.6.5/10",7,26,93,1 November 2005
Batman Returns," doom, gloom, and a lotta 'kaboom'
","Before tonight, it had been a whopping 14 years since I'd seen 'Batman Returns' (upon its initial theatrical release)...probably because I didn't like it much the first time around. With old(er) age and a more well-rounded appreciation of cinema, I decided to give it another shot, and...well, it was a LITTLE better than I remember it being when I was a tyke. The plot has something to do with a deformed child dumped in the Gotham City sewer, who is befriended and raised by penguins, and somehow amasses a face-painted sideshow cult to do his bidding, rising to the ranks of Penguin (an extremely unrestrained Danny DeVito); meanwhile, put-upon secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) stumbles upon a shady deal her industrialist boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is looking to pull, and is murdered for her efforts, only to be resurrected as Catwoman, a nimble minx in a bondage outfit. Batman (Michael Keaton) spends most of his time in the background of chaotic scenes, and is hardly in the movie. 'Batman Returns' shows off director Tim Burton's big-budget stylistic flair, with a taste for the macabre and a morbid sense of humor; the script, however, takes a colossal misstep in putting the Penguin at the center of things, as he is easily the most obnoxious adversary the Caped Crusader has ever had to confront. His endless one-liners only randomly hit the funny bone, and the plot surrounding him feels fabricated. Catwoman has more seductive charm, as does Walken's Shreck, but even they can't detract from this overcooked movie.",5,2,4,26 February 2006
Hot Fuzz," May be the best comedy of 2007
","Despite a glut of critical accolades, 'Shaun of the Dead' struck me as an uneven parody/homage of George Romero's zombie films--the premise was well-executed, the carnage grisly, and the laughs sort of infrequent. I don't know, perhaps it was my own bias toward a bunch of Brits sending up Romero's VERY American films (and the subsequent humor being skewed in the vein of the former) that kept the film from being all it could have been. The good news with 'Hot Fuzz' is that it's not only a fine rebound from 'Shaun,' but possibly the best comedy of 2007. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), London's finest boy in blue, is reassigned to the small idyllic town of Standford after his superior officer claims he's making the rest of the force 'look bad'; Standford comes across as a squeaky-clean village where a missing swan commands police priority, but when a string of gruesome 'accidents' claim the lives of several citizens, Angel gets suspicious. Whereas 'Shaun''s setting seemed to work against it, co-writers Pegg and Edgar Wright (who also directed) strike up a balanced script that takes aim at the Michael Bay/Kathryn Bigelow school of Hollywood cop flicks ('Bad Boys II' and 'Point Break' figure wonderfully into the plot), all the while acknowledging the absurdity of rapid-fire shootouts taking place in the English countryside (the last half hour is a jaw-dropping, hilarious tribute to quick-cutting and over-the-top action). The chemistry between Pegg and Nick Frost (who plays Angel's naive partner) is excellent, a comedic collaboration that grows richer with each film; and the supporting cast of British veterans is well-chosen, from Billie Whitelaw to Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and even former James Bond Timothy Dalton (as a shady supermarket manager, of all things). My only complaint would be an overlong run time that hurts the otherwise strong momentum, but even so, 'Hot Fuzz' is a winner.",7,2,4,21 November 2007
Constantine," 'Now let us give NO thanks for this overcooked turkey!'
","If Tom Servo had popped his little gumball-machine head up in a silhouette during 'Constantine,' he probably would have voiced my opinion precisely: 'What pretentious crap!' (from 'Pod People,' by the way).This film brought me to one conclusion about mortality, however: I really have to stop trusting the recommendations of people who liked 'Resident Evil,' for that film and its kin ('Constantine' most definitely included) do nothing but leave a hollow hole of regret in my brain at 2 potentially productive hours put to waste.Anyway, the perpetually stoic Keanu Reeves (who certainly looks good, even if he still can't act) is a cheap 'Noir' demon-dispeller named John Constantine; early on, he performs an exorcism on a girl bound to a bed while Max von Sydow leads a chorus of 'The Power of Christ Compels You!' Later on, when one of Constantine's in-the-supernatural-know buddies is consumed by killer flies, Rod Steiger drops by with a message of: 'For God's Sake, Get Out Of The Bowling Alley!' Non-actor Gavin Rossdale shows up a few times, proving that there IS life after Bush (he also looks smashing in a suit!). People sprout ostentatious CGI 'wings' or rotting faces in an attempt to remove all metaphor from who is 'good' and 'bad.' Near the end, Constantine massacres a bunch of demonic minions in a hospital in what looks like any given screen shot from 'Doom'; shortly after, Satan himself shows up, and you almost think director Francis Lawrence (who, by the way, is a music video auteur by trade) is going to pull a 'Joel Coen' out of his seemingly limitless bag of cinematic tricks...but of course, he doesn't. The cinematography is initially unique, but quickly deteriorates into obtuse, showy obnoxiousness and whiplash edits. Rachel Wiesz plays a cop whose twin sister commits suicide...or does she? And more importantly, do I care? Not really, which means the style 'Constantine' so tenuously floats on gets old and disingenuous fairly quickly.Now, I usually allow a certain amount of leeway for comic-book-to-film adaptations, especially in light of recent triumphs like 'Sin City,' which went to great lengths to reproduce the printed page. Logic and backstory doesn't have to be forthcoming (or necessary at all) if the characters are at least somewhat well-drawn and the story possesses a modicum of interest. 'Constantine' is a mumbo-jumbo mess from start to finish, with a story that seems to have been lost (or at least truncated) in translation, an overkill of CGI effects, and a running time that drags like a one-legged zombie in a science lab...",3,3,7,12 October 2005
Ed Wood," one of the greatest movies ever made
","It's unusual. The critical consensus on the films of Tim Burton seems to always reach a level of love-it-or-hate-it polarization, and with a few exceptions, I don't necessarily consider myself a fan of his work (his films are artistically brilliant, but usually in service to half-baked screenplays), but 'Ed Wood' is a film so unlike any other in his creepy-crawly back-catalog that it performs one feat of brilliance after another, fearlessly and joyfully, extremely and tragically. By taking some welcome liberties with the actual story of notoriously inept filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., Burton transforms this film (photographed in black and white, with makeup and production design that echoes the 1950s perfectly) into a documentary that exists in the alternate universe of one man's mind, while simultaneously being the most down-to-earth film he's made, with moments of staggering hilarity, tenderness, and imagination. In 'Ed Wood,' Burton finally has the balance of his creative, offbeat vision in conjunction with a strong script that matches it well. The polarization that marks his films makes the subject matter an ironic choice to tackle--author of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space,' reviled by many as the worst movie ever made, and with a penchant for dressing in drag to 'feel closer' to women, Ed Wood is a character with a demeanor as unusual as Burton's, and maybe the ultimate posthumous tribute of this film is the manner in which it displays Wood's spirit, sincerity, and vision in spite of his poverty-stricken projects. Johnny Depp's performance as the never-discouraged (except when dealing with Baptist financial backers) director is carried out in a way that should render it a flaming caricature, but instead becomes something of genius; his Wood conveys a vibrancy and life that sees him through the difficult times of his relationship with aging Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance) and girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker); when crew members complain about getting only one-hour's sleep during a grueling night shoot, Wood counters: 'I got no sleep, and I feel great!' Such a mantra could be applied to Burton's execution of the film--despite its deliriously light fantasy, fiction, and occasional lapses into the surreal (even incorporating a scene where Wood has a chance encounter with his idol, Orson Welles), 'Ed Wood' is driven more by character than style; it would be fair to say the two mix harmoniously to create a work of sheer brilliance and total entertainment. Though I first watched this film 10 years ago, each subsequent viewing has played as consistently as the first, and if that isn't a sign of quality in a world of paper-plate flying saucers, I don't know what is.",9,1,1,17 July 2005
Insomnia," cinematic school of the drooping eyelids...
","In 'Insomnia,' director Christopher Nolan and his cinematographer have a knack for schizophrenic edits that disorient and surprise with regularity, putting a fine accent on an otherwise unspectacular police procedural with delusions of a deeper moral core (some aspects of which work quite well, to an extent). Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (an appropriately somnambulant Al Pacino) is sent to the small city of Nightmute, Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl, but accidentally shoots his partner while in pursuit of the murder suspect; throughout the rest of the movie, Dormer is racked with guilt (which reveals another transgression years before) and is unable to sleep. He forges a bond with the girl's murderer, an author played with a too-controlled earnestness by Robin Willaims (whose dark side was displayed much better in 'One Hour Photo'), and these two actually wind up showing a multi-layered morality and depth that is mature and endearing. However, too many unnecessary plot threads run through 'Insomnia,' and the script frequently resorts to repetition to pad things out (and at nearly two hours, the movie is already overlong)details about different guns and bullets and who possesses what winds up less clever than confusing; similarly, a boyfriend character is given little personality and just serves as a convenient plot device to take the killers' fall when the third act rolls around. And, after a fairly satisfying buildup in its first half, 'Insomnia' unravels the closer it comes to the endinstead of the action and suspense tightening, it becomes as lethargic as the sleepless Dormer, to the point where a shootout ending is inserted (which, despite some subtle closing irony, pretty much jettisons the pains the film took to be cerebral) to wrap up the plot in a crowd-pleasing way. Removing the fog of amazement many critics had toward Nolan's 'Memento,' 'Insomnia' is a sophomore effort that's rather thin beneath the surfacea cinema stunt that too infrequently rises above convention.5.5/10",6,0,2,7 October 2005
Juno," Spitfire 'Juno' kicks 'Knocked Up' to the curb
","2007 has been the year of the overrated pregnancy comedy, with last summer's 'Knocked Up' and now 'Juno' as recipients of hype and high box office. Unlike most of the critical populace (save for a few clear-headed writers like Maryann Johanson), I found little to like in Judd Apatow's film, and was particularly turned off by its lack of realismin spite of the critical accolades it received, I found its plot machinations (and jokes) to be the stuff of stale-sitcom artificiality and Hollywood Happy Endings. I approached 'Juno' similar to how I approached 'Knocked'it's getting a lot of press, so I'll see it.And while 'Juno' has its share of problems (which I'll get to later), it knocks 'Knocked Up' to the curb. The story follows 16-year old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page'Hard Candy'), who finds herself impregnated by soft-spoken track star Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera'Superbad'), and the ensuing ups and downs that come from the appraisal of her classmates, her parents, and even the couple who volunteers to adopt the yet-unborn. Whereas 'Knocked' carefully blew off issues like abortion (hit the punchline, cut to next scene!), it is the first thing Juno discusses with her best friendand while there is an undercurrent of humor to her visit to the clinic (where a classmate holds a solitary protest outside), this setpiece never ventures into cartoon terrain.While Juno herself comes off as the lost sister of the 'Ghost World' girls, and her character and dialog can be incredibly caustic for caustic's sake (first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody's hipper-than-thou barbs are frequently over-the-top and almost trivialize the more controlled elements of the story), there is a surprising relativity in Page's performance that eventually transcends what, at first, seems like an immature, one-note teenage character.The same can be said for the ensemble cast surrounding her. Cody's script and Jason Reitman's direction cleverly works the characters from straightforward caricatures (the perpetually-perky adoptive mother; the dog-obsessed stepmother; the cheerleader friend; the dim jock) to fleshed-out, three-dimensional people whom we genuinely care about. For its first hour, 'Juno' made me smile a lot, even laugh a few times, but only in its last third did it take on a level of complexity that gave way to a humbling maturity in Juno and those around her. I honestly did not expect the dramatic elements to kick in with such wrenching force, but they do, and they are seen through to their most logical conclusion. By the end, 'Juno' had touched me in a manner that made 'Knocked Up' seem all the more clueless.While I'll grant that 'Juno' earns its laughs and tears honestly, it can also be pretentious in spots. Reitman, whose 'Thank You for Smoking' struck me as a slick yet show-offy ensemble comedy, frequently seems to be cribbing Wes Anderson's stark aesthetic and twist-of-fate life lessons. Additionally, the soundtrack of indie songs with the minimalist guitar and faux-poetic lyrics is overincorporatedwhile I understand that it's symbolizing the mentality of a teenage girl who's a bit pretentious herself, too many scenes are punctuated by it, to the point of redundancy. And even the animated opening-credits sequence seems to be invoking the Daniel Clowes-created 'Ghost World' with another nod toward the distinctive portraits that appear in Anderson's films. On a plot level, the relationship between Juno and Paulie is developed in brief snippets throughout the film, but the plot turns in the last act don't jell quite as well as they shouldwhile there's a satisfactory (and perfectly believable) closure for the characters, it seems to be missing a few steps.But 'Juno' is ultimately a modestly endearing film despite its aesthetic missteps, using a deceptively simple plot device to tell a tale that cuts to the heart of a teenager's emotional core, and presents the leap into maturity as something as painful as labor, albeit with its rewards in the end. Not one of 2007's best films, but easily the best pregnancy comedy (of errors).6.5 out of 10",7,4,14,13 January 2008
Zodiac," Definitely worth another look, especially if you didn't like it the first time around
","When Canadian Industrial band Skinny Puppy came out with their first album in 8 years, many fans embraced the music, but just as many seasoned veteran listeners greeted it with scorn. The overall complaint was that the band was merely cashing in on the anti-Bush bandwagon (circa 2004); others posited that it did not sound like the band they'd grown up listening to (circa the '80s and '90s). In other words, the group didn't meet expectations because they did something DIFFERENT, as opposed to what was EXPECTED. My conclusion, which also applies to David Fincher's sweeping epic 'Zodiac,' is: change is inevitable with the passage of timeif you want 'the same old thing,' go back and listen to it, or watch it, or whatever.That being said, my first viewing of 'Zodiac' (during its theatrical run) left me feeling almost remarkably disappointed. I had been anticipating the film since I first heard about it (circa 2005), as it was based on one of my favorite true-crime cases, and directed by David Fincher, who had created some of my favorite films. If ever there was an ideal pairing (and Fincher had shown his skill with serial-killer thrillers in the classic 'Se7en'), this would be it. Yet as I sat in the theater, I was almost disappointed in Fincher's own self-administered stylistic restraint as the film went off in the direction of a character study mixed with police procedural. I liked it up until about 90 minutes in, and found the remainder of its 158-minute run time to be labored and unengagingright at the point where the tension should have been rebuilding. That, and I found that Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal, two up-and-comers, didn't possess the necessary chops to see the remainder of 'Zodiac' through. After a 5 year gap, I was left somewhat bitter at what Fincher had (or hadn't) delivered.And now that I'm typing up a review, fresh off my second viewing (ah, the wonders of DVD!), I have to say my initial impressions have changed radically. (Of course, part of this is me confessing my own pro-Fincher slant.) There is an interesting generational dynamic at work in the 'Zodiac' reviewsmany of the elder critics who rejected Fincher's previous films have showered the heaviest praise on this one. And it is highly likely to alienate the teens and twentysomethings (myself included) who watched 'Se7en' at an impressionable age, and celebrate 'Fight Club' with near-religious fervor. For Fincher, who has built his career on unusual and unsettling projects, 'Zodiac' is really the closest he has come to 'normality,' despite the subject matter.I kept thinking that the film would play better on the small screen, and sure enough, it does. Without the distractions often associated with theaters, home viewing becomes 'Zodiac''s most fitting arena, a safe haven to soak up the volumes of detail present within this lengthy mystery. In addition to the near-relaxed style and sepia tones present, the other audience-limiting factor is the convoluted nature of the caseyes, 'Zodiac' is a film that demands total concentration on the viewer's part, loaded with dates, places, and characters who pop up sporadically throughout the narrative. Fincher successfully condenses James Vanderbilt's screenplay (based on the book by Robert Graysmith, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal in the film) into something coherent, but only if you stay on your toes. 'Zodiac' is admirably challenging in its effort to turn a mainstream film into a thinking (wo)man's piece.Fully engaged in the story, it's interesting to see Fincher's stylistic touches channeled in a manner contrary to the visual dazzle he's known for. First is the cast: comprised not of marquee names but real faces, actors like Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal (both usually associated with lighter fare) actually leave fitting impressions in remarkably human roles; ditto Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, and Donal Logue as policemen from three different jurisdictions. This lack of bankable names is quite daring, and the performances sell the film. Second: the subtle depiction of obsession present is cleverly displayedin any other film, Graysmith's relationship with his wife (Chloe Sevigny) would have been padded out into a subplot, but Fincher makes it a side note to the Zodiac hunt, thus eliminating potentially melodramatic filler. Similarly, Robert Downey Jr. (as SF Chronicle reporter Paul Avery) has an excellent scene (among many excellent scenes), wherein he tells the invigorated Graysmith to forget about the dormant case, something the audience may be agreeing with at that point. Gyllenhaal, who gives the material his best shot, ultimately keeps us anchored in his Everyman pursuit of truth, to a substantial, satisfying payoff (the film's final scene gave me chills).Is 'Zodiac' the jewel in Fincher's celluloid crown? No. It is, for my taste, a very well-made film that will probably make its way onto my 'Best of 2007' list and alienate a lot of the director's cult following. But I'll be the first to admit that stepping back and viewing the film as the logical progression of Fincher's diverse career will make it more satisfying and rewarding. If you were left cold by it before, give it another lookit might just surprise you the second time around.7.5 out of 10",8,3,4,27 July 2007
Milk," The Milky Way
","I'll begin by stating my general dislike of director Gus Van Sant: seldom has a director's own eccentricity in style and structure grated so abrasively against my nerves (I consider 'Elephant' one of the worst films ever made); in most of my experiences with his work, I have been put off by his pretentious, avant-garde tendencies that pine so desperately to break through to the mainstream. And while 'Milk' (easily Van Sant's best film) is often susceptible to distancing, distracting stylistic and tonal shifts, the end result is a heartfelt and optimistic true-life character study. Harvey Milk (played with immersive passion by an Oscar-winning Sean Penn) gained notoriety in the Castro District of San Francisco in the 1970s by bringing gay rights to the forefront of a repressive social climate, at first as an outspoken citizen, and soon after, as a political candidate. His growing achievements (that eventually result in his election to public office, making him the first openly gay candidate to achieve such status) are recalled in flashback, contained in a series of vignettes that chronicle the personal and political roadblocks and triumphs of this driven, determined man. While 'Milk' is clearly Penn's show (and Van Sant wisely keeps him in nearly every frame), he is surrounded by a capable supporting cast, including James Franco (as Milk's supportive ex-lover), Emile Hirsch (as a volunteer who rallies the disenchanted masses), and Josh Brolin (as the not-quite-earthbound Dan White, a fellow city Supervisor clinging to 'moral' values).",7,0,2,19 April 2009
The Prestige," Proof that an ending can make or break a movie
","Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.'The Prestige' is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with 'Memento' and rejuvenated the ailing 'Batman' franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of 'Insomnia,' Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of 'The Prestige.' After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the 'Saw' series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, 'The Prestige''s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.In 'Secret Window,' Johnny Depp told us: 'The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good.' Too bad the same can't be said for 'The Prestige,' a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater.",6,3,7,14 November 2006
Cloverfield," Operation Enduring Love
","A lot of things get smashed, destroyed, and brokenheck, most of Manhattan, for that matterin 'Cloverfield,' but the film never really breaks through the surface of getting us to care much about it. The most high-profile film of 2008's 'found footage' fad is rife with spectacle in its attempt to postmodernize the drive-in flicks of the 1950s, where some Inexplicable Thing (irradiated bugs, hostile aliens, or plain'ol monsters) bears down on our resourcefulbut all too humanprotagonists. Yet 'Cloverfield' falls shortthe ultimate result has scattered moments of palpable fear, but never really finds a suitable emotional pitch until it's almost over, and by then the plot machinations render any real sympathy a moot point. The film is problematically populated by narcissistic young-professional types residing in NYC, who are at Ground Zero the night some Inexplicable Thing attacks Manhattan; instead of fleeing, our young heroes instead set out to find the girlfriend of the main protagonist, trapped in her apartment complex. 'Cloverfield' takes elements from 'Godzilla' films, Gap ads (the no-name cast is certainly model-caliber, if nothing else), and even 'Shaun of the Dead' (down-and-out guy trying to win his girl back in the midst of extenuating circumstances), filtering the unraveling spectacle through a first-person perspective; this gimmick, surprisingly, doesn't work as well here as it did in 'Diary of the Dead' and 'Quarantine'instead of heightening visceral experience, it paradoxically draws too much attention to itself ( having the camera guy constantly mentioning his need to 'document' everything doesn't help matters), while at times wanting to draw attention away from a lot of obvious CGI. And it's hard to be pulled into a survival situation when even the extras look like they've been done up by professional make-up artists. The blatant references to 9/11 don't resonate on a level any deeper than their blaring-neon obviousness, and come across as simplistic attempts to lend the film a social significance it doesn't deserve; and the glossy slickness of the film's look overall actively works against its chances of delivering a terrifying, in-the-moment experience. As with most experiments, 'Cloverfield' is conceptually impressive, but a maddening disappointment overall.",5,0,1,5 December 2008
Crash," well-done, but beats you into a corner with its 'message'
","Bearing no relation to the David Cronenberg film of the same name, Paul Haggis's 'Crash' is a button-pushing film that shoves race discrimination in the viewer's face in a way that is both admirable and off-putting. When dealing with such issues, filmmakers tend to shroud themselves in a protective cloak that makes them invincible from negative criticism, as those who criticize, without careful justification, can be painted as being as racist as the characters in the movie. My central objection comes in the form of the sledgehammer subtlety with which the issue is presentednot that it doesn't deserve addressing in such a waythat causes the film to reek of 'Oscar consideration,' and thus removing some of its authenticity. Thematically, the extensive ensemble cast linked by scenes of racism that change their perceptions (a DA and his wife are carjacked at gunpoint; an Iraqi store owner is robbed; a black director releases his pent-up fury after witnessing his wife being molested by a corrupt cop; a detective investigates the murder of a young black man; a rookie policeman is hardened by two notable racial encounters), and the stories and the resulting fatal ironies that occur are well-done, with spectacular performances all around (Matt Dillon as a racist cop; Ludicrous as a paranoid petty criminal; Sandra Bullock as the DA's wife). Unlike 2003's '21 Grams,' which also presented moral and emotional quandaries with the intent of telling a story from three equally-explored viewpoints, 'Crash' is more prone to contrivance (that cop's demeanor really shifted drastically), especially when put against the gimmicky framework of a single 'day in the life,' which leads to plot developments that seem forced and inauthentic. Still, almost in spite of its overwhelming good intentions, 'Crash' is compelling, unpredictable, and well-performed. It will provoke discussion and linger in your mind, which is an achievement in and of itself.",6,0,3,6 October 2005
The Expendables," Quite Dependable, Actually
","Despite the beefy, leathery exterior that has defined him as world-class neck-breaker but nowhere close to a serious thespian, Sylvester Stallone may be a bit more astute (in terms of cinematic technique and his own roller-coaster celebrity status) than I have given him credit for. On one hand, 'The Expendables' is a killer title for a film that is as badass as its world-class, neck-breaking cast; on the other hand, that very title seems to be winking back at its built-in, action-hungry audience -- as if daring us to take a leap of faith that will make us believe that misbegotten stars of yesteryear, many of whom have floundered in the direct-to-video action ghetto, still have the ability to leave us in awe of their prowess (both dramatically and physically). It's a mighty gamble that Stallone (as director and co-writer) takes to delirious extremes; the result is both a thrilling, bloody action showcase and a much smoother directorial outing (despite the expected deluge of explosions and bullet-riddled bodies) than 2008's barnstorming 'Rambo.' The plot itself doesn't stray far from the star's favored tropes: South American dictator ('Dexter''s David Zayas) puppeteered by rogue CIA toady (a deliciously oily Eric Roberts) who holds a small island territory in a grip of fear; the heart-of-gold daughter who defects to help The Good Guys and convinces our jaded hero that some things ARE worth fighting for; the general lustful attention to the facets of fun and dirty mayhem. The script is peppered with in-jokes and knowing winks (some of them quite literal), and manages to balance the lighter moments with the more predictable excesses (there is even a fantastic scene where Mickey Rourke -- as the team's haunted go-to guy -- relays a wrenching monologue about the moment when his 'soul turned black'). In a summer that has been sadly void of creativity and anything resembling a fresh idea, Stallone returns the action faithful to 1985 -- and re-affirms cinematic testosterone in the process. 'The Expendables' is anything but.",7,1,7,18 August 2010
Knocked Up," 'Knocked Up' and out...of 2 hours I'll never get back
","I feel it is my duty as a proactive thinker and cinema fan to level some serious complaints against the unfunny, un-moving, un-touching, un-realistic farce of a farce called 'Knocked Up.' I know film does not need a basis in realism, but when critics hail a film for its sense of 'accuracy' in real-life terms, I carry a whisper of that with me into the theater, whether it is comedy, drama, horror, or avant-garde surrealism. That 'Knocked Up' has a 92% 'fresh' rating at RottenTomatoes implies one of two things: 1) that film critics need to leave their homes/apartments once in a while and experience life outside the vicarious lens of cinema; or 2) that said critics, in their bubble of maintaining a bar by which the public sets their tastes by, are very out-of-touch with humor derived from real-life situations (a possible 3) is that the other summer comedy offerings are simply so bottom-of-the-barrel that this looks brilliant by comparison).Or perhaps it's because writer/director Judd Apatow is just so 'hot' right now--hey, he made 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' (which I loved, by the way), and 'Knocked Up' can only be as good, if not better! Right?!? Well, NO. 'Virgin' was not a solitary Apatow effort; in the co-writer's chair was the very funny and talented Steve Carrel (who has successfully picked up the Comedy Crown once held by James Carrey), and after seeing 'Knocked Up,' you can almost tell where the Apatow/Carrel script gradations occur (Apatow: the bar/pick-up scenes; Carrel: the whole of Andy Stitzer). 'Virgin' had a strong anchor in Carrel, who also hit the right notes of depression, anxiety, joy, and sarcasm in 'Little Miss Sunshine.' In 'Knocked,' Seth Rogen (a funny supporting character in 'Virgin') shows no leading-man quality, even in the 'unlikely' way the film laboriously sets up; Katherine Heigl, the E! producer (yeah, very realistic, isn't it) to whom he does the titular deed, brings nothing exceptional out of his character, since her character is also a shallow, contrived cliché (and certainly acted as one).Like an extended sitcom (Apatow worked in television before becoming a Hollywood hitmaker), 'Knocked Up' writhes in textbook stereotypes, clichés, and generalizations. As other critics have keenly pointed out, Heigl's 'attraction' to Rogen is a Screen writing 101 contrivance, and the film ultimately gives us no satisfactory justification for this relationship (of course, the film progresses under the 'realistic' pretense that we should not care about such unimportant details). Does it even need saying that this unlikely couple will try to make things work, have some arguments, and wind up together as Better People in the end? Countless films with predictable structures have held my interest better than 'Knocked Up,' through innovations in character, dialog, or simply plot twists.I kept wondering, as the audience broke out into roars of laughter, if there was something I was missing. For the record, I am a 26-year old, single white male, and I do have a sense of humor. My mind cycled through potential audiences for 'Knocked Up': married couples, people in long-term relationships, parents, and...potheads. While it is Apatow's clear intent to have me rolling in the aisles with every stale-in-five-years pop-culture reference (of which there are many, camouflaged as 'punchlines' to 'jokes'), I came to the conclusion that, if nothing else, I should be LOLing at Rogen's pathetic roommates. You see, they want to start a website displaying video clips of celebrity nudity (any Howard Stern listener will see this unfunny 'punchline' coming from the get-go)! They all get pink-eye! They make Taliban jokes about a roommate who's agreed to a beard-bet! And, they...smoke lots of pot! In another movie, these gags may have worked, but Apatow's method is to just have the audience gawk, expecting the sheer simple overstatement to elicit impressed guffaws. Tenacious D invoked that type of humor in a more creative and FUNNY way last year, but their movie tanked (explains a lot, doesn't it?).While I sat waiting for 'Knocked Up' to unveil some revelation about existence that I was somehow missing, I could only come to one conclusion as the credits began rolling: audiences and critics alike want their 'realistic comedy' coated in an impenetrable layer of super-sweet sitcom frosting. Oh, yeah, and for the slob hero to 'change' so he can earn the affections of a girl who looks like Barbie. LMFAO.",3,7,16,6 July 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody Wonderful!
","First, I will get the most obvious (and redundant) sentiment out of the way: 'Sweeney Todd' IS Tim Burton's best film since 'Ed Wood'; and, had 'Ed Wood' never been made, 'Sweeney Todd' would be his best filmperiod, bar none, no arguments. Sure, it's based on the long-running Stephen Sondheim musical, but this film version is Burton's own distinctive animala marriage of his trademark Gothic visuals paired with richly fleshed-out characterizations. Imagine Herschell Gordon Lewis with a budget and a proclivity for song, and you've got it.I have always appreciated Burton's eye for distorting typical American facades (the Gothic carnival of 'Batman'; the eerie pastel caricature of suburbia in 'Edward Scissorhands'; the literal Candyland of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory')the man knows how to put his own distinctive stamp on a picture. However, many of the scripts he's chosen to helm come up short in character development (usually more comfortable to present the 'outside world' as a string of shopworn clichés), save always for a protagonist who is some sort of socially maladjusted outcast. The result has been films that are aesthetically pleasing (certainly wonderful to look at) yet emotionally hollow.Yet in the character of Sweeney Todd (played by Johnny Depp), Burton finds his greatest outcast alter-egonot only does Depp dissolve into the role, but as the film progresses, we see Burton's own socially awkward persona fade into the characterization, as well. What could have come off as nothing more than a filmed version of a popular musical instead becomes a complex character study of the motives that drive a man to madness; Todd inhabits a world so grey and dark that the upside of things is impossible to recognize (until it's too late).That being said, the setup is rather simple: in flashback, we learn that Todd was happily married to Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), only to have her and his child, Johanna (Jane Wisener), stolen away by the lecherous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Silenced and hardened by 15 years of imprisonment under a bogus charge, Todd is released and returns to London with vengeance in mind (his first song is a misanthropic screed against the city that sets the tone for the remainder of the film). He quickly comes across Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the proprietor of a roach-infested meat pie emporium; their relationship develops into a mix of business and pleasure, as Todd's victims become the main ingredient in the pies. But never does Burton give Sweeney an exit into an easy love affair with Lovettin a great montage, she fantasizes about traveling the world with the earnings from her rejuvenated business, with a stoic, frowning Sweeney en tow.Now, I have never been a big fan of movie musicalsin many cases, I have gone out of my way to avoid them. Songs from the Disney school have always struck me as redundant re-iterations of things the audience already knows, serving as little more than fodder the kids can sing to death on the car ride home (did any parent leave 'The Lion King' unscathed by choruses of 'Hakuna Matata'?), while big-budget studio productions have always struck me as overblown and pretentious. Something daringly controversial ('South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut') or conceptually innovative (the Burton-produced 'Nightmare Before Christmas') can more easily earn my favor, and 'Sweeney Todd' is impressive not because you'll be humming the songs on the way out of the theater, but because the music blends so seamlessly with the spoken dialoga way of further developing character and plot that puts us in within a jubilantly macabre world. Burton knows this terrain well, and frequently hits notes of pitch-perfect black humor when we least expect it. And just as surprising is a subplot involving a vagabond boy who falls for Sweeney's now-teenaged Johanna; what at first seems like padding eventually becomes the innocent-love counterpoint to the demon barber's own path of vengeance, desolation, and lost hope.As with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' Burton favors the streets of Britain, and makes even the aristocratic areas gleam with squalorthe whole production looks like a postmodern Hammer flick, with blood spraying in a deep-red, exaggerated manner. 'Sweeney Todd' also retains the director's own Gothic cutie-pie fashion nods (Depp often looks like a sinister variant on Edward Scissorhands, with Bonham Carter invoking a live-action manifestation of the Corpse Bride), and the characters' appearances actually complement their color-drained lives. And the performances...well, they're the stuff of genius, simply put.'Sweeney Todd' is not only Burton's second-best film, but one of the best of 2007.8.5 out of 10",9,2,6,25 December 2007
Shutter Island," Insanity Island
","Late in 'Shutter Island,' Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's head-spinner of a novel, weary U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the Warden (Ted Levine) of the Ashecliffe Institute (which rests on the titular isle) share a conversation on God, nature, and violence while in a moving jeep. Scorsese ingeniously blocks the scene so that all we see are the two men conversing and the spring foliage passing by, as if our characters are being propelled toward the inevitable not by a motor vehicle, but by fatalistic machinations beyond their control.Applying decades of film-making experience to a genre he's less known for (save for the 1991 remake of 'Cape Fear'), Scorsese uses this initial element of surprise to, well, SURPRISE us. Continuously. With modern thrillers relying on fickle, manipulative twists as the sole justification for their being, 'Shutter Island' (which faithfully ports over a staggering majority of Lehane's characters, plot, and dialog) digs deep into the psychosis of its characters, using the isolated island and its damaged inhabitants as a greater metaphor for a world in which madness reigns (the film is set in 1954, subtly using the Red Scare to extend this theme).In the opening shot, a ferry slowly emerges from a white, all-encompassing fog; on board are Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), two Marshals who have been assigned to locate Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a murderess who has inexplicably escaped from Ashecliffe. Through a series of imposing, wide-angle shots and knowingly ominous musical cues, Scorsese sets an overwhelming tone of dread and isolation before our protagonists even get off the boat, and almost sustains it for 'Shutter Island''s entirety. The island is populated by a brilliantly-chosen collection of character actors (most leaving big impressions with only a few lines of dialog): Ben Kingsley (as the evasive Dr. Cawley), Max von Sydow (advocate of brain-surgery-as-clinical-cure Dr. Naehring), John Carroll Lynch (as head of island security), and Levine are quite smooth as administrators and law enforcement, conveying unarticulated jagged edges through stoic stares and subtle mannerisms. The patients themselves range from the seemingly normal males and females of Wards A and B, to the scar-faced terrors of the penitentiary-like Ward C (including Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas).While Scorsese's genre-crossing film-making skill is impossible to deny here (and is indeed the dominant driving force of the movie), 'Shutter Island' marks another notch in the ladder of Leonardo DiCaprio's career. His turn as the penniless, handsome artist in the astronomically overrated 'Titanic' really did nothing for me, and it wasn't until 2006's 'The Departed' (his third collaboration with Scorsese) that I felt he cemented his leading-man potential. Here, DiCaprio invokes the rugged look and swagger of a '50s celebrity icon; what impresses, however, is the fearlessness with which he probes the psychologically damaged Daniels (as revealed in vivid World War II flashbacks and surreal, grisly dream sequences), going to dark corners that separate his acting skill from his boyish good looks.'Shutter Island' does such a fine job of keeping the audience unsettled, with the notion that our feet are never firmly glued to any sort of relatable reality, that the climactic events come as a slight disappointment; while Laeta Kalogridis' script is an excellent example of a literary adaptation done right, it is Lehane's key revelation that comes as a letdown. However, credit must be given for presenting it in a manner that coalesces so well with all that has come before that it enriches, rather than cheapens, the film overall. And with a thriller as classy as 'Shutter Island,' that's merely a minor crime.",8,2,5,21 February 2010
Corpse Bride," color me a shade of disappointed blue...
","While I am not among the nodding legions who hail every work of Master Burton 'an artistic masterpiece,' I will acknowledge his talent for visual flair, which is in abundance in 'Corpse Bride.' Unfortunately, the dazzling eye candy falls flat in the wake of a blandly conventional story (boy is arranged to marry girl; meets dead girl; boy then finds his commitment in question) that simply isn't 'fresh' enough to merit the painstaking craft of stop-motion animation. The ghoulish undead underworld looks like a tamed version of Clive Barker's Midian (from 'Nightbreed'), the song lyrics are mostly indecipherable (but that might be a good thing), and the gags revolve around painfully obvious puns and dangling/popped-out eyeballs. And, once again, Burton hammers home the importance of 'accepting people for what they are...even if they ARE dead,' as he's done in seemingly all of his films. The presence of veteran actors Michael Gough (voicing one of the wise undead) and Christopher Lee (as a wonderfully cantankerous priest) provide some bright spots, but cannot elevate 'Corpse Bride' above its glaring superficialness.",5,1,6,2 October 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Exceptional...another gem from 2007
","Wow. I'll admit I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but if 'Gone Baby Gone' is any indication of his directorial prowess, I may have to reassess my opinion. Based on a Dennis Lehane novel (co-adapted by Affleck and Aaron Stockard), 'Baby' hits with grace and rawness the notes played for heavy-handed melodrama in Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' (another Lehane adaptation). An exceptionally satisfying mystery, well-textured through character instead of action (though there are several harrowing scenes of violence), with a script that consistently plays against our expectations without resorting to cheap cop-outs and last-minute twists. Affleck stages seemingly simple dialog exchanges with the same amount of visceral intensity as, say, a shootout in a derelict building. While some of the Boston accents are so thick subtitles wouldn't have been unreasonable, the actors nail their rich, complex roles: Casey Affleck as a freelance missing-persons finder (don't be deceived by his baby face and short stature; he has definite leading-man potential); Ed Harris as a cop assigned to the case; Michelle Monaghan as Affleck's partner. In this type of literary adaptation (and no, I have not read the novel), the tendency to emphasize certain passages can lead to a heavy-handed execution ('Mystic River,' again), but Affleck does a good job of keeping things grounded in reality--the performances possess a raw naturalism that seldom conveys a Hollywood polish, save for Morgan Freeman, whose small yet crucial role is essentially a reprise of the 'wise elder' he's been playing since 'Se7en.' But overall, 'Gone Baby Gone' is one of the most surprisingly satisfying films of 2007--the type of character-rich meditation that hits hard, and is not easily forgotten.",8,4,10,23 October 2007
Burn After Reading," Burn Before Viewing?
","You have to hand it to the Coen Brothers, the maverick satirists of American idiocy (and its resulting comedy-of-errors quirkiness): only they would dare to follow up their most critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning films with offbeat comedies that are no less consequential when it comes to the bloody consequences of man's avarice. 'Fargo' was followed by the cult classic 'The Big Lebowski,' and now the Best Picture-winning 'No Country for Old Men' has 'Burn After Reading,' a jolting, surprising comedy that shows the film-making duo's mastery of cinematic form as a source of humor...and frustration. The plot (a gleeful jumble that recalls the tone and vulgarity of 'Lebowski') concerns a discharged CIA agent's (John Malkovich) memoirs falling into the hands of two self-absorbed gym employees (Frances McDormand and an inspired Brad Pitt); meanwhile, a close-knit circle of Washington insiders (George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, et al) swap wives and find themselves entwined in what seems like a vast conspiracy (even the Russians are brought in to juxtapose Cold War paranoia against our post-9/11 era of fear) that is really just a string of misunderstandings inspired by the simplest of minds. While this is the Coens' umpteenth variation on the premise (after 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo,' 'Lebowski,' and 'No Country'), 'Burn' shows them toying more with the mechanics of storytelling than before: there is a deliberate (yet also slow) buildup that holds back humor in favor of establishing character; and it is based on this knowledge that the film's last half often erupts in hilarity. And while the broad, artificial-feeling characters run the risk of throwing 'Burn' into self-parody, the brilliant cast elevates what could have been throwaway caricatures. While a marginal effort in the Coens' unique filmography, 'Burn' remains a distinct delicacy in a cinematically mundane year.",6,8,18,3 October 2008
Watchmen," Heroes in Retrograde
","Only in the heavily-hyped buildup to the theatrical release of 'Watchmen' did I sit down to read the graphic novel on which it's based. As ashamed as I am to admit it, Warner Brothers' persistent ad campaign (making sure to overstate its status as 'most celebrated of all time'!) was the only reason I bothered. The teaser trailer premiered way back in July of 2008 (bundled with 'The Dark Knight'), and my own reaction was a mix of bad laughter and undeniable curiosity. I had heard of 'Watchmen,' of course, but my own disinterest toward hero-based comics kept me at a distance.Upon reading (and, at times, struggling) through it, I came to the conclusion that 'Watchmen' must be much more gratifying to those already predisposed toward the Supermans and Spider-Mans of the comic-book underworld. To someone more inclined toward the personal, more subjective works of Crumb and Clowes, the end result came off as distancing and condescending (especially in the 'Black Freighter' subplot, which is thankfully absent here); the interesting, complex characters, contemporary political allusions (Richard Nixon in his third presidential term; the onset of nuclear war at the hands of the Russians), and science-fiction tropes (the space-time distortions of Dr. Manhattan), while hinting at something greater, all stood in the shadow of writer Alan Moore's pretentious structure and dialog. Too often the narrative went off on tangents that failed to synthesize with the ongoing plot into a well-rounded whole. Illustrator Dave Gibbons did his best to elevate the material through sheer imagery, but his drawings were marked by a stiffness crossed with nostalgia for the old-school DC comics. In all, 'Watchmen' came off as a dated piece of nostalgia for a paranoid era instead of a timeless classic of the medium.With this laundry list of qualms, I approached the film adaptation with no small amount of skepticism, to the point where I questioned why I even wanted to see it. Yet, sitting in the theater as the opening credits rolled, my expectations brightened to the point where I was completely wrapped up and enthralled by 'Watchmen.' While film is notorious for compromising and, at worst, denigrating beloved works of literature, it has proved a fertile medium for enhancing the graphic arts: a few years back, Frank Miller's 'Sin City' was turned into one of the most dazzling comic adaptations of all time. And this is why 'Watchmen,' as a film, succeeds where the novel did not: the flatness of the page has been given three-dimensional life by committed performances and a stunning visual imagination.Director Zack Snyder is no stranger to this territory, as his Green-Screen adaptation of Miller's '300' proved. While I would be otherwise reluctant to call the guy a 'visionary,' 'Watchmen' certainly advances his mainstream credibility several notches. Showing a keen attention for period detail (the film is set in 1985), carefully utilized slow motion, and a grainy, earthy color palate that appropriately mixes the unease of a world on the brink of annihilation with a Film-Noir mood, Snyder removes the barrier of Moore's pretentious pose and puts us on a field level with the characters, whose all-too-human problems (bad childhoods, impotence, apathy, age-driven obsolescence) are surprisingly relatable. As a result, it's hard not to feel implicated in and concerned toward the outcome of the proceedings. Screenwriters David Haytner and Alex Tse, who condensed the book into a tighter narrative that sacrifices little in the way of character detail, also deserve much credit for this successful translation.The plot regards the titular characters, a group of masked crimefighters operating in the latter part of the 20th century, following in the tradition of an earlier group (the Minutemen). In a volatile sociopolitical climate, however, sitting President Nixon implements a ban on masked vigilantes, thus forcing our characters into exile as common citizens. There's Edward Blake, alias 'The Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), whose brutal murder sets the Watchmen back into action; Walter Kovacs, alias 'Rorschach' (Jackie Earle Haley), is a street-smart psychotic who is nonetheless committed to his own brand of justice; Dan Dreiberg, alias 'Nite Owl' (Patrick Wilson), an engineer who longs to re-connect with Laurie Jupiter, alias 'Silk Spectre' (Malin Akerman); rounding out the group is Adrian Veidt, alias 'Ozymandias' (Matthew Goode ), a suave corporate exec with influence in science, medicine, and merchandising; and Jon Osterman, alias 'Dr. Manhattan' (Billy Crudup), a powder-blue, nigh-indestructible specter who can alter time and space at will. While some personalities are overshadowed by others (with Haley's Rorschach being a key scene-stealer), all are given a chance to shine, and are left to bode with questions that verge on the morally catastrophic (paralleling the looming threat of nuclear war).Last year, 'The Dark Knight' set a precedent for all comic-book adaptations to follow: it pitted a well-trod character against a villain who knew no boundaries (and, as a result, had nothing to lose), while grappling with his own inner demons; in the end, the victor of the battle seemed less important than whether or not our hero could rise above the damage that had inspired such a climate of fear. In very similar ways, 'Watchmen' approaches the same issues, and winds up a compelling, intimate, and visually stunning tale of loyalty, tragedy, and the uncertainty of mankind's own desire to want to be saved from itself.",8,0,4,22 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Mom's mad at dad again!
","I never really understood why '28 Days Later' caused such a ripple in the horror genre back in '03--many saw some sort of masterpiece, while I just saw yet another movie piggybacking on the zombie mythos created by George Romero (some scenes were blatant steals from his 'Living Dead' series); had it been directed by anyone besides the guy who scored accolades for 'Trainspotting,' it probably would have been recognized as such. '28 Weeks Later' is slightly better than its predecessor (no difficult feat), and even contains an interesting (at times ironic) thematic arc that has some things to say about familial unity; too bad the characters are of the one-dimensional variety and the plot plays out like a simplified cross between 'Dawn of the Dead' (the remake, natch) and 'Children of Men.' While director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo keeps the film moving at a rapid clip, he can't seem to reconcile the main story of a family's joy and grief against the overwhelming urge to shoot every scene in overblown, ersatz-epic fashion (for the love of Pete, ENOUGH with the shaky-hand-held 'Saving Private Ryan'-style shots!); '28 Days' may have suffered from sluggish pacing and too many preachy monologues, but '28 Weeks' rips along in a seemingly endless string of jerky cuts that are more frustrating than exciting (what's there to be excited about when we can't tell what the hell's going on, or where it's happening?). The effects scenes are a mix of CG trickery that paradoxically come off as fake and realistic and always overblown (the firebombing of Britain in particular looks like a screen shot from a PS3 game). Despite this, there is an occasional flash of innovation (a creepy trek down a pitch-dark escalator lit by a gunsight's night vision), and the actors (including a criminally underused Robert Carlyle) are serviceable in their thinly-written roles. Make no mistake--'28 Weeks Later' is an even pulpier ride than its parent, but worth a gander if you set your expectations really low; it's so fast-paced that it passes rather painlessly, but there's nothing very endearing about it.",5,0,1,25 December 2007
The Thing," a definite chill in the air (in more ways than one)...
","True to his name, John Carpenter was a major architect of celluloid terror in his prime, with a distinctive visual style, a reliance on simple musical scores that stick menacingly in the viewer's mind, and a manner of manipulating suspense through lighting, character conflict, and well-choreographed action. As both writer (often under a pseudonym) and director, Carpenter's films comprise some of the finest examples of the horror genre. However, when he's in command of someone else's script, there is sometimes a clash between the two. Upon viewing 'The Thing' for the first time in several years, this inconsistency sticks out like a sore thumb.Now don't get me wrong. As a child I'd build my schedule (at least on weekends) around horror movies playing on cable TV, and Carpenter's interpretation of 'The Thing' (far more faithful to the short story 'Who Goes There?' than its 1951 predecessor) was certainly a major influence on my personal taste--it was bloody, scary, and very cool-looking (Rob Bottin's makeup FX put all the CGI offerings that have come since to shame). And that minimalist score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone produced a shiver without fail. And the ending--from its ambiguous final line to the isolated manner in which it's photographed, was enough to thoroughly creep me out as a youngster.The movie still holds up for a lot of the reasons I just mentioned, but it falters somewhat due to the weak characterizations. Bill Lancaster's script renders the dozen or so men stationed at an Antarctic research outpost (a gaggle of scientists and military types) besieged by an imitative alien life form as little more than fodder for the cool-looking transformation/death scenes (that is, when they're not tossing explanatory dialog around like a hot potato). The isolated setting in the midst of a section of the world known for extreme weather conditions casts a weariness and desperation over the whole film, which would have been more effective if we gave a damn about the characters.Carpenter does what he can, and certain actors shine (such as future Quaker Oatmeal spokesman Wilford Brimley as a crazed doctor and David Clennon as a wisecracking pothead), but most of the cast comes off as nondescript as the alien life form itself. While mostly exposition, the dialog does unravel in an intriguing way as the men become increasingly aware of what they're dealing with, and the special effects complement the story rather than overwhelming it. And perhaps 'The Thing''s main saving grace--in terms of its horror being so well-preserved after all these years--is Carpenter's uncanny way of capturing a mood of dread, fear, and isolation, to the point where you might be tempted to jack up the thermostat a few degrees after the end credits are done rolling.",8,1,7,1 August 2005
Lilo & Stitch," impossibly cute and moving
","While the overriding message of 'Lilo and Stitch' has been mined before in films such as 'Babe' and 'Shrek' (that appearances are deceiving and we should learn to tolerate the differences in others) and the film leans toward the stereotypes of Hawaiian culture, it succeeds greatly in the relationship between Lilo, a friendless young girl, and Stitch, a malevolent creature from another galaxy who crash-lands on Earth. The humor doesn't always connect, but the story is an offbeat fusing of fantasy and reality that becomes a showcase for the crazed Stitch and outsider Lilo, which is the moving core of the film. And, amazingly, the conclusion of this animated feature musters up some authentic tears.",7,1,2,7 October 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A High-Tension Nuclear Family...
","Welcome back, horror! How I've missed you all these years...'The Hills Have Eyes' is yet another remake of a beloved (but not by me) '70s horror film that springs largely from Hollywood's ongoing lack of creativity. Most recent remakes have either been exceptional, but not on par with the original ('Dawn of the Dead'); just slightly better than the awful original ('The Amityville Horror'); or simply rock-bottom awful in comparison to the original ('The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'; 'Assault on Precinct 13').Wes Craven's original 'Hills' was a 1977 production about a family who becomes stranded in the Arizona desert after their truck (complete with trailer) gets a flat. Far from a telephone or any other people, they stick out the night, only to be besieged by a family of cannibals living in the hills. While a low-budget production (popularized by the signature image of Michael Berryman's malformed head), Craven's film had a grittiness and brutality to it that adhered close to his previous film, 'Last House on the Left.' However, what sunk the original 'Hills' for me was its lack of urgency and languid pace...that, and the cannibals themselves looked sillier and sillier the more they were shown. On the IMDb's scale of 1 to 10, I would have given the original a 4.This redux, brought to us by the talented Frenchmen who gave us 'High Tension' (Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur), is not only a marked improvement over Craven's original, but one of the best horror films to come along in quite some time. As with 'Tension,' Aja shows a clear skill in building atmosphere and suspense that frequently culminates in chest-tightening terror; the makeup is superbly grotesque and convincing; also present is the creative extremes of bloodletting that marked their previous effort. The politics of Craven's original remains intact, with unlikely heroes being reduced to acts of savagery, but the dynamic of the mutants has been made more ambiguous--instead of a close-knit family of savages, Aja's monsters don't seem as strongly linked; they are instead scattered across the desert like scorpions, which makes their menace a lot more effective. The scenes in the original that focused on the cannibals in their habitat often ventured into camp; in the remake, the relationships are there, but not explored in as explicit of detail, which works better, actually.'Hills 2006,' save for a few divergent touches, remains structurally similar to the '77 version. A toothless gas station attendant (Tom Bower, hamming it up) directs the wayward Carver clan (including Ted Levine, Kathleen Quinlan, and Dan Byrd) toward a shortcut through the desert that will (supposedly) shave hours off their trip to California. The shortcut is sabotaged, however, and the truck pulling the family trailer is totaled; in the meantime, the Conservative Father (Levine) and Liberal Son-in-Law (Aaron Stanford) head off to find help. 'Hills' is deliberately-paced for about the first 40 minutes, providing some overly typical characterization and dialog; it is when the 'trailer siege' sequence rolls around that this remake kicks into high gear and doesn't let up. While keeping faithful to the source material, Aja uses grainy film stock, different film speeds, and a buffet of abstractly-rendered blood and viscera to put this remake over the top (in a way, Craven's film was a victim of the technology of the time).The performances complement the material fairly well; while the characters begin as typical drones of current Americana, the film gives everyone ample opportunity to transcend their roles as a result of the extreme circumstances contained within. Aaron Stanford's limp-wristed cell-phone salesman transforms into a blood-spattered hero; Dan Byrd's easygoing son becomes a resourceful protector; Kathleen Quinlan's cheer-faced mother is reduced to a catatonic wreck. Among the mutants, Robert Joy ('Land of the Dead')'s Lizard leaves the biggest impression, a bloodthirsty savage sporting cinema's most hideous overbite.Within the current Hollywood climate, where remakes are as standard-issue and bland as department-store mannequins, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a very rare achievement: not only does it transcend the usual low standards of studio horror, but also stomps its source flat. Definitely recommended.",7,6,12,12 March 2006
American Psycho," stellar adaptation of the misunderstood novel
","'American Psycho,' which was one of the most controversial novels published in the last decade, makes for one of the most stellar, elegant book-to-film translations in quite some time.  An indictment of '80's excess, the focus is on a young, extremely wealthy Wall Street yuppie named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who's excellent) whose lust for material status and conformity leaves him disgusted with his fellow man.  He vents his frustration and boiling rage by murdering boastful coworkers and vacant, oblivious prostitutes in all manner of ghastly ways (although, to be fair, the film comes nowhere near the graphic detail of the book).  Marry Harron and cowriter Guinevere Turner have done a commendable job of organizing the scattered passages of the novel into something of a coherent narrative, and the film is alive with bright, elegant cinematography and gallows of wickedly dark humor.8/10",8,1,3,22 January 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," A Total Surprise...One of 2006's Best Films
","A father looking to sell a '9-Step' program, an avowed 'winner.' A beleaguered mother with unflagging hope in her daughter's potential. Her troubled, homosexual brother, fresh out of the hospital after a suicide attempt. A Nietzsche-obsessed brother who has taken a vow of silence. A porn-ogling, foul-mouthed grandfather regretful of having 'not f--ked a lot of women' in his lifetime. A precocious little girl determined to be the winner of the titular pageant. If I had read a description like this, I would have written off 'Little Miss Sunshine' without a second thought--it looks and sounds like a standard-issue, deliberately 'quirky' road-trip comedy where the standard-issue dysfunctional family bonds and learns an Important Lesson at the denouement. And you know what? It is. But it is also laugh-out-loud hilarious, brilliantly acted (would someone please give Steve Carell a Best Supporting Actor nod?), and genuinely moving (the climax made me want to laugh, cry, and cheer, all at the same time). The feature debut of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (known previous for music videos, including The Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight Tonight') plays with the style and attention to character of a Wes Anderson film (though with a lot less inhibition in its comedy), and the breezy humor and hard knocks of, say, 'The Squid and the Whale' (another excellent dramedy). But any way you cut it, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is one of the most inspired films of the year...under a conventional-looking surface lies a tremendously moving experience.",8,14,23,5 January 2007
North by Northwest," 137 minutes of 'Huh?'
","Had I been alive in 1959 and capable of seeing 'North by Northwest,' I probably would have gotten up and left the theater halfway through--not because it's a poorly made film, but because it exists, to this day, for no other purpose than to jerk the viewer around to the point of cold indifference.Alfred Hitchcock enjoyed playing his audience like a piano, and while I have no problem with that, all his notes are out of tune here. One part vanity piece, one part spy thriller, 'North by Northwest' has innocent Everyman Cary Grant on the run after being framed for a diplomat's murder; Eva Marie Saint is the femme fatale who may or may not be playing both sides; and James Mason is some sort of vaguely-defined heavy masterminding everything. Unlike Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho' or Jon Finch in 'Frenzy,' Grant is filled with too much winking, boyish charm to ever convey a sense of consequence for his character; Marie Saint is presented as more of a plot device than a character; and Mason brings a fair amount of class to his limited scenes.Maybe I was expecting something different, and therefore kept waiting for 'North by Northwest' to turn into the tense, gripping thriller it has been hailed as. Ultimately, only a director with Hitchcock's pedigree could get away with a project so flagrantly self-indulgent and impossibly plotted and still earn a slew of sycophantic raves. Perhaps I took it too seriously, but 'North by Northwest' is an incredibly empty romp that's high on style, but precious little else.4.5/10",5,16,31,18 April 2006
The Shining," a disjointed, 'Kubrickized' adaptation
","I first saw Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' several years ago, and my overall impression was that it was a decent, yet unspectacular horror film with a few creative touches.  Following this, I read Stephen King's flawed yet commendable novel and had a chance to view the miniseries, which was a much better interpretation than Kubrick's version (the acting and production values were abnormally strong for a made-for-TV effort).  This was back in 1997.  After a five-year wait, the much-anticipated (by me, at least) official video release of the miniseries prompted me to put both versions up to scrutiny.I popped in Kubrick's hailed and derided film, cleared my mind to be as impartial as possible, and wound up disappointed in how much the film had deteriorated in value.  While 'The Shining' had never been a masterpiece, I was shocked at how little was under its polished surface.  Even if you disregard (or are just ignorant to) the merits of King's work, 'The Shining' can barely stand on its own as an individualistic, one-of-a-kind horror film.  Kubrick's narrative is filled with the cinematic equivalent of foam peanuts en lieu of emotional content and characterization, not to mention general coherence.  King's book cleverly explored the parallels between the possessive effects of alcoholism with the possession of a man by ghosts--this film is about endless tracking shots of a kid on a bigwheel, blood cascading out of an elevator, and Jack Nicholson chewing the scenery as he limps around with an ax.Point by point, here are my problems with this adaptation (my comparisons/contrasts were made after viewing):1.)  The cast.  Nicholson (who is completely inappropriate for the role of Jack Torrance)'s pointy eyebrows and trademark grin paint him as a psycho from the get-go, yet I never found myself fully convinced of his possession, and his excessive tongue-waggling and eye-rolling made the performance all the more laughable (to see a charismatic actor leashed, with successful results, check out Robin Williams in 'One Hour Photo').  Shelley Duvall's 'aw-shucks' personality seems out of place, and she looks absolutely ridiculous running around with a knife (she and Nicholson are one of the most unconvincing couples to grace a movie screen).  And, that shrill 'redrum' chant aside, Danny Lloyd gives a robotic, lifeless performance. One of the reasons for 'The Shining''s failure is that this group of offbeat performers just doesn't gel, even as a faux family.  Which leads me to...2.)  the screenplay, by Kubrick and Diane Johnson.  Even if it hadn't been culled from a previously published story, it still would have fallen flat. But since it was, it seems necessary to bring up some contrasts with the novel that have a huge bearing on the events which conspire.  I never criticize a film for not being a word-for-word adaptation (anyone who sets their expectations that high is just asking for a disappointment) as long as the fundamental points are covered.  Story elements that would have been easy to incorporate, such as the boiler (a heavy-haned symbol, granted, but it works), Jack's escalating, obsessive commitment to the hotel (here, Nicholson spends most of his time in a hungover state while DUVALL tends to the hotel...sheesh), the 'shining' itself (limited to a few scenes, and are mostly throwaways, used to--in desperation--heighten dramatic intensity), and the sordid details of Jack's unemployment (beating up a student) are just a few details that are either truncated to insignificance or ignored completely.  As a result, the characterization is frustratingly one-dimensional (so the blame can't be pinned solely on the cast), and the plot--as it's stretched out for 144 minutes--is appallingly shallow, with motivations and actions that seemingly come out of nowhere.3.)  The previous problems do nothing to help the lethargic pace of 'The Shining.'  Kubrick, who is notorious for his overlong 'epics,' has made a film where little of interest happens (could that bathroom scene be just a LITTLE longer??), but that doesn't stop him from dragging that nothing out to damn near two-and-a-HALF self-indulgent hours.  (Some actually seem to use this as a gauge to measure the quality of the film, though--the more minutes, the more brilliant 'art,' indeed!)  I find it ironic that King's miniseries runs 2 hours longer than this, yet has a far better sense of pacing.4.)  And, a major annoyance I have with 'The Shining' is the death of Hallorann, which doesn't get mentioned much (in positive reviews, at least). It's not that Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) is a memorable character here, but the fact that his death took the final straw in the overworked yet lazy script.  It was as if Kubrick and Johnson, completely out of ideas, connected the dots to this inevitable conclusion where, in order to justify the 'horror' tag, Hallorann travels a couple thousand miles, only to get an ax in the chest AND provide Duvall and Lloyd with a means of escape. Talk about shallow writing--the unsatisfactory conclusion that follows leaves much to be desired.I did like a few (very few) things about this 'Shining,' though.  I found the opening aerial shots to be absolutely breathtaking, and the occasionally creepy score was effective (even if it set a mood that was never fully realized); the scene in which Nicholson meets with the hotel manager for an interview is very well-handled--observe the self-conscious body language, the hospitable smile, and his use of 'please' and 'thank you'.  For a few minutes, Nicholson is an average-Joe applicant with a friendly tone, both authentic and convincing.  It's a shame it's the only time in the film where anybody--in front of or behind the camera--exercises any restraint.In the end, my favor lies with the 1997 miniseries.  Kubrick's 'Shining' plays out like a pretentious slasher film for those who deem slasher films beneath them.3/10",3,4,12,19 May 2003
Over the Hedge," Well-animated satire with a worthy cast
","I always find myself with a lack of creative things to say when commenting on animated films, so I'll make this brief: 'Over the Hedge' is a cute, well-animated morality tale (with themes of family, redemption, and the value of hard work) with an excellent cast: Bruce Willis as RJ, a thieving raccoon on the run from Vincent (Nick Nolte), a gravel-voiced bear; RJ meets with a group of hibernating animals, from earnest turtle Vern (Garry Shandling) to porcupines voiced by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (re-creating the wonderful chemistry evidenced in their work with Christopher Guest). While the dazzling animation will appeal to kids, adults will appreciate the biting commentary on the suburban landscape (including an hilarious explanation of how humans obtain, consume, and dispose of food).",6,0,0,29 December 2006
Edward Scissorhands," uneven, but hits the right notes...
","'Edward Scissorhands' is an affecting, minimalist fairy tale and one of Tim Burton's better cinematic outings. It chronicles the story of an artificial 'boy' named Edward (an understated Johnny Depp) with shears for hands, as he tries to fit in with the denizens of a 1950s pastel vision of suburbia; the townsfolk embrace the outcast, who carves out immense topiary and gives lonely canines and housewives haircuts; the weak conflict comes in the form of Anthony Michael Hall, as a single-dimensioned goon who clings to the object of Edward's affection (virginal suburban daughter Winona Ryder). The unusual setting and the laid-back attitudes of the characters provides its share of unexpected laughs, but the core of the film comes in moments of quiet beauty, when Burton's cinematic eye, Danny Elfman's beautiful score, and the unspoken emotions of the characters truly hit home. 'Edward Scissorhands' is a film as touching as its lead character, and rife with passages of sheer, poetic wonder and beauty.",6,4,8,27 October 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Funniest thing to come out of Hollywood in quite some time...
","'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is an inspired comedy, one that blends blue sexual humor, the perceptions of males and females, and an uncommon tenderness to great cinematic success. But perhaps most impressive is how the title--which seems to promise a sex farce in the 'Porky''s vein--subverts our expectations; against the image of a beaming, plain-clothed Steve Carell, we receive a farce with its own juvenile tendencies, made hilarious and relatable by a character who is seemingly past his sexual prime. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a character that Hollywood often relegates to quirky supporting roles: introverted, modest guy working in retail, surrounded by friends who are as cocky as they are confident. While I'm not quite 40, 'Virgin' presents Andy as a character most men would be able to relate to at some point in their sexual lives, and is therefore instantly likable. His reluctant efforts to score with women (persuaded by his co-workers), using different methods to pick them up, all while keeping his intended mate at arm's length, is more than a bit indicative of the oft-insecure methods of men. The script, by Carell and director Judd Apatow, is crude but layered, giving us characters who are shaded with quirks that act as amplifications of typical human behavior (one coworker has an obsessive love/hate relationship with his ex)...and when Andy finally meets his mate, the domestic humor stems from a strong sense of realism. Past the wonderful performances and the 'LOL' comedy present, it is this situational realism that gives 'Virgin' such an endearing charm.",7,1,2,26 August 2006
Dark City," Untied laces
","Though some may consider it the 'be-all, end-all' sci-fi flick, 'Dark City'--while an interesting existential meditation on creation--is a remarkably cold piece of work. Granted, it's a beautifully-conceived piece of work, brimming with intelligence and intrigue (probably the reason it bombed at the box office), but its philosophy is unsupported by its characters who, no matter how integral to the plot, remain paper-thin ciphers from start to finish (making the main character an amnesiac shouldn't have exempted the screenwriters from throwing a few emotions into the role). This is unfortunate, since 'Dark City' is a fine film on its own, with some good eye candy and interesting ideas: an alien race known as 'The Strangers' has created a world (with a heavy 1940s Noir look) wherein they tinker with the identities of the inhabitants in an attempt to discover what, exactly, makes human beings such a unique breed; they are also able to alter material reality through sheer will. Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff!) stands out as a key Stranger, but the humans are not quite earthbound--with the exception of Colin Friels (another amnesiac), who brings some much-needed, high-strung energy to the proceedings for a few minutes, bigger names like Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, and William Hurt are left stranded in the mechanical script, while Kiefer Sutherland invokes Quasimodo. As a mainstream entertainment, 'Dark City' does what is expected while clarifying as much as possible for the average film-goer--however, I wound up wishing the emotional and intellectual aspects had been pushed further.",6,1,3,12 July 2007
The Machinist," The World According to Trevor
","Even though 'The Sixth Sense' came first, raked in more dough, and established that GOTCHA! third act twist that re-defined everything that had gone on before, 'Fight Club' took a route that was more psychological (and satirical) and less gimmicky and ultimately suffered at the box office for being too damn subversive and challenging for audiences expecting a bare-knuckles movie about, y'know, guys beating each other up. In that film, we follow an insomniac narrator who takes charge of his nihilistic life with the aid of anti-corporate crusader Tyler Durden, who winds up being nothing more than a figment of the narrator's imagination. It's a testament to the cleverness and believability of this twist that it has been mined pretty successfully in subsequent films like 'Session 9,' 'Secret Window,' 'High Tension,' and now 'The Machinist,' a film as frightening as it is compelling, with an uncanny psychological depth and a keen eye for detail.Like the aforementioned films, 'The Machinist' is quite disorienting upon first glance--its ending requires the viewer to all but re-start the movie to find out what it all means. Patience is essential to get into the rhythm of the film, which is deliberately paced and builds gradually to its turns, both expected and unexpected. If you expect a movie to lay down all the facts, explain every detail, and come to a tidy conclusion, you might want to bypass 'The Machinist.' Directed by Brad Anderson (who helmed the brilliant 'Session 9') from a script by Scott Kosar (the same man who graced us with the loathsome 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake), 'The Machinist' is the tale of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), an industrial worker harboring immense feelings of guilt for unknown reasons--he hasn't slept in a year as a result, and has starved himself down to a dangerously low weight (though the image of an emaciated Bale is not the film's most harrowing aspect); his bosses and coworkers are uneasy around him, and one day he causes a gruesome accident while distracted by the mysterious Ivan (a brilliantly cast John Sharian), a fellow worker who might not even exist. Anchored to reality by a sympathetic hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and an airport waitress (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), Trevor is plagued by cryptic messages on post-it notes that somehow wind up in his apartment, the most grim being a 6-letter hangman with two letters already filled in.In the paranoid stew brought about by his guilt, Trevor's perception becomes that of a mad conspiracy theorist who believes the ultimate plot is against himself...and who is to say it isn't? There is a brilliant sequence within the bowels of a carnival ride, where every image--from a corpse with its guts splattered to the silhouetted customers inside a brothel--triggers a twinge of panic in Trevor that makes us wonder how much of this is an actual ride, and how much is imagined (or amplified) by his guilt-riddled conscience. The ultimate beauty of 'The Machinist' is that it endures past its revelation because the world we have just watch unfold, with characters we THOUGHT we knew, turns out to be the product of a sleep-deprived (and, at a whole year, certifiably insane) mind; at the same time, this also reflects the kind of person Trevor Reznik aspired to be in the wake of the crime he perpetrated. The film's title and the oppressive, grease-stained factory environment lends it to a moody metaphor: was Reznik really a machinist, or was the scenario a representation of his swaying conscience, as gears turn clockwise and counterclockwise inside metal boxes as machines are turned on or off and are at times unstoppable for discernible reason, thus causing unforeseen tragedy? In addition to its loftier ambitions, 'The Machinist' is calmly effortless in showing how clever it is without being showy--which is why the film warrants multiple viewings. The amount of foreshadowing and character flip-flops and real-life incidents transposed into Reznik's remorseful fantasy world is done with an incredible amount of care. Seemingly trivial details, like a fishing rod on a closet shelf; a close-up of a sticker; the image of bumper cars in the foreground while Trevor talks to the waitress' son, all have a soul-shattering impact that is impossible to uncover upon a single viewing. Like the bastard child of 'Spider' and 'Fight Club,' 'The Machinist' is a persistent challenge, an ultimately bleak glimpse into the life of a man whose mind has been hollowed by guilt even more so than his body.",7,1,1,29 July 2005
Ratatouille," Dazzling visuals do not hide a half-hearted story
","My reaction to 'Ratatouille,' the latest from the seemingly endless siege of computer-animated features from Pixar or Dreamworks, is one of semi-exhaustion. Written and directed by Brad Bird, former 'Simpsons' contributor and maverick behind 2005's 'The Incredibles,' the film has the necessary ingredients for greatness, but comes off as a lukewarm dish overall. The positive message of this very kid-oriented feature? 'Anyone can cook!' Which is what rodent Remy (Patton Oswalt) does best; after being separated from his colony, he winds up in France, helping a gawky clean-up boy at an upscale restaurant produce brilliant dishes, much to the head chef's chagrin. Strangely enough, 'Ratatouille' has a monopoly on frenetic action, brilliant cinematography and editing, and a fine balance between authentic and cartoonish animation styles--yet none of this really makes the film 'funny.' I often found myself laughing at the sheer zaniness of what was happening on-screen rather than any of the scripted punchlines; even in a theater populated largely by children and their parents, the occasions of unison laughter were few and far between. Bird hit the mark much better with 'The Incredibles,' which combined genuine thrills with satire and a sense of humor that pleased kids AND their parents. 'Ratatouille,' with its cultural displacement (it takes place in France, after all) and focus on razzle-dazzle and lesson-learning, comes across as half-hearted effort.",5,5,19,8 July 2007
The Exorcist," cerebral, plausible, and compelling
","There are certain scenes in 'The Exorcist' that have a great power to them (the exorcism itself is a masterful set-piece) and others that are a bit shaky (including the drunk, unfunny director cracking Nazi jokes in the presence of a German butler); but overall, it is a film that mines genuine fear from a pervasive sense of vulnerability. In dealing with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by an unseen, inexplicable force, we feel as if nothing is safe, therefore making the potential of horror that much greater. I suppose the story is probably the most familiar in the annals of horror at this point, but to recap: actress Chris MacNeil's (Ellen Burstyn) daughter, Regan (Blair) comes under the spell of a vile, vulgar demon (at one point implied to be the Devil itself), and when the most well-paid psychiatrists and doctors come up clueless, the Catholic ritual of exorcism is suggested. While the performances of Burstyn and Blair aren't revelatory (Chris often seems like an overly dramatic starlet in need of a Xanax, and Regan is confined to heavy make-up), the thread of plot dealing with Damien Karras (the Gabriel Byrne-ish Jason Miller), a priest who suffers the death of his mother and is afraid he's losing his faith, adds a believable, consequential depth to the tale--the visible doubt he conveys during the exorcism finale (alongside the brilliant Max von Sydow) makes the tension resonate on a higher level. 'The Exorcist' is cerebral, plausible, and compelling...in my book, it may not be 'the scariest movie of all time,' but it unlocks an undeniably gripping fear.",7,5,6,15 September 2005
Saw III," The Jigsaw Miracle Network
","'Hello, dear readers. That time of year is upon us once again--a time when we ask our loyal constituents to look deep in their gore-dipped hearts and make a donation to the Jigsaw Miracle Network. This year, a portion of your donation will go to Jigsaw's Kids, to help perpetuate future generations of murderous masterminds wreaking psychological torment and physical torture on unsuspecting common folk who put their lives to no good use. Make your pledge to see 'Saw III'--heck, see it twice--so that one of the current lone beacons of quality horror may continue to warm our hearts with its reign of terror!'Richard Roeper called the original 'Saw' 'an exercise in audience manipulation,' damning the film to a position on his 'Worst of 2004' list. Needless to say, I think he missed the point--horror films, when done well, are all ABOUT audience manipulation; being terrorized by a madman for 90 minutes, at the end of which we are given the mandatory plot-twists, can be quite fun. As in the first two 'Saw' films, diabolical mastermind Jigsaw is a sly string-puller, and one of the more endearing, well-defined villains in recent horror history.'Saw III,' in addition to being a twisty torture chamber of nasty surprises, is the third installment in one of the only horror franchises with any quality (most--no matter how awful--do well at the box-office). I approached this sequel with great skepticism--after all, the prolific 'Halloween,' 'Friday the 13th,' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series trudged on for years, seeing little to no glory after their initial installments (condemn 'Scream' all you want--at least Wes Craven had the dignity to end it at '3').My fear of 'Saw III' plunging a thus-far successful series into the toilet lasted for the first 15 minutes--a montage of bad acting, bad setup, and overall crudity (with two characters forced to fight against traps with no exit) that almost completely dashed my hopes. Then, to my surprise and delight, 'Saw III' redeemed itself. Once cancer patient/mastermind of murder John 'Jigsaw' (Tobin Bell) enters the scene, hooked up to life support and apparently breathing his last, his utterance to partner-in-pain Amanda (Shawnee Smith)--'I want to play a game'--kicks the film into high gear. The contestants on this round of Wheel of Torture are Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a revenge-minded father looking to get even with the drunk driver who killed his son; and Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), a doctor enlisted to keep John alive, otherwise a harness around her neck will blow her to bits.As with 'Saw II' (and, to a lesser extent, the original film), 'Saw III' has fun playing with the mythos that have been established in the series so far. Some questions are answered, some loose ends explained, and while one could argue that this is unnecessary overkill, I enjoyed the little segues that referenced the previous films. It's not a revisionist history (like idiotically adding a man in black--or Busta Rhymes--to 'Halloween'), just a play on the seemingly deliberate ambiguities throughout the series. Granted, this often comes off as an attempt to out-twist the previous films, but I cannot fault 'Saw III''s narrative ambition--there's a richness of detail present that could provide a solid base for a prequel and maybe 2 more sequels. (Pauses while the critics recoil in horror.) Is there blood, you ask? Yes, and it's rather disturbing stuff; no, not because there's a lot of it thrown in our face (which there is, along with pureed pig guts, but that's another story), but because it complements the story and characters so well. I won't give away any of Jigsaw's torture techniques this time out, but his methodology (and the filmmakers') puts the viewer in a morally jarring position--the 'guilty' are turned into victims, to the point where our 'hero' looks as repulsive for simply standing idly by. Additionally, the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, briefly explored at the end of 'Saw II,' is dramatically plausible, and even heartbreaking. Loyalty, guilt, revenge, and other emotions of Biblical proportion are smeared across the screen in all their ugliness and beauty. Amazingly, director Darren Lynn Bousman and writer Leigh Whannel make this commentary fresh and genuinely gripping--the conclusion of 'Saw III' is a lesson in the boundlessness of revenge that is as compelling as it is blood-spattered.Though 'Saw III' has some flaws (including a completely implausible scene involving a hidden camera and some shaky performances) and the constantly-jerking camera movements are enough to induce vomiting, it is, quite surprisingly, the best showing of the series thus far. Quite rare for me to say (or even think) this after a second sequel, but 'bring on the next one!'7.5 out of 10",8,1,3,6 November 2006
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Blunder
","It's hard to deny how inspired the premise is: that, in an era where John Rambo gets a blood-soaked, retro-fit reboot and the schlockmeister 'satirists' responsible for 'Meet the Spartans' have another sign-of-the-apocalypse turd about to be unleashed upon mouth-breathing American audiences, that Ben Stiller would come along and meld both worlds into an action-comedy taking aim at a point in history that has almost exclusively been relegated to epic dramas ('The Deer Hunter'; 'Apocalypse Now'; 'Rescue Dawn'): the Vietnam war. While 'Tropic Thunder''s general plot (that a bunch of prima donna macho actors become stranded in Myanmar but think it's all part of a movie they're filming) is far from original, its setting and implications provide a fertile ground for risquÃ© comedic shenanigans; and with a strong cast led by Stiller, Jack Black, and a wonderfully wacky Robert Downey Jr., the promise of a gut-busting good time is all but guaranteed. Strange, then, that while 'Tropic Thunder' delivers spurts of chuckle-worthy lines and sight gags (Downey himself being one of 'em), the overall experience feels blunted and safe, reverting to stale satire of the Hollywood system (in a disastrously unfunny subplot involving a slimeball producer (played by none other than Tom Cruise) and an agent (Matthew McConaughey) looking to get his star a TiVO) to defang the proceedings. Even more problematic is the script's confusion over satirizing action-film excesses while being excessive itself: there is a tug-of-war between ridiculously overblown action scenes and broad, 'see-what-sticks' humor (which requires the actors--Stiller, Black, and Cruise in particular--to play their parts to the rafters) that ultimately renders the proceedings meandering at best, pointless at worst. While Downey's performance and character shows the only real signs of creativity and comedic riskiness (he's an Australian actor playing a black Southern soldier), the three phony trailers (while also broad send-ups) that precede the actual movie portend a great untapped reservoir of humor. Too bad.",5,4,9,20 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Many Levels Above
","'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' is the most visually stunning and elaborate film taken from the pages of a graphic novel since 'Watchmen.' Actually, it's probably the most visually stunning film, period, since 'Watchmen.' And even more so, it is a prime example of cinema's ability to reconfigure familiar tropes (in this case, the Romantic Comedy run through the John Hughes/Diablo Cody hipster-slang script machine) into a finished whole that transcends nearly all crippling convention. Like Hughes and Cody, the language of 'Scott Pilgrim' is distinctive, pop-culture savvy, and with a unique heart under its glossy, showy surface. Who knew that Edgar Wright, the promising director of such quaint-by-comparison genre homages as 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' had the capability to wield extravagant digital effects (with more dexterity than most high-budget filmmakers) in a film that sets a new precedent for hip romantic comedies? Scott Pilgrim (perpetual adolescent Michael Cera, typecast to his advantage here), the bass player in a struggling indie band, is getting over his last girlfriend by dating an Asian high-schooler; when he notices the neon bob of a steampunk rollerblader (the wonderfully deadpan Mary Elizabeth Winstead) one day, he becomes fixated on winning her over. Little does Scott suspect that this enticing babe has 7 ex-boyfriends he must lay to waste in order to claim her hand (and thus proving that chivalry is not dead). The film's setup takes some adjustment (with an emphasis on superimposed factoids about characters, comic-book sound effects, and storyboard panels laying out certain plot details), but by the time Scott is thrust into his first battle (not ironically at his band's first gig), Wright's approach establishes itself as something to be reckoned with -- these guys don't fight with traditional fisticuffs; they fight with the impossibly slick maneuvers of joystick-controlled video game Spartans. While it may sound eye-rolling in print, the choreography is smoothly rendered and edited with a precision that keeps us firmly rooted in the action; and better yet, Wright finds new ways to tweak and spin this fresh, candy-colored technique over the remainder of the film, so that it never gets tedious. By its close, 'Scott Pilgrim' has given us an incendiary tale of romance and intrigue, never sacrificing character or story for the sake of mere visual dazzle. It surprises me to say, but I think it's the best movie of 2010.",8,0,4,10 January 2011
No Country for Old Men," No country for young men, either
","At various moments in 'No Country for Old Men,' we are shown rusty, weather-beaten windmills squeaking in the dry desolation of the American Southwest, doing their 360-degree revelations in the passing wind. This imagery ties in nicely with the elliptical nature of the characters and plot (based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy), but also shows Joel and Ethan Coen coming full circle within their own career, as this film plays like a 'desert noir' companion to their debut feature, 'Blood Simple' (1985).The brothers' requisite plot devicea large sum of money being stolen and sought afterfinds an Everyman foil in Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens upon a massacre site where a drug deal went awry, and makes off with a satchel of cash pried from a dead man's hands. His wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is skeptical, and it is not until Llewelyn commits an act of charity that he finds himself in a relentless chase to outrun the innumerable factions seeking the cash. As in McCarthy's novel, these factions are vaguely defined at best, save for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a seemingly indestructible boogeyman who possesses no loyalty, and only the faintest trace of humanity (some of his potential victims are absolved by the luck of a coin toss). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (one of the 'old men' of the title, played with depth and grace by Tommy Lee Jones) is the outsider intermediary, whose own jaded feelings toward the inexplicable senselessness of crime in America is magnified in the increasingly nihilistic pursuit between Chigurh and Moss.'No Country' is like a symphony of aesthetics, with the Coens showing an affinity for wide-angle photography (captured by DP Roger Deakins) of the vast American Southwest; close-ups of faces of a variety of ages, weathered by age or fatigue or shrapnel; sound-effects editing so razor-precise that the squeaking of an oxygen valve or the clicking of a safety-catch in an otherwise silent scene is enough to inspire chills. Also worth noting is the absence of musical score, with Carter Burwell's orchestrations swelling only a few moments after the end credits have started to roll.I find it refreshing that, in our era of cinematic spectacle, replete with CGI-candy, that 'No Country' derives much of its impact from the characters themselves, often filmed in the aforementioned close-ups that makes their dialogues resonate with a profoundalmost meditativeurgency, conveyed wonderfully in the subtly understated performances. This is an interesting adaptive choice on the Coens' part, since many of their films take a parodic approach toward 'country folk' as witless yokels designed as vessels for comedy. And while 'No Country' finds some clever comic asides (Moss's exchange with a testy American border guard is a gem), the tone is that of pervasively ominous uncertaintythe tags of 'hero' and 'villain' are not easily applied, and the Coens are not above showing the moral ambiguity of their characters with a flatly objective eye.And the performances are indicative of this flat objectivity. Talented character actor Josh Brolin ('The Goonies'; 'Grindhouse') embodies the quirks, flaws, and traits (both heroic and anti-heroic) of Llewelyn; Bardem is a towering iceberg of intimidation, whose Chigurh becomes an almost-infallible extension of some mythic desert dweller (existing solely in a world of self-obligation and passive violence); Jones brings a worldly wisdom and depth to Ed Tom, the glue that bonds the narrative; English actress Macdonald (probably best known for 'Trainspotting') slips into a Southern accent and conveys the necessary fearand finally, acceptanceof being an unwitting pawn in a situation beyond her control.In the end, there is a paradoxical thematic synthesis as two characters 'walk away' from obligation and into a future that is, at best, uncertain (the characters 'unite' in a slow fade); and while Bell's closing recollection of a dream veers into Oscar-nod territory, it perfectly resolves 'No Country for Old Men,' a story so open-ended and incendiary that its grislier moments could easily be culled from today's national headlines. The movie may be set in 1980, but its parable-like presentation will prove timeless. One of 2007's best.",8,7,13,8 December 2007
District 9," Martians Go Home (Maybe)
","The first inclination of Film Criticism 101 would be to hail 'District 9' as a genre-bending sci-fi thriller that fuses very real aspects of life in the post-9/11 world with extraterrestrial visitors standing in for illegal immigrants (one character even alludes to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' near the beginning). Had the aliens landed in New York City, the metaphor would be clear as day; but these crustacean-like beings (who cohabitate in the titular walled-in ghetto) are stranded in Johannesburg, treated like literal 'aliens' over the course of two decades. Amid alien/human riots, theft, and overall animosity, the government intervenes to relocate the beings to an isolated tent community. The relocation goes less than smoothly, when Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) stumbles across some contraband that eventually begins his metamorphosis into one of the alien beings (the unfolding irony of his predicament is obvious, but still very well-played). The political agenda of 'District 9' is strong, but at its core, this is a film about humanity, the destruction left in its wake, and its potential for redemption. Director Neill Blomkamp (who co-wrote with Terri Tatchell) stages the action like an embedded cameraman in a war zone; there is an up-close, you-are-there feel to these gritty, violent sequences. The special effects are nothing short of stunning (the CG aliens are as good as they come). And the notion of staging 'District 9' as a straight drama (littered with neat gizmos and wild action) instead of a winking parody or heavy-handed satire gives it a weight that has been lacking in similar films with socio-political agendas--in the sea of mediocrity that is Summer 2009, this is an eye-opening gift.7.5 out of 10",8,2,5,30 August 2009
Batman Begins," probably doesn't need another comment, but...
","'Batman Begins' is a satisfying trip overall. Christopher Nolan--who directed the inventive reverse-order thriller 'Memento' and the tepid remake of 'Insomnia' applies his distinctive visual style (lots of wide-angle shots employed, plus sprawling sets) to the comic-book hero and film-franchise icon. Granted, Batman's last two cinematic outings all but dragged the Dark Knight's name into the ground, thanks to Joel Schumacher's hollow neon approach to spectacle; Nolan--with the assistance of screenwriter David S. Goyer--brings a richness of character and an emotional maturity to the proceedings; the film itself is rather serious, but also has some nicely tucked-away comedic bits (courtesy of Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon). The story, as before, seems rather peripheral to the overwhelming demands of action-movie thrills, but has something to do with a mad doctor ('Red Eye''s Cillian Murphy) poisoning Gotham City's water supply with a hallucinogenic toxin that will literally rip the population apart with fear (an overarching theme whose exploration adds to the film's richness). But nothing is as it seems (of course). With the exception of Katie Holmes, who still looks and sounds like a 16-year old fresh off the set of 'Dawson's Creek,' the cast turns in excellent performances. Christian Bale, one of the more exciting younger actors of the past few years, fills the Caped Crusader's shoes with grace and dignity; Michael Caine brings his affable, fatherly charm to Alfred; Cillian Murphy brings a casual malevolence to his demented doctor; and Gary Oldman does well in the unfortunately limited role of Commissioner Gordon. 'Batman Begins' also exhibits a sense of visual wonder that's more assured and authentic than in previous outings; the vast Gotham is less an obvious computer-generated landscape and more of a negative Utopian dreamworld, both haunting and inviting. A job well done, breathing life into a faltering series...may the next 'Batman' films continue in a similar direction.",7,0,1,20 December 2005
Twilight," Vampires Defanged
","It's slick. It's glossy. And sometimes it's so bright it *sparkles*. But like the 'vegetarian' vampires (they subsist on animal blood, not human) that rest at the center of its story, 'Twilight' is also pretty bland. Even for a story about the walking undead, the film itself is just as lacking in any sort of dramatic pulse. I have not read Stephenie Meyer's books, but by the end of 'Twilight''s distended running time (clocking in at just over 2 hours), I felt that I had borne witness to a hatchet-job adaptation, where everything revolves around star-crossed lovers Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson). She's a shy girl moving in with her sheriff father in the rainy Northwestern town of Forks, WA; he's an elite member of a pale-faced clan of ageless vampires, whose hormones run in conjunction with his innate predatory lust toward Bella. While 'Twilight' isn't a boring film, its lack of pathos and underdeveloped supporting characters leaves a lot to be desired: vampires have been portrayed as sexy, repulsive, aristocratic, and natural born charmers, but the overbearing 'sex is bad, abstinence is good' philosophy at work here all but fizzles any potential excitement, which is a shame, because Stewart and Pattinson (despite a pretty equal share of awkward beats and line readings) make for an interesting couple. Director Catherine Hardwicke does a fine job establishing the gloomy setting, but fails to integrate special effects convincingly, or create a palpably exciting climactic showdown; and Melissa Rosenberg's (who has written many great episodes of Showtime's character-driven 'Dexter') script treats anything outside the Bella/Edward union as a distraction, leading to undercooked backstories, motivations, and a central 'villain' whose screen time is so fleeting his presence barely registers at all. It's a shame, really: vampires have been at the center of much great art through the years; the notion of sunlight causing these pale bloodless suckers to *sparkle* instead of burn to a crisp is probably making Bram Stoker roll in his grave.",4,2,5,11 October 2009
28 Days Later...," mediocre amalgam will have you fantasizing about the movies it copies
","'House of 1,000 Corpses' was hyped as a revival of the zombie (or maybe just horror) genre, but turned out to be one of the most contemptible jokes I'd ever seen; so, then, after that false alarm, is Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' the savior of a genre that seems to be played out?  Despite a hopeful beginning, the answer is NO.  Aside from the extremely annoying music-video edits during the action scenes (which signify that this is, in fact, a zombie movie for the NEW MILLENNIUM), there isn't much in 28DL that hasn't been borrowed from another source.  The trans-generational, ethnic mix of heroes (including, yes, a black female survivalist) echoes 'Night of the Living Dead'--only here, the characters are weakly-drawn caricatures.  The 'zombie disease' theme was mined in 'The Omega Man.'  And the critique of the military as a harsh, dictatorial outfit was handled better in 'Day of the Dead' and 'The Crazies.'  The script doesn't expand on these themes in an attempt to create something new--it just recycles them, and had me wishing I was home watching one of the aforementioned movies instead.4/10",4,0,0,28 June 2003
The Incredibles," Delivers on what it promises
","Had it been done as a live-action picture, I don't think 'The Incredibles' would have been nearly as successful (in a worst-case scenario, it probably would have wound up a dumb parody, a la this year's 'Superhero Movie'); the interplay between live action and CG remains a tricky balance that few filmmakers can convincingly pull off. Thankfully, writer/director Brad Bird has taken his years of creativity (as a longtime contributor to 'The Simpsons') and poured every drop into one of the best computer-animated films I've ever seen--while the title may sound pompous and hyperbolic, 'The Incredibles' delivers high-quality thrills and laughs on an epic scale. Part of the fun lies in Bird's own lampooning of superhero clichés while developing a narrative that draws a very valid conclusion about the dangers of fanboy-love. The Incredibles themselves are a family defined by their super-powers: Bob Paar (aka Mr. Incredible, a Superman surrogate, voiced by Craig T. Nelson), his wife, Helen (aka Elastigirl; Holly Hunter), daughter Violet (able to turn herself invisible and put up force-fields), and sons Dash (named thus for his ability to run super-fast) and Jack-Jack (whose hidden talent is saved for the very end); when obsessive fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) takes his own superhero-fascination to extreme lengths, it is up to the quirky family (called out of exile after being blacklisted) to put a stop to his plans. The voice-actors fully inhabit their animated counterparts, nailing the human imperfections and weaknesses that eventually equate 'saving the fam' as an act just as important as Saving the World. While I had considerably less love for Bird's 'Ratatouille,' 'The Incredibles' is still a beacon of promise for an extensive animation career to come.",7,0,0,13 July 2008
The Mist," A Spectacular Scarefest
","While the cast and crew of 'The Mist' will herald the Weinstein Brothers at press junkets and the like, the producing duo has made 2007's most refreshingly original horror films ('Grindhouse,' 'Halloween') sacrificial lambs to fright-unfriendly weekends (there's a good article on this at Dread Central.com). And while 'The Mist' certainly commands a 30-foot screen, maybe its best possible fate lies on DVD, where viewers with surround sound and a widescreen TV can live the horrific, harrowing experience without the distraction of an audience too dumb to decipher their ticket stubs.'What's wrong with Stephen King?!' one member asked at the climax of 'The Mist,' certain he had made an alternately incisive and hilarious comment. To which I thought, 'Had you actually read the novella, clod, you'd know that King ended on an (almost) upbeat note.' With home entertainment fast becoming the industry standard, I guess the expectation of a tactful audience is beyond reason anymore.Despite the running commentary, I was able to see the treasure most of the room missed out on. As a novella, 'The Mist' islike most of King's workpulpy, scary, and compelling. The film, written and directed by Frank Darabont, is a stunning adaptation that manages to capture the slow burn of dread and desperation that permeates the novella. And while there is an uncanny titular similarity to John Carpenter's 'The Fog,' this is an altogether different beast.The setup is simple: after a brutal storm whips through a small Maine community, movie poster artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane'Dreamcatcher') and his son, Bill (Nathan Gamble) head into town for supplies, accompanied by Norton (Andre Braugher), their next-door neighbor. Once they arrive at a small shopping plaza, a shear mist encroaches upon them, trapping a large number of people inside a grocery store. The utter randomness of this scenario is enough to make one's skin crawl, but it turns out there are prehistoric-looking monsters waiting in the mist. And the inhabitants of the store become increasingly desperate for survival.(At this juncture, I will apologize in advance for the upcoming comparisons to 'Night of the Living Dead,' due to the sheer quantity of mentions.) What follows has a lot of thematic parallels to George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead,' a B movie whose guerrilla fearlessness and intelligence pushed it into legitimacy and legend. 'The Mist' is as much about things-that-go-bump-against-the-plate-glass as the way in which trapped humans respond to such a fantastic situation. Like 'Night,' the breakdown of social order and martial law is addressed; the role of the military comes into play; religious fundamentalism is personified by Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fire-and-brimstone type who becomes a macabre, sacrifice-minded beacon to the store's desperate. In an era where most of today's horror crowd expects 'Saw XIV' every time they walk into a theater, Darabont's script is built on a foundation of logic and authentic human action (even when characters do things we know are unwise, their rationale is convincingly fleshed-out) as opposed to manipulative twists and anticlimaxes. The ending is at once ballsy, depressing, and right. Like 'Night,' 'The Mist' is less about otherworldly monsters than mankind's uncanny ability to BE the monster.That being said, 'The Mist' works as well as a traditional horror film, with several genuinely scary sequences involving mutant hybrids of pterodactyls, houseflies, and spiders, with several Cthulhu-esquire unmentionables to complement their Lovecraftian backstory. The CG is well-utilized and the sharp editing keeps it from being overdone. Darabont transforms the creatureswhich are essentially '50s B-movie fodderinto absolutely convincing visions of hell. This film bucks current horror trends by actually scaring the audience instead of just repulsing them.'The Mist' is one of the year's best.",8,297,471,27 November 2007
I Am Legend," The Man Who Dreaded Sundown
","Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' has undergone such high-profile film adaptations (from 3 different eras) with diminishing success, that the terms of 'faithful adaptation' and 'remake' have become fairly absurd. 'The Last Man On Earth' (1964), co-scripted by Matheson (under a pseudonym) and starring Vincent Price was the first; 'The Omega Man' (1971) re-imagined the vampire tale as a Hollywood action flick with Charlton Heston. Now, in 2007, Francis Lawrence ('Constantine'and a million music videos) has used the original title for a semi-faithful adaptation blended with old-school tension-building tactics and carefully rationed CGI.The premise is simple: a plague has wiped out most of the population (exempting a infinitesimal number of immune cases), and survivor Robert Neville spends his days foraging for food and supplies in a desolate New York City, returning to his fortified, barricaded house to elude the 'infecteds' that roam the streets by night. He believes himself the only survivor of the plague (here caused by a cancer-cure side effect) and devotes his own efforts to concocting a serum to reverse the plague's effects.I was not a fan of the overblown 'Constantine,' but 'Legend' shows Lawrence's technique in a more confident place. There is plenty of CG spectacle on displayeasily the most stunning I've seen to dateand while the Hollywood model is to exploit this to the point of overkill, Lawrence balances it against scenes of quiet solitude and suspense-sequences that can be intensely claustrophobic and ominously open. The landscape of a plague-ravaged New York is at once a stunning marvel of digital imaging and jaw-dropping isolation and horrora maze of car-clogged streets and human desolation.As Neville, Will Smith veers away from the cute and comedic roles that have permeated his career, and proves he can carry a film that's essentially a downbeat, one-man show with great success. Unlike the chest-thumping machismo of Charlton Heston, Smith's Neville conveys an authenticeven sadsense of loneliness, loss, andwhen two survivors cross his pathan awkward, clumsy re-integration into normal human interaction. Even the scenes between Neville and his dog, Sam, possess a pathos because the relationship is crucial to Neville's own sanity and day-to-day function.Yet if the post-plague scenes (set in 2012) contain a visceral, urgent quality, then the fragmented flashbacks (spliced in at deliberate moments) of a panic-stricken mob seeking passage out of the City when the plague hits recreates the panic and fear of a post-9/11, post-Katrina scenario of a world goingand goneto hell. These sceneslike the CGIare presented in intense snippets, shot in a cinema-verite style that maximizes their impact. Lawrence places us INSIDE the panicked mob, and the effect is absolutely chilling.The suspense is also frequently brought to an unbearable swellwhen Neville has to retrieve Sam from an abandoned, pitch-dark bank, the tension builds beautifully (as an ironic counterpoint, the world outside is bright with afternoon light). Same goes for a scene in which Neville falls prey to a booby-trap and must crawl back to his car as the sun rapidly sets and ravenous 'plague dogs' spring in his direction (a particularly excellent marriage of old-school suspense tactics and current technology).On the downside, the 'infecteds' are largely lacking in personality, reduced to howling mutants with little more than fresh meat in mindthough it's better than the all-to-eloquent existentialist of 'The Omega Man.' And near the end, we're expected to believe that Neville has wired the area surrounding his house (underground, even) with hi-test explosives. And the film concludes on a note that, while satisfactory for this particular narrative, misses the point of Matheson's novel. But that aside, 'I Am Legend' is a thoroughly satisfying entertainmenta carefully controlled mix of sci-fi spectacle and action, a strong performance by Smith, and a thoughtful meditation on what mankind's actions can wind up reaping.7.5 out of 10",8,2,4,27 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Super Zero
","Not too long ago, in a galaxy that now seems incredibly far away, Lionsgate unleashed some of the grimiest, most unabashedly un-PC films into mainstream theatres ('Saw', 'High Tension,' and 'The Devil's Rejects' immediately come to mind); as a result, the studio gained a favorable reputation among genre loyalists looking for cheap thrills delivered by up-and-coming talent. It would seem that 'Kick-Ass' (whose ostentatious title is culled from a comic-book series I have not read), the tale of a dorky high-schooler with aspirations of superhero grandeur, would fit well into the 'cheap thrills' department...but instead becomes an astonishingly unfunny punchline unto itself. Ignoring the fact that the film is a tonally inconsistent mess (dark, 'outrageous' humor -- a little girl who blows away henchmen twice her size! -- is mashed between sloppily-choreographed action scenes and agonizingly pretentious teen-talk), it flat-out fails in its central conceit: that even a dorky high-schooler who dons an obnoxious green wetsuit can be elevated to Living Legend status (with the reliable help of faux-hype instigators like MySpace!). Truth be told, Kick-Ass does little of note for the duration of this miserable slog, and the inclusion of other not-so-super heroes (including a lame Batman caricature essayed by an insufferably lame Nicolas Cage) only further muddies what little focus this film has. It also doesn't help that the main villain is standard-issue cipher, a dime-a-dozen mob boss we've seen too many times before. Did I mention that this whole ordeal crawls toward the close-to-two hour mark? Perhaps I'm just missing the point of 'Kick-Ass'...unless its point is riddled with the kind of whip-smart irony that led me to the following conclusion: with the right kind of moxie, obnoxiousness, and low-rent business savvy, those among us who are most unworthy of attention (but possess a loud enough mouth to voice their vapid opinions with confidence) can launch themselves into a grotesque parody of celebrity without really DOING anything. With 'Kick-Ass,' the exponentially lowered expectations for super-heroes translates into a new icon for the Facebook Generation. Pathetic.",2,2,12,26 September 2010
Ghostbusters," 'Ghostbusters' revisited
","I can hardly believe I submitted a comment on the IMDb that not only gave 'Ghostbusters' a paltry '6' rating, but also had the audacity to claim that the humor hadn't aged well. Since the dawn of my obsession with film, friends of a more casual viewership have always claimed that I take the medium far too seriously. And while I do think an intellectual embrace inspires thoughtful critique, I am not beyond getting giddy over a film just because I can, reasoning be damned.Case in point: 'Ghostbusters.' Back in 1986, I started my school career as an extroverted kindergartener with a love for Saturday-morning (and weekday-afternoon) cartoons. Out of all I'd watch, 'The Real Ghostbusters' was the most entertaining; I was endlessly fascinated by the premise of 4 guys running around New York (plus other parts of the world and even outer space) with their 'positron rifles,' blasting deformed comic apparitions. In hindsight, this mixture of comic hijinks and supernatural mayhem is probably what piqued my long-standing love affair with horror films.I didn't actually view the film version of 'Ghosbusters' until I was a well-ingrained fan of the TV show, to the point where I had to adjust to the difference in appearance of the live-action characters (as opposed the other way around). Despite this, I warmed up to the film instantly--I laughed my butt off and was amazed by Richard Edlund's brilliant FX (which look f*cking incredible to this day). Bill Murray's portrayal of the coolly sarcastic Peter Venkman is one of my all-time favorite performances (and cemented Murray as my favorite comic actor); the efforts of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson also contribute to an unmatched cooperative of quirky humor that works better than one might imagine.The premise of 'Ghostbusters' is so utterly ridiculous that it's something of a miracle it works as well as it does. The script, by Aykroyd and Ramis (back when they knew 'funny'), involves our heroes sweeping the ghost population of NYC while dodging EPA toady Walter Peck ('Die Hard''s William Atherton, in a hilariously straight performance); in the meantime, Venkman woos musician Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment becomes a portal for ghoulish baddie Gozer to enter through. Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.Through all its absurdity, 'Ghostbusters' works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.Personally, 'Ghostbusters' is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on 'Ghostbusters'' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss.",9,0,0,1 September 2006
Gran Torino," Eastwood's Legacy
","At this point in his career, Clint Eastwood can afford to get a little experimentalhe's earned it. I mean, would you tell this mean-looking SOB otherwise? I thought not. And while 'Gran Torino' treads territory that invites memories of such whitebread vigilante epics like 'Joe' and 'Falling Down,' Eastwood (who directed and stars) transforms his film into a character study that, in spite of all its by-the-numbers machinations, works on damn near every level. I have never been a big fan of the man's directorial outings, but the appropriateness of his slice-of-life detail really turned my head here. Our grizzled, aged, yet firm-featured star plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran whose cynical, bigoted outlook on the world is affirmed by his wife's passing, and outright exacerbated by the arrival of a Hmong family next door. When the young son is caught trying to steal the codger's 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation, Walt becomes a one-man force of nature who isn't beyond training a gun on the kids stepping on his fresh-cut lawn. Yet when he frightens off the bullying gang in a gesture of unintended heroism, he is heralded by his neighbors, eventually acquiescing to the pleas that Thao, the son, pay off his transgression with a week of servitude to Walt. That these two unlikely characters become friends goes without saying; it's in the generational and cultural gaps that Eastwood makes these conventions something of revelation: the film even presents a nagging spiritual quandary for Walt that intensifies his burden as we see the layers of ice thawing from his personality. Additionally, 'Gran Torino' is filled with such spun-from-Americana Archie Bunkerisms that one can't help but laugh at the audacity of Kowalski's passive racism (even positing that his usage of such slurs might spring from his own insecurity and fear); it sounds 'wrong' and 'un-PC' to say such a thing, and perhaps it's only in the context of our familiarity with Eastwood the actor and his hoarse voice and deliberate mannerisms that humor connects in such surprising places. Eastwood is no longer the young man who set screens ablaze in the Westerns of Sergio Leone, or as Harry Callahan, and 'Gran Torino' seamlessly consolidates decades of his tough-guy persona into a character who is at once Eastwood, and also a near-satirical comment on the character he has been most associated with for his entire career, providing a fitting tribute to his own career, and an appreciative gift to fans of great cinema.",8,1,5,7 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Case of David Fincher
","A self-defeating thought crossed my mind when I first learned of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button': is David Fincher going mainstream on me? Pretty ironic if he is, considering the thrust of his film-making career has been completely within the multimillion-dollar blockbuster range, replete with A-List stars (most notably his repeat collaborations with Brad Pitt). Yet Fincher is one of the most unlikely, unassuming directors working today, probing the dystopian ('Alien3'), the grotesque ('Se7en'), and the darkly satirical ('Fight Club') on a level that backhands the notion that Hollywood can only pump out light, easily-forgotten entertainments.A story about a man who is born old and proceeds to age backwards, for instance, seems like the recipe for trite sentiment and Oscar nods, and while 'Benjamin Button' will certainly be up for the latter, Fincher manages to transform it into a meditativeand remarkably maturerecord of life itself, in all its highs and lows.In his third turn as Fincher's leading man, Brad Pitt plays the title character, born to a button tycoon's wife in 1918 New Orleans, abandoned on a doorstep of a rest home, and raised by a black couple who acknowledge Benjamin's condition as miraculous and heaven-sent (one of the film's most stunning setpieces has the wrinkled, midget-sized man 'walking' for the first time at a tent revival). A decrepit old man at the age of seven, Benjamin meets Daisy, the axis on which his life will revolve. The film unravels in a grandly classical way, framed by the dying Daisy's daughter (Julia Ormond) reading journal passages from the hospital as Hurricane Katrina rages outside.Through the conviction of the performances and Fincher's deft handling, the notion of 'wrongness' at a physically older man falling for a young girl (while the two possess an equal maturityor lack thereof) is curtailed into something affecting and true. The extent to which the relationship between Benjamin and Daisy (played as an adult by Cate Blanchett) is pushed (both literally and figuratively) is the central unpredictable element that keeps 'Curious Case' from falling into shopworn sentimental pap. This is probably the first time I have fallen so deeply in love with characters whose experiences impart lessons both genuine and sincere, and reflect people as they truly do change with age.That being said, Eric Roth's heavily-expanded adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story becomes too obliquely ponderous at times, particularly Benjamin's adventures with a tattooed tugboat captain (Jared Harris) and an English spy's society wife (Tilda Swinton) with ambitions of swimming the English Channel (after an unsuccessful attempt). While these interludes do enrich Benjamin's character, just as much could have been imparted had they been abbreviated.But the love story is the driving force of 'Curious Case,' and it's a testament to Fincher's versatility as a filmmaker (and the palpably passionate performances of Pitt and Blanchett) that he stages every shot in a manner to evoke the greatest emotional impact without coming off as plaintive and sentimental. Furthermore, his love of state-of-the-art visual effects remains on full display (he still wields CGI better than any director working today), particularly in the backward transformation of Benjamin, culminating in a scene of 'birth' that is at once painful and beautiful.7.5 out of 10",8,2,4,11 January 2009
Children of Men," Visually stunning, emotionally sterile
","One of the arguments (in my mind, anyway) against 'A.I.' was that the project, long-gestating with Stanley Kubrick prior to his death, and taken over by Steven Spielberg after, was at odds with the former's emotionally sterile obsession with style, and the latter's fixation with sentimentality and family values. And in a sense, that film-making dichotomy is just as much on display in 'Children of Men,' only instead of Spielbergian emotion, director Alfonso Cuaron opts for the frustrating detachment of Kubrick, to the point where no matter what fantastic visual is being displayed on-screen, it's hard to care all that much because the characters--no matter how well-played--are little more than genre ciphers. The film forgoes whatever literary quality P.D. James' source material possessed, instead going for gritty, in-the-moment documentary realism; and while Cuaron shows impressive skill with long, complex takes and CGI, the film feels shallow (and sometimes shrill) in its overall narrative. What we have is essentially the tale of mankind's death knell due to women becoming infertile (it's none-too-subtly implied that this is the source of terrorism, death, and destruction the world over), until an immigrant girl (running afoul of some eco-terrorist types) turns up pregnant, resulting in an unbroken chase to get her to the 'Human Project,' a fabled safe haven that may not exist. The performances are excellent if not truly transcendent--Clive Owen as the reluctant protector; Julianne Moore as his radical ex-wife; and Michael Caine as the cerebral, aging hippie who clings to hope--perhaps because the characters don't get the faithful fleshing-out they deserve (some only get a few minutes of screen time before making their exit--is this a comment on the film's own 'time is fleeting' theme?), leading to an experience that kept me at a distance. Don't get me wrong--'Children of Men' is a well-done film, albeit sometimes a bit thick with its philosophy, but a step away from Kubrick would have been a step in the right direction.",6,7,11,17 April 2008
Mulholland Drive," one of Lynch's best films
","David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' is a movie that not only gets better upon repeated viewings, but also requires a lot of brain work on the part of whoever views it (that means YOU).  The script is filled with strange incidents ('Club Silencio,' for instance) and characters (a cowboy, a dwarf with links to the underworld, and a rotting corpse hanging out behind a Hollywood restaurant), but is also filled with with small details that clue us in to the answer to Lynch's riddle.  'Mulholland Drive' is a mystery in the purest sense of the word, with events and characters that overlap, and seemingly go back in time--there are no easy answers to be found, but trying to figure them out is part of the fun.Betty (Naomi Watts, filled with the right amount of cheerful naivete and, later, despair) is a young Hollywood hopeful who encounters a car crash victim named Rita (Laura Harring), who has amnesia.  In the meantime, a harried film director (Justin Theroux, of 'American Psycho') is re-casting the female lead of his film, but outside forces beyond his control insist on one specific girl.  That's the basic plot--Lynch's narrative structure depends on unconventional incidents/characters that are better left unsaid.If there's a flaw to 'Mulholland Drive,' it's the VERY made-for-TV look of the film.  Quite obviously, many scenes were intended for network TV (the film was originally going to be a series, a la 'Twin Peaks') and went unchanged in the final cut of the film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing--it just cheapens the look of the film.  But that's a minor complaint. For fans of Lynch...or people who just like a good mystery, 'Mulholland Drive' delivers in spades.  4 stars out of 5.",8,0,1,13 January 2003
Shrek 2," pale shadow of the original
","The original 'Shrek' was an absolutely charming fairy tale that skillfully accentuated a simple message with impassioned performances and gallows humor. 'Shrek 2,' however, fails in many departments, but no more than the most crucial: it is completely lacking the fairytale charm and wonder that made its predecessor so darn endearing. This time around, the characters seem to be just going through the motions of what is, at heart, a formula sequel propped up with glitzy computer animation that is at least as good as the original's. A collection of charmless new characters does little to help the cause, which is made increasingly futile with a tone-deaf sense of satire and a self-conscious, anvil-heavy humor that seldom permits any genuine laughs. Unfortunately, this sequellike so many otherswas clearly driven by a committee of producers rather than fresh ideas.",4,0,0,7 October 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Chicks, swords, gore, and more!
","I first saw the opening entry of the 'Kill Bill' series theatrically, and under sour circumstances stemming from some personal problems. I was also in the midst of my own disillusionment with Quentin Tarantino (but more so his over-exposure and over-hype)a backlash had been in effect ever since the release of 'Pulp Fiction,' and the debacle of 'Jackie Brown'though still heavily-praised by criticsdidn't help matters much. So, by the time 'Kill Bill' came alongwith, again, the predictable amount of critical praiseI was ready to see if Tarantino could put his money where his big mouth is.The verbose auteur announces that this is his '4th film,' and immediately puts a sour tinge of smugness over the proceedings (though I feel the same way about the 'From the Visionary Director of...' tag that pops up frequently these days)who does this guy think he is? I don't think directors of any caliber or experience would ever be so pretentious as to draw attention to their work as if it's the Holy Cinematic Grail all us anxious spectators have been anticipating for years. No matter how bombastic a director's ego may be behind-the-scenes, most have the simple modesty to let their work speak for itself.And, factoring in my preexisting attitude, I was left less than impressed with 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1.' Granted, I had never been too keen on the Samurai-assassin/chopsockey potboilers Tarantino was directly quoting, but didn't think he did a very good job making the grindhouse aesthetic of the film accessible to the general viewing public (as he did with 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' a decade earlier); in my view, his ode to Japanese-style swordplay and literal fountains of blood could only be relevant to the audience members who had already established their fanfare for that genre.For whatever reason, I recently decided to give both volumes of 'Kill Bill' another look. I've calmed down in regard to Tarantino's off-camera persona (especially now that QT crony Eli Roth is an easier whipping boy), and am surprised to report that I had a lot of fun with both films.On its own terms, Vol. 1 toys with viewer expectations in a variety of waysTarantino lays out his tale in a very literary way, dividing the film into 'chapters' that free up the chronological constraints, allowing surprise twists from future and past events to manifest at unexpected times. There is a sequence that chronicles one character's rise to the highest ranks of the Japanese Yakuza in hyper-violent anime style. The use of different color filters and black-and-white to emphasize a particularly brutal flashback are utilized to stunning effect. There is a fun nod to Brian De Palma early on (in which Daryl Hannahas one-eyed assassin Elle Driverdons a nurse's outfit to kill our heroine) which utilizes a split-screen. And genre buffs will enjoy the use of a key musical theme from Lucio Fulci's 'The Psychic.' Actors like David Carradine and Sonny Chibawho peaked in such similar fare back in the 1970sare given career-reviving roles here.Amid all the homages, Tarantinorather than just slavishly imitating the works of otherssynthesizes the elements into a vision that is distinctly his own. There are passages of dialog that ring familiar of his style, clip, and rhythmbut unlike 'Pulp Fiction,' where conversation became a plot point unto itself, 'Kill Bill' is far more interested in the storytelling aspect, and progresses with a masterful author's flair. One stunning setpiece (that owes much of its effect to Sally Menke's sharp editing) near the end of the first installment begins with a brilliant, several-minute tracking shot (echoes of De Palma and Scorsese) that lets loose into all-out pandemonium that goes on and on with irrepressible flair, a spectacle of superb framing and stunt work. And it's interesting how Vol. 1 seems to shoot its figurative load in the first installment, making viewers rightly wondereven after the last-second revelationwhere the latter half could possibly go.As it turns out, Tarantino has more than a few tricks up his sleeve in crafting what could rightly be called his Masterpiece.7.5 out of 10",8,0,1,15 June 2008
Saw II," a sequel that's a cut above...
","The original 'Saw' was a nifty little horror film wrapped in the grit and grime of 'Seven,' whilst turning the clichés of the 'serial-killer-thriller' on its head by giving the murderer a modus operandi as severe as his condition. In the film, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) was not a killer per se, but more of a prophet preaching to his victims, who found themselves in elaborately-staged scenarios entailing some form of self-inflicted bloodshed to ensure survival. In a dank, abandoned bathroom, Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell were left with a horrifying proposition: hack through their legs, or remain in the room 'to rot.' 'Saw II' ups the ante of this initial scenario by placing a handful of ill-willed strangers in an abandoned house, where a booby trap awaits around every corner, and certain rooms are suspiciously tailored to the vices of the victims (for instance, a drug addict is forced to fish a key out of a pit filled with syringes). Meanwhile, a harried detective (a surprisingly good Donnie Whalberg)--whose son has been involved in this game--interrogates the frail, soft-spoken Jigsaw.While the victims aren't overly memorable (though a returning Shawnee Smith leaves quite an impression) and their backstories sketchily-shaded (but still tied together well), the real appeal of 'Saw II' is its shocking relentlessness. In a way, the mounting tension in the final minutes of the original 'Saw' has been distributed more evenly throughout this sequel. The cast reins in any severe overacting tendencies, and while generally clichéd, each victim puts forth a noble effort at two-dimensionality. 'Saw II' is so intricately plotted, suspenseful, and surprising that the characters really serve as little more than fodder for whatever unpleasant shock is waiting around the corner.My initial expectations for this film were fraught with skepticism: here was a movie coming on the heels of a sleeper hit barely 1 year old, which smacked of assembly-line studio product; worse yet, it was a sequel being helmed by a novice director (Darren Lynn Bousman). Bracing for another title to add to my 'I-Actually-Shelled-Out-Money-For-That' list, I was consistently surprised and quite pleased with how well 'Saw II' sustained itself as far as mounting suspense and cringe-inducing moments were concerned. Several uncontrived links to the original film were well-done, and Bousman's visual style--while sometimes prone to whiplash edits and camera moves--remained faithful to previous director James Wan, thus transforming 'Saw II' into one of the more authentic sequels I've seen (a definite rarity).I've said little about the plot, and for good reason. 'Saw II,' filled with the kind of downbeat grotesquery that gave the original its bearings, needs to be experienced. Even the slightest hinting at the events that transpire would ruin the film. I resist the common urge to unmask villains and twists in films (due in no small part to the fact that I'm almost always wrong), and while the rushed turning point of 'Saw II' elapses quicker than we can absorb it (and owes a bit to 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Scream'), it does ultimately fit--and is no less contrived than the conclusion of the original.But underneath the heinous violence and bloodshed that greases the gears of 'Saw II' is something of a revelation: through the character of Jigsaw, Tobin Bell creates a murderous mastermind who not only favorably recalls John Doe (Kevin Spacey in 'Seven') and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins in 'The Silence of the Lambs'), but invokes a surprising amount of empathy; granted, the 'lessons' he teaches his victims are wrought with sadistic severity, but his condition, coupled with a soft-spoken, intelligent, world-weary demeanor makes him the appealing backbone of the film while the alleged 'victims' scream and brutalize their way toward survival. Though such irony is doubtlessly intentional, I was surprised--and a bit shocked--at how well it seduced me.In summation: 'Saw II' is a sequel that's a cut above (pun intended), and certainly better than most of the mass-marketed horror dreck plaguing your local multiplex.(Side note: listen close for a delicious reference to 'Last House on the Left.')",7,0,1,29 October 2005
Paranormal Activity," The Horrors of Banality
","It seems no mere coincidence that a sleeper so far below the radar it took two years to find big-time distribution and commercial success has come on the 10-year anniversary of the innovative (though somewhat thin) found-footage footsteps of 'The Blair Witch Project.' Also familiar is the carefully calculated hype machine (which began as grassroots chatter that slowly garnered major interest) used to land the film in as many theatres as possible, with the beaming, always-hyperbolic blurbs of impressed bloggers lighting the way.When it wants to be (and it often is), 'Paranormal Activity' is an effectively extemporaneous haunted-house freakout. Like 'Blair Witch,' it takes a simple premise (young couple encountering a restless, unseen presence in their home), and builds around it a claustrophobic vortex of suspense, where our (not always) sympathy-garnering protagonists become mankind's last stand against forces far beyond its control.In an interesting narrative choice, the film begins with Katie and Micah (she's the reserved student; he's the cocky day-trader) already complicit with the strange happenings in their new house, to the point where Micah is actively recording the proceedings in hopes of catching an ectoplasmic curveball. Their banter possesses a slice-of-life realism that helps ground us in the banality of suburban America, complemented by the house's own lack of production-designed, artsy flourish. The consumer-grade camera work, while already a well-established avant-garde cliché, is fittingly abrasive and starkly honest.With his shoestring budget and limited resources, writer-director Oren Peli has created a film that (yes, like 'Blair Witch') requires the viewer to drop all expectations of a slick, glossy gorefest and embrace the lost art of the subtle, slow-burn scare. This is more of an Unease Film than a Horror Film. And while the sense of psychic disturbance in the air is indeed palpable, 'Paranormal Activity' plays like an intriguing short subject stretched beyond its capacity; by the time the disappointing, jump-scare conclusion rolls around, it feels like an out-of-place shock in a film that doesn't quite know how to combine its parts into a satisfying whole (Katie's haunted past, for instance, is left dangling). And once the screen went black, I was just wishing Peli had pushed the supernatural elements even further. In the end, 'Paranormal Activity' is a risible (yet not superior, especially in the wake of 'Diary of the Dead' and 'Quarantine') contender bringing up the tail end of a cinematic fad.6.5 out of 10",7,7,14,10 November 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a balance of caricatured characters and visual wonder
","Tim Burton is a director who has always been at a disadvantage when applying his unique visual style to the half-baked screenplays he is all too often saddled with--no amount of 'flair' or signature weirdness can cover up flaws in character and story ('Edward Scissorhands' and 'Beetlejuice' in particular), but with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (a return to the grind of Roald Dahl's book, first filmed in 1971) he meets his match. While not as downbeat or malicious as the earlier film, Burton's handling of the characters and situations melds well with his directorial flourishes--with an eccentric Willy Wonka (the playfully androgynous Johnny Depp) and an overwhelming wonderland contained within his factory, the exaggerated, bratty children (plus the humble and compassionate Charlie) and their parents are the pitch-perfect accompaniment to all the visual caffeine. The cast is in fine form, with Grandpa Bucket (David Kelly) and Wonka's father (Christopher Lee) to provide some chuckles for adults, while children will be hypnotized by the fantastic yet menacing factory; like most of Burton's work, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' too often threatens visual overload, but at least all the elements blend together finely, like a chocolate waterfall.",6,1,1,24 July 2005
Black Snake Moan," Sledgehammer subtle, but compelling regardless
","In 'Black Snake Moan,' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into 'Happy Ending' territory for my liking). And that's not to mention the archival footage of musician Son House, ruminating on love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). Yet in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of 'Black Snake Moan,' the tale of aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who comes across near-death nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever); nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem his own fallen self. While there is a definite prurient appeal in watching Ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature--not a trace of Wednesday Addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with Jackson, who personifies 'the blues' in his portrait of a flawed, God-fearing man. While heavy-handed, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm/blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there. The setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts Rae's libido) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends 'Black Snake Moan' much of its strength--the committed performances of Jackson and Ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with, well, seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance I could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film.",7,2,4,21 August 2007
Black Hawk Down," high beams in a thick fog
","I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why 'Black Hawk Down' is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.  Those who say, in so many words, 'leave your politics at the door' are the ones who are missing the point of a democratic society--even in something as simple as film criticism, dissent is not a privilege, but a right for all people who disagree with the preset opinions of others.'Black Hawk Down' is a film that offers up an indistinguishable cast of characters, Army men devoid of personality but all trailed by gold haloes (heavy irony here, as one reviewer mentioned, one soldier is presently in prison for rape), as they carry out a rescue mission that goes awry (although the plot becomes a moot point even before the troops arrive), which turns into the type of loud, exploitative, and soulless bloodbath we've come to expect from the prolific, oh-so-patriotic Jerry Bruckheimer. (At least 'Con Air' had John Malkovich for comic relief.)Inking his soul over to the devil, Ridley Scott employs the mandatory, quick-edit style of pretentious music-video directors the world over, and rather than drawing interest into the almost nonexistent story, instead makes the film bomb even harder.  The shameless cliches that are trotted out do nothing to build the characters (the phone call that came one ring too late; the 'kissing of the family picture', etc.), therefore it is impossible to relate to or care about anyone, even more so when they choke out the typical 'Tell my wife and kids...' line.On the other side of a particularly one-dimensional, racist 'script' are the Somalis, who are presented with even less personality than the soldiers--their video game objective is to yell, wave automatic weapons, and act like utter psychopaths.  What better way to establish the Good Guys, eh? Just give the Bad Guys even less personality!  Personality is overrated, anyway--especially when the gory consequences of war are shoved in your face with unflinching horror!  BHD piles on the gore, mostly for dramatic effect, but since the characters are such cliches, it becomes pure shock value...gore for gore's sake.  I've seen better, more justified use of the red stuff in Lucio Fulci films.Unlike 'Apollo 13,' this is not a 'successful failure,' but became a success (financially, that is) by being such a typical exercise in Hollywood sensationalism.  Riding high on the wave of nationalism, revenge, and general intolerance brought about by the 9/11 tragedy, BHD arrived at an opportune time, and gave audiences exactly what they wanted--a sink-your-claws-into-the-armrest propaganda film where the U.S. Army's angelic duty boils down to blowing away foreigners (a testament to this film's racial and nationalistic bias is the fact that 19 American soldiers died in contrast with 1,000 Somalis).  As if this shallow exercise in war pornography couldn't attest to its own ulterior motives, many critics hailed BHD as 'the best war movie ever,' among other ostentatious remarks, right as the full-speed 'War on Terror' campaign was gripping this country (makes you think, doesn't it?).  As for myself, I could only raise a skeptical eyebrow at the proceedings, as I pondered U.S. foreign policy, racial stereotypes through the years, and Hollywood's ability to make a mint by ignoring history.  This forum seems divided--as is the case in America right now--between gung-ho 'patriotic' comments and dissidents.  To disparage the flag or this film is unpatriotic--but is it patriotic, then, to accept everything you see and hear without question?  Or is it more patriotic to bask in the jingoistic arrogance of BHD?  If you believe that to be true, then by all means see this movie.  As for everybody else, 'Bowling for Columbine' will soon be out on video.1/10",1,101,203,27 May 2003
The Dark Knight," Carnival of Carnage
","While the notion of 'capturing the post-9/11 Zeitgeist' became a tiresome, overused, and seldom-accurate expression in the film-critic pool before the dust had even settled on that fateful day, it is hard to deny how much it has influenced the tone of popular culture. In 2005's 'Batman Begins,' the villainasylum director Jonathan Crane (aka 'The Scarecrow')wanted to see Gotham City 'rip itself apart with fear.' In 'The Dark Knight' (director Christopher Nolan's sophomore franchise follow-up), that fear has been given a very real personification in The Jokera character whose unrepentant brutality and calculated brilliance gives a chilling face to a malevolence that is never explainedindeed, its out-of-nowhere appearance is what makes it so damn frightening.Picking up right after the events of 'Batman Begins,' 'Knight' has Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, as haunted and conflicted as ever) relocated to an upscale penthouse, with devoted butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Wayne Enterprises exec (and go-to-guy for high-tech gizmos) Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) at the ready to serve Batman's needs. Opening with a violent, elaborate bank heist that introduces us to the ghoulish Joker (Heath Ledger), the film eventually settles into a plot wherein District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), courting Wayne's on-off girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, stepping in for Katie Holmes), attempts to take a stand against crime during election season, only to see his efforts impeded by the insane yet brilliant Clown Prince of Crime.If 'Begins' ended on a note where order was restored (albeit temporarily), 'Knight' erupts in chaos in the opening minutes, and seldom lets up for the duration of its 2 1/2-hour run time. Nolan, who gave us the cerebral thriller 'Memento,' brings together notoriously conflicting elements of narrative and cinematic technique into a largely satisfying whole: the action is suspenseful and unpredictable; the narrative is comprised of twist after chilling twist; and the characters arcs are quite exciting and fitting. 'The Dark Knight' is not a snobbish action film for intellectuals, but a meticulously assembled thrill ride that pulls the viewer in with the raw recognition of simple emotions like anger, jealousy, and fear.As praiseworthy as 'The Dark Knight' is, I had a few problems with the film overall: a consequence of most big-budget action fare is the suspension of disbelief that accompanies the more frenetic scenes (here, Bruce Wayne somehow rigs every cell-phone in Gotham with a sonar device that helps him pinpoint the Joker's whereabouts), and while Nolan knows how to stage breathtaking chases, some of the editing is awkward and confusing, causing us to lose track of who is where (and when). Additionally, the introduction of Two-Facewhile intentionally deliberateoccurs far too late in the film to make him a villain as formidable as The Joker, causing Eckhart's finely nuanced performance to fall in the shadow of Ledger's maniacal grease-paint fiend. The film overall is quite satisfying, but also stretched beyond its capacity in an attempt to give audiences their money's worth.And what about Ledger? His performance is as singular and primal as The Joker has ever been, and brings a disturbing, sickly-psychotic face to anarchy that knows no bounds. Ledger's initial scenes portend the sense of murderous, blackly-comic pranksterism (the 'disappearing pencil trick' that's destined for pop-culture legend) that marked Nicholson's signature performance in Tim Burton's 1989 effort, but becomes increasingly horrifying as the film progresses, to the point where we recoil in shock from all the evil his visage radiates. As Nolan is playing on a reality-based field filled with devastating consequences, his Joker is the antithesis of winking campindeed, Ledger's performance makes the argument for madness being an integral part of the human condition; where the humor ends and the horror sets in, however, is the manner in which he exemplifies not only extreme-thinking individuals (the Hitlers, the Stalins, the bin Ladens), but the persuasive appeal that mobilized the masses to their out-there causes. And that is what transforms 'The Dark Knight' from a mere 'superhero movie' into something chancy, unpredictable, and dangerous.And also undeniably entertaining.",8,3,8,28 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," not much to say...
","Since the masses usually go to great lengths to over-analyze such manufactured, Hollywood-ized quirkiness as found in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' I will spare everyone my long dissertation on the film (since I don't have one), and just say that, behind its clever casting (Jim Carrey, like Nicolas Cage in 'Adaptation,' is playing a facsimile of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman), deliberately disjointed structure (it is a film about memory loss, after all), and emotional moments, the film is largely an exercise in overly self-conscious artistry. Light, diverting entertainment at best--nothing earth-shattering.",6,1,4,9 July 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," no classic, but a fine send-up nonetheless...
","'This is Spinal Tap' is the granddaddy of the 'mockumentary' subgenre (consisting of an admittedly small group of films), and like an elder, it has aged in ways both positive and negative. The script, by Christopher Guest ('Waiting for Guffman'; 'Best in Show'), Michael McKean, Harry Shearer ('The Simpsons'), and Rob Reiner (who also directed) shows an astute knowledge of the behind-the-scenes world of rock music whilst amplifying the excesses of the lifestyle with satiric gusto. The film is awash in early-80s glamour, neon, cheesy yet catchy musical interludes, and ostentatious Van Halen hairdos. Clocking in at 83 minutes, 'Spinal Tap' breezes by quickly enough, but the gags often feel too spaced-out and too subtle for their own good...while this helps the ersatz-documentary aspect, the comedy suffers a little. Despite this, 'Spinal Tap' is a highly entertaining item with some wickedly funny scenes (the dwarfs dancing around a miniature mock-up of Stonehenge is priceless), and remains relevant today as a tongue-in-cheek portrait of the excesses of the music world.",6,5,14,2 February 2006
Alice in Wonderland," Down...and down...and down...the rabbit-hole
","It seemed like a no-brainer: the eccentric, visionary genius of Tim Burton ('Ed Wood,' 'Sweeney Todd') paired with the eccentric, surreal literary work of Lewis Carroll seemed a recipe for something that could be nothing less than mind-blowing, especially when the literary work in question is something as beloved and resonant in popular culture as 'Alice in Wonderland.' It's a shame the reality portends a less-than-flattering cinematic experience. What really happened here is anyone's guess: Burton, after floating on a career high in the wake of 'Big Fish,' 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' and 'Sweeney Todd' (one of his best films), transformed a world-renowned tale into something so bombastic and scattershot that it often feels like a mega-budget Terry Gilliam movie. 'Alice in Wonderland' really owes more to the broadness of 'Mars Attacks!' than the controlled maturity of Burton's recent works. The film is stuffed with eccentric characters, but barely a single relative emotion; the dialog, delivered in English accents by frequently hyperactive actors, borders on the incomprehensible. As Burton's long-reliable muse, Johnny Depp has essayed many memorable roles under his direction, but as the Mad Hatter, delivers a lisping performance so wildly over-the-top that it barely registers (his clown makeup and red fright wig doesn't help matters). And despite the film's much-hyped use of 3D, that aspect comes off as curiously pedestrian, with very few scenes that take full advantage of the effect (or perhaps it's a case of bad timing: in the wake of the fantastically immersive world of 'Avatar,' everything else looks like child's play by comparison), resulting in a visual experience that lets the viewer down almost as much as the flatly-rendered narrative. By the end, my frustrated mind could only wonder, without answer, where 'Alice in Wonderland' really went wrong.",5,2,5,21 March 2010
Avatar," Cameron's Visual Dazzle Saves Familiar Story
","At this point, the smothering hype machine has told you all you really need to know about 'Avatar,' James Cameron's much-anticipated return to the cinematic fray. Insofar as visual impact is concerned, this could very well be the crowning achievement of 2009 (and certainly an apt way to end the first decade of the new millennium), with a literal world of intricate detail on display, populated by characters and creatures that run the gamut from beautiful anthropomorphs to grotesque hybrids of prehistoric creatures. When viewed in 3D, 'Avatar' is nothing short of breathtaking, and forgives much of the film's storytelling shortcomings: the bottom line is, this is a simple plot (the military-industrial complex wants some precious/valuable resource from an indigenous population; said population is not going to give it up without a fight) that is not new, and often monotonously stretched through a series of anticlimaxes until it settles on a proper ending. While there is a stinging indictment of human greed and military intervention on display, it's nothing we haven't seen before in the post-9/11 cinematic climate (and granted, Cameron--who also wrote the script--has always worked better with conceptual ideas than narrative intricacies). Yet 'Avatar,' while heavy-handed in its telling, is less about a message and more about the experience overall; I was frequently taken aback and awed by the imagery on display, and in a medium that (at its best) demands we be shown, and not told, what's going on, 'Avatar' is about as good as it gets.7.5 out of 10",8,1,5,13 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Us Home, Raimi
","This much insanity shouldn't be legal...and so much fun. Thankfully, no one told Sam Raimi, who shakes off Hollywood expectation and demographic-appeal concerns with 'Drag Me to Hell,' a back-to-basics horror flick that's one of the strongest original works of genre storytelling so far this year. To those who would bemoan or dismiss the vitality of this frequently reviled class of film...this one's for you.Confession Time: I have never been a big fan of Raimi's work; his well-regarded 'Evil Dead' trilogy never consumed me with the same sense of ballistic fanaticism it inspires in most. I could appreciate his distinctive way of mixing the extremities of the genre (demons, decapitation, dismemberment) with gleefully broad (and outright ludicrous) physical humor, but something always kept me from fully embracing this auteur's style. A theatrical screening of 'Army of Darkness' last year had me thinking I might have been a bit harsh in my assessment of Raimi's work. After all, even his more streamlined, serious mainstream works (the masterful 'A Simple Plan,' for instance) contain undeniable stylistic echoes of his macabre roots.As with other horror directors whose humble beginnings have spun off into commercially and critically successful careers (David Cronenberg and Peter Jackson immediately come to mind), part of the thrill of 'Drag Me to Hell' is to see the accumulated experience of a now-seasoned filmmaker played out in the genre he helped define. The result is classical in style while distinctly contemporary; silly and funny while genuinely jolting and unnerving; polished and slick while grungy and crude. These contradictory traits are a clear invitation for the already-initiated, and newcomers will have the pleasure of experiencing Raimi's now-highly refined joybuzzer shocks without the safety net of familiarity.The premise is deliciously simple, creating a uniquely internal logic that gives Raimi free reign to pull out all the stops: Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a promotion-seeking loan officer who, in a split-second of avarice, denies Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an old gypsy woman, an extension on her mortgage payment; as a result, she visits a three-day curse on Christine that, if not stopped, will literally send her to hell. Supported by faithful boyfriend Clay (Justin Long, balancing the dramatic and comedic quite well) and the assistance of 'seer' Rham Jas (Dileep Reo), Christine is driven to extreme measures in the battle to save her soul, leading to sequences that will leave even the most jaded horror hound uncertain of the outcome. In addition to the macabre elements and the suitably outlandish special effects, Raimi builds adequate suspense and even integrates some genre-crossing sidesteps (a great sequence where Christine meets Clay's parents is played liked a romantic comedy that segues into horror before once again returning to comedy) that deliver a one-two punch of terror, humor, and character development. Its initial scenes even invoke 'The Twilight Zone' in the sense of bland domestic drama giving way to powers beyond man's ability to control.True to its title, 'Drag Me to Hell' is a film without barriers or limits; nothing is definite in Raimi's world, and in the best horror tradition, the guarantee of a Happy Ending is punctuated with a solid question mark. All the more impressive given the film's PG-13 rating; in an era where horror films are stigmatized for whatever commercially-viable moniker the MPAA attaches to them, it speaks volumes for Raimi's tact and skill the wildly creative grotesqueries that fit within the seeming 'confines' of this rating. With a generation of filmmakers that miss the point of 'horror' and go straight for gore, it's downright refreshing to see a veteran (who made his name in gore) embrace straight-laced fear...and succeed wildly.",7,5,10,4 June 2009
Grindhouse," 'Grindhouse' rocked my world (several times over)
","There is a certain postmodern irony to Grindhouse, a double feature (complete with fake trailers) that tries--and succeeds--in transplanting its audience into the squalid pit of a lowbrow, sleazy theater running Cannibal Holocaust or Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS, circa 1979. Today's viewers have seldom (if ever) had the opportunity to set foot in an actual 'grindhouse' cinema (myself included), and the notion of seeing 'two movies for the price of one' is an all but obsolete concept in our multiplex-dictated culture. Like johns at a brothel, we all pay $8.50 for at least 85 minutes of a prefabricated entertainment fix before shambling out of the theater, either basking in the afterglow or complaining of blue balls. Grindhouse channels the boundless taboos of '70s exploitation and horror cinema in an uncanny way--directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino pull off the seemingly impossible: making these taboos marketable to the typical 'mainstream' audience of today without blunting the edge one bit (some movies just push the envelope--Grindhouse rips it to shreds).Horror, as of late, has been in a very dire state, with the most marketable (and thus overused) plots dealing in dismemberment and desaturated color palates--films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes and Hostel have tried to resurrect the raw spirit of '70s horror, but have been unable to escape the pandering, post-millennial genre sensibility that exists now. Most directors who brag of actively pushing for the commercially-suicidal NC-17 rating are still contradictorily contented to succumb to an R for theaters with the more profitable Unrated DVD waiting in the wings--a rather complacent gesture in a genre notorious for its defiance of 'playing it safe.' Granted, Grindhouse carries an R rating (which shocks even me), but its content is some of the most twisted--and yes, obscene--sh1t you'll ever see in a mainstream film (and I mean that in the best possible way). In their respective segments, Rodriguez and Tarantino show there is a fine line between slathering gore across the screen and turning it into an elegant symphony of wanton yet calculated recklessness, turning the potentially disturbing into cause to cheer, applaud, and howl with laughter. In another bit of shocking postmodern irony, Grindhouse may be the first b@lls-to-the-wall mainstream exploitation item that still retains a sophisticated art-house appeal.After the trailer for the ersatz Mexploitation Machete (starring Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo) that whets our appetite for what is to come, Grindhouse explodes into Planet Terror, Rodriguez's segment about a released chemical agent that infects the residents of a small town, turning everyone into boil-covered, flesh-eating zombies. Our group of colorfully offbeat survivors includes El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), a tow-truck driving, smooth-talking bad-ass; Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), a go-go dancer with ambitions of becoming a stand-up comedian; the local proprietor of a barbecue stand (Jeff Fahey) and his sheriff brother (Michael Biehn), who commits the repeated cliché blunder of never allowing El Wray a firearm (which he eventually gets anyway). In all its scratched-print, reel-missing, blood-drenched glory, Rodriguez seems to be channeling John Carpenter's Escape from New York, crossed with the in-your-face gore of Lucio Fulci's Zombie (Tarantino, in a cameo, even gets the signature ocular trauma), but creates a frenetic, absurdist adventure all his own--I wore a big grin from start to finish.Following Planet Terror are intermission trailers of surprising quality from Rob Zombie (Werewolf Women of the SS), Edgar Wright (the Hell House/Mario Bava-styled Don't) and Eli Roth (who turns Thanksgiving into the latest slasher-friendly holiday). Though I may not think much of this trio's feature film work, I have to echo the sentiments of other critics who say these pseudo-trailers alone are worth the price of admission, with Zombie's being arguably the most amusing.Up until now, Grindhouse has been a thoroughly rousing feature, and one would suspect that Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, would be the crown jewel in its trash-cinema crown. The subversive method of his film, however, proves initially confounding, and left me wondering if the movie as a whole would derail as a result--gone was the scratched-up print quality and absurdist tone that marked Planet; what took over instead was Tarantino's usual penchant of a plot predicated on over-analytical dialog, and generally laid-back scene composition of characters engaging in said dialog. After a slow introduction of some incredibly obnoxious characters (who all--thankfully--meet a satisfying demise) and the genuinely disturbing death of a relative innocent (McGowan again, in a blonde wig), the story settles in with four free-spirited girls working within the Hollywood system who run afoul of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a scar-faced psycho who turns his car into a souped-up, 'death proof' machine. While the rhythmic dialog and moseyed pace takes some time to adjust to (especially after the rapid-fire Planet Terror), Death Proof gradually increases its intensity in a slow burn that eventually culminates in an extended, incredibly thrilling car chase. The young actresses are engaging heroines, and Russell shines as the villain (though his presence is a bit random in the narrative); instead of aping Rodriguez's style verbatim, Tarantino stays committed to his own method of storytelling, wallowing in unapologetic slasher-flick misogyny and car-chase thrills.Overall, Grindhouse is 3 hours of cinematic glory whose experience will not be equaled anytime in the near future. While its lengthy running time and taboo subject matter will adversely affect box office, it is a film that--true to its title--will be ideally experienced (and not just seen) in the confines of a theater, with an audience who may not be in on the joke initially, but certainly will be as the film progresses. For me, it provided a rush of movie-going excitement I haven't felt since watching Dawn of the Dead late one night when I was twelve.Planet Terror: 9/10 Death Proof: 7/10 Overall: 8.5/10",9,1,3,30 June 2007
Saw," fearlessly downbeat thriller
","SPOILERS! 'Saw' is something of a testament to the power of genre films, a marker of how low-down, gritty, and generally unpleasant a plot can be, while being mercilessly intense and suspenseful at the same time. It also is a testament to why most film critics simply aren't cut out to critique such films--in an era of feigned PC cuddliness and romantic comedies with Brittany Murphy, it's downright MEAN to splatter our fine multiplexes with the type of morbid bloodshed found in 'Saw.' Shame on you, Mr. Wan and Whannell! Have you no courtesy for the real-life suffering of human beings?! Perhaps that's the point said critics are so slow to acknowledge. Downbeat, gut-wrenching, and intricately crafted, 'Saw' is pure escapism that takes us to a dark place that we never hope to visit in reality. The plot begins deviously simple--two men awaken in a disgusting, decaying bathroom with their legs shackled--and becomes increasingly complicated as the film progresses. In the vein of a true thriller (however B-list), director James Wan (working from costar Leigh Whannell's script) has a knack for keeping plot details hidden in order to build suspense, so that their inclusion later on will make sense (poor Zepp!). The grungy visual style is an obvious nod to David Fincher (the atmosphere and plot is pure 'Seven'), and the plot--which could be taken from any one of a million serial killer pics--actually forgoes the POV of the murderer and instead focuses on the two characters (Cary Elwes and Whannell) trapped in the room.I have viewed 'Saw' several times, and must say the quality of the acting improves each time. Whereas I found Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter (okay, not much of a stretch there) to be hamming it up to an insufferable degree the first time out, I have lumped this eccentricity in as a contributing factor to 'Saw''s morbid charm. Though at times overwrought, Elwes's performance seems to accurately reflect the neuroses of an average man put in an unfamiliar, oppressive situation--there is even a note of horrifying tragedy in the decision he winds up making. He and Whannell are an unusual couple, but their interactions have a certain grace and are not dull. Michael Emerson, who plays the patsy Zepp, is probably the film's standout--a performance that depends heavily on nuance to trick the audience into seeing him as a cold-blooded killer and, ultimately, a pawn. Tobin Bell, a character actor who has spent his career playing lowlifes and killers, phones in his minor role as the murderer Jigsaw.Though drowned in a sea of hype months before it hit theaters, 'Saw' is a solid reminder that true horror and suspense is still alive and kicking, even if it is only with one foot...",7,0,0,7 April 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's One True Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick is easily one of the most overrated directors of all time, but I will say that 'A Clockwork Orange' is a singular masterpiece that still carries an effect, 36 years later. I think this has less to do with Kubrick the director than Kubrick the adapter--working from Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name, rich with food for thought, the director does not skimp on the intertwining strings of morality, religion, criminality, science, and the State that mark Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell, in an iconic role)'s descent through a literal mindf*ck in order to curtail his delinquent desires. Kubrick's 'point-and-stare' technique, usually an invitation for sleep, is properly observant and well-utilized here: the characters convey the aforementioned commentary in a lively, sly way (from Alex's 'droogies' to the pitch-perfect Aubrey Morris as the perpetually-grinning Mr. Deltoid). While time has diminished the shocks that made the film controversial upon initial release, the morality-play structure is still well-executed and compelling, culminating in a scene revolving around Alex, a plate of spaghetti, and a bottle of wine that is nothing short of masterful. There are many more scenes like this, but like the rest of 'A Clockwork Orange'--they are best experienced cold. Highly recommended, and that's coming from someone who thinks the rest of Kubrick's filmography is negligible.",9,0,2,16 August 2007
The Fly," a driven, relentless horror show with heart...
","Long before the business of remaking old scare films became an industry unto itself, David Cronenberg (then-author of 'The Brood' and 'Scanners,' among other low-budget shockers) took a 1950s B movie and (literally) transformed it into a relevant and compelling horror film. Now, I'll admit that I have never been a big fan of 'The Fly,' and always viewed it as one of Cronenberg's more underwhelming efforts--an FX spectacular starring then-lovers Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis--but upon recent inspection, was taken aback by its terror, romance, and tragedy. While most of his films are marked by a cold, detached tone, Cronenberg finds a classical despair within the characters of Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a fidgety scientist who invents a teleportation device, and Veronica (Davis), a reporter for a scientific journal who follows his progress. In a fit of jealousy one evening, Brundle--who has only recently met with success in teleporting a living ape--steps into the pod-like contraption, unaware that a housefly is trapped inside with him; afterward, he exhibits an abnormally stunning physical range, and undergoes a transformation that is truly horrific (Cronenberg, with the assistance of makeup artist Chris Walas, spares us no small detail). 'The Fly,' like 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting. The chemistry he and Davis share is something truly rare in the horror genre, which gives 'The Fly' its transcendent tone; Cronenberg offers a story with humanity, jelled with a metaphor of human decay, and brilliant special effects that assist in bringing this fantastic tale to life. Well done.",7,2,3,2 February 2006
How to Train Your Dragon," A Fireball Allegory with Heart
","Ah, jeez. Why did they have to make the dragons so darn CUTE under that scary, scaly, toothy exterior? So cute, in fact, that Toothless (a pitch-dark dragon called a Night Furie), the dragon our hapless (and unfortunately named) hero Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) befriends, reminded me of a cat I used to own (she was also pitch-dark, with a spot of white on her neck). Huh? Since when do dragons act like domesticated housecats when you get to know them? Ah, jeez. I suppose such questions are best left unpondered, since 'How to Train Your Dragon' blends humor, pathos, and sometimes heart-melting tenderness with such grace and style that it had me shedding a tear or two by its conclusion. At its core, this is yet another allegory about not judging others by their differences, choosing your own path in life, and Doing The Right Thing (regardless of what others may think). The story is supported by colorful characters (dragon-killing vikings and their children), sharp writing that is by turns funny and truthful, and a fully fleshed-out world (including landscapes and a variety of colorful dragons that blend traits of both mammals and reptiles). The film is being marketed to capitalize on its 3D (which, admittedly, adds a few extra thrills to some scenes), but unlike 'Alice in Wonderland' (so sorely lacking in pathos, style, and humor), 'Dragon' is so strong on its own merits that the effect enhances the existing story, rather than becoming the sole reason for viewing.",7,1,3,28 April 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," repellent, unsettling, oppressive, articulate, and fascinating
","Being a connisseur of extreme cinema, I can say that my stomach was twisted into knots during the 2 hours I spent watching 'Salo.'  I'd heard only vague sentiments relating to its controversy, but was intrigued all the same.  If you think movies like 'Beyond the Darkness' or 'Cannibal Holocaust' are extreme in their unflincing portrayal of human savagery, give 'Salo' a try. A horror film that is made all the more frightening because the monsters committing the atrocities are flesh-and-bone, and the victims being savaged are so young and virginal.  The film presents a world (a castle where a handful of fascists have enlisted a group of youths as sex slaves) that is not pleasant, nor one the viewer would want to visit again, necessarily, but I found myself with an overwhelming appreciation of life itself once the film faded up white at the end.  Pasolini's directoral style is transfixing, even during the display of contemptible, tasteless acts; his writing, too (I'm sort of relieved to discover this film was based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade) is articulate and stimulating as it comes from the mouths of his unredeemable fascists. Reactionary viewers need not bother with 'Salo,' but those looking for something both unsettling and intellectually stimulating will be held captive by the experience.7/10",7,1,4,22 September 2003
Limitless," Well Within Limits
","It's frustrating when any work of art -- be it an album of music, a novel, a painting, or a film -- carries a distinct yet maddeningly unplaceable sense of familiarity; when its sources and inspirations bubble exceedingly close to the surface without ever really showing their faces, as if embarrassed by what has been done with their influence. 'Limitless' is a film fraught with such familiarity, and as a result, comes nowhere near matching its title. The plot involves disheveled, would-be writer Eddie Mora (the reliably charismatic Bradley Cooper), who has a run-in with a long-unseen cohort, who hooks him up with a transparent, dime-sized drug called NZT. After his first tab, Eddie plows through his novel and becomes a sudden fountain of once-untapped knowledge (the aim of the drug is to free up all the unused, inaccessible space in the human brain); he makes connections up the societal ladder, and eventually uses his expanded headspace to...wait for it...play the Stock Market and make himself filthy rich. This leads him to a position of grace with a powerful corporate mogul played by Robert De Niro (on default mode, as is usually the case these days). As one might predict, what goes up must come down, and the demands of NZT eventually cause Eddie to run afoul of some time-filling Russian mobsters who serve no real purpose other than to shoehorn some overly contrived, plot-desperate conflict into the proceedings. As directed by Neil Burger, 'Limitless' is pulp, plain and simple -- alternating between bizarrely jokey voice-over narration, some very cool (if narratively disposable) 'rollercoaster' shots, and dour sermons on the side effects of addiction, all while culminating in an ending that favors convenience over believable logic.",4,5,8,6 April 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Not surprisingly, Kubrick continues to herd sheep from the grave...
","After over a year of production, Stanley Kubrick came up with a final bone to throw at the slobbering sycophants--er, FANS--who elevated him to a godlike position among filmmakers.  With 'Eyes Wide Shut,' the director's sterile, detached style reaches an unfathomable low, as he literally sucks potential vigor and excitement out of his own movie during its 159-minute transfusion.  Therefore it is hard to blame the actors for the film's lack of importance (and interest)--neither Tom Cruise nor Nicole Kidman can feign drunkenness (or other highs) convincingly, and their performance as husband and wife feels uncomfortably self-conscious.  It doesn't speak too well for Kubrick when his best-staged scenes involve Alan Cumming and Sydney Pollack embarking on expositionary monologues when he gets bored with ogling his bland stars.  The director's death only helped fuel the hype about 'Eyes,' but the perceptive viewer won't find much to get excited over--every inch of the female anatomy is lovingly examined during the much-ballyhooed orgy scene, yet is drawn-out, numbing, and base compared to something like 'Blue Velvet' or 'Crash.'  The pretext for Cruise's descent into the baroque sexual underworld--Kidman's admission of an 'erotic' daydream--is rather improbable, resulting in a weak payoff in the last act.  Granted, there are some moments that hooked me in, but the trance was only fragmentary.  To many, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was interpreted as a fitting epitaph for a great director--to me, it just amplified an overrated one.4.5/10",5,1,2,28 June 2003
Inside Man," Potentially great thriller gets lost amid an aimless civics lesson
","In Jan De Bont's 1994 action extravaganza 'Speed,' he pitted Keanu Reeves and a busload of ethnic/social/economic stereotypes against a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper); it was a taut, intense, and breezily implausible ride that didn't leave the viewer pondering much afterward. On initial glance, Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' is another concoction in the mold of De Bont's film, but is undermined by the director's unleashed tendency to prod us with a civics lesson. While this is the kind of thing you expect from a glorified After-School Special like 'Crash,' it does not help along an alleged thriller...as a matter of fact, every time Lee brings a new ethnic stereotype into the fray, the film comes to a screeching halt because his technique is so heavy-handed (the racist patrolman; the busty Albanian translator; the Muslim who natters endlessly about his turban). The result is a film of diffused intensity through and through--which is a shame, because its setup promises something very cool: Clive Owen plays a crafty extortionist who takes over a branch of a Manhattan bank with his masked, hooded partners; bank head Christopher Plummer is extremely concerned about the contents of a safe-deposit box inside; Jodie Foster is enlisted as an impartial 'fixer' to negotiate things with Owen. Meanwhile, Denzel Washington reprises his 'flawed-yet-resourceful cop' role, trying to figure out Owen's motivation...which, to the film's credit, is unique. The leads turn in good--if rather typical--performances, and the cinematography puts us within the action very well...but 'Inside Man''s suspense is constantly thwarted by a manufactured look and some of the most artificial supporting characters ever put on-screen. That, and Lee's aforementioned perpetuating of the racial divide at the expense of story and thrills...well, it makes one long for the summer of '94, when 'Speed' delivered entertaining action, sans a political agenda.5.5 out of 10",6,2,4,24 November 2006
Zombieland," Woody of the Dead
","For a guy who's portrayed a mass-murdering psychopath (in 'Natural Born Killers') and went head-to-head with mass murderer Anton Chigurh (in 'No Country for Old Men'), it's anyone's guess as to why Woody Harrelson--he of the perpetual cowboy hat and hickly typecasting--was never enlisted to play the role of undead-whompin' good-'ol boy before. Rest easy, friends: in 'Zombieland,' that dream is fulfilled, and all is now right with the world. Woody plays Tallahasse, a grizzled zombie hunter plowing across the highways of America to make it to his namesake (and also find a Twinkie along the way, if possible); in his travels, he meets neurotic dweeb Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, who is really cornering the market on this character type), whose obsessive tendencies and notepad of 'rules' has kept him alive; also on board are Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin--'Little Miss Sunshine'), two sisters with their own tough-love survival instincts, who even add a little romantic tension to the mix. True to its title, 'Zombieland' knows the character types and conventions of the genre, and expects the audience to, as well: this is a film that plunges us into a world gone to walking-dead hell, and--in the vein of the 'Scream' films--knows the clichés that accompany such a scenario, to the point where the surviving inhabitants are pretty jaded toward it all. Director Ruben Fleischer creates a convincingly apocalyptic landscape, and even mines some passages of suspense and rip-roaring action to accompany the laughs, courtesy of Rhett Reese's and Paul Wernick's script. While 'Shaun of the Dead' might have beaten 'Zombieland' to the punch as far as undead satires/homages are concerned, it's hard to top the thrill of seeing Woody Harrelson pluck strings on a banjo (pretty badly, I might add) to the theme of 'Deliverance' to draw overweight zombies out of a supermarket aisle.",7,1,2,11 October 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Funny...vulgar...with a beat you can dance to
","For those who loved 'Wayne's World'...'The Blues Brothers'...and hell, even 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' you will find much to like (but probably not love) in 'Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny,' a fictional epic about the formation of the JB (Jack Black)/KG (Kyle Gass) band. Two out-of-work losers with a love for rock n'roll are met with a dilemma when KG's long-supportive mother stops sending him rent checks; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a sage music-store clerk (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the titular pick (a funny animated-tapestry sequence gives the backstory). Along the way, our zeroes encounter a snaggle-toothed stranger (a game Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, stoner security guards, sorority chicks, and Satan himself (an ironically-cast Dave Grohl), in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed (and preferably played at high volume). Rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but 'Pick' is an extremely nice change of pace...it may not go up to 11, but it hums a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired low-brow hilarity. Recommended.6.5 out of 10",7,1,2,27 November 2006
The Departed," A Work of Bloody Genius...One of 2006's Best
","For as much as I fancy myself a connoisseur of cinema, I have never been too heavily interested in auteurs like Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Scorsese--granted, they have made some films I've enjoyed, but on the whole, I lack the (seemingly mandatory) obsessive critical enthusiasm for their works overall. But 'The Departed' (a surprising remake of a Japanese original) is the type of film that might finally inspire me to peer into Scorsese's extensive backcatalog.'The Departed,' in addition to telling a story that's deceptively simple on first glance, but brilliantly twisted with complication as it progresses, also succeeds in assembling a cast at the tops of their respective games. The film actually deserves its biggest accolade for convincing me (finally) that Leonardo DiCaprio is capable of playing an adult role without a hint of the sappy, sentimental 'Titanic' baggage that's long stigmatized him in my eyes (when his undercover agent roughs up two hoods in a convenience store, we buy it completely). Similarly, Matt Damon--who's often seemed like a pretty-boy recycling the same character--has a fine turn as a cop who's corrupt to the bone, whose long-standing relationship with Jack Nicholson's Bostonian mob kingpin only drags him further down. Parallels to 'The Score'--the 2001 heist flick that united Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton--are not out of place, but 'The Departed' is more than a cinematic stunt revolving around a twist ending while the actors show their chops; there is a sincere, wrenching intrigue and dramatic force propelling this ride. Scorsese's implications--as we've seen in 'GoodFellas' and 'Taxi Driver'--are shattering, and 'The Departed' is no exception.While the plot is intricate and I probably couldn't spoil it even if I tried, it is only a tiny part of the bigger picture. Scorsese's film might be the best fictionalized portrait of corruption among civil servants since 1997's 'L.A. Confidential,' and the double- and triple-crosses perpetrated by DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson interweave beautifully. While the script has its contrivances--a romantic interlude between DiCaprio and Damon's girlfriend (Vera Farmiga)--Scorsese not only makes us feel that something is truly at stake all the time, but is not afraid to align our sympathies with his corrupt characters at any given time. 'The Departed''s constantly spinning moral compass--and the coordinates it settles upon--is one of the film's major attractions, because it keeps predictability at a minimum.At two and half hours, 'The Departed' is a tightly-paced crime thriller that maintains such strong momentum that its minuscule caveats are easily forgivable. In addition to the wonderful interplay between the three leads, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg also turn in strong supporting work. This is a surprising, enthralling film...one of the year's best.",8,0,0,5 November 2006
Psycho," 'A Standard Rave'
","Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of 'Psycho' when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.And 'Psycho' is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), 'Psycho' remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.) Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that 'Psycho' is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique.",9,6,8,6 November 2006
Rosemary's Baby," A masterpiece of mood
","Like 'The Silence of the Lambs,' 'Rosemary's Baby' is a horror film that is so justifiably praised that it's a pretty futile effort to attempt to find something that hasn't been said about it before, and better. Until recently, it had been many years since I'd seen the film, and upon revisiting it (with a newfound appreciation for director Roman Polanski), was thoroughly impressed.The story is simple and ingenious, and hooks us from the start: Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes) move into an upscale New York apartment complex attract the attention of their kind yet invasive neighbors; shortly after, Rosemary becomes pregnant and grows increasingly concerned that the residents are plotting against her. Polanski would revisit this type of paranoia (albeit through male eyes) in 'The Tenant'; 'Rosemary's Baby' takes a similarly subjective approach to the story, telling it largely through the perspective of the title character--and Mia Farrow is incredibly good at conveying pain, sorrow, fear, and submission.In addition to structuring suspense well, Polanski also gives the film a sense of patriarchal commentary: the husband is cunning, cocky, self-centered, and manipulative; ditto the loathsome Dr. Saperstien (Ralph Bellamy) who insists that Rosemary stop reading books that might cause worry. Throughout the film, Rosemary is presented as a passive, soft-spoken wallflower, easily put in her place by the male figures in her life; even when she uncovers the conspiracy around her, everyone is so firmly pitted against her that her efforts become meaningless in the face of the inevitable. Polanski makes us pity Rosemary and loathe the occult conspirators, but gives us a conclusion that drips of irony from all angles--in a sense, a great injustice is perpetrated, then accepted.With 'Rosemary's Baby,' Polanski delivers a masterpiece of mood and subtle scares without a reliance on blood and guts. Strong performances and a fine story contribute to making this a gem of the genre.",8,5,7,22 April 2006
War of the Worlds," intergalactic road show of antique clichés
","A few years ago, Stephen King's alien-takeover novel 'Dreamcatcher' was transformed into a feature film, meeting with as much success as a 900-page novel condensed to a 2-hour run time could. As a whole, it was uneven, but not without ambition, a brisk pace, and well-drawn characters. This kind of low expectation is quite unusual for a filmmaker of Steven Spielberg's caliber and a screenwriter of David Koepp's skill (ironically, he gave us last year's underrated King adaptation, 'Secret Window'); to combine these two talents for a summer-ready adaptation of H.G. Welles' 'War of the Worlds' must have sounded ideal on paper, and with Tom Cruise leading the cast, how could it possibly fail? I don't know what's more bothersome--that the summer movie season has passed with very few memorable entries (save for 'Land of the Dead' and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'), or that a film as hollow as 'War of the Worlds' is still playing after all this time. Though I suppose its success is no mystery as far as escapist fantasy is concerned--Spielberg's and Cruise's name recognition aside, it is a film that delivers exactly what audiences want--big, fantastic spectacle pixellated with elastic-looking CGI effects. But that's not the problem--I have voluntarily put my brain on the shelf for many summer senses-obliterators (I even enjoyed 'The Rock,' for Christ's sake) that jettisoned plot and character in favor of rapid-fire action and thrills...'War of the Worlds,' however, is such a stilted, empty experience that even the sight of tripods towering over cities and reducing scampering earthlings to ash loses its bite well before the film is over.In a bit of opening narration that seems lifted from a '50s B movie, it is revealed that 'unsympathetic' aliens are gearing up for an attack on our planet because they're so darned jealous of our 'advanced' ways (though watching this movie in advance might have saved them the trouble). This setup is about all the 'plot' we get, thus allowing Spielberg free reign to indulge special effects for the remainder of the film. We are introduced to Ray (Tom Cruise), a divorced, blue-collar dock worker who is given the kids for the weekend--Robbie, the ersatz-rebellious son, and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), the endlessly screeching, wild-eyed daughter. His ex-wife is pregnant with #3 and married to a well-dressed, clean-shaven #2. Cruise's house, intended to reflect his 'neglectful father' persona, is messy and cluttered, with a refrigerator full of spoiled food. After some teeth-gnashingly clichéd 'bonding time' with his children, we witness a bizarre electrical storm that stops all magnetic devices (but has no effect on digital cameras!), followed by an introduction to the tripods that is admittedly awe-inspiring.Unlike 'Signs,' where a martian invasion didn't overwhelm the human story, and in a way became an extension of it, 'War of the Worlds' insists on cramming 'family values' down our throat. Sure, those aliens are nasty buggers, but the story is really about a Father Trying To Better Himself In The Face Of Impending Doom, and the triteness of this is not helped by an unconvincing Tom Cruise (who is driven to murder at one point) or Dakota Fanning's shrill daughter (she serves as a great argument against procreation, however). Tim Robbins shows up halfway through in a pointless role that echoes his 'Mystic River' shtick, but gives Cruise an opportunity to show some Fatherly Courage. When son Robbie inexplicably heads into the military mêlée on a hillside, only to show up without a scratch at film's end, is an infuriating, cheap (and illogical) attempt to milk some feel-good tears. In a film where we're left staring at the increasingly uninteresting tripods or the sappy familial drama, we quickly run out of things to hold our interest (when, in the best-case scenario, all aspects of a movie should envelop the audience completely) and devolve into a chorus of 'Is it over yet? Is it over yet...?' At least in 'Mars Attacks!' the badness of the overall product was part of the fun. In 'War of the Worlds,' we are asked to suspend disbelief as the tripods descend a hillside toward a farmhouse where Robbins, Cruise, and Fanning are hiding. Why it seems to take days for the tripods to arrive is anyone's guess. More questionable is why the martians, who level cities without a second thought, inspect the farmhouse with a tentacled 'eye' and snoop around the basement where our heroes are hiding--in addition to them looking for antiques to sell on the intergalactic market, the answer is obvious: the scene kills some time, and allows our handsome protagonist to keep living (this can also be applied to Cruise's uncanny skill in avoiding the path of lasers during the opening attack). After all, nobody--the producers most of all--wants a bankable star like Tom Cruise to be felled by martians, unless it's in a softly-lit, dramatic sequence that might earn a nod from The Academy.To his credit, Spielberg busily dresses scenes with lots of visual flair, as if to compensate for the clunky script, but his efforts aren't enough (the film looks grimy and unappealing). Also, the constant references to 9/11 and terrorism come off as a cheap attempt to lend the story some modern-day relevance (it worked a lot better in 'Land of the Dead,' man). Though 'War of the Worlds' has moseyed toward a generous box office take, it's a hollow ride, with thrills that aren't thrilling, characters that inspire no sympathy, and visual ingenuity that inspires more yawns than gasps. By the end, I was nostalgic for the cinematic junk food of 'Dreamcatcher,' 'Signs,' 'Mars Attacks!' and 'Independence Day'... Okay, maybe not 'Independence Day,' but you get the idea...",4,1,1,13 August 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," 'Infinite' Digress
","From the slickly-animated opening titles to the hipster-jukebox soundtrack selections to the casting of Michael Cera as the neurotic hipster-kid who just can't let go of his manipulative bitch of an ex-girlfriend, 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' sets out to be the 'Juno' of 2008, but falls short of entertainment...and substance. While overrated (particularly in Roger Ebert's glowing review), the latter film was a tricky balancing act of aching-to-be-hip dialog and seemingly loose characterization that, surprisingly, worked its way inside-out to leave an endearing, heartfelt impression; the energetic and caustic lead performance by Ellen Page didn't hurt, either. While 'Nick and Norah' pines for the same audience (and will likely get it), its shallow story (two star-crossed, would-be lovers exchange missed signals under the New York City skyline over a night-long search for a show by underground rockers Where's Fluffy) is all about pretty faces and surface qualities; the cast is attractive, but the characters never feel more than two-dimensional (and some are simply grating), and most attempts to elicit an emotional response from the audience come from dishonest manipulation (preferably by some swelling, low-key ballad on the soundtrack). That Nick (Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings), the star-crossed, would-be lovers in question, hook up by night's end goes without saying; it's the artificial roadblocks that stand in their way that make the film tedious amid some genuine laughter and emotion. It's not bad, but certainly not inspired, especially standing in a shadow as immense as 'Juno.' 5.5 out of 10",6,4,5,4 March 2009
30 Days of Night," Just drink your blood and shut up!
","It is with day-glo irony that one character in '30 Days of Night' makes an offhand reference to cinema's penultimate bloodsucking actor, Bela Lugosi. While the original Universal 'Dracula' remains the cornerstone of cinematic vampire lore, the way of the mythic creatures has gone into hyperdrive in the last few years, most visibly in the 'Underworld' series. Yes, it seems that vampires just aren't that interesting anymore, unless they're screeching, howling, hurtling through the air at great speed, and outfitted with the latest in repulsive denture prosthetics.Director David Slade, who began his career directing music videos before graduating to features with last year's overrated 'Hard Candy,' does an impressive job establishing a bleak visual tone in the small community of Barrow, Alaska. Throughout the movie, the chilly atmosphere was so convincing it kept an ice-cold grip on my spinenot since John Carpenter's 'The Thing' has isolation been established with such bone-chilling desperation.'30 Days'attempts an alchemy on a stagnant movie monster with only marginal success, since the script (co-written by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson) really isn't up to snuff. We get a few main characters who are defined just enough (in admittedly cliché parts) to earn our sympathy, followed by maybe a dozen supporting characters who exist A) solely to be picked off; or B) recite monologues we couldn't possibly care about before getting picked off. A big no-no in horror films is trying to give bit players depth when their demise is nigh. In the meantime, a lot of the humans' actions are Fright Film 101 stuff, running the gambit from simple clichés (at least half the movie is spent asking who/what the vampires are) to the idiotic (grandfather flees hiding place, possibly blowing the other survivors' cover; grandson dutifully follows after, yelling after gramps). Similar territory was covered more intelligently, and with a keener awareness of genre convention, in Carpenter's 'Thing.' While Slade is very good at establishing setting and mood, his choices in technique can be jarring. There are at least a half-dozen cuts away from (and into) action that is given no specific setting, nor any real setup (an early 'home invasion' scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere is a good example). Also indicative of the past decade of horror is an over-reliance on chaotic, 'Saving Private Ryan'-style edits whenever a vamp attacks, which is more disorienting than exciting.Now, I grant you, all of these qualms could very well be peripheral if the movie delivers on its blood-sucking baddies, but '30 Days'' most glaring misstep (and it is pure, graphic-novel flaw) is in turning our gang of black-suited vamps into periodic philosophers who strut around like smug Goth kids with blood on their chins. Every time fang-king Marlow (Danny Huston) paused to deliver a subtitled line in his guttural vampire-language, I nearly rolled my eyes in disbelief. I kept thinking, 'You're ruining itjust suck your blood and shut up!' The other vamps screech and howl and get the requisite 'snarling close-ups' as they feast on some poor sucker's neck. Ho hum.While Josh Hartnett and Melissa George do an admirable job of propping up their underwritten roles (they're an estranged couple, and you know the rest), their efforts, combined with Slade's eye for visuals, cannot raise '30 Days' to the level of a modern vampire classic. No matter how it's presented, a plot about vaguely-defined characters holing up in buildings for an indefinite period is nothing new. Which is a shame, since '30 Days' clearly had the potential to set a new genre benchmark.5.5 out of 10",6,14,27,5 November 2007
There Will Be Blood," Tainted Blood
","(Spoilers ahoy.) Regular viewers of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup should be familiar with the grotesque, hilariously offensive parody show 'Robot Chicken.' A recurring in-joke involves director M. Night Shyamalan ('The Sixth Sense') popping up periodically to make the following declaration: 'What a twist!' And while I'll be the first to admit that narratively desperate films that trot out manufactured twists bother me very little (maybe since something like 'Saw IV' has nowhere to go but down in the first place), films like 'The Prestige' (which twisted me into cold indifference) and Paul Thomas Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'films of no small qualitywound up diminishing my overall high opinion of them.Yet before I get around to the closing 30 minutes of 'Blood,' in which an otherwise sturdy narrative becomes unhinged, let me comment on the first 120.I had never seen a PT Anderson film before this, so I came in with a bit of skepticism. I tend to be wary of films that get released late in the year for the sole purpose of unleashing the torrents of critical praise and opening the Oscar-nod floodgates (even more prominent with the Coen Brothers' 'No Country for Old Men'), but 'There Will Be Blood' kept me engrossed quite well. Despite the lengthy run time, the film itself doesn't feel long, and the lush cinematography (by Robert Elswit) and dusty locationsplus fine attention to costume and set designproperly evokes the physical look and technique of the early classics of cinema. This is one of the most unassuming, understated 'epic' films I've ever seen, with machinations so subtle that periodic revelations hit with bruising force.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil-driller at the turn of the 20th Century who quickly rises to riches and notoriety. He's driven, and makes up for his lack of persuasive skills with a shrewd cleverness that only underlines his bitter hatred and disgust toward humanityat one point, he's negotiating with the railroad managers and wonders what he'll do with even more riches. Plainview has a band of trusted workers, and trots his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), along to his meetings with clients and townsfolk. Early on, Plainview is approached by Eli Sunday (Paul Dano'Little Miss Sunshine'), who claims to know of a place rich with oil, and will guide the driller to it, for a price. As it turns out, Eli is the leader of the local dustbowl parish, and quickly unravels into a character whose motivations are as selfish and hypocritical as Plainview's.But Anderson doesn't clue us in all at onceone of the more delectable aspects of 'There Will Be Blood' is a deliberate pace that slowly shades in the characters, turning both Plainview and Sunday into individuals who undergo change in a variety of ways, for good and ill, while keeping the underlying motivations obscured. This understated battle of wits is sustained quite well for the film's first two hours, as is the awkward relationship between Plainview and his curiously remote, unusually mature son.Unfortunately, 'There Will Be Blood' slips into the same territory that undid 'The Prestige' in its final minutes. I don't know what has compelled talented filmmakers to gravitate toward the 'What a twist!' mentality in the past decade, especially when their story lines are so solid that a twist could do nothing less than diminish the value of what has gone one before. The initial twist in 'Blood'involving Plainview's sonis actually fairly predictable, and while it does illuminate certain scenes that occurred years before, it is established and hastily dismissed (its failing being that I ultimately didn't buy it as a natural narrative progression). Almost immediately after, there is a confrontation between Sunday (who has since become a successful religious commentator) and Plainview that layers on the pop-psychology double-entendres until both Dano and Day-Lewis erupt in a fracas of method histrionics. The scene itself is rather laboriously set up, with Sunday's appearance functioning merely for plot closure, and the final fight we have been waiting to see all along.That being said, 'There Will Be Blood' does possess passages of such raw purity and beauty that the film is, for a bulk of its run time, genuinely spellbinding. The performances are spot-on, with Day-Lewis carrying the film as the type of bitter bastard who would usually make 2+ hours feel like an eternity; Dano is the more understated foil, giving a performance of quiet grace and wickedness. And as a whole, it is simply beautiful to look at. While allusions can no doubt be drawn between 'Blood' and America's current foreign-policy mess, I was so captivated by the film that I barely considered it.7.5 out of 10",8,2,6,3 February 2008
Army of Darkness," I've now seen all three 'Evil Dead' movies...
","...and for the life of me, I don't understand their appeal.  Which is bizarre, because they're almost designed to be right up my alley.  I love Lucio Fulci and the slapstick horrors of Peter Jackson ('Dead Alive') and Stuart Gordon ('Re-Animator' is a masterpiece).  But Sam Raimi's films never did much for me.  In each installment of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy, he seems to be trying too hard--one-upping himself constantly in terms of horror and humor, but with neither of those elements being very strong to begin with. 'Army of Darkness' is the third installment in the trilogy, a film that thinks it's a lot funnier and scarier than it really is.  Most of the time, Raimi wants to covey, as loudly as possible, 'ISN'T THIS HILARIOUS? IT'S OH-SO OVER-THE-TOP!' when, in reality, it's not.  Special effects eventually take over the meager plot.  Bruce Campbell is a capable leading man who gives the material his all, but he's mostly reduced to uttering hit-or-miss one-liners.  Sam Raimi may have a cult reputation for these films, but there's a reason his recent, non-horror output ('A Simple Plan' comes to mind) has been better: it's balanced and controlled.4/10",4,2,7,2 April 2003
Stranger Than Fiction," Good...could have been great
","Twist Endings have always faded in and out of popularity over the decades...recent movies, from 'The Usual Suspects' to 'Fight Club' to the first 'Saw,' usually bank on a curveball in the last act that aims to redeem something seemingly conventional with a forehead-slapping plot development. In the world of 'Stranger Than Fiction,' the 'twist' is done with such earnestness and honesty that part of me felt bad in not completely accepting it; there is a palpable dramatic swell, after which we cut away to What Really Happened. I guess any movie that casts Will Ferrell as a bland-as-cardboard IRS auditor looking to seize the life he's wasted deserves some consideration, especially in its third-act machinations. Ferrell plays the painfully-named William Crick, who lives a life of routine (counting teeth-brushing strokes, for instance), until one day he begins to hear a woman narrating his life (including a budding relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaal); turns out he's unwittingly become the main character in reclusive author Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) new novel. The catch? Eiffel's lead character always dies. While 'Fiction' is modest in its exploration of existential matters, the randomness of its premise comes off as gimmicky; while director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland') keeps things moving along with a sense of purpose (though the superimposed diagrams that occasionally flash on-screen are a distracting miscalculation), Zach Helm's screenplay barely rises above convention. Ultimately, 'Fiction' is a case of the performances really selling the material: Ferrell is quite good in a quietly funny and believably dramatic role; Gyllenhaal is plucky and spunky as his love interest; Thompson communicates a wonderfully wiggy, stress-fried persona; and Dustin Hoffman shines as literature professor who helps Harold with his predicament.",6,0,1,11 October 2007
The Green Mile," a rich, elegant adaptation
","I haven't read the book, but watching the 'The Green Mile,' it's quite obvious that Stephen King has matured as an author, and with that maturity his books have earned more respect, and as a result, the adaptations of his work are getting better and better.  Who would've thought a film adapted from a King novel would ever be nominated for an Academy Award?  The movie is mesmerizing, complete with impassioned performances (which, at times, veer into schmaltz), impressive set design, and a very involving script with a surprisingly humane and emotional core.  It may be over 3 hours long, but it passes by like 15 minutes.  See it and be moved.8/10",8,0,1,25 January 2003
The Wrestler," The Comeback Kid
","There is something undeniably haunting about Mickey Rourke's performance in 'The Wrestler,' to the point where, a week after having watched the film, nuances and lines still stick in my mind. Excepting 'The Fountain,' the films of Darren Aronofsky have had a similarly lingering effect on my conscience, but more so in their aesthetic presentation (culminating in the shrewd technical dexterity of visual effects). And 'The Wrestler' is founded on subject matter (a downbeat tale of a pro's descent into obsolescence) that echoes the clinically detailed stories of 'Pi' (a mathematical character piece by way of Polanski) and 'Requiem for a Dream' (a tale of street-smart junkies and their individual spirals into addiction and degradation). Considering my lack of familiarity toward Rourke's past notoriety and his filmography in general (counting 'The Wrestler,' I've only seen four of his films), I can fairly objectively say that his performance is what largely buoys the film overallwhile Robert Siegel's script tends to be episodic and fragmented (and Aronofsky cuts it together like a string of vignettes), it never forgets its focus, as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is prevalent in every scene, the camera stalking him wherever he goes (not unlike a festering tabloid camera looking for a story). 'The Wrestler' is filled with deliberate anachronisms, from the authentic New Jersey locales (that look efficiently frozen in the mid-1980s), the use of an 8-bit Nintendo system (as Randy plays a game based on his celebrity), the VHS tapes Randy and his faded contemporaries sell at a depressing 'convention,' and a soundtrack populated exclusively by eighties hair metal bands. Rourke manifests his role with grace and a burdensome sadness; his attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood)a subplot that sometimes feels forcedcome across as emotionally genuine, a man trying to make amends even though he realizes it's a losing battle. Marisa Tomei also shines as an aging stripper who is struggling with her own obsolescence as the world turns its eyes to the young and vigorous.",7,0,0,19 March 2009
Inception," Row Row Row Your Boat...
","I knew it was coming, and by the final frame of 'Inception' my strongest reaction was a compulsion to watch it all over again; and this was something of a resentful feeling, as the motivator was not to witness its stunning visuals synthesized in a tight narrative, but to simply make SENSE of the narrative as it shoots off into increasingly difficult directions (even within the illogic of the Dream-World our characters inhabit for most of the film). Since his indie breakout 'Memento,' writer/director Christopher Nolan has ascended the ranks of major Hollywood filmmaking, injecting his work with a sense of wonder and intelligence; yet like 'The Dark Knight' (a great, yet somewhat flawed film) my feelings toward 'Inception' (those I can clearly rationalize, that is) wind up a few notches below where I believe they should be. While the film -- centered around a group of 'dream hackers' (headed by Leonardo DiCaprio) looking to plant an idea in a corporate heir's (Cillian Murphy) headspace -- has its share of visually stunning setpieces and fascinating ideas (it's nice to see some Jungian concepts get their toes wet -- if not immersed -- here), the ultimate result is overlong, overindulgent, and marked by distracting, unsatisfying diversions (the prime offender being the haunted, memory-based relationship between DiCaprio and wife Marion Cotillard) and leaden exposition that completely deadens a sometimes-glacial pace. And for a film about dreams and their origin in the mind, Nolan's action-movie transitions come across as counterintuitive: instead of reminding us of the jagged inconsistency and incoherence of dreams, the jerky cutting merely comes across as...well, just incoherent (which becomes particularly tiresome when the film dissolves into dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream action-movie territory in the final act). 'Inception' is most fascinating in its first hour, which lays the ground rules of dream-logic and how dream-worlds 'work'; once it settles into the main plot, it derails somewhat, and it soon becomes clear that Nolan, in his attempt to not only dazzle, thrill, and stimulate the collective consciousness of the viewer, but build on the astronomical expectations established by 'The Dark Knight,' has a reach that far surpasses his grip.",6,5,14,19 July 2010
Lord of War," generally entertaining, but overly familiar territory...
","If it were the only film of its kind, 'Lord of War' would probably play out a lot better than it does; not to say it's a bad film--not in the least. The semi-factual story is suspenseful, engaging, dramatically convincing, and occasionally witty. Writer-director Andrew Niccol's tale revolves around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukranian who emigrates to America only to discover his true calling lies in supplying arms to third-world countries; Jared Leto plays his coke-addict brother, who provides an occasional assist; Bridget Moynihan is Yuri's trophy wife; the underutilized Ian Holm is a fellow dealer; and Ethan Hawke enters periodically as a persistent Interpol agent out to apprehend Orlov. With a fine cast and a lot of stunning visual ingenuity, Niccol has a seemingly infallible formula for success. Unfortunately, 'Lord of War' quickly reminds us that we've been down this road before, joining such embellished, voiced-over productions as 'Goodfellas' (a young man's rise to Mafia power) and 'Blow' (a young man's rise to international cocaine dealing) as a moralistic, 'rags-to-riches-through-illegal-means' story with a script that just isn't distinguished enough. The sentimental material between Orlov and his wife could have easily been excised, as it feels contrived and unnecessary (I would have preferred more time spent with the characters played by Leto and Hawke). As it stands, 'Lord of War' is a sleek, interesting thriller with great visual flair and fine performances, but all too quickly becomes self-indulgent as it putters toward the 2-hour mark.",6,0,2,19 February 2006
WALL·E," Wall-E: Rise of the Machines
","I don't make any excuses for it, but I am pretty resilient toward the wave of computer-animated films that has come to dominate our post-millennial cinematic experiencecall me old-fashioned, but I grew up with reruns of Looney Tunes, Saturday-morning cartoons, and theatrical releases done solely via cell animation. Appreciation of animation is a cross-generational phenomenon that has become more diverse with the ushering-in of computer technologyplots contain enough colorful, slapstick humor to entertain the kids, but also a fair share of mature, witty writing to amuse their guardians. Yet still, I have never really gone out of my way to view these CG-rendered productions, and have always relied on the persuasion of others to give this emerging technique a chance.With 'Wall-E,' I may be sold on computer animation for the first time everthis is the kind of movie that justifies the extra wait in line on a major holiday.Being Pixar, 'Wall-E' is preceded by a short (entitled 'Presto!') that is aimed squarely at the 10-and-unders sitting in the audience: the tale of a magician's rabbit going to extreme lengths to get his owner to cough up a carrot. It is five minutes of madcap, frenetic amusement that is funnier in concept than its ultimately overachieving execution. If anything, it only helped raise my guard for the feature presentation.'Wall-E' begins on a note of stunning minimalismthe image of an abandoned Planet Earth, home only to the robot of the title (think 'Short Circuit' meets 'E.T.') and his best friend, a chirping (and adorable) cockroach. Wall-E's function? To compact all the leftover trash (and there's a lot of it) into cubes. The opening scenes convey a sense of isolation and awe (literal skyscrapers of junk), and immediately garner sympathy for our likable (if frequently Woody Allen-ish) protagonist, who has a storage unit filled with his own fascinating finds (including a VHS tape of 'Hello Dolly!'). Living a life of routine, Wall-E (whose 'voice' is limited to a few robotic-sounding words) becomes smitten with a mysterious robot named Eve, whose objective may be the key to reviving a planet that, as we're told, has been unoccupied by humanity for 700 years.While ostensibly an animated feature aimed at kids, the surprising thing about 'Wall-E' is how its wide-ranging mash-up of cinematic genres and films synthesizes into such a fresh, original whole: while Wall-E and Eve may owe a debt to German Expressionism (Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' in particular), their homage to a cinematic era when no spoken dialog was required to move audiences to tears, is remarkably effective and well-rendered (the early courtship scenes even recall classics like 'City Lights'). And additionally, some later moments on a massive spaceship recalls the lunatics-running-the-asylum spirit of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (only with robots). Granted, writer-director Andrew Stanton inserts an incisive (if anvil-heavy) satire on our Wal*Mart-fixated culture of consumption, and keenly wonders if we've lost touch with the very acts that make us human; it only adds to the irony that, amid his attempts to save the world, Wall-E is really just a persistent romantic, looking to snare the woman he loves by any means necessarythe endless pursuit of the blue-collar, working-class male to win over a beautiful woman whose career won't let her slow down for romance.It makes for one of the most moving motion pictures I've seen in a while.",7,3,10,5 July 2008
Halloween," It'll leave you screaming for gore...
","It's hard for me to gush about 'Halloween' like others do...even seeing it during its recent nationwide, two-night engagement in a tiny theater jam-packed with college-age couples didn't much change my opinion of the film. While hailed as a masterpiece by the likes of Siskel and Ebert (among others, circa 1978), I can't say I've ever really understood why. It's not a 'bad' film, but it ultimately isn't all that good, either. The reason, and perhaps this is just my 25-years-later, misinformed opinion, but 'Halloween' is just too damn SUBTLE for its own good. While I am of the notion that subtlety and atmosphere can produce more scares than gore (check out 'Carnival of Souls'), director John Carpenter takes it to such a level that his shortcomings become painfully apparent. The chilly Midwestern setting sets an appropriate mood, and the scenes with the late Donald Pleasance possess an effective fearfulness; Carpenter knows how to frame a great shot (the scene of Michael Myers standing behind a tree watching his future prey is a fine example), and his score is minimalist and spooky. Unfortunately, the dialog is trite to the point of tedium (generic girl-talk from the girls; vague 'evil-speak' from Pleasance) and the characters are so ill-developed that it's hard to get excited, scared, or upset at their eventual demise. And it comes to a point where all the declamatory musical cues hinder the scares instead of heightening them; it's as if Carpenter had little confidence in his scares working on their own merits, and inserted the 'stingers' to make it blatantly obvious. Personally, I think Carpenter scored more successfully with 'Assault on Precinct 13' and post-'Halloween' efforts like 'Christine' and 'Prince of Darkness.' After that long laundry list of complaints, there are some tidbits of quality to be seen: a young Jamie Lee Curtis, well-cast as The Final Girl; the subtle menace of Myers, when shown, is effective; Carpenter's establishment of the 'indestructible killer' clichÃ©; and during its most suspenseful parts, the director does put us on the edge of our seats. The widescreen print I viewed recently presented information I'd never seen in any of the cropped VHS releases (including Michael Myers ascending the staircase at the very end), which was cool. And watching it in the theater allowed me the pleasure to imagine that great ending being the ABSOLUTE end, and that no other sequels ever came about (it's a pity reality dictates otherwise). 'Halloween' is well-made and highly influential, but in all honestly, its imitators ('Friday the 13th') and predecessors ('Psycho') hold more entertainment value.",6,1,5,6 November 2006
Despicable Me," A Fiendish Delight
","Gru (voiced with faux-eastern-Euopean gravitas by Steve Carell) is a nefarious Supervillain in the midst of crisis: a younger nemesis named Vector (voiced by 'Freaks and Geeks' alum Jason Segel) is stealing his fiendish thunder, his most recent acquisition being a Shrink Ray. In order to engender the good faith necessary in the bank that gives Gru loans to carry out his schemes (even Supervillains aren't immune to the bureaucratic red tape we normal citizens must contend with), he adopts three precocious orphan girls to unwittingly aid in his scheme to steal the moon, a heist so astronomical it will place him back at the top of the Supervillain ladder. That's 'Despicable Me,' in a nutshell. Yet the film is so richly textured (in both its exquisite animation and storytelling) that it becomes something transcendent of the usual doldrums of summer popcorn fodder. The character arcs are well-executed, the gadgets and gizmos are awesome to behold, and the eventual tenderness that seeps into Gru's dark heart is affecting without being sappy. As for Gru's squeak-uttering, cyclopean yellow 'minions'--they're a riot, adding an extra layer of slapstick humor to the proceedings. With so much overuse and abuse of the 3D medium as of late (with the cynical cash-grabs of 'Clash of the Titans' and 'The Last Airbender' being the most high-profile), it is refreshing to see it used so well in 'Despicable Me'--it is a visual feast that helps bring its underlying emotions into even sharper focus.",8,5,10,10 July 2010
1408," Escalating nightmare will 'torture' you with old-fashioned horror goodness
","Within a summer movie climate piled high with stagnant garbage (hello, threequels!), critical darlings I cannot fathom (have aliens removed everyone's mind in order to make 'Knocked Up' a success?), and horror offerings that all but beg for the genre to be put to sleep (goodbye, 'Hostel: Part II'!), '1408' is like the chilled (and I do mean CHILLED) lemonade that hits the spot on a particularly hot day.That being said, it should be made clear that the film is based on a short story by Stephen King, whose screen adaptations have grown finer (and more high-profile) over the past decade or so. '1408' is no exception. While screenwriters Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karasewski have added some narrative material to tighten the cinematic aspects of the story (though I must say, the guilt-over-a-lost-child subplot is becoming pretty cliché), it remains incredibly faithful to King's original tale; similarly, the notion of 'supernatural' is made increasingly (and believably) threatening through special effects that manage to frighten with a bare minimum of bloodletting. Like 'Secret Window' a few years back, '1408' is all about building mood through atmosphere and knowledge of character.King's protagonist, Mike Enslin (John Cusack, in a strong lead role), is a writer whose stock and trade is documenting real-life haunts, but has fallen from his former glory. One day, he receives a curious postcard in the mail from the Dolphin Hotel in New York City; with its cryptic warning ('Do not enter 1408'), Mike is enticed to check it out (with the mentality of debunking a tall tale); after a meeting with the discouraging manager Olin (Samuel L. Jackson, lending a tense professionalism to his small role), the writer is left to his own devices in the room, whose history entails 50-some odd deaths. (And the less said about Enslin's stay, the better.) Director Mikael Hafstrom shows definite skill in building suspense and toying with audience expectations--just when our flawed hero appears to be safe out of harm's way, another complication springs up. My only qualm with this tactic is that it wears thin by the end...nevertheless, Hafstrom should be commended for wielding such shopworn clichés as loud musical cues, jump-scares (one of which got me), and creepy noises in a manner that complements the story while escalating the tension. As with other thrillers, like 'Phone Booth' and 'Panic Room,' the confined setting becomes naturally oppressive and suffocating, and the trapped character earns our empathy (if not right away); with '1408,' the details of Enslin's daughter feeds into the dream/nightmare reality of the room itself. While '1408' outstays its welcome slightly, it is one of this summer's more impressive releases, and a chilling meditation on both internal and external demons.",7,0,0,2 July 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," for once, a movie that lives up to all the hype
","I doubt I have much to say in the way of praise for this magnificent film that already hasn't been said better by someone else, so I'll keep this short.  'The Silence of the Lambs' is a film that grips me every time I watch it--an entrancing, mesmerizing experience that sheds the pulp and trashiness usually associated with the horror genre, transcending into a tasteful, terrifying, and wonderfully-acted masterwork.  Jonathan Demme, who started his career making pulpy exploitation, exhibits maturity and confident directoral skill.  It goes without saying that Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is one of the most intelligent, multilayered depictions of a psychotic ever committed to celluloid, and Jodie Foster's twerpy, Southern-fried FBI agent is easily his equal; the understated Ted Levine is also excellent (and underappreciated) as the Ed Gein-ish serial killer who skins his victims.  Basically, if you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for?8/10",8,0,0,16 September 2003
Blade Runner," I just don't get it
","It seems fitting that one of Ridley Scott's most popular movies is about androids, since his body of work is filled with a disproportionate amount of visual flair, and a distinct lack of humanity (see 'Black Hawk Down' or 'Hannibal').  'Blade Runner' scores a slot on my 'Overrated Movie List,' a would-be sci-fi epic with a dash of shallow philosophy thrown in that fails to excite or intrigue in any way.  The plot is a lot like 'The Fugitive,' with super-smart androids in place of humans, and the jaded cop (played by Harrison Ford's hunky monotone) designed to track four of the rogues down. 'Blade Runner' contains its share of stunning visuals (which hold up surprisingly well, even today), but its characters are unappealing (or, in the case of Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah, given little to work with) and the plot, when stripped to its core, is rather thin.5.5/10",7,0,4,22 October 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard: Generations
","Being a die-hard fan of the 'Die Hard' series for as long as I can remember, watching the first installment in 12 years is by turns exhilarating and jarring: 'Live Free or Die Hard' shows just how much the process of cinematic action has changed in such a relatively short period. Whereas we once had stunt-men and creative blocking/editing to successfully deliver the illusion that, yes, that IS Bruce Willis unloading a can of whoop-ass on Alan Rickman's, William Sadler's, and Jeremy Irons' henchmen, we now have technology to deliver increasingly improbable action (not that the action in the previous films was ever very probable) with our bruised, now-bald rock of a hero, John McClane, in the foreground. While this makes the action-sequence ceiling seem limitless, it makes much of 'Live Free''s stunts and set-pieces veer into ridiculousness.And, of course, that is one of the reasons we pay the over-inflated ticket price to watch Bruce do his thing--we know most of the stunts and set-pieces are anything but humanly possible, but we are riveted to the appeal of Willis's Everyman dynamic. In 'Live Free,' our undeterred hero butts heads with Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant--'Go'), a former government worker feeling burned for having his techno-savvy Homeland Security protection program rejected (or something to that effect--does it really matter?); with the ultimate goal of locking down all of America's technology, these Caucasian terrorists (with a female Asian martial-arts expert, and--curiously--French assassins) incite a 'fire sale' that only Willis and techno-geek Matt Farrell (Mac pitchman Justin Long) can stop. As McClane becomes his usual one-man force, Gabriel raises the stakes by kidnapping his daughter, Lucy ('Death Proof' hottie Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The road to the conclusion of this 130-minute monster is paved in carnage, all of which Gabriel claims 'can be fixed' ('On the back of the taxpayer, right?' I mused to myself).Director Len Wiseman, who cut his teeth on the style-heavy 'Underworld' films, seems a rather natural choice for this type of material, which puts action over plot. But his direction is almost too slick for its own good--part of me embraced the uses of CG technology to make the action more urgent and polished, but my inner series purist felt betrayed by a convention that is, quite frankly, overused in cinema today. To 'Live Free''s credit, most of its uses are seamlessly integrated, but when a Harrier Jet is chasing McClane around a winding, elevated highway at the film's climax, the temptation to laugh almost overrides the equally strong urge to gasp. The scene works, but is closer in tone and appearance to Michael Bay than John McTiernan.Which is why I suppose I titled my review 'Die Hard: Generations.' 'Live Free' shows Bruce Willis at the end of his franchise credibility, and while he has plenty of 'yippie-ki-yay' to see him through this entry, the inclusion of Justin Long's ferret-y hacker seems like an attempt to bring in a younger audience. Ditto the use of computers as harbingers of destruction--while taking a less-than-subtle jab at how our lives have been overrun by technology, Long's savvy is more a point of interest for kids weaned on iTunes and pirated programs (whatever happened to the good old days, where terrorists took control of high-rises before the advent wireless networks?). And another dubious nod toward making 'Live Free' palatable to (and viewable by) a younger audience is its PG-13 rating; while the carnage is pretty substantial, it seems as though the filmmakers held back very little in the way of wholesale death--the axiom being, 'you can kill as many generic henchmen as possible in quick edits with no (or little) blood and beat a woman as long as she's an Asian martial-arts expert and get a PG-13, but with more gore and one extra F-bomb, you'd be in R territory.' While the film sated my summer action fix, I wonder why a film that already pushes the barrier of the PG-13 didn't simply venture into R territory anyway (after all, part of the appeal of watching the original trilogy at an impressionable age is seeing stuff we're not 'supposed' to see).The villains of 'Die Hard' have always been part of the key to the series' success, sophisticated yet flawed foils to Willis's distinctly 'mom and apple pie' hero. Thespians like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons had fun playing against type as criminal masterminds of ill intent (but no ill humor), and held their own against the unflappable McClane. Olyphant, by comparison, comes off a bit bland--potentially another 'touch' for the detached generation weaned on Michael Bay; cold and smartly calculating, Thomas Gabriel epitomizes 'The Man'--the soulless computer geek (with a better wardrobe and haircut than his more transparently dorky accomplices) whose Bill Gates-ian demeanor naturally breeds contempt. By the time McClane confronts this terrorist threat, the effect doesn't come off as spectacularly as it has in the past (though the Harrier chase that comes right before is a hard sequence to top).While I have leveled a lot of seeming criticisms against 'Live Free or Die Hard,' I still recommend the film on the basis of its sole purpose: as pure entertainment to pass a lazy summer afternoon. Willis is as tough and appealing as ever, and Long makes a good counterpoint to his grizzled veteran. While not on the same level of the previous films, which valued substance on a level above the superficial (watch the scenes between Reginald VelJohnson and Willis in the original, or those with Samuel L. Jackson in the third to see what I mean) it is certainly worth a look.",6,3,6,12 July 2007
RED," Nothing to blush over
","Sometimes, the mere novelty of an idea can see a movie through the entirety of its run time (for a recent example of this, see the action-star-has-been extravaganza 'The Expendables'); and sometimes, the novelty falls apart well before the movie is over. For its initial hour, 'Red' engenders optimism about where it will ultimately wind up: retired CIA operatives played by Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren find themselves targeted by assassins for unknown reasons. During this introductory period, we are treated to some stunning action setpieces, some amusing (if not always hilarious) character development, and some name actors doing what they do best (Willis, especially, seems to be having a blast playing a parody of the summer action hero he helped create). Director Robert Schwentke stages the action and cross-country story with a kinetic fluidity; it's a shame, then, that the film (adapted from a DC comic, believe it or not) eventually succumbs to the demands of a plot that, by the time it rolls around, feels half-baked an disposable.",5,1,6,26 November 2010
Munich," murky morality, powerful execution
","'Munich' is a pseudo-docu-thriller that is brilliantly stylized and performed, with a rollicking pace that makes its near-three-hour run time pass with surprising efficiency. While this dramatization of the events that followed the massacre of 11 athletes at the 1972 Olympics at Munich is, at heart, rather basic revenge fodder, and its message of 'Who are the REAL terrorists?' is less than profound, Steven Spielberg makes every moment count. Eric Bana is an Israeli leading an innocuous team of everyman 'experts' (one skilled in bookkeeping; another in explosives, etc.) across Europe to search out and kill the masterminds behind the Munich massacre. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the issue at hand is NOT the 'bad men,' but the principle of violence/vengeance itself, and the effects it has on the morality of the individual; Spielberg uses flashbacks of the actual Munich crimes as a simple method of iterating this. The group of men exhibit a heartfelt rapport on par with the company in 'Saving Private Ryan'; the violence is handled in a similar way, with gritty choreography and cringe-inducing sound effects that drive the feeling home. Of all the films that have come out in the wake of 9/11, 'Munich' might be the most attuned to our current attitudes and mentalities, while giving us a fittingly ambiguous answer to the question of violence itself.7.5/10",8,1,2,15 January 2006
Pineapple Express," Less Than Half-Baked
","To Seth Rogen, being Seth Rogen must be a great thing: he starred in the under-appreciated sitcom 'Freaks and Geeks' and was swept up into commercially successful comedies, often featuring much of the ensemble players from the show and guided by the sometimes-astute, sometimes-labored hand of writer/director Judd Apatow. If the likes of 'Knocked Up' and 'Observe and Report' are any indication, America has fallen head-over-banana-peels for this guy...and I just don't get it. 'Pineapple Express' is another entry into the Rogen pantheon (he co-scripted with Evan Goldberg), a film that takes the tired Stoner Comedy to yawnsome new lows. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server who delivers subpoenas to people, has an uber-hot high-school girlfriend (Amber Heard), and spends most of his lazy days in a stoned stupor (typical gag: he calls radio talk-shows complaining about how pot hasn't yet been legalized!), courtesy of supplier Saul (James Franco). But when he witnesses a mob murder while puffing on the titular weed, Dale and Saul are thrown into a half-assed action-movie plot where they are pursued by police, Asian gangsters, and Gary Cole (a fine character actor who deserves much better). For a film that crawls toward the 2-hour mark, 'Pineapple Express' is loaded with filler, and many scenes (a seemingly improvised exchange between Rogen and Franco in the woods early on sets the tedious tone) seem to directly bank on the notion that most of the audience will be too high to tell the difference. More like a second sequel in the 'Harold and Kumar' franchise than an actual comedy, the only thing that goes toward redeeming this remarkably laughless film is the deft direction of David Gordon Green ('Undertow'), who imbues a distinctive sense of style and pace to a less-than-worthy screenplay.",3,2,7,9 September 2009
Sin City," cinematic redemption in a world of 'Sin'...
","In 'Sin City,' director Robert Rodriguez remedies the problem that cripples many a comic-book adaptation: the appeal to reality. While faithful in regard to character and plot, many are too afraid to plumb the depths of a world warped into a full-blown perversion of our own, thus denying the finished product its eyeteeth and turning it into a mere distraction instead of a transformative experience that makes our concept of reality seem pitifully dull by comparison. True to its title, 'Sin City' is a visionary epic rife with content so vicious that its true impact doesn't settle in until the movie is over. Set against a noirish, black-and-white background (with blood appearing as red droplets or inverted white splotches), the film grips you from the first frame and doesn't let go for 2 hours. The random insertion of color seems almost a parody of 'Schindler's List'--red blood, a rainbow of rain splattering a windshield, the yellow gore of a grotesque creature; these details are like traces of reality settling into a fantastic world, awakening the id-controlled demons that lie suppressed in many. These touches infuse 'Sin City' with a dramatic pulse that is complemented by its throwback to 1940s film noir style. When the movie began, I was on my guard and a little defensive about what it might hold--some high-gloss adaptations expend a wealth of stunning visual style, yet are poor in story and character; 'Sin City' is an example of the opposite--while the film follows 3 separate story lines, the main characters are well-drawn, supporting players sparkle, and plots twist with playful frequency. The vignettes consist of a hulk avenging a prostitute's murder; the accidental killing of a crooked cop that threatens a turf war; a detective's quest to save an earlier victim from a psychopath reincarnated as a yellow-faced monster. Contrary to (or perhaps irony inspired by) the film's title, each story suggests a desire to reform that leads to decisions which finally bring about closure, and, in a way, redemption for the characters. Even the narrative gimmick of having the film bookended by an ambiguous character (referred to only as 'The Man' in the closing credits)suggests that the random encounters in our lives account for more than we realize.'Sin City' is Robert Rodriguez's most controlled cinematic work to date; even amid its fantastic chaos, he shows a maturity lacking in his previous films--whereas 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' were as loud and bombastic as they were hollow, 'Sin City' succeeds in moments of quiet reflection, slick voice-over narration, and grizzled facial expressions. The world these flawed characters inhabit is drowned in unpleasantness and death, yet is transfixing in its own hideous beauty--in an era of pulpy, disposable filmed fiction, 'Sin City' lends both comics and cinema fresh credibility. Well done!",8,1,2,10 April 2005
Moon," The Dark Side of 'Moon'
","If Roman Polanski ever considered bringing his trademark obsessions (isolation, paranoia, delusion, hallucination) to the science fiction arena, the result would probably be close to what Duncan Jones achieves with 'Moon,' a deliberately off-kilter study of an astronaut's descent into neuroses and existential delerium. Sam Rockwell (in the first truly outstanding performance I've seen from him) plays Sam Bell, who mans a corporate-owned space station on the moon (its function? to divert environment-sustaining elemental capsules to Earth); in the final 3 weeks of his 3-year commitment to the job, his grip on sanity begins to erode. An automated robot named Gerty 3000 (voiced with chilling lack of emotion by Kevin Spacey) is his sole 'companion' (whose only 'expressions' are confined to creepy Emoticons). The strength of Rockwell's performance is amplified by how convincingly Jones conceives the barren surface of the moon--there are long shots that carry a hauntingly chilling emptiness, and only underline the inner frailty of his protagonist. While 'Moon' certainly isn't for all tastes (its deliberate pace and design seems destined for cult status), adventurous fans of cerebral cinema will find much to like.",7,1,3,15 August 2009
The Runaways," Doesn't Run Far Enough
","A music video director with a stunning visual eye (Marilyn Manson's 'The Beautiful People' being a standout), Floria Sigismondi brings a fitting, drug-hazed 1970s aesthetic to 'The Runaways,' a pseudo-biopic of the the titular, Joan Jett-founded band. Now: I like Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart, and it was their presence (as Cherie Currie and Jett, respectively) that attracted me to this film; and while I appreciate their willingness to add some shades of gray to their resumes, 'The Runaways' doesn't give us much reason to care about these young rock icons who grew up way too fast. Currie is presented as a sweet suburban girl who eventually succumbs to the allure of sex, drugs, and rock n'roll; Jett is brash tomboy with a grizzled edge, and the film's central problem is that these people aren't very likable. Some filmmakers can pull off feats of cinematic gold via the use of morally corrupt and/or apathetic characters (Alex Cox attempted something similar with 'Sid & Nancy'), but Sigismondi's adherence to the lowlights of Currie and Jett renders 'The Runaways' a niche curio that might attain cult status, but never mainstream acceptance (which, come to think of it, is essentially Jett's mantra throughout the film). Also problematic is the film's slavish reliance on generic rock-biopic tropes: we get the disorienting, drugged-out transitions; the moral quandary of Currie's suburban life; the token bi-curious make-out scenes; the obligatory 'break-up' where Jett goes berserk in a recording studio; and a resolution of bittersweet drama, followed by a textual 'Where are they now?' before the credits roll. It's something of a shame: for long stretches, 'The Runaways' had me engaged and visually awestruck (not to mention amused by a wildly over-the-top performance from Michael Shannon), but the nagging notion that I'd been down this road before, and better, left me cold.",5,4,8,17 April 2010
The Breakfast Club," The Way We Were
","There are certain works of literature, cinema, and even television that have to be viewed at a certain crucial point to truly engage on the level they were intended. My first viewing of 'The Breakfast Club' came when I was a high-school senior (at the insistence of my then-girlfriend), and while I didn't see the film as an accurate reflection of any experiences I had had, I certainly liked it. I viewed the film several months later as part of a psychology class I was taking. And now, with high school 8 years in the past, 'The Breakfast Club' plays better than ever. While this quintessential John Hughes snapshot of '80s teens can veer into corny, outdated lingo and other dubious asides (the 'whistling' interlude), the overall effect is no less potent or genuinely intended. The premise is simple: 5 seemingly disparate teens, identifiable by one distinguishing trait (Athlete, Criminal, Princess, Brain, Basket Case), are stuck in an 8-hour Saturday detention session, during which they reveal themselves as uniquely layered individuals. The performances are the stuff of legend--each actor brings a vulnerable edge to their deceptively clichÃ© titles (and, of course, part of the film's charm is seeing which characters we can most closely relate to). Hughes is as good at staging goofy comic moments (such as a hallway chase set to synthesizer percussion) as he is at the more quietly emotional and raw scenes. The adult characters (represented primarily by Paul Gleason's bitter principal) are somewhat problematic, coming across as short-fused boogeymen...yet still, this seems to be part of Hughes' (mostly accurate) teenage perception, where the notion of 'adult' remains an elusive, mysterious concept. 'The Breakfast Club' is a mix of comedy, drama, and nostalgia that is by turns hilarious, affecting, and wrought with the kind of naive complexity that makes youth at once joyful and painful.",8,1,1,22 October 2007
Donnie Darko," one of 'those movies'...
","After seeing it twice now, I've come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is a conundrum--but a conundrum even the most disciplined philosophical mind wouldn't want to ponder. Writer-director Richard Kelly's tale of a psychologically disturbed boy (the title character, played with remote detachment by Jake Gyllenhaal) with the ability to see through time and space, aided by a creepy rabbit-faced entity, is simply too ambitious for its own good. It has a lot of worthwhile ideas and characters going for it, but their realization usually only reaches the halfway point, thus transforming the film into an underwhelming, frustrating experience. Though it addresses issues of mortality and fate, the emotional tone could have been lifted from any number of 'Teens-Coming-Of-Age' movies (the presence of Jena Malone made me recall the much better 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'). Perhaps the director's cut fleshes out some of the weaker threads of plot, but I'm not curious enough to find out. I won't fault 'Donnie Darko' for going in a different direction that most teen-oriented films, but '12 Monkeys Meets Ghost World' is quite a stunt to pull off, and nothing here comes close.",5,7,13,10 November 2005
The Social Network," Doesn't Fully Connect
","David Fincher has always been one of my favorite directors, a visual stylist unafraid of pushing boundaries or putting his full effort into controversial (and sometimes even grotesque) scripts. With the exception of 'Alien3,' my affection for this auteur has maintained stable through the years; even more difficult, patience-testing, mainstream-leaning works like 'Zodiac' and 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' maintain a human solidity and warmth at their labyrinth cores. And hot on the trail of those mainstream-leaning works comes 'The Social Network,' a film that has been hailed as capturing the Zeitgeist of our time (embodied in Mark Zuckerberg -- played here by Jesse Eisenberg -- the founder of Facebook); and while nobody ever said a Zeitgeist needed to be embraced by all, I found the coldness of the film overall to be its most notable (and most crippling) aspect. The film presents Zuckerberg as a motor-mouthed, self-absorbed, and socially inept college kid who, in a fit of anger over a girl who has just snubbed him, germinates the seed of Facebook over the course of a few drunken hours (the film will return to the theme of romantic/personal failure as the seed of vengeance-through-technology retribution more than once); the remainder of 'The Social Network' criss-crosses between present day and flashback, chronicling the bridges Zuckerberg burned as quickly as they were built, and the wake of angry, ripped-off colleagues and contemporaries left in the dust as Facebook became the Internet's premier social networking site. While Aaron Sorkin's whip-cracking dialog all too often feels like a less endearing, less caustic version of Mamet-speak that is never as clever as it thinks it is, the real surprise of 'The Social Network' is the utter conventionality of Fincher's direction. For a film as jam-packed with characters as this, we never feel especially close to anybody, and Zuckerberg (who is essayed with an admirable lack of grace, couth, and empathy by Eisenberg), who dominates the proceedings, is both loathsome and pathetic. Perhaps a second viewing will be more fulfilling, but for now, 'The Social Network' is a rather unappetizing contemporary history lesson without much beyond its incendiary content to recommend it. Actually, it is worth viewing for the fantastic minimalist score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.",6,1,2,26 November 2010
The Simpsons Movie," An incendiary, hilarious, and ultimately anticlimactic ride
","For all the creativity crammed into one half-hour episode of 'The Simpsons,' I am probably not alone in saying that the show's creative apex bottomed out when it stopped being a 'funny sitcom' and became a 'cultural phenomenon'--it's been years since I've sat in front of the TV on a Sunday night with the primary interest of being wowed by Matt Groening's brainchild. When the show first began in 1989, the Bart-friendly T-shirts and pins seemed borne out of uncertainty over the show's staying power; these days, with the show's position in the TV canon firmly established, your Xbox games are designed for little more than feeding the 'Simpsons' cash cow. That being said, I revisit the show every once in a while (via taped weekday-afternoon reruns of earlier seasons), and very much appreciate it--the sense of satire is sly, incendiary, and often very funny. Some critics cite horror films as being able to express social concerns that would be difficult to convey in other genres; 'The Simpsons' would be another arena (and easily the more critically acclaimed).So, after years of hype, this cultural phenomenon has spawned a film (aptly titled 'The Simpsons Movie') that most fans will no doubt consider 'belated.' As a laid-back viewer with an appreciation of the show, the end result is frequently 'LOL' hilarious, but not very endearing (honestly, I had forgotten most of the gags by the time I was out of the theater and walking to my car). The best I can say is, 'it's like a really good episode of the TV show' rather than 'a great film,' though I guess that's complimentary enough. I will pick up the DVD once it's released, and be reminded all over of why the film succeeded in its primary goal of clever laughs.It begins with an excellent jab at the film's own existence, courtesy of Homer ('Why pay for something we can watch on TV for free?' indeed!), then delves into a plot that is as incendiary as anything the yellow-tinged family has tackled: an environmental crisis strikes Springfield when Homer dumps a silo a pig feces in a lake that's been recently de-contaminated, inspiring outrage from the citizens and the government (headed by President Schwarzenegger, though I kept thinking 'President McBain'), whose EPA liaison (voiced by Albert Brooks, who also guest-voiced the similar 'Hal Scorpio' years ago) covers the contaminated city in a huge Plexiglas dome. Before you can say 'Al Gore eats yellow snow,' the Simpsons escape through a literal sinkhole and make tracks for Alaska as renegades from the law, only to find themselves returning to rescue their idyllic American home.Which ultimately isn't much different than what you would find in an average episode of 'The Simpsons.' This is a film that knows its audience, but also successfully provides an initiation for those who (for some strange reason) have never seen the show. The animation is fluid, colorful, and uber-glossy, and the writing is on par with the better episodes (the mantra remains 'anything goes' in 'Simpson'-world); some intriguing character twists aside, the film overall neither exceeds nor diminishes the expectations of those who expect everything and those who expect nothing. It's a fun summer film, but not an outstanding blockbuster of endearing quality...you'll laugh heartily and maybe feel moved, but the relatively short running time is both a blessing and a curse--while you will be sufficiently guffawed-out by the end credits, 'The Simpsons Movie' leaves a viewer yearning for more. I suppose that's as good an indication as any to go back to the tapes.",7,15,23,3 August 2007
Up in the Air," Finding Levity
","With only 3 feature films under his belt, Jason Reitman has developed a unique cinematic language for his own interesting voice; unlike his father (Ivan Reitman, most renowned for the 'Ghostbusters' franchise), he is less interested in big-budget blockbuster film-making, and more passionate about intimate tales that turn their characters inside-out. His Awards-hungry 'Juno'--while not a perfect film by far--established a teenager who was by turns arrogant, callous, and clearly unaware of the grownup responsibility that came with her pregnancy; by the end of the film, however, it was clear that she had undergone a series of epiphanies and personal discoveries that not only forced her to confront the reality of her situation, but transformed her character into something heart-wrenchingly believable. The same finely nuanced character development occurs in 'Up in the Air': George Clooney (who comes across as a close cousin to Aaron Eckhart's character in Reitman's debut, 'Thank You for Smoking') plays a corporate shark/motivational speaker, who, by his own admission, spends only 40 days at his Omaha apartment out of the year; the rest of the time, he is boarding endless flights around the country, firing workers on behalf of companies who don't have the brass to do it themselves. Initially, Clooney's character comes across as an arrogant gloss on Michael Clayton, and is very hard to like (there is a palpable coldness to the way he and fellow jet-setter Vera Farmiga 'bond' over frequent-flyer miles and online itineraries); it is only after meeting plucky-yet-emotionally-fragile Anna Kendrick (the brainchild behind an depersonalized online method of firing workers en masse) that Clooney undergoes a change in attitude, going from a man who loves to be surrounded by people without actually connecting to anyone, to a man who realizes that he might be missing out. Reitman, who co-wrote the script with Sheldon Turner, lets the image speak for itself: while the characters are clearly works of fiction (and contrived in their own ways to meet the script's needs), the snap of their dialog and shared experiences seldom rings less than true. By its ambiguous close, 'Up in the Air' has gone from a study of alienated (and alienating) people to a near-revelation in how we, as human beings, disconnect from one another without even knowing it.",8,0,2,10 June 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," When all else fails, run around in your underwear...
","The best moments in 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,' belong to under-appreciated character actor Gary Cole (who played Mike Brady in both 'Brady Bunch' movies, a sinister thief in 'A Simple Plan,' and a malevolent sheriff on the TV series 'American Gothic'), who not only treats the material with a gleefully smug sarcasm, but also provides the only whiff of successful comic timing in this NASCAR-wreck of a comedy.Either I have a knee-jerk resistance to movies featuring the blowhard cast members of 'Saturday Night Live' and am missing out on nuggets of comedic genius that infiltrate the multiplexes once every month or so, or I'm becoming too snobby for my overgrown film-snob shoes. Whatever the case may be, the recent rash of kitchen-sink comedies featuring performers either obnoxious or charming tend to be largely hit-or-miss affairs. In the best-case scenario, a majority of the gags hit home ('The 40-Year Old Virgin'); on a less successful level are films whose high energy compensates for the margin of misfired gags ('Team America,' 'Anchorman'); and beneath that lies 'Talladega Nights,' a film that (snobby) professors of sociology and psychology might unearth 50 years from now to display as a symbol of everything that was wrong with the American sensibility toward things, circa 2006. But wait...maybe that's what star/co-writer Will Ferrell is aiming for! Firing shots at an American Past Time that is quickly eclipsing Major League Baseball, a satirical foray into the world of NASCAR seems like a no-brainer (literally); a scenario so broad that the comedic possibilities are endless. And while he's prone to grating on my nerves in large doses, Will Ferrell has proved gifted in the realm of comedic excess with his retro-behind-the-scenes news send-up, 'Anchorman.' While I wasn't chomping at the bit to see 'Talledega Nights,' I can't say I wasn't a little intrigued at its potential.But for all its attempts to gross us out and make us bust a gut, 'Talladega Nights' is an incredibly pedestrian comedy. For the most part, this tale of the titular superstar NASCAR racer (Ferrell) who suffers a particularly un-funny trauma (he wrecks, and runs around under the delusion that he's been set aflame, when he hasn't) only to rise up and compete against a corporate-competitor Frenchman (Sacrebleu! the French are traitors and wussies in post-9/11 America!) is trying to be a sappy, inspirational movie as much as it's trying to be a send-up of sappy, inspirational movies. We have the corporate flunky who sets Ricky up for a fall; the wackily eclectic pit crew; the cheating-whore trophy wife; the precocious children who yell and swear; the best buddy who shares with Ricky a really stupid catchphrase ('Shake n' bake!'); and the quietly inhibited girl who turns into a purring love interest for our hero. The jokes come quick and dirty, from every which direction--but the satirical possibility of the material seems completely lost on the filmmakers, thus transforming 'Talladega Nights' into just another undistinguished pile of misfired comedic excess. (By comparison, a 'Trekkies'-style mockumentary targeting NASCAR would have elicited more laughs.) The half-dozen or so laughs I did derive from 'Talladega' came courtesy of Cole's hilarious portrayal of Ricky's hard-drinking father, whose unorthodox methods of re-affirming his son's crushed spirit consist of driving blindfolded and with a cougar, among other things. And there's also a great scene involving the removal of a knife plunged into a thigh with another knife. Otherwise, this is a most unspectacular pit stop...but then again, maybe I'm the one who's missing out here...and if that's so, I don't feel the least bit bad about it.",2,7,17,13 August 2006
