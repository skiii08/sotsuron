Iron Man 3," Why does everyone hate this?
","I personally did see this as a bit of a let down, however the Marvel community has done the best they could on this. Tony Stark is back to his old talkative cheeky self and brings a lot of comedy to the film. Iron Man destroys his enemies the only way he knows how, leaves nothing left. So why is everyone moody with this film? Have all your periods synced up or something? Come on guys, although the film was a bit more comedy than usual, this was still awesome.Iron Man 3 was great in all sorts of different places; -The script was well written. -The plot was still great. -All suits were amazing! -Pepper Potts was great. -The special effects were great, with parts of Iron blasting onto Tony's Body. -The exploding enemies.The one problem I found was, they never explained why Aldridge wanted to blow stuff up? Was this Marvel's attempted at a Joker? The only one complaint I had!Robert Downing Jr. was great in this. He never disappoints when it comes to Iron Man. He was funny, clever and as per normal, great with his gadgets.This film was not as good as the first and second, and it was very hard to live up to them two, stop being picky, leave that to the critics, come on guys, this was an amazing film and we are all butchering it! If the first two Iron Man's didn't exist, I see this film getting at least a 8.5 out of 10 rather than 7.9! Come on guys, we are the Marvel Universe, do this film justice and boost the ratings guys, it deserves more!",7,2,7,4 May 2013
