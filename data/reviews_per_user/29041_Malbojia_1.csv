The Benchwarmers," very funny film, altho not everyone's cup of tea.
","i know a lot of people don't like this movie. i however love it, its not the story, or the acting. its the stars. nick swardson is going to go places. very funny. but like i say, not everyones cup of tea. some people wont get past 'ooo they are playing watered down characters from previous films'. and to the people who say the napoleon dynamite dude is playing a watered down version of the aforementioned name, i say, 'yeh, he should have been playing a dumb jock. that would have been more realistic and true to the actor yes!!' ..... well .... no.... see its never going to be a huge film, but i think the writing team of allen covert and nick swardson will continue to bring us great films like this and grandmas boy. my favourite scene in this film is nicks last little bit at the end. cracks me up all the time.",8,0,0,28 October 2006
