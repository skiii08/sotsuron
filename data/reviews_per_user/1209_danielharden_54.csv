10 Cloverfield Lane," Valencia
","When you think of Horror movie sequels that have basically zero of the original crew and that has little to do with the first film, it's normally a combination for failure, But... 10 Clover field lane is the complete polar opposite being an extremely thrilling and suspenseful Mystery Thriller.The acting was solid. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallighar Jr were good in the film. But the real star of the film is John Goodman.John Goodman was phenomenal as the 'John Badman' that is Howard (ha puns), a conspiracy theorist/ farmer with unspecified mental illnesses. Goodman perfectly portrays the innocent yet sinister man who you are never quite sure whether or not he can be trusted. The psychological thriller aspect of the film through this character was extremely tense as you are never quite sure of what he's done and what are his intentions.The Movie was nail bitingly tense as we dip in and out of trust with the bunk owner Howard and watch as the two 'guests' plot against him and escape, hopefully back to civilisation. This film will have you hooked and even shock you at points. This film has a great premise that would have made for an even more amazing stand alone movie.Which brings me to my only real criticism of the film, and that is the fact it is a Clover field spin off sequel. It was unnecessary. The Clover field aspect of this film was nothing more than a way of getting butts on seats and money in the bank. The majority of the film takes place in an UNDERGROUND BUNKER, so why they decided to add giant alien monsters into the mix I don't know. This film really tries to be two films rather than one. There is the suspense thriller and there is the monster horror movie. It does a great job with the former but barely introduces the latter. I read that this was originally a stand alone idea but was tweaked to fit into the Clover field universe just like 'voila, loads more money.'As a whole I was extremely gripped, surprised and impressed with this movie that for the most part was a fantastic suspense thriller. If the ending wasn't simply a corporate decision to maximise profits, which it absolutely was, this film would be bloody perfect. But aside from the terrible title and random aliens this is brilliant suspense thriller that is definitely worth a watch",8,0,2,20 March 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Dear BP screw you Love Peter Berg and co.
","What do you do when you are in some really deep water, not just in the metaphorical sense but in the literal sense as well? Director Peter Berg and Actor/Producer Marky Mark Walhberg bring us the answer as they adapt the story of Mike Williamson and crew aboard the BP owned, Deepwater Horizon oil rig on the day it exploded and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This disaster movie brings both the action and emotion of the event brilliantly and it is safe to say Berg has bested his other ocean adventure film Battleship by a mile with this true story.The action packed portion of the movie was excellently executed. The action isn't only good because of the relentlessness of the event but mainly due to the emotion embedded within it. This also is down to the film building to the incident by building on characters so you actually care about them when the mud starts to rise. The emotion behind the action is what makes the film great and to me a specific moment that stood out was the man who died moving the crane, we do not know his name but we know he's one of the 11 casualties of the event.Peter Bergs direction of this film was simple but effective. The event is built to and happens, but the way that Berg is able to embed emotion within the action really stands out as it constantly reminds us that these are real people and this event (although dramatised) actually happened.The acting all round was great. Mark Walhberg does good this time especially at the end on the hotel floor. Kurt Russell and John Malkovich made perfect enemies, Russell's performance as the extremely competent and passionate Jimmy Harrell is easy to get behind, and equally Malcovichs power abusing and corner cutting Vidrine is a character you easily come to hate. These two characters stand out as the best as their rivalry is massively entertaining to watch.The only real issue I have with this film is one of Bergs directing staples. Berg ruins the ending of his biopic films in the opening scene. In Lone Survivor the opening scene is the ending and also the marketing of star Mark Walhberg in a film and the title spoil the events of the film before even watching it. In this film the film opens with audio from the real life court hearing and through the mention of names you know who survives the event. I do understand this is a true story and so the ending has already been written by life itself, but for those who don't know who Mike Willaimson is or who have forgotten it (which would be the majority of people) would bring more tension if they are left unaware of the characters fate.Overall, Deepwater Horizon is an explosive and emotive disaster movie with great acting and direction despite the opening audio. Berg and Walhberg are becoming a pretty good film making duo and look forward to their next collaboration. I highly recommend this movie so if you love disaster movies and hate BP then you are in for a treat.",8,0,1,6 October 2016
United 93," Intensity Intensifies
","United 93 is intensely brilliant. A fascinating true story that some may not have known going in (like me), and that simply had to be told. Thankfully it was told by an outstanding director who made an equally outstanding film.The film feels so authentic. Director Paul Greengrass hits the nail on the head with this almost documentary of a film, taking you step by step through the events of 9/11 from multiple points of view, all up until the crash of united flight 93.To find out that the majority of the actors weren't actors but where either playing themselves, or actually worked their characters job in real life was amazing, as the acting was solid and frankly impressive after hearing these facts.The tension in the film never lets up, it builds and builds, up until the films final frame. The ending of the film is where the intensity truly intensifies, as the passengers charge on the terrorists, fighting for their lives in a final attempt to regain control of the aircraft. This is one of the most intense, and in my opinion, best endings to a film I have ever seen.Overall United 93 is hard hitting. A tragic story with a unique focus on the events of 9/11. United 93 is the movie this airliners story deserved as it does justice by those involved and you cannot help but respect the hero passengers aboard the flight",7,0,0,27 February 2016
It," They All Float Down Here
","Stephen King is no stranger to big screen adaptations of his work. The prolific author even directly wrote a handful of these films And I think he'd like to forget the time he directed one. Some of King's classic film adaptations include such titles as; The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, Carrie, The Shining, Misery and It. Now, adeptly made 27 years after the classic Tim Curry starring miniseries, Mama director Andy Muschietti brings Pennywise the dancing clown to the big screen with IT. The film tells the story of the losers club, a group of outcast kids suffering from varying degrees of domestic issues, as they encounter a sinister being that takes the form of a clown and feeds off children's fear No not like in Monsters Inc. IT both works as a horror film and a coming of age movie with Andy Muschetti proving himself to be an extremely competent horror/genre film director. IT is a heartfelt and truly creepy movie even if it does underwhelm slightly due to the hype surrounding it.This adaptation of part one of Stephen King's classic novel is brought to life with nightmare-inducing imagery rather than loud sound effect jump scares. For this reason, director Andy Muschietti has my respect, as I can clearly tell he wants to truly scare and disturb his audience rather than conforming and relying on the laziest horror trick in the book. The opening sequence, aka the paper boat scene, is so fantastically executed by Muschietti, the tension drives you to the edge of your seat, and the payoff is frankly one of the most shockingly brutal things I've ever seen on a cinema screen. IT is unflinchingly gory for a film centred around a group of adolescent teens on the verge of puberty. However, the brutality and shock factor have been hyped up so much in the many articles written on this film, that you can't help but feel underwhelmed by the end product. Muschietti and his actors have gone on record about the number of 'extremely disturbing' scenes that were cut, that you can't help but wish they had left them in. The paper boat scene is perhaps the most hardcore scene in the entire film, thus establishing the film's tone with this, will only lead to disappointment. As good as Muschetti is at directing horror unconventionally, leading with the visual, not the sound, he does rely heavily on characters being lured into obviously dangerous situations. I understand that the protagonists are children and so are easily manipulated, but Muscetti literally builds to every scare with a character being overly curious and following a creepy sound/voice, or an ominous red balloon, a weird easter egg looking thing, or even their long-dead brother Although I'll allow the emotion transcending logic on that one as that is realistic, you get the idea, it's majorly overused and makes the film repetitive.This all being said, IT doesn't just work as a horror film, but also as a coming of age film. Perhaps Muschietti's most effective use of horror revolves around the horrors of domestic life, abuse and growing up. Bill, Mike and Beverly are so emphatically brought to life in the script with such horrific back stories that no child should ever have. I believe that Beverly is fleshed out the best of the entire losers club, the tension between her and her father is so subtly constructed yet so effective. Mr Marsh's dialogue motif is so unnerving as it implies something much more disturbing and dark than what we see, which in itself adds a whole new dynamic and layer to Beverly's character, one of immense empathy. As well as this, the bathroom scene is wonderfully constructed to represent the ugliness and loneliness of a girls menstruation. This all being said, I couldn't help but dislike the films ending for sending the wrong message surrounding Beverly's character. The characters in IT are developed in such an engaging and distressing way, that you wish there was more of it. The horrors of home are great and really add to both the horror and coming of age genres, yet I feel a greater focus on this was severely needed, but then again this is chapter 1 after all.Last but not least the acting is outstanding across the board. All the kids act better than most adults today, to the point that you forget you are watching a group of child actors. Bill Skarsgård makes Pennywise his own in this film, many would say Tim Curry is impossible to top, however, I do believe Skarsgård rose to the occasion and makes for a far scarier Pennywise in the few scenes that his makeup doesn't do all the talking for him. I wanted more of Skarsgård, just like how I feel about everything else in this film.Overall, IT is an impressively made horror/coming of age film, that works on a number of levels. All the departments, from production design to make up, are doing a phenomenal job of bringing Andy Muschietti's horrific vision to life. Shocking and gory yet still coming off as tame, IT is a film that should have remained tight- lipped, however, everything Muschetti offers is so intriguing and engaging you simply cannot get enough. I for one cannot wait to see what Chapter 2 has in store, but one thing for sure, chapter one certainly floats.",8,2,5,25 September 2017
Detroit," Prepare to get angry... Very, very angry...
","Anyone who knows anything about Eminem knows that Detroit is an American state that is pretty f*cked up. The state has been known for its constantly turbulent financial situation, and even going bankrupt in recent years. However, one of Detroit's most notorious moments in history is arguably the race riots of 1967, to which Kathryn Bigelow's new movie takes place. Finishing off her unofficial gritty war film trilogy, Bigelow brings the war to the streets, focusing on one particular night and event during the 1967 Detroit race riots, the Algiers Motel incident. Bigelow delivers on her unflinching, documentary/ Paul Greengrass style of filmmaking, in what is probably her most traumatic film to date.The film begins with an animated montage of exposition to explain how black people came to live in Detroit, and why they eventually rioted. At first, I thought I was watching a short film before the actual film started, as the colours and animation style completely clash with Bigelow's gritty directing style and tone. Alas I was not, the animation was the intro to Detroit and immediately got me thinking 'this could've been done better.' The animation, although good, doesn't fit and is far too short to really deliver on the exposition it aimed to convey, leaving me still unaware as to why the riots actually started. We then cut to a celebration at an all black, unofficial bar, to which gets raided by police and riots soon ensue. Further research revealed that this bar was created due to the poor treatment of black people in normal bars, so they made their own, and when that got shut down it became the straw the broke the camels back. Detroit could've and should've introduced the film this way, with the facts behind how the riots started. What we get is a nice animation, but one whose purpose is rather weak, and Bigelow can do better than what she offers here.We are now thrown into the riots and lives of people within Detriot, both cops and citizens. Bigelow has an obvious bias towards African Americans, and against the police in this film. This bias has been seen to be rather unpopular and controversial, but Bigelow is no stranger to making controversial statements in her films, 2013's Zero Dark Thirty heavily suggested that the American military used torture as an interrogation method during the hunt for Bin Laden. In Detroit, the actors who play black citizens are presented as everyday people, while the cops are presented as horror villains/monsters. Bigelow's direction, as well as Mark Boal's script, brilliantly portray the cop characters as evil, frightening and inhuman beings that even you are fearful of. Ultimately, I attribute the scare factor of the cops to the actor's outstanding performances, especially Will Poulter who utterly shines in this film. The entire cast is excellent as an ensemble, John Boyega, Algee Smith are also outstanding, however, it is Will Poulter as the racist brute, Krauss that steals the show in this film. Having previously made a name for himself in comedy with films such as We Are The Millers, seeing Poulter in such a disturbing role excellently exhibits his acting range with this extremely drastic juxtaposition of roles.The film mainly revolves around an hour or so long sequence, the Algiers Motel incident. Bigelow cranks up the tension in this film and does not turn it down, with help from a script that feels, for the most part, natural, and an absolutely astonishing cast. Bigelow's documentary style makes you feel you are actually watching this horrific event happen, that coupled with some of the most uncomfortable acting to ever witness, Detroit feels less of a cinematic event and more of a traumatic one, to which this was back in 1967. You feel this has been documented and not filmed or particularly staged, as what you witness will disturb you and leave a lasting imprint, I have to say that the one word that best describes this film is; traumatic.Although Kathryn Bigelow is a great filmmaker, she does tend to overuse hand-held camera in her films, and Detroit is possibly Bigelow's worst use of the technique. The technique is again overused and so too is zooming, which are not film techniques held in high regard. Detroit reaches stupidly bad levels of shaky cam and zooming as some shots, albeit very few, literally lose the subject of the shot altogether, take note of the Fred going to work scene. As well as this, John Boyega's character seemed almost fictional as he simply does nothing in this film, however, due to the reality of his character, I can understand this is probably close to what actually happened.Finally, the film's biggest issue lies in its lack of context and general information. The film offers a very obvious and strong bias, hell the script even features ham handed dialogue from other cops saying things like; 'Who could do something like this?' when we all know it's the Detroit police. Alas, this film has some rather large plot holes and/or areas to question. The film even states at the end that they don't know for sure what happened, which feels like the film is chickening out of it full on onslaught of Detroit's police force. The film does pick up on enough evidence that would convict these cops in today's far less, openly racist society, however, it equally has enough holes within it to get that evidence dismissed. Although I personally believe this film is close to the truth, if exaggerated, you can't however, ignore the flaws.With excellent acting, a decent script and great directing, Detroit is an unflinching and frankly, traumatic film. Detroit does have its flaws and plot holes, but so too did people's recollections of the Algiers incident. This film will enrage you, but that reaction in itself proves the film has serviced its purpose, to provide a form of justice for the people who got none.",8,1,10,10 August 2017
Wind River," This is the land of you're on your own
","Taylor Sheridan has made quite the impact in the last two years as a writer. Having predominantly been an actor, most recognised for his role as Chief Hale in Sons of Anarchy, it seems Sheridan has found his true calling. Sheridan's first script, Sicario, introduced us to Sheridan as a writer, as well as introducing the world to leading director, Denis Villeneuve. Sheridan's next script, Hell or Highwater, would then gain Sheridan an Oscar nomination and received the Oscar push Sicario didn't quite achieve. Now, Sheridan both writes and directs his next film, ending what has been an unofficial American setting trilogy. Sheridan's third script and second directorial effort come in the form of Wind River, the true story of veteran game tracker, Corey Lambert and his assistance with the FBI on the homicide of a Native American girl. A writer stepping up to direct is often risky, but with Wind River, Sheridan simply adds another string to his bow.The settings of Sheridan's films are almost characters in their own right. The settings can determine people's states of mind, character motivation as well as highlighting specific social or political conflicts/ problems. Sheridan has thus far used the America Mexico border and Texas in such a way, and now he swaps the warm for the cold. Wind River takes its name from the ice cold Indian reservation in Wyoming, and this setting perhaps the most important and significant one Sheridan has written about. The film is rich with Native American culture, but not in the stereotypical sense that everyone would think. Wind River highlights just how disenfranchised Native Americans are in their own country without getting overly political or racially charged. The film feels authentic and highlights its issues in a heartbreaking and frankly factual way. Wind River is the mystery of a Native American girls murder but is most notably a statement about Native American homicides, as well as, a character study of Jeremy Renner's character, Corey Lambert.Jeremy Renner's performance as Corey Lambert is phenomenal, with great performances in such films as The Hurt Locker and The Town, Renner's performance in Wind River is yet again Oscar worthy. Renner brilliantly portrays a man struggling with the loss of his daughter, by attempting to claim some form of justice, not only for the family of the girl murdered but also for himself. Wind River is a character piece and Renner rises to the occasion as the character of focus. The film reunites Renner and Elizabeth Olsen from the Marvel universe, acknowledging they have a platonic relationship already established and thus utilising what the two have already displayed to great effect. These two actors work well together and the casting directors knew this well. The film also has great performances from Graham Greene as well as a surprise appearance from Jon Bernthal who is always great to see.Sheridan directs this film similarly to how Denis Villeneuve and David Mackenzie directed his last two scripts. Sheridan has clearly taken note from these two as he establishes a slow pace which absorbs as much of the setting as possible, while also having punchy action that exhilarates. It could be viewed by many that Sheridan simply pads the film's run time with shots of vehicles moving in the snow, and to an extent, they are right but knowing of Sheridan's significance of setting, these shots have within them, an element of dread and isolation to which these shots capture so vividly. Sheridan's slow pace in the first two acts of the film makes for an intriguing thriller with great character depth, but unfortunately, the films third act fails to impress from a mystery thriller standpoint.The reveal of the murderer and the crime in the third act felt far too abrupt and took away from the build to it. On reflection, the mystery story was very simple and didn't feature any developments of much interest. Instead, we slowly build to what feels like midway through the investigation and then have everything revealed at once via flashback. I know Hitchcock has done this famously with Vertigo, unveiling the reveal earlier than audiences expected, but with Wind River, I feel it just takes away from the intense and brooding build up of the first two acts. Also the killer is a character we first meet within the flashback, and thus yet another genre convention subversion that didn't sit right with me. However, after reflecting on this, I acknowledge the fact this is a true story and that Wind River is predominantly a character piece and statement of social injustice in America. Nonetheless, the film promises more than it delivers from a genre perspective and features an extremely simple mystery which is hard to not be disappointed by.Wind River is a fascinating character piece with a strong social statement about Native American missing persons. Excellently acted by Jeremy Renner and sophisticatedly written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River may not have hit the right notes as a genre film, but has more than excelled in every other way. Wind River is a very human story of vengeance, justice and how the two can be one and the same. The title card at the end speaks volumes about the world we live in and how true equality doesn't exist, but as this film also expresses, this needs to change.",8,7,13,1 September 2017
Train to Busan," Last Train Home
","The horror genre has its fair share of hits and misses, however, it would seem that the sub genre of zombie horror suffers from the greatest ratio of misses to hits. Yes, the genre does have George A Romero's Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead, as well as, spoof film Shaun of the Dead, but it would appear that is all we have. One must think hard to find a decent zombie film that doesn't end in 'of the dead'... Until now. Director, Sang-ho Yeon makes his live-action debut with what is in my opinion, the best zombie horror film ever. 2016's Train to Busan, or Busanhaeng as it's pronounced in its native country of South Korea, is more than just a simple zombie film, it's ultimately about evaluating what matters most in life, as well as being a social commentary of Korea's government and perhaps even our own.Train to Busan's success as a horror film could be boiled down to a singular detail, character development. Countless horror films don't take the time to establish and expand upon their characters, resulting in little to no tension, people you more or less want to die and the audience's overall detachment from the film. The social messages of Train to Busan demand fully realised characters for them to have an impact, and fortunately, the filmmakers choose to flesh out a number of characters rather than a limited few. The film's main protagonist, Seok-woo, is a father who prioritises his work over his family, now having again disappointed his daughter, Soo-an, Seok-woo reluctantly agrees to take Soo-an to see her mother in Busan for her birthday, but of course, the zombie outbreak makes things a little bit more difficult The film is primarily the journey, pardon the pun, of Seok-woo as he's forced to be the protecting father he wasn't pre-outbreak and witness the consequences of his actions as a fat cat businessman. As well as this, the film features a married couple expecting their first child, however, the father has yet to name the baby. I for one, found the couple and their love for each other to be the most impactful and engaging. Train to Busan also features; a sports team where one member and a cheerleader have an off and on relationship, two elderly sisters who care deeply for one another and a selfish business owner who I believe represents the ruling class in Asia. Train to Busan is rich with subtext, making it more of a mental and emotional journey than a physical one.In addition to the emotional message of human life matters most, Train to Busan is contextually relevant in the modern day. With North and South Korea technically still at war having never signed a peace treaty, but more importantly, North Korea's constant threat of nuclear attacks and Donald Trump Well Doing what he does best as president, adding fuel to the fire and being racist So it's safe to say things are pretty sh*t in Korea at the moment. Train to Busan takes aim at the ruling class, from the fat cat businessmen like our protagonist to the government itself, controlling the media and thus the people to fit with their political agenda. The continent of Asia is no stranger to censorship and unquestioned authority figures such as dictators, and so I believe Sang-ho Yeon is attempting to highlight the errors of totalitarianism by effectively bringing a ruling class man to the ground, to see the errors of his ways and the ways of those like him. The shoe is on the other foot and together with the breathtaking performances from the films cast along with the films character development, this message is made all the more powerful.It isn't all serious however, there is a lot of fun to be had and the film is incredibly entertaining. The action set pieces throughout Train to Busan are large in scale, visually stunning and seriously impressive. Visceral imagery takes the place of cheap jump scares in this competently directed action horror film. Yeon wants to scare you with the culturally relevant subtext, in conjunction with horrifying imagery, instead of simply relying on a loud noise. Director Sang-ho Yeon also understands the horror genre, its themes and concept. It's all about fear, but not just of a killer, a ghost, a vampire or zombie etc. Horror can be the fear of anything and Yeon has made a film that is more about the fear of failing as a parent, disappointing your family and fearing for your country, than it is about the fear of zombies. The human fear amongst the supernatural is what truly makes Train to Busan the best of its genre.The world is a scary place. The divides between the rich and the poor remain intact and the threat of war is ever-present. Yet humanity does exist, there is light in the darkness we just have to open our eyes to the horror of others. Train to Busan is a poignant, relevant and phenomenal film which takes the audience on the same emotional journey as its characters. It's an extremely tense film thanks in no small part to the phenomenal cast and use of character development. This film can be read on a number of levels, I just hope people see it for what it truly is, a social and political statement highlighting the lack of humanity seen in the modern day.",9,7,16,30 October 2017
Zootopia," Zootacular
","Disney goes back to its anthropomorphic roots, with help from their Pixar brothers of course, to create Zootropolis. Judy Hopps is determined to be the first ever bunny cop and aims to do so by solving a missing persons case along with a sly fox called Nick Wilde. This film is another home run you would expect from the guys at Disney Pixar, a blast for both kids and adults alike.Leaning towards the latter of the two, I can say from an adults point of view this film is really funny and mature. Everything has another meaning and the political satire and statement this film makes is impressive in the run up to the new Trump era (God forbid).What I love about this film is its extremely relevant, mature and real subject matter, with references to immigration, Political cover-ups/ corruption, racism, terrorism, technology and even Breaking Bad. This world, even though animated and inhabited by animals, feels extremely realistic and as if someone has put a mirror up against urban society, revealing the issues hidden under the surface. Zootropolis tells about the people just as Inside Out told about the person.As one would expect, there are a fair share of puns and background Easter eggs to be spotted and for you to laugh (or roll your eyes) at. Everything has been meticulously planned out from Beaver construction workers to Fox conman to Carrot Phones. It's a very very Punny movie but fortunately the film doesn't round off puns like bullets out a machine gun, they are delivered they way they should be, as an occasional one liner. Story drives the film rather than gags which also makes Zootropolis stand out as far as I'm concerned.Zootropolis, Zootopia or whatever else its been renamed for whatever reason, is a another Disney Pixar success. The film speaks to kids and in even greater volume to adults making for a viewing experience that is both fun and entertaining as well as being thought provoking and politically worrying. I would not be surprised if some families leave the theatre with the adults having liking the film more than the kids as the references will fly right over their heads, but at the end of the day it's great to TRY EVERYTHING (Pun intended).",8,2,9,2 April 2016
The Danish Girl," The Film doesn't live up to the story
","The story of Lily Elbe and Gerda Wegener is one that had to be told on screen, and it has in the form of the Danish Girl.The film isn't bad by any means, I think its an OK film. But I do not think the film is what this true(ish) story deserved. Lily and Gerda's story is a pivotal moment in LGBT and human history and so I couldn't help but feel a tad underwhelmed by this movie.The acting is good, Eddie Redmayne plays a Eddie Redmayneish trans gender martyr and Alicia Vikander deserves the Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the supportive wife with ambitions and problems of her own.On reflection if you are going to make a character piece about a trans gender woman wouldn't it be best to hire a trans gender Director as to get a full understanding of what the character would be feeling and what they are going through? Not that I believe that Tom Hooper was a terrible director, I just think the complexity of the character would have been better understood and conveyed on screen by someone who can relate with LilyOverall the Danish Girl is alright. I understand the films omission from the best picture Oscar race and I feel this film is nominated for all the right Oscars. The film is by no means bad but is simply a 5/10 film whose story could have been told much better than it was",5,1,2,10 February 2016
Creed," It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep on going
","On paper the premise for Creed doesn't sound like a good idea, it's a Rocky sequel for god's sake so a passing of the torch seems ludicrous when the previous 6, I repeat 6 films include the name 'ROCKY' in them.BUT...Ryan Coogler got it completely right, creating a film that is not only a great Rocky film (and from what I've heard the best sequel), but is also a great film period.I have not seen any of the Rocky sequels (except this of course) but I have seen the 1976 original to which I believe Creed is as good as, maybe even better.The acting is good. Michael B Jordan more than redeems himself after the train wreck of a film that is Fant4Stic, Tessa Thompson is good as well, and I can't believe we may even see Rocky himself, Sylvester Stallone win an Oscar and actually deserve it showing a side of the Italian Stallion that we never thought we would see, in the biggest fight of his life yet, that of cancer.Creed is both art-house and blockbuster, Ryan Coogler brings the edge of your seat action as well as the emotion as he portrays two generations of boxers fighting two very different fights. After having seen this and his debut feature Fruitvale Station, I believe that Ryan Coogler has cemented himself as the next big thing and an excellent filmmaker. And that one take boxing match scene tho, enough said.Creed packs a punch in more ways than one, jabbing, crossing and Hooking you from start to finish. If you are a fan of Rocky films or just want to watch a good film, I highly recommend Creed and praise all those involved in it's making but especially Ryan Coogler who will be one to look out for in the future.",8,3,6,11 February 2016
Spotlight," Batman and The Hulk take on the Catholic Church
","A film given a 15 certificate on its theme alone, Spotlight tells the story of a group of reporters from the Boston globe who shine a light on the 'degenerate clergy' of Boston soon becomes uncovered as a global injustice.The sophisticated and unflinching screenplay is packed to the brim with powerful dialogue that drives this film, delivering the emotion and motivation of the victims and spotlight reporters alike.Acting is great, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams put a lot of time and work into making their portrayals of the real life people behind the story as accurate as possible, spending a lot of time with the Boston journalists on and off set.This film is so powerful and unnerving, and having had a catholic upbringing but not being particularly religious, I find the film even more relatable and shocking when finding out about how widespread this issue was and how corruption actually came from the top down. But the single most surprising and frankly disgusting thing about the whole thing was Cardinal Law's consequence in the end credits. A promotion to Rome. That's right he got promoted for covering up several child molestation cases against priests. I left the theatre speechless after that.Spotlight is a fantastic movie. The film is like the actual article(s) that was written by the Boston Globe on this topic; a controversial issue about upsetting and unsettling subject matter that ultimately had to made for the public to see.",8,0,0,12 February 2016
The Hateful Eight," The Good, The Bad and The H8ful
","The aptly names The Hateful Eight marks the 8th film of director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is one of few directors who can be seen to do no wrong, but with this comes a very very high standard to which people expect of the auteur. The Hateful Eight is a good film but to me was rather disappointing when compared to the standards expected due to Tarantion's past works.The aim to create an old western aesthetic is perfectly constructed, from the aspect ratio to the score composed by the great Ennio Morricone, Tarantio goes all out and succeeds in his efforts to set this scene. Minne's Haberdashery is the setting to which the bulk of this film takes place, almost like a play.To me personally this film reminds me of Of Mice and Men and thus has succeeded in its old western style setting.Tarantino is also renowned for his characters and rather conversational dialogue. With the majority of this film being set in Minnie's Haberdashery the conversational dialogue and monologues are very much present in this feature. However the characters are a bit too underdeveloped for my liking. As i've said Taranito is known for his compelling and memorable characters, so I was disappointed to find that over the course of the films 161 minute run time, that we still knew very little bout many of the characters. Instead of character development the film opts to address the issue of racism in the old west as well as a who-dun-it? mystery plot point. These are handled by Tarintio as expected and make for an engaging film, but the lack of insight into the characters feels like the missing piece to this cinematic puzzle.The ensemble cast is great and under Quentin's script and direction make this film as good as it is. Samuel L. Jackson reminds us that he is one of the best actors around yet to have an Oscar, and can play more than just a supporting role as he has become known for. Jennifer Jason Leigh actually received award nominations for her role but ultimately wasn't given much to show off why she was nominated and feels underused. But overall as a collective unit the cast does a fantastic job.The second half of this film is far better than the first. The film starts off slow, introducing characters and the plot. This isn't a particularly bad thing aside from the fact it takes the better part of 90 minutes to do so. The second half however is when the film becomes a Tarantino movie. The monologues, the over the top violence, the shocking sudden deaths of key characters etc. All the Tarintino conventions come out in the films second half. The film is one that builds and you just have to sit tight until the sh*t hits the fan.Overall the Hateful Eight is a good film, but is fairly disappointing by Quentin Tarrintios standards. The acting, dialogue and authentic are all great but the extremely slow pace of the start and the lack of depth and development of many of the characters leave me unsatisfied, like missing pieces of a puzzle. The picture may look great but there are still something stopping me from achieving satisfaction from this film. Hopefully Tarantio's 9th film will restore the balance.",7,0,1,11 June 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Boy
","Spider-Man is arguably the most relatable and beloved superhero of all time, I know this is true is for me. When Sam Raimi first brought him to the big screen in 2002, the film had the biggest opening weekend for any film at the time. Now 15 years, 5-6 movies, 3 actors and 2 reboots later, we now are graced with Spider-Man: Homecoming. Directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland as the third Spider-Man, Michael Keaton as the Vulture and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Spider-Man: Homecoming tells the story of an overly eager, adolescent Peter Parker, who is done with being the bridesmaid (your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man), and thus desperately attempts to impress Tony Stark in the hopes of becoming an Avenger. The film is a fun addition to the Marvel universe that is by far the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004).Spider-Man: Homecoming is unlike any Spider-Man film before it. It is crossover film in more ways than one. Yes the film has Iron Man in it, but it also has Spider-Man face off with former Batman, Birdman now Vulture, Michael Keaton. Jokes aside, this film is unique in the sense that it does its own thing and doesn't follow in 'The Amazing Spider-Man's footsteps by retelling the classic Uncle Ben origin story. The film fortunately does what Spider-Man 2 did so well, getting right into Peter's life as Spider-Man. I swear if we got a third origin story that would be a last straw, I'm sorry Spidey. Also in the same light as Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming plays with the question 'can Peter Parker be Spider-Man without the suit?' I personally enjoyed the rather realistic way this was handled and this really helped warm you to Tom Holland's Spider-Man as a person with faults, thus juxtaposing the way audiences related to Tobey Maguire's relatable, good guy nerd Spider-Man.As I've compared Spider-Men and Spider-Man films I might as well cut right to it. Tom Holland is a great Spider-Man, he embodies the naive ambition, rebellion and awkwardness of a young teenage boy and did what I believe to be the right way to approach Spider-Man, that is playing Peter Parker first and Spider-Man second. People love Spider-Man not because he can swing from a web and climb walls, well not just because of that. People love Spider-Man because Peter Parker is a relatable character. When I was growing up Spider-Man wasn't just a hero, he was a figure of representation and therefore was MY hero. Although Tom Holland will never be better than Tobey Maguire in my eyes due to personal history, he is a surprisingly close second. I appreciate Holland's approach to my childhood icon, and I think it's safe to say, he was definitely better than Andrew Garfield. As well as Tom Holland, Michael Keaton also did an excellent job as the films antagonist, The Vulture. His story was understandable and his character was given a surprising amount of depth for an MCU villain. Keaton's Vulture stands out above pretty much all MCU movie villains (except Loki of course) and would feel more at home in the Netflix shows alongside Cottonmouth, Kilgrave and Kingpin.My only criticisms surround the high school dramedy parts of the film. Although, a lot of the comedy that came from this was pretty funny and so I can't fault it too much, I could however have done without the teen romance sub plot with Lizzie. Again, I understand that it does become crucial to the plot and nicely reflected the Osbournes over for dinner scene in Spider-Man (2002), this being said, It just felt cliché overall and seeing as this is a rather fresh take on Spider-Man, the typical high school romance took away some of the films freshness, in my opinion. Also I felt that maybe the character Ned and Michelle could have swapped positions. Ned just didn't do much for me by being in the film, I feel Michelle and Peter could have had better banter and that Michelle could've acted as Peter's reality check. I do see however that Michelle may become important in the sequel so we shall see.Finally, I get this being an Avengers crossover movie, Tony Stark being a father figure to Peter, as well as, a massive payday for RDJ, but there is a part of me that feels this is Marvel trying to make every superhero movie a 'Mini Avengers' movie, ever since the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier. This is a Spider-Man film, but it also isn't as it is a constant reminder that the Avengers exist and have a movie next year. Part of me would have liked an solo Spider-Man movie with references to the universe similar to the Marvel/Netflix shows, which to be honest it does do, but at the end of the day, I'm just thankful they have finally made a good Spider-Man film after 13 years of trying.To conclude, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun and surprisingly relatable superhero movie that ends Spider-Man's bad movie streak. Its an entertaining action and teen movie that understands its character, as well as, what made the last three movies not so great. Sure its another 'Mini Avengers' movie as well as a typical teen film, but with brilliant acting, writing, directing and a real sense of humour, Spider-Man: Homecoming does my childhood icon justice and satisfies on many levels.",8,15,25,9 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Seppuku Squad
","Are you tired of those same old superhero movies? Do you want something a little bit different? Yes? So hows about instead of SuperHEROES we have SuperVILLAINS as our protagonists? That may or may not be how a meeting at Warner Brothers went down, but still the proposed idea of villains instead of heroes (helped a hell of a lot by the films fantastic marketing campaign) got millions of people pumped up and made this the film the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2016... But with so much hype surrounding the film the likelihood of disappointment grows higher, and in this particular case, the film is very disappointing.I should probably start with what was good about this film, and I think if there is one positive thing we can all agree on, it's that the soundtrack was really good. There are songs from such great musicians like The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Queen, Eminem and Twenty One Pilots just to name a few (Don't even get me started on the number artists on Sucker For Pain). The films opening 10, 20 minutes is literally good song, after good song, after good song for like 5 or 6 songs straight. So regardless of the films quality the soundtrack for this should hopefully sell well.Another good thing about this film is what the actors do with their characters. Will Smith plays a Will Smith version of Deadshot, Margot Robbie is pretty brilliant as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto does a decent if brief portrayal as the Joker even if his presence is kinda irrelevant (Jared is nothing on Heath though). Although some actors spread there wings and fly with their characters, others are unfortunately never given the opportunity. Aside from those I've mentioned (and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag I guess) everyone else is just there for the ride. Killer Croc, Captain Boomarang, Enchantress and Katana are given very little to do (Most notably Killer Croc who is probably one of the only character you knew about before this film happened). I'm not sure if its a case of tow-many-characters-spoil-the-broth but the focus in extremely disproportionate between the members of the squad.Suicide Squad suffers with some of the same problems as Batman v Superman, most notably the plot and its messy attempt at a unformulaic structure. The first 30 minutes or so simply introduces characters, but it only really introduces Deadshot and Harley and there isn't really much that is actually revealed about them other than Deadshot is the best hit-man ever and has a kid that is his world, and Harley was a doctor who treated and fell for the Joker and went batsh*t crazy. Also the mission they are on is unknown to us as well as the Squad, but you can kind of guess by putting two and two together which some will but some won't. So pretty much all you get for most of the film is thinly layered character introductions who are set on an unknown suicide mission. We knew more than this walking into the cinema screen. Oh I almost forgot about the oddly placed occasional flashback sequences like the Harley jumping into a toxic vat and making gross love with the Joker scene... They happen for some reason.This film is called Suicide SQUAD and yet the squad never at any point feels like a team. The film fails to form any kind of on screen bond/ chemistry with anyone (except Deadshot and Harley maybe). The film instead seems to have characters make dramatic shifts in their way of thinking for example; Diablo won't fight and get involved with the squad (albiet for a different reason other than not liking them) then suddenly they are his 'family' and he, SPOILER ALERT, dies fighting for them. Another extreme out of character good to bad switch is evident in the scene where Amanda Waller leaves her control centre and joins the suicide squad on foot. This character has seemed rather fair thus far in the film... and then she guns down the entire control room, she may not have been all good but this seemed way to far of a leap to the dark side.Overall Suicide Squad suffers from a messy plot, thin character depth and a lot of underused characters, but at least the actors gave it their all and the soundtrack is dope. The DCEU is off to one hell of a rocky start that I, along with millions of others, must be thinking, the only way is up for batsy and his little band of misfits. Right?",6,2,3,10 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Stranger Things
","Benedict Cumberbatch has made a name for himself by mispronouncing the word 'penguins' and playing the asshole genius role in many a film and TV show. He's been Alan Turing, Julian Assange, Sherlock Holmes and Khan, but now Cumberbatch plays Stephen Strange... An asshole who is also a genius... Well if it ain't broke don't fix it am I right? Doctor Strange is a decent Marvel film that doesn't quite reach the ranks of other 2016 Marvel films Deadpool or Captain America, but at least it's better than X Men Apocalypse.The film is overall well acted, Cumberbatch plays the type cast role as good as ever and works rather well together with Chiwetel Ejiofor. The two together provide theatrical level acting as if they were cast in a critically acclaimed dramatic stage production rather than a MCU film. The British duo are also joined by Rachel McAdams who does fine in this film as well as Tilda Swinton, who controversially plays the Ancient One. Although the Ancient One wasn't played by an Asian actor luckily Wong is. Played by the aptly named Benedict Wong this character was the best and most entertaining in my own personal opinion. Now, we know that every blockbuster film is often only as good as its villain. So that explains why this film felt average as Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius joins the ranks of pretty much every Marvel film villain... Pretty much you will forget about them fairly quickly. Be that as it may this is not down to Mikkelsen's performance at all but more the lack of things for him to work with.Which leads onto the next point about the film itself perfectly. The film feels generic. The dialogue is typical of superhero films in which the fate of the world is at stake and some of the visual techniques are as well. The one scene in particular that screams the word unoriginal is the scene where Kaecilius and the Ancient One circle each other while they talk before fighting. The film is hard to pin down as I enjoyed its simplicity by being generic but it is also just too generic to the point of not bringing anything new besides kaleidoscope visuals to the table.The film is visually beautiful with its kaleidoscope styled visual effects and its magic portals etcetera, but overall the film lacks originality and to an extent substance. Doctor Strange is an average Marvel film similar to the first Captain America film but nonetheless I'm intrigued to see what the MCU plans next for Stephen Strange... Maybe some more bargaining?",6,2,3,17 December 2016
Lion," Planes, Trains and Aussie Mobiles
","Lion is the story of Saroo, a 5 year old Indian boy who one day finds himself on the wrong train and becomes lost. The film tells Saroo's story of being lost and the multitude of challenges he faces in his quest to find home. With a good cast, script and direction, Lion is an enjoyable biopic which does justice to it's intriguing story.The cast is great. Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman act wonderfully as adopted mother and son in this film. However the real star of the film is little Sunny Pawar as young Saroo. The boy performs brilliantly as you really feel for him and believe that he really is a lost individual. Also due his adorable appearance, Pawar is someone the audience can easily come to love. Credit should also go to Gareth Davis' direction as it must have played a really big part in directing the 5 year old Pawar. So credit where credit is due.Lion is a film that simply tells its story. This story of a young boy getting lost and spending many years trying to find his way home. An extraordinary true story with a film adaptation that is both written and directed in such a way that the story and can tell itself, with help from a great cast of course. In this way the film is enjoyable to anyone who is interested in an intriguing and hopeful true story about one boy's adventure that takes him across the globe, from India to Australia.Overall, Lion is a well acted, written and directed film that tells it's fascinating story in a satisfactory way. With a standout child performance from Sunny Pawar the film is an enjoyable one for many, and is a film I would recommend. His name is Sheru, hear him Roar!",7,0,1,9 February 2017
Baby Driver," Plug In Baby
","From Edgar Wright, co-writer and director of the Cornetto trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs the world, comes a rather fresh take on the Heist genre that is Baby Driver. Ansel Elgot of the Fault in Our Stars and Divergent fame, stars as Baby, a young getaway driver with a deep rooted love of music and indebted to the wrong person, Kevin Spacey. Baby drives to pay his debts and keep those he loves safe, but when things start to escalate its dog eat dog. Wright's first solo writer/director feature is like True Romance as a heist film, while bringing Wright's auteur stamp to the genre. It's a brilliantly acted and directed film, even if the story unfortunately does get progressively worse.The films first half was far better than its second in my opinion. Opening with a heist that immediately solidifies the film as an Edgar Wright one. Baby's car dancing and lip synching establishes a comedic element that has run throughout his work and the signature Edgar Wright fast cuts are used as good as ever in several absolutely fantastic car chases in this film, but especially in the films opening. The films first act is the films peak. I would also like to highlight Wright's choice in this sequence, and throughout the film, to not show the heist take place, he could have easily made the film super conventional and shown a heist, but this film isn't about that. Wright Knows the film he is making and it's really quite a feat to make a heist film without really showing a single one. Not only is he unconventional in not showing a heist, but he also uses the long take quite a lot, and from the 'Master of the Fast Cut' this was very interesting to see. After the excellently executed opening sequence we are graced with an equally well executed title sequence which is all done in one take. I understand why Wright would use the long take. It lets the actors feel the music, move and react to it. The title sequence is exactly that as Baby goes to get coffee while listening and reacting to a song as it plays in its entirety. The long take is used throughout, similar to Wright's signature fast cut, and it simply showcases his versatility as well as his impeccable handle over a soundtrack.At the screening I saw, Edgar Wright stated in an introductory video to get ready for an awesome soundtrack and he isn't wrong. What makes Baby Driver's soundtrack so good isn't just the selection of songs, which is brilliantly done by Steven Price, but the way in which Wright has woven them into the film. I did think to myself before the film started 'are they just trying to capitalise off what Guardians of the Galaxy did and is doing?', but now having seen Baby Driver I can safely say, that the way Wright has used his soundtrack is truly unique, and not just an easy attempt at merchandising. You can tell that Wright had the songs in mind before and/or during the script writing process as scenes are written and directed around certain songs, such as Debora by T. rex. I have heard critics call Baby Driver a 'sudo-musical', but I would prefer to compare it to more of a 2 hour long music video. The use of music allows for Wright to play with how the film is edited and he does not disappoint as the entire film is edited wonderfully by editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss.Now, although Wright directed the absolute hell out of this film and the wove the soundtrack in nicely, the film does however suffer a dip in quality when it tries to create and relationships. My biggest issue is with Kevin Spacey's character who I would like to have known more about, especially in regards to his relationship with Baby. This is mainly a problem as his character takes a sudden U turn in the films third act which is so sudden to which we are given one sentence explanation 'I was in love once.' Maybe Wright wanted his character to be a mystery, I don't know, but personally I would have liked the film to focus a little more on Spacey and Elgort's relationship, thus giving the film's final act a little more kick even if it doesn't really need it. Also the relationship between Baby and Debora was okay but didn't have to take up so much of the run time as it did. The only other issue I have is with the films final act as, although directed fantastically and filled with unexpected moments, it did feel rather expected due to the nature of the heist genre. I can't help but have the films The Town and Triple 9 in mind, and personally this association made the final act a bit too conventional than for what I would have liked. I also didn't really like the ending. I found it a bit rushed and arbitrary and to me it felt like an alternate one you get in the DVD extras But then again who doesn't like a happy ending? In this case me I guess.To conclude, Baby Driver is written and directed to near perfection by Edgar Wright, with a big star cast that more than satisfies expectations the audience would have of it, and a kick ass soundtrack that is woven beautifully into the film, Edgar Wright has made yet another great film here. Although the script could have probably done with one more draft, adding a little more detail into characters and their relations to others, but then again it is because Wright has created such interesting characters that I even want to know more in the first place Watch out Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift because here is the real Drift King.",8,8,16,22 June 2017
The Revenant," Mother Nature, Thou Art a Cold Bitch
","The Revenant is a cinematic journey, depicting the lengths a father will go to avenge the death of his son.Every second of the films 2 1/2 hour runtime was felt, leaving me with a feeling of accomplishment as I left the theatre and begin to contemplate what I saw on my travelsLeo is great as usual, pulling off a performance you would expect but having to go through hell and back to achieve it. Acting as a whole was fine but I'm left asking myself one question.... What the f did Tom Hardy say in this movie? Although the actor has a number of accents up his sleeve, this one just left me scratching my head as he seemingly impersonates Jeff Bridges in cowboy roles.The film is intense, brutal, barbaric and at times hard to watch which is exactly what was the aim and reflects both the true story of which the film is based as well as the story behind this films making.For me the Revenant is a well acted, well directed film with brilliant cinematography with a daring choice of only natural lighting throughout. With the Oscars fast approaching I wouldn't be surprised if the film came back with a few awards(LEO FINALLY), even if Best Production design is laughable, the film is well made across the board and has the nominations to prove it.",6,0,2,9 February 2016
Split," The Twenty Fourth Sense
","M. Night Shyamalan is a director who has had his fair share of ups and downs over his career. He was Oscar nominated for The Sixth Sense and was once predicted to be the next Steven Spielberg, but he's also suffered had one hell of a streak of bad movies, winning 4 Razzie awards for such films as; The Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender. Now off the back of the moderately well received film The Visit, Shyamalan is looking to propel his career back in the right direction as he releases his next film Split. Split stars James McAvoy as a man with 23 different personalities who kidnaps 3 teenage girls in preparation for the arrival for a 24th personality, the Beast. Split keeps Shyamalan on the right tracks and is itself a good psychological thriller.The best bit of the film by far is James McAvoy. McAvoy is given a very difficult task of having to portray a total of 8 different personalities, but not only that, he sometimes must switch between each one within a single take. You can always tell who McAvoy is due to the slight facial expressions, mannerisms and tones of voice that he exhibits. He's scary, creepy and will make you laugh at the same time. It's mesmerising to watch and is a perfect performance, which I personally believe is a real Oscar snub.Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty good in this film, portraying the mysterious social outcast character who is pretty well explored in this film. The way Shyamalan deals with her character throughout the film is very well done, but due to the spoiler sensitive nature of psychological thrillers I'll leave it there.Shyamalan's writing and directing are great as the film is very suspenseful and clever, like any good psychological thriller should be. Shyamalan also masterfully places moments of humour throughout that doesn't in anyway lessen the suspense of the film and actually adds to it. The film feels reminiscent of The Silence of the Lambs with its setting and tone, to which Shyamalan has obviously used as inspiration, but has done so brilliantly. Like most Shyamalan films, the ending is key. It either can either make or break the film, often due to Shyamalan's love of a twist ending. I will not confirm or deny the appearance of this Shyamalan trademark, but what I will say is that the ending makes sense and is pretty thought provoking, unlike some of Shyamalan's films *cough* Signs and The Happening *cough*.Overall, with a faultless James McAvoy performance, solid script and direction, Split is a great psychological thriller that M. Night Shyamalan can be proud of. Shyamalan is back and he is out for redemption. Let's hope he's left the After Earth 'I like it but I think it might be bad.' days behind him once and for all. Fingers crossed.",8,1,9,26 January 2017
Dunkirk," Pure Cinema
","Christopher Nolan is without a doubt one of the greats, a modern day auteur, and the filmmaker behind some of cinemas most highly anticipated indie films. The man has managed to find the sweet spot between blockbuster and art film, gaining the praise of critics and casual viewers alike. The man has become an event in himself, everyone knows when a Christopher Nolan film is coming and they flock to the cinema because of his name. I love Christopher Nolan's films, he has yet to make a bad film, despite The Dark Knight Rises being disappointing on reflection. Although not stepping many feet wrong his entire career, I don't view Nolan and his work as many others do, that being as the work of an untouchable God. I try to walk in without expectation or, without having already decided the film is a perfect 10/10, as it seems quite a few people don't do. However, I really wanted to enjoy Dunkirk for my own sake, God forbid I actually didn't like it, I would swiftly be told why exactly I am wrong in even suggesting Nolan could step a foot wrong Thank God I actually really enjoyed the film, phew. Dunkirk recounts the true story of the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk in 1940. The film is high octane, action packed and suspenseful and again Nolan proves why he's a human cinematic event.This film is obviously a Nolan film, there are some star talent in the film, but they are there because they want to work with Nolan, not the other way round. The film is, for the most part, wordless, this isn't really a film for actors to shine, it's for Nolan to show the world how the real thing can be, and is often, better than CGI. With the film being wonderfully wordless, Nolan shows he knows exactly what film is and always should be, the visual art of storytelling. He has obviously taken note from such greats as Hitchcock, using sound and dialogue to further aid the visual, not to overpower it. In today's film landscape this is quite rare, and so you have to give Nolan credit and respect for making a film the way they should, but rarely are, made. This is film after all, not radio. Also to note, Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography in this film is absolutely breathtaking, Dunkirk would be little without his work and he is in need of some serious recognition. Dunkirk isn't a conventional war film, we don't get character development in the form of 'who you got back home son?' campfire talks, nor do we get multiple battles throughout the run time. Dunkirk doesn't have a dull moment whatsoever. It is a battle from beginning to end, and so with this, Nolan does not allow us, the audience to rest easy. Nolan doesn't hold off on the tension at all. I personally loved moments where Nolan momentarily lulls us into a false sense of security, only to then provide a sudden jump scare in the form of gunfire, reminding us that you are never safe in the middle of war. Now this is how you use sound as a jump scare correctly. This film is high octane, tense and extremely gripping from start to end.Also this being a Nolan film, he has to make things more complex, he can't just tell a war movie with a chronological narrative structure. Dunkirk follows the same story, from three different perspectives and three different time frames. For audience members, like myself, who understand Nolan's knack for complex storytelling, this will be confusing for a moment whilst you recall previous information to make everything make sense again, and then you will love what Nolan has done. However, audiences who expect to see a war film, which by our conventional understanding is often self explanatory, will forget that previous information and thus remain confused throughout the rest of the movie. I've seen negative reviews say that Dunkirk gives no indication of time, and to an extent they are right, but then again all I can say is watch it again, but this time take note of the opening title cards which read 'one week', 'one day' and 'one hour' it should clear things up, but I do think maybe the title cards could be a little clearer.To conclude, Dunkirk is Nolan's Full Metal Jacket. I wouldn't say this is his greatest masterpiece, I reserve that for Memento. But Dunkirk is an outstanding piece of cinema that proves Nolan's auteurship and that he is one of the greatest filmmakers alive, if not, who ever lived. The man knows film and knows how to make a great, complex one. Hell the guy has a knack for impressing the experts, having actual scientists make discoveries through Interstellar, and now by a soldier who was at Dunkirk, praising Nolan for his accurate representation of the event. Now if that doesn't say it all then I don't know what will.",9,8,14,1 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Bust a Cap in your ass
","The best superhero vs superhero movie of the year (*cough* Batman v Superman was nowhere close *cough*) Following the hugely successful, mini avengers movie Captain America and the Winter Soldier, the Russo Brothers step it up a gear by basically bringing us the next Avengers movie. Or at the very least giving fans a great deal of confidence in the next two official Avenger films.Thor and Hulk (and thankfully Pepper Potts) are nowhere in sight, but its OK because the Russo brothers pull out a whole arsenal of superheroes to fill there place. Although many are literally there to kick the asses of hero's they haven't been formally introduced to yet, its still extremely epic to watch Spiderman, Ant man, Black Panther, Ironman, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Vision and Scarlet Witch battle it out while at the same time delaying a lot of peoples flights. Those Heroes never learn.The film is far more than just a superhero movie. It's a thought provoking psychological thriller with a juicy twist near the end. Who's side are you on? Tony's? Steve's? Debates take place on numerous occasions with both sides given the chance to express their point of view. I personally sided more towards Iron Man due to the more selfless reasons for his vote, but I was never 100% behind anyone. Even though this is a Captain America film, we as an audience are positioned more alongside Iron man, unveiling the truth as he does and even learning so much more about his character than the title character. This may have been called Captain America Civil War but it's Ironman who the film is really about.The motives of the characters are much more emotional than they have ever been before, making this the most human MCU movie to date. Whether its the almost sibling rivalry of Steve and Tony or Daniel Bruhl's back story, everyone has a personal motive which just adds to the tension and drama, gripping you to the characters and the action they encounter.The Action was good. The Airport fight scene is where the whole film has been crafted around and it pretty lengthy too, every hero gets a decent amount of screen time making it a really satisfying sequence to watch. Some sequences were a bit quick especially if in more claustrophobic settings but that's more of a harsh nit pick to be fair.My only real issue with this film was its villain(s). Although I had no problem with Daniel Bruhl as a villain its more how on earth he got access or knew about anything which I'm sure would have been top secret? Being a normal guy who lost everything due to the events in Sokovia, there is little explanation as to how he was able to do the things he did, I guess he's just really really really well connected.Daniel Bruhl is a great actor and all but the fact that the main villain is just an average guy is a little underwhelming even if it does pose an interesting reminder that the Avengers are not worshipped by all. Frank Grillo's Crossbones looked awesome and would have been a great villain... But he is sadly wasted in the film. It's a real Smaug in The Battle of the Five Armies scenario. He doesn't even last 10 minutes.Overall, the Russo's have done it again. Captain America Civil War ends the Captain America Trilogy on a high making it one of the best superhero trilogies/ series ever. This political psychological thriller reminds our heroes the human cost of war and brings in new dimensions to characters we love, whether its via film or comic book. I have full faith in the Russo's as it has been made clear to us that Infinity War is in good hands.",8,7,14,1 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Valak Morghulis
","The Warrens are back with a new case to solve and a new demon to cast out. The Conjuring 2 reunites us with Ed and Lorraine Warren 6 years after the events of The Conjuring, This time the Ghostbusting dynamic duo are called to Enfield England to help a family of 5 in what would become the longest recorded paranormal case in history. Following the previous films three stages of possession the film escalates perfectly and unfortunately for Ed and Lorraine, they have become targeted by this demon as well.The return of the Conjuring also sees the return of Director James Wan, back to the series and the horror genre after directing 2015's Fast and Furous 7. Wan knocks it out the park yet again with this horror movie sequel. The tension is unbearable, the imagery is horrifying and the film is scary as f*ck. This film puts Wan's tension building ability to the test and Wan rises to the occasion, making several scenes borderline unbearable to watch. The Conjuring 2 wouldn't be as good as it is if James Wan didn't direct. The film proves once again why James Wan is the best horror director working today.The acting in this film is great. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprises their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, this time adding a more personal touch (and awesome Elvis impression) to their respected characters. The chemistry the two have is believable and brings a human touch to this paranormal horror film. Like the first film the child actors are good (great by child actor standards), especially Madision Wolfe who is great as the tormented and occasionally possessed Janet Hodgson.I couldn't help but feel there was a wasted opportunity when the Amityville case was glossed over at the films start. Although the opening is wonderfully shot (similarly to NBC's Hannibal) I still think it could have been its own conjuring sequel. The films foreshadowing of events was rather obvious except such as the focus on the dog bell and he crooked man toy etc. Speaking of the crooked man, the scene where the dog transforms into the crooked man didn't really fit in and was almost laughable due to how bizarre and wtf the moment was.Overall the Conjuring 2 is a well acted, well directed horror film that is overflowing with tension and that also has heart. This film marks a successful start to the Conjuring sequel series and hopefully there are more to come, and more importantly that James Wan acts as director for them.",7,1,3,18 June 2016
It Follows," Panic at the Mutiplex
","It follows is a modern horror classic, a horror film that doesn't rely on the use of cheap jump scares to terrify its audience, this alone shows just how well crafted and genuinely scary this film is, it's a frightening homage to classic horror films.Director David Robert Mitchell creates a nonsensical dream world to which this seemingly simplistic story takes place. Many things do not make sense in this film but that is not down to poor direction, believe me, I studied this film late last year. David Robert Mitchell includes these nonsensical elements to create a world which is literally a nightmare.Maika Monroe establishes herself as a modern day scream queen with her performances in this, and in the 2014 film The Guest, and looks to have a very promising career in this genre.A lot of the films success has to be down to Disasterpeace's musical score. a tribute to John Carpenter and slasher horror films, the music gives me Goosebumps every time I hear it, especially the 8 bit dissonant screech similar to Psycho.I'm not a frequent watcher of horror films but I would say that It follows is definitely worth a watch on the big screen as I've seen this film three times. The first time in the cinema at night. I was so scared by this film I actually had a panic attack after the film had finished, this is probably more down to me being a wimp more than anything, but, for a film to garner that kind of response from me surely has done its job, and has done it well.This film is probably quite tame for horror fans who have been numbed by frequent viewing of the genre, but to others this film should be wonderfully scary. I would highly recommend It Follows to anyone, but be warned, that it is a film that will ironically follows you after you've seen it.",9,2,8,14 February 2016
Get Out," From the edge of your seat to the sunken place
","In the Film Industry, race has become a very talked about issue. With events like the #Oscarssowhite campaign last year, prompting hundreds of black filmmakers to be headhunted to join the academy, and then a year later Moonlight wins best picture at the Oscars as well as their being a number of black award recipients. With many films at the moment tackling the very relevant issue of racism, one film stands out above the rest as the most original and all round best in my opinion. Get Out comes to us from the mind of Jordan Peele, one half of comedy duo Key and Peele. The film is a satirical horror comedy about implicit racism, slavery and being the only black person in the room. Now the first black filmmaker to debut with a film grossing over $100 million, Peele has made history and rightly so, as this film is fantastic on every level from comedy, to horror to political satire.Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film beautifully. The script is extremely clever and well structured, and Peele's direction is just as fascinating. Get Out is a rare breed of horror comedy film as the two genres are kept separate throughout the film, but yet never feel out of place. The main source of comedy in the film comes from character Rod Williams played wonderfully by LilRel Howery. The rest of the comedy in the film is derived from the unknowingly racist comments and assumptions from the old white people in the film. Often with horror comedies it's the subversion of horror conventions that creates comedy, but not in Get Out.First and foremost, this is an original horror film that explores racial issues. These themes are expressed in an extremely sophisticated manner, within the microcosm of the Armitage residence. To me, the film is essentially a visual metaphor for the slave trade and that it still exists in alternative forms today, whether that be a mental form or being a thing out for display at a social gathering. What's great about this film is the realistic nature of its racism, it's very subtle and implicit, something you can imagine your grandparents would innocently say without knowing. This makes the film feel more authentic and genuine as you can relate to this, regardless what side of the encounter you find yourself on.The film's direction is superb. As already mentioned, Peele evens out comedy and horror in this film, marrying the two together in a way that shouldn't work but somehow does. Peele is very good at crafting anticipation and suspense in this film, and thanks to Michael Abel's score, the tension in this film is nail biting. Peele is also very good at handling conventions, as he doesn't necessarily rely on horror movie clichés to create an unsettling atmosphere. Jumpscares are in this film, but Peele uses them wisely, rather than making the rookie error of overusing and relying on them. Peele wants to be original in the way he unsettles his audience, he doesn't want to fall back on human reflexes in the way jump scare heavy, modern horror films tend to. Peele uses proportion and I commend him for it. I also thank Jordan Peele for having the most satisfying final act to a film that i've probably ever seen. The use of the police car is simply genius.As well as Jordan Peele doing an outstanding job on this film, the same can be said of actor Daniel Kaluuya, who plays the films lead, Chris Washington. Samuel L. Jackson may have preferred to see an American black man play the role, but personally I couldn't think of anyone better for the role than Kaluuya. The level of emotional control on display by him in this film is off the charts and simply mind blowing. This is not the first time that I have genuinely been amazed by Kaluuya's acting, he shows the same level of emotional intensity and control in Black Mirrors episode 'Fifteen Million Merits'. After that episode I said he would be an actor to watch out for, and his performance in Get Out is continued proof of that. Get Out also boasts a great supporting cast from good performances from Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Betty Gabriel and comic relief LilRel Howery. But at the end of the day the focus is on Kaluuya and boy does he shine.Overall, Get Out is an absolutely fantastic horror film. Original, unsettling, funny and with an emotionally mesmerising performance by Daniel Kaluuya. Get Out takes you on a thrill ride like few other film has done before. Hollywood needs more filmmakers like Jordan Peele, visionary directors with original stories to tell. No wonder this film is setting and breaking cinematic records.",9,9,19,4 April 2017
Room," You're gunna love it... What?... The World
","Wow that is what comes to mind when I think of Room and especially when I think of Jacob Tremblay's performance. Room has one of, if not, the best child acting performances of all time.No doubt Director Lenny Abrahamson worked his ass off to make this possible along with the rest of the cast and crew which also do a tremendous job to make this film come to life.One thing that I think makes this film so great is it's screenplay. It is written by someone who knows the source material more than anyone, the books author Emma Donoghue. I loved how events in Jack's life where told by his extremely imaginative and optimistic point of view even if deep down what he is describing is extremely dark and traumatic. The whole film opts for a hopeful, feel good tone which I appreciated as it easily could have been much darker.Since I saw her in the indie flick Short Term 12 I remember saying that one day Brie Larson would win an Oscar. I may be right as she beautifully portrays a loving mother who is strong when she needs to be for her son. It's a fantastic performance with a believable on screen bond between the two leads. Although Brie Larson being Oscar worthy, Jacob Tremblay's mesmerising lead role in the film outshone her by far, but this may be due to personal expectations.Go see Room, it is an extremely well made film from it's wonderfully unique screenplay (and dialogue), it's astonishing child and adult acting and of course it's directing that has successfully brought everything together as we cut the cord and say 'Hello Jack!'",8,0,5,10 February 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Jar of Dirt
","Remember when Johnny Depp exploded onto the big screen as Jack Sparo- Sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, and it was awesome? Ah the good old days, what I would give to go back to that time where Pirates were cool and Salazar's Revenge didn't exist. The fifth instalment to the Pirates franchise displays a complete evolution of genre complying with Louis Giannetti's theory. The Cure of the Black Pearl marked the Primitive genre stage, the film blew audiences away and introduced them to the pirates genre. Dead Man's Chest marked the classical stage, classical conventions were utilised such as the Kraken and what have you. Next is the Revisionist stage of At World's End with it's time travel, witches that grow into giants and that sinkhole final act, let's just ignore the pointless fourth film aaaaaaaaaand now, unfortunately, we have the all out parody that is Salazar's revenge.Pirates 5 is quite simply a parody of itself, from its stupidly absurd, comedic action sequences, to Johnny Depp himself. This film feels like one big joke and I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew this to be true. The way Jack is introduced in this film is quite possibly one of the goofiest sequences I've ever seen in the cinema. I've seen bank robberies go wrong before, but stealing the bank itself... All I can say is, what are those horses taking and where can I get me some? BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! The guillotine scene is just so horrifically bad I physically had to lift my jaw up off the floor in a mix of amazement and bafflement. The Pirates franchise is no stranger to big, illogical, comical action scenes, but this film takes that to a whole different level of stupidity and is almost like a scene out of Epic Movie.As well as the action scenes being all out parodies of ones which preceded them, the acting is as much, if not more so. Johnny Depp drunkenly stumbles out of the children's hospital to play Jack Sparrow once again... Or at least I think he was acting... I'm not quite sure to be honest. Sparrow has always been an alcoholic character, but that was once his lovable charm, now Depp slurs his speech and acts so confused to the point where it's hard to believe he hadn't had 'a single drop of rum.' This being said he gives the best performance in this film which is shocking to be honest. Geoffrey Rush, similar to Depp, plays a parody of his character Captain Barbossa, but to be honest, Barbossa was always a kind of parody of pirates so I can let that slide. However, what I cannot excuse is the abysmal performance by the films two newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Not helped by their rather forced relationship, the two provide a masterclass in wooden acting that makes it near impossible to care for their characters.However bad the acting is, it is not the worst part of this film, oh no. That would be the films script and visuals. Firstly, the script. Pirates 5 is plagued with terrible dialogue. Lines are recycled over and over, exposition is embedded with little effort and subtlety and the sex jokes, lots and lots of cringe worthy, unfunny sex jokes. Sex jokes are practically the back bone of comedy nowadays and can be hilarious, but here the jokes just come off as dirty, like a bunch of dirty old men in a bar recounting 'the things I'd do to her.' Simply put, it's extremely uncomfortable to watch and hear. The film also features a few pointless characters. From the bald witch lady who is simply there to give Barbossa Jack's compass, to Paul McCartney's Cameo role as Uncle Jack. The film just doesn't need them and they either act as a plot device or a waste of everyone's time.Now the visuals, the film was poorly shot. The lighting at night was non existent and the way the camera is positioned for some shots was possibly the single worst place they could have placed the camera, hidden behind objects so the action of focus is distorted/ out of view. Also you can clearly tell where the film is missing a vital shot or just couldn't be bothered to shoot it, as the use of fast cutting and cut away shots are used in an attempt to cover this up, but instead only highlights it and thus confuses the audience. SPOILER WARNING! When Henry is kidnapped by Salazar there is no shot of him being pulled away or anything. A series of fast cuts, Carina's reaction shot to a non existent shot and expositional dialogue of 'THEY TOOK HENRY!' is used to present his capture, and frankly it just seems like they spent too much money on Salazar's gravity defying hairdo, that their visual effects budget was bone dry. This happens a fair bit in Pirates 5 and it simply leaves you as confused as Depp appears to be throughout.To conclude, Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is by far the worst in the Pirates franchise. A full on parody of what it once was with horrific acting, poorly shot sequences and a script that needs some work done to say the least. I know I've been insanely harsh so, on the off chance that the filmmakers see this, I would like to say the famous line 'it's nothing personal, it's just business' whether or not you agree or disagree with me, none of us can deny that the theme tune is absolutely epic and pumps us up every time.",3,22,35,12 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Butting Heads
","It's the end of the world as we know it. Xmen Apoclypse completes(?) the pre-sequel trilogy of Xmen films with less of a bang and more of a meh. The film is alright but lacks that special moment/ scene that stands out and would make it memorable.The cast as a whole were fine, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James Mcavoy and the rest of the original prequel gang resume their roles, slipping back into them seamlessly like a pair of old slippers. The newbies on the other hand never truly get their chance to shine in this film. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan are given the most opportunity in the feature but others like Angel, Psylocke, Storm and Jubilee (especially) are given very little to do and overall serve very little purpose to the film. The film is 144 minutes so I would have thought there would be a little more of an introduction than what we actually get. Don't even get me started on the depleting relevance of Rose Byrne's Moira McTaggart and how Nightcrawler wore the Thriller Jacket first.Wolverine makes a cameo appearance in this film because its Xmen, and no Xmen movie is complete without Huge Jackedman reprising his role again even if it is to tell our protagonists to f*ck off. Although aimed to be a cool little cameo it doesn't get the yay from the crowd it aims for due to how often Hugh Jackman has played Logan.Genertic is one word that could be used to describe the story of Xmen Apocalypse. An Achient Evil Awakens with a plot to destroy or world. Yeah yeah yeah we have seen it all before. There just isn't anything really new about this film as it seems to follow basic superhero movie formulas and even recycles the Quicksilver scene so often that they even made a Sky Fibre advert doing it. Talk about overdoing something just because it was received well the first time. It was still cool to see but I do feel they have ripped away the wow factor it achieved in Days of Future Past.So the film has a few too many characters to utilise properly and follows a generic end of the world plot, this all could have worked well if the film had that one unique point about it. Sadly it doesn't have Tyrion Lannister or that Quicksilver scene to really get people talking. The film feels like its keeping steady and it just needs that peak moment to make the audience go WOW.Overall Xmen Apocalypse was a bit disappointing to be honest. Jean Grey's comment about the third film being the worst is a funny burn to Brett Ratner with Last Stand but ironically to me she is referring to this film as well, being the worst of the prequel trilogy. And the end credit scene is pretty crap, setting up for the next Wolverine film which on the bright side can only get better after the last two sucking but we shall have to wait and see Bub.",6,2,8,25 May 2016
Hidden Figures," Space Race
","The 1960's is probably the most significant decade in African American history. The black movements of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X made history and sadly so did their unjustly murders. But in another part of America, three African American women are chasing a white police man down the highway on their way to make history in the NASA space program in an openly racist society. Hidden Figures stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae and many more in what could be called the greatest feel good film about racial and gender discrimination.Looking at the films style and substance, you'd think it would all come together like oil and water, yet somehow it works. The film deals with heavy themes such as racism and sexism while at the same time being directed as a feel good movie. Due to the success of Katherine, Dorothy and Mary, the film can be told in this way, and luckily the script finds this sweet spot to make oil and water mix together, as it brilliantly deals with the discrimination of the 1960's while also making you smile, laugh and leave the cinema feeling good.The film features an all star cast which is often not a good sign for feel good films, but this isn't the case for Hidden Figures. Not only is the film good but so is the ensemble cast of famous faces. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali play their roles well in this film, and Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae are fantastic in their supporting, and at times leading roles. But the real star performance comes from Taraji P. Henson as the films lead character, Katherine Goble Johnson. Although the film is about three women who each make considerably extraordinary achievements, it is Katherine Goble who is our lead protagonist, and Henson stands tall and performs wonderfully in this leading role, standing out of the crowd of an all star cast. The speech she gives in the 'We all pee the same colour' sequence is extremely powerful and is simply mesmerising to watch.Overall, Hidden Figures is a hidden gem. It's a well cast film with a stand out performance by Taraji P. Henson, and a conflicting mix of style and substance that somehow works beautifully together. I would highly recommend this to black women everywhere, due to its empowering representation of black women. But regardless of who you are, Hidden Figures is a satisfying feel good film that we can all take something away from.",7,2,7,18 January 2017
Logan," Farewell Huge Jackedman
","Ever since his breakthrough role as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X Men (2000), Hugh Jackman has played the claw brandishing mutant a whopping 9 times total. Now fed up of those egg white omelettes that have kept him in shape for the role, Jackman has decided to retire from his infamous role after 17 awesome years. Logan marks Hugh Jackman's last time round as Wolverine and is directed by James Mangold and also starring Dafne Keen, Stephen Merchant and Professor X himself, Patrick Stewart. Finally we get the Wolverine film we have been waiting for and fortunately Jackman goes out on a high.As a whole, the acting was great. Dafne Keen was brilliant as the young mutant Laura, playing the role with such maturity often unheard of from child actors. I genuinely forgot I was watching a 12 year old girl. Patrick Stewart was also great in his seventh appearance as Professor Charles Xavier. Portraying a version of Charles plucked from our nightmares, a sick, weak and lonely man in need of care but who is still that hopeful, good willed professor at heart. It is with Charles' predicament that the emotional impact is most effective, he was a man who looked after many, but in his time of need only Logan is there for him. The X men series began with Charles and Logan, it's only fitting that it would end with them.The film is of course called Logan, so the focus of the film is all on Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman did very well in this film, bringing us a Wolverine that we haven't seen before. Now older and unable to heal, Logan is more human than ever and Jackman transitions from brutal murder machine, to a sensitive and dying man perfectly. But as Good as Jackman was, a lot of the credit is due to writer/director James Mangold, as well as screenwriters Scott Frank and Michael Green for bringing this version of Logan from the comics to the screen. It was very refreshing to see characters I grew up watching be humanised, showing a side to them not truly seen in 17 years. This was fantastic is upping the emotion of the film, and having grown up watching Charles and Logan's cinematic relationship, this film was rather hard to watch.As well as brilliantly showing off Logan's soft side, James Mangold does an outstanding job with showing his barbaric side. Thanks in no small part to Deadpool and its success, proving that there is a market for R rated superhero movies, we finally get the Wolverine action scenes we have all been waiting for. When you have a hero whose superpowers include growing adamantium claws from your knuckles, you kind of want to see those claws in action. Finally we get to see Wolverine slice up people in full gory detail with no cutaways. I have long awaited this day and it did not disappoint. The opening fight sequence was satisfyingly brutal, giving closure as to what an adamantium claw can do to people and what the aftermath looks like.The villains in this film were weak and the film in a way acknowledged this. The main villain shifts throughout the film from; Pierce, to Dr Rice, to Wolverine Mark 2. The film knows its villains are weak so opts to have Hugh Jackman be both hero and villain when they wheel out the X-24. But, at the end of the day it was more about the journey and character of Logan himself, so villains were always secondary.Also as Wolverine gets weaker, there is a lot of him passing out, then becoming conscious, only to pass out again. Although I understand this reinforces the weakened state of our once self healing protagonist, but it made the latter parts of the film feel a little boring and repetitive.Overall, Logan is a wonderfully acted, directed and written film that takes these mutants and humanises them perfectly, showing the sensitive and barbaric sides of Logan in a respectable final movie. The R rating was needed in order to fully respect the source material and finally deliver a Wolverine standalone movie that fans have been waiting to enjoy. The end of an era, so this is what it feels like.",8,4,10,29 March 2017
La La Land," Here's to the ones who dream
","Are you a rusher or are you a dragger? Writer/ Director Damien Chazelle had us all asking this question after he released the spectacular movie that is Whiplash. Now off the back of an amazing directorial debut and having just co wrote one of the best films of 2016 (10 Cloverfield Lane), Chazelle is back with his second film and boy is he back. La La Land is a beautiful film about falling in love and chasing a dream, but is also about the difficulties that come with both.Chazelle blows us away with the films opening scene. The opening highway gridlock number is perfectly directed by Chazelle; singing, dancing, cycling, parkour, it's all there and is all seamlessly choreographed by Mandy Moore in a scene that is shot as if done in one take (I am not certain if it is). The scene perfectly sets the tone for the films first act, which is that of a sophisticated homage to Hollywood's golden age of entertainment.The first act introduces us to our two protagonists and their dreams. Mia is a woman trying to make it as an actress in Hollywood and is played wonderfully by Emma Stone, and Sebastian is a struggling musician aspiring to resurrect Jazz music and is played phenomenally by Ryan Gosling. The two leads work fantastically well together and their on screen chemistry is the best I've seen since Her. Personally I got behind Sebastian and his dream more than I did with Mia and I believe that is Chazelles intention as evident in the films ending. But I'll come back to that later. Sebastian's dream was a small thing and is achievable and realistic. Paired with Goslings passionate performance I really felt his love for the music and so was drawn to him. The reason I didn't connect with Mia was because her dream is cliché, although her reason behind it is one that I understood, it's still a very vague and cliché dream and so I did not connect with Mia. But as I said this is Chazelle's aim and due to this the films ending is so much more emotional.After the film pays tribute to Hollywood's golden age and establishes our characters, their relationship and their dreams. The second act brings us back down to a more sober reality. Now that we have come attached to these characters we experience the roller coaster ride that is their relationship and their dream chasing. It's up and it's down, it's hopeful and it's hopeless, it's heartfelt and heartbreaking. What was once a tale of optimism, now begins to question itself, the characters question themselves and the dream and relationship conflict each other. The stand out scene has to be the dinner table argument. A well written and acted scene that has been built up to rather subliminally by Chazelle, for example I read Sebastian playing piano on the left side of the stage (from our perspective) as him not enjoying the music he's playing.The third act brings back some of that nostalgic hope from the first act before building to it's bitter sweet ending. After endorsing in these characters hopes, dreams and relationship we now wait eagerly to know how it ends for Seb and Mia. Chazelle both writes and directs possibly the most perfect ending for the film imaginable. The 'how it could have been' sequence is mesmerizingly saddening as classic Hollywood set pieces and dance numbers reemerged all the while we are feeling Sebastian's regret, and with my connection to him this makes the sequence all the more emotional when they exchange that one final look.Overall, La La Land is beautiful homage to the golden age of Hollywood the then fittingly becomes a sobering reality until building to it's perfectly bittersweet ending. Wonderfully acted by Stone and Gosling and Fantastically written and directed by Damien Chazelle. Mandy Moore should also be praised for the films choreography and Justin Hurwitz for his beautiful score that ironically seems to have achieved what Sebastian wanted. La La Land is a near faultless movie, that is personally a close second to Whiplash, but is likely to grant Chazelle what he deserves and that is the Oscar gold.",9,2,7,21 January 2017
Saw," See Saw
","The infamous torture porn movie that is Saw. This horror movie serves as more than just a sketch show of creative and elaborate traps rigged to kill those in its way, it is essentially a psychological mystery thriller about two men piecing together how they came to be the latest victims in a puppets game whilst also solving the puzzle that is... the identity of Jigsaw killer.The film is of course unsettling and disturbing, It's a torture porn horror film after all. The film successfully creates this uncomfortable feeling with the use of creative camera-work, good direction, nauseous plot points and (fortunately) minimal jump scares.Would you like to play a game? Let's play count the flashbacks. The film is overly reliant on the use of flashbacks that the film even contains flashbacks within flashbacks. The infamous Head trap is one of these inception like flashbacks.One other issue I had with the film was the poor/ lack of explanation for major plot points. The key in the bathtub at the very start of the film as well as the reasons for why Adam and Dr Gordon are in this situation as they haven't really done anything wrong. These plot points could have been explained far better then they were so that audience members can actually understand key moments and back story of the film.Overall Saw is a disturbing, creative and scary film that like many good horror films would subject itself to a string of sequels each one worse than the other. But it would not have happened if not for this successful horror thriller that will leave you both disturbed and intrigued to see the next instalment",7,1,3,21 March 2016
Don't Breathe," See No Evil Breathe No Evil
","To those who think that just because someone is disabled that means they are fragile, vulnerable people, just tell them to watch Don't Breathe, a movie about a group of scumbag teens who break into an old blind mans house only to find he isn't as disabled as they thought. This premise has the potential to be a really scary and nail bitingly suspenseful horror thriller and to a degree it was. The film is tense and has you constantly gripped start to finish but isn't particularly surprising or scary overall.Firstly, I think director Fede Alvarez did a good job with this film. When the film feels like it has nowhere left to go due to the contained location of the house, Alvarez finds a new interesting way to manoeuvre the film into another room and situation. A complete change from the blood and gore of the Evil Dead remake, Don't Breathe showcases Alvarez's directing range in the horror genre. This film works more as a suspense thriller than a horror film but either way Fede Alvarez will keep you suspensfully entertained until the end.The main issue with the film for me was the lead character, Rocky. I didn't like her at all. SPOILER ALERT, sure she had a sister who she wanted to get out of the abusive sh*t hole that is their mothers home, but she basically emotionally manipulated Alex to his death even if didn't intend to she still knew. I propose that instead the film should have focused on Alex and gave him the sister and sh*t home life and still have him say no to the blind mans house, but have the change of heart be motivated by his younger sibling. It also wouldn't have follow the 'final girl' cliché in horror movies, which would have been a nice change for once.Overall, Don't Breathe is a well directed suspense thriller that isn't particularly scary or surprising but will definitely keep you hooked. What i've noticed about this film is that damn those kids can take a beating and that 'turkey baster to the mouth' bit was absolutely hilarious I mean literally laugh out loud. But anyway, all hilarious semen filled meat utensils aside, Don't Breathe is a good movie that will, dare I say it, leave you BREATHLESS!",7,0,3,22 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty in the eyes of the beholder
","In 1991, Beauty and the Beast made cinematic history, becoming the first animated film ever to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. Now 26 years later the film is given the live action treatment by Disney, following the success of other such films like; Maleficent, Cinderella and The Jungle Book. 2017's Beauty and the Beast retells the same story from 26 years ago, but with impressive visuals and good acting, this film serves as an acceptable remake of the classic original.The film is visually stunning, the cinematography and visual effects work perfectly together to bring these, once animated characters and settings to life. This is really all the film needed to achieve as the story itself is exact same as the original 1991 animation, bar a few plot point tweaks. Now that visual effects and animation has come along way since the 90s, Disney wants to flaunt this with these remakes, as evidenced by The Jungle Book winning a visual effects Oscar at this years academy awards. Beauty and the Beast isn't as CGI heavy and thus visually impressive as Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book, but it is still beautiful to look at nonetheless.The acting as a whole was decent from the films all star cast, with a particularly good performance from Luke Evans as Gaston. Luke Evan's completely outshines everyone in this film including its lead's Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. Evans sings impressively well and without the aid of autotune *cough* Emma Watson *cough*. This overall theatrical performance steals the entire show and completely makes this film worth remaking.Also as a whole the film is well directed by Bill Condon, slowing the pace to give way to more character development and to express the time taken for the two title characters to fall in love. The controversial (to certain countries) direction taken with LeFou was done in such a delicate and implicit manner which was good to see, and also made this film feel more contemporary.Overall, Beauty and the Beast does all it needed to do. It's a well acted and visually stunning film that tells the same story from 26 years ago. I commend Bill Condon and Luke Evans for their work on this film, and thanks to them this remake isn't just a heartless cash grab. It may not be the most impressive of the live action remakes, but is by far the most enjoyable in my own opinion.",7,0,3,2 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Star Lords Episode 2: The Daddy issue strikes back
","Three years ago James Gunn proved to the world a number of things; 1) You can make a great superhero movie based off heroes that aren't already household names, 2) The 1980's had a lot of awesome songs that you didn't know where awesome back then, 3) you can get a good acting performance from a wrestler who isn't the Rock. And finally, 4) you can turn the funny fat guy from Parks and Recreation into a freaking sex symbol. It's fair to say Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has quite a tough act to follow... Fortunately, Gunn follows up his space epic as best he realistically could, with a film that feels even more 80's than its predecessor.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a fun, escapist action movie that is very reminiscent of the action films of the 1980's. In fact, I view this film as James Gunn's attempt at making a light hearted, super cheesy and clichéd 80's action blockbuster, in an age where all blockbusters are dark and super serious. Hell Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell are in this film, how much more 80's action can you get? I commend Gunn for attempting to expand what the soundtrack of his last film achieved, and for giving the audience some good quality, escapist fun.Of course, this film looks beautiful. The visual effects, costume, makeup, production design and everyone else who helped bring this galaxy to life really outdoes themselves. I honestly found myself suspending utter disbelief, thanks in large part to the realistic detail put into everything on screen. I also praise James Gunn again for making a very stylistic film that although is far from original, still manages to somehow feel fresh.But what about the team we have all come to love I hear you cry? They are all back, yes even Vin Diesel, and they haven't changed a bit. Chris Pratt plays the very Chris Pratt like Star Lord, who is just as Chris Pratt like as ever. Zoe Saldana is still your least favourite and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return also to voice act Rocket and Groot, as previously confirmed, yes, Vin Diesel is credited for this. Personally, my favourite actor and Guardian in this film has to be Dave Bautista as Drax. Bautista nails the character and every line he is given like a goddamn Batista Bomb. He is absolutely hilarious in this film, and thankfully saves James Gunn's rather unfunny script with his excellent comedic delivery.Speaking of Gunn's script, lets get into some of the issues shall we? This film is filled with a lot of one liners and jokes, which is fine if they are either; A) funny and frequent or B) Unfunny and infrequent. The jokes in Vol.2 are unfortunately unfunny and far too frequent, I've heard people refer to this film as more of a comedy with action than an action film with comedy, to which personally I believe this should be the latter. Gunn really needed to hold back with the jokes in this film, I understand why they're there as I read this as an 80's action film made in 2017, but lots of these jokes feel really forced to the point where it's almost like Gunn is exclaiming 'laugh god damn you!' The film is also very predictable, this isn't the issue for me as again it fits with the 80's aesthetic. My problem is with the different plots going on at once and how they remain, for the most part, disjointed for the majority of the films run time. It makes this film drag on a little bit longer than you would wish. Also the fact that Pratt, Saldana and Bautista don't really do anything for 80% of the film, and more or less wait around on Planet Dad for the finale to happen. This was annoying if you ask me. I almost wanted to poke them with a stick and say 'shoot something.'All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the best possible follow up Gunn could have crafted, in my opinion. The film is visually stunning but the script could have done a bit more with its story and a little less with its attempts at humour, just cut to Drax or Groot and laughter is guaranteed. This film is far from original but finds other ways of staying fresh and fun. The Guardians trilogy looks to compete for the best MCU trilogy yet. Will Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 be as good, if not better than the first two, and surpass Captain America as the best MCU trilogy? Tune in next time as the Guardians of the Galaxy will return.",7,4,6,11 May 2017
Steve Jobs," The Asshole of Apple
","Two years after Joshua Michael Stern's Jobs, Aaron Sorkin would aim to rectify the story of the man who made apple by penning Steve Jobs. The film suffered a disastrous pre production which saw top talent such as David Fincher, Christen Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio turn down the film and the film was even dropped by the Sony conglomerate. Fortunately for Aaron Sorkin, his adaptation would see the light of day as director Danny Boyle and actor Michael Fassbender would eventually confirm and stick with the project through to completion... Only for it to flop in the box office. On the bright side though Aaron Sorkin got a Golden Globe for all his troubles.Speaking of Aaron Sorkin's Golden Globe win, the films script is interesting as it focuses on the Steve's personal failures than his career achievements. Highly selective and dialogue heavy, this character study set during three Steve Jobs tech presentations aims to present the unlikable genius that didn't seem to do much. As Steve says 'I play the orchestra', but from what this film suggests, that quote simply means he uses people for personal gain. Ironically this film achieves very little (on the personal side), despite it being about a extremely successful man. By the film's close Steve doesn't make amends with many of the people in his life and in real life he remained estranged from his daughter. This aims to mirror what really happened and what Steve really did but it leaves you with no sense of closure when the credits roll.As mentioned earlier, Michael Fassbender takes on the role of Steve Jobs in this biopic. Fassbender is arrogant and extremely unlikable as jobs and so does a particularly good job worthy of the Oscar nomination he received. Fassbender is surrounded by an equally good ensemble cast; Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogan are terrific in this film. Seth Rogan I found most impressive, shifting away from comedy to do drama successfully in his portrayal of Steve Wozniak. The collective collaboration of the cast play a huge part in the enjoyment and quality of the film and should be applauded.The only real critique of this film is that it could have focused on and done more with the character its about. The film is extremely selective and misses out some major moments in Steve Jobs' life; such as the birth of Apple, his involvement with pixar, the iPod and his cancer. I do on the other hand understand that the film would want to be more than a by-the-numbers biopic and of course there is the Ashton Kutcher Jobs that the film makers of this film would not want to repeat, so i'll give this film the benefit of the doubt in that respect as well as this being a character study of the man and not a walk-through of his achievements that everybody probably knows about.Overall Steve Jobs is a well acted, well written film that focuses on the man and not the legend that is Stev Jobs. Although the film could arguably done and/or covered more of Jobs' life the film doesn't fall into by-the numbers biopic by doing so. The first Jobs film was a failure with critics and the second, a failure at the box office. Lets hope this film gains success on other platforms... For Aaron Sorkins sake at least.",6,0,0,20 June 2016
Sausage Party," Sausage Out For Harambe
","Sausage Party is the newest addition to the 'Animated Movies For Adults That People Mistook Was For Kids' list that includes films like Team America and literally every animated movie above a PG rating. With a cast filled with funny comedic actors (and Edward Nortan), this toy story like film about food items journeying to discover the truth of the 'great beyond', should be a laugh a minute... But sadly the cute cartoons doing and saying R rated things gets old really fast.The main issue with Sausage Party is that I don't know if it tried too hard or didn't try hard enough. The film completely overuses its profanity especially the F bomb which in tern weakens the impact of the word both in shock value comedy and as an insult of any kind. The dialogue is basically what you would expect to hear in a Call Of Duty lobby on xbox, a barrage of nonsensical swearing that's only funny due to how completely pathetic it is. The film also heavily overuses food sex jokes and puns which, like swearing, is funny in moderation... Not every God damn sentence. Also the puns aren't exactly original or creative, some of them are but when the film is 89 minutes of food sex puns not every joke is going to work. Also may I add the food orgy scene at the end wasn't funny its just traumatising.What I did find interesting though with this film was its symbolic approach to homosexuality and religion... OK the homosexuality implications became less than subtle as the film went along and ended up a little disturbing just like the rest of the film, but the religion metaphor was good. 'The great beyond' being the food version heaven and the humans being... well... God's, as the food refer to them as.... OK nothing about this film is subtle I'll just admit this now. For me it isn't the symbol of religion that I liked, SPOILER ALERT, it was when Frank confronts and questions the food belief and how this as well in a way challenges Christianity in both their belief of a God and heaven as well as their beliefs of homosexuality. This to me is the redeeming quality as I liked how the film had an underlining meaning that, although not executed brilliantly, still got me thinking.Overall, Sausage Party is a mentally scarring animated picture that attempts to make a statement about religion and homosexuality. It completely overuses the humour of watching a cartoon swear and have disturbing CGI sex but some jokes are actually quite funny. Is it as good as other animated films for adults like Team America? No, but I would say its worth a watch.... Just don't bring your kids along... Unless they play a lot of xbox",4,3,10,17 September 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Where that it twas so simple
","The Cohen Brothers new film Hail Caesar is a visually stunning recreation of 1950's movie studios and the films they made. This film is a good homage done in Cohen Brothers fashion... But something just didn't sit right with this one. It's a good film, there's just more that could have been done and I felt something was missing.To start the acting was great. Josh Brolin and Alden Ehrenreich are great in the film. Everyone else don't really get much screen time excluding George Clooney of course. The rest of the acting was fine, nothing outstanding or terrible but then again there wasn't much screen time for some so its hard to judge.I liked the political and religious elements of the film, with Capitalism vs Communism world and capitalist business the movie industry was at the time. The studio name was a nice touch to reinforce the political conflict.The religious nature of Hail Caesar (movie within this movie) would lead to a rather interesting confrontation between different religions on how Jesus should be portrayed, this was good and was amusing especially when going off at a tangent, poking fun at the logic of movies which is always fun. I did however fail to see the purpose of Josh Brolin's confessions and religious opinion on the grand scheme of things, but it did reveal about his character quite nicely, presenting a rather likable person whose job has him worrying over 101 things at once, even a kidnapping. But the first thing he tells the father is that he smoked a cigarette when he promised his wife he'd quit.My problem I think with this film was the events that unfold. The kidnap was almost forgotten about and didn't really conclude rather well. I would have preferred if the kidnap was given a bit more attention and doesn't end in the communists leaving George unguarded so he can simply leave. I know the film is about the many problems the studio head/ fixer has to deal with and the importance of image and keeping them up, but the film was advertised as a ransom kidnap film and was not really.Overall Hail Caesar is an alright film. Alright by the Cohen Brothers Standards. Not their best or worst. But it was a good homage to 50's cinema with the Cohen's mark on it. The story and plot could have been tackled better or done differently but other than that its fine.",5,2,3,12 March 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Twasn't Beauty that killed the Beast
","From the people who were able to make a Godzilla movie with only 11 minutes of Godzilla, comes another reboot of cinemas other most iconic monsters, King Kong. Kong: Skull Island is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly and the list goes on and on and on. It's a solid blockbuster film but lacks any and all kinds of emotional engagement.This reboot is not the classic empire-state-building-finale Kong everyone has come to know the giant gorilla by, but instead tells a rather self contained adventure story. Due to the nature of this narrative, the film is going to require a lot of CGI, prosthetic and anything and everything that can help bring monsters to life. I have to hand it to them, the films visuals are spot on, the visual effects as well as production design and cinematography, come together perfectly to make what is a very good looking movie.The action sequences as well are well shot and edited and enjoyment is easy to be had, my own personal favourite scene involves giant skeletons/fossils, flammable soil and a digesting Camera. Need I say more. It's a very well directed scene and features a very interesting hint of the horror genre.Although the film looks good and has well directed scenes, the film lacks a lot of substance as it doesn't have any developed characters at all, bar the exception of John C. Reilly. The film features an all star cast and distributes screen time as evenly as it can between them. Regardless, no one is given enough time for the audience to form an attachment with, and so everyone feels extremely disposable. Anyone, including Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, could have died and I wouldn't have given a single f*ck. Personally, Tom Hiddleston was wrongly cast in this film, or needs to drop his natural posh boy voice, and put on American accent or anything remotely macho if he is to play the archetypal masculine hero role. This is a King Kong film so really the protagonist should be King f*cking Kong. Although the lack of focus on the title character isn't as bad as the Gareth Edwards Godzilla movie, it is however frustrating to have to follow the story of a bunch of disposable humans I don't care for.... It's Aaron Taylor Johnson all over again. Also I can't not talk about the Asian girl who was just there for God knows what reason, as well as Toby Kebbell's character being a walking, talking, eulogy writing cliché.As well as having sh*tty characters, Kong: Skull Island has some pretty dumb moments, some of which are absolutely laugh out loud dumb. It's not 'The Fast and the Furious' level of dumb, but the film is stupid to progress the plot. One moment in particular, involving a lake, a rifle being dropped and a guy with two grenades, is just on a completely different level of dumb that I couldn't contain my laughter.Overall, Kong: Skull Island has great style but zero substance. Visually stunning and well shot and directed action sequences, but focuses on uninteresting characters and is dumb for the sake of plot progression. It's an enjoyable, average blockbuster that subtly sets up a sequel and leaves you with anticipation for the second ever Godzilla vs Kong in 2020. Fingers crossed Legendary get it right.",7,0,2,27 March 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," The IlluMINatION Station presents: Dog Story
","Welcome to the Illumination station, home of the Minions and this new animated feature... But mainly the Minions as is made perfectly clear. Secret Life of Pets is the animated film that animal lovers everywhere have been waiting for. The film is one for the kids and has some small references for adults making it, in my book, an fairly average family film.Deriving its story from Pixars Toy Story, Secret Life of Pets tells the story of Max (Woody) who lives in harmony with his owner Katie (Andy) until one day, Katie brings home another dog, Duke (Buzz) who rivals Max. The two have a falling out get lost and must make their way home... Literally the story of Toy Story. The big issue I have with this film is that it is rather unoriginal and easy to come up with in terms of story and jokes. The humour of the film relies heavily on two things; 1) basic slapstick and destruction and 2) funny things animals do that owners can relate to. If you are an animal person then you will love this film, but if you are like me and have no pets then you may like or hate it.This film has many characters. Although there are many characters, it is hard to find any interesting ones. Max and Duke are plain and boring as there really isn't much too them. In Toy Story Woody had control issues and Buzz lived in a fantasy world which made their characters rather interesting whereas in this Max and Duke are just normal dogs. The best character in the film is by far Pops the paralysed dog voiced by Garth from Waynes World. Pops has the best lines and his cynicism made for some universally funny jokes and a character you would remember.Illumination made the Minions movie and this film suffers from the same plot issues as the Minions movie. The films series of events is hectic and all over the place. Although not as bad as the Minions Movie, Secret Life of Pets does suffer from a lack of focus. This lack of focus is what makes this film engaging for children but too hyperactive for adults.Overall Secret Life of Pets is for animal lovers. If you have a pet or pets or simply love anything about animals or Minions then you will enjoy this film. But from my point of view the film is hectic, over populated with simple characters and unimaginative. Animal lovers rejoice!",5,3,13,10 July 2016
Finding Dory," The Fish that Just Keeps Swimming
","In 2003 Andrew Stanton brought us the story of a clown fish who loses his son and goes on a wild adventure, along with the help of a forgetful palette surgeonfish, to find him. 13 years later (or a year later Finding Nemo time), Stanton is back with another underwater tale, only this time focusing heavily on fan favourite Dory. A highly anticipated and long awaited sequel, Finding Dory doesn't disappoint, being a fairly good Pixar film, but it does fail to come anywhere close to the original.The voice acting talent is good. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks slip right back into the fins of dysfunctional dynamic duo Dory and Marlin seamlessly. The casting team on this film must watch be die hard TV fans as the rest of the newly recruited cast come from a wide range of shows, such as: Saturday Night Live, Modern Family, It's Always Sunny In Phillidelphia, Luther and The Wire. As a whole the voice acting is fine and the casting choices made were wise ones indeed.In true Pixar fashion this film aims to appeal to both the kids and the adults in its use of humour. This film has a couple of adult jokes hidden within it but they do seem a little too obvious and forced compared to Pixar's standard. Most notably the 'Mummy's and Daddy's talk' that Dory gets confused about. When I say there are a 'couple' hidden adult jokes I mean like very few, in fact there isn't a lot for adults in this film which is odd considering that the sequel comes 13 years after the original. The film is geared a little too much towards kids and not enough towards the complete family unit. Don't get me wrong there is enjoyment to be had just a couple smiles and exhale-out-the-nose-laughs. In my opinion I would have liked to see more of the seals, especially Gerald as (if it wasn't shown in the trailer) they would have been the funniest thing about this film.The films plot takes from the previous in part but not completely. The motif of the importance of family whether they are genetic or chosen by you was good to see nearer the films close. As well as that, Dory's bonding with Hank the Octupuss was something I rather enjoyed and was interesting to see develop over the course of the film. The film revolves around Dory completely, and so Nemo and Marlin take a big step back in this one. What was good about Finding NEMO for me was the range of different characters and how they all got bits to do. In Finding Dory this happens just not particularly as well as Nemo, for example its felt to me like Marlin and Nemo weren't in the film that much and I almost forgot about everyone else in the film except Dory who has a permanent spotlight on.The films climax feels like it goes on for a while. The close of Finding Dory continues to throw obstacles in the way of its characters and to me this happened a little too much. The ending jumps all over the place and just tried to do too much. I understand this may appeal to shorter attention spans little children will have, but again this sequel comes 13 YEARS after the original so to fans of the original less would be more in this case. I must also add how the films closing shot felt incredibly weak to me, so overall the ending left me rather underwhelmed, maybe play some dramatic happily ever after music or something to give some sense of emotion at the end? Just a thought.Overall Finding Dory is a fair film that pales in comparison to 2003's Finding Nemo.On the scale of Pixar films quality I would say this falls in between Monsters Univerity and The Good Dinosaur. It's a wild adventure that never has a dull moment but is geared a tad too much towards kids and a tad not enough towards the older family members. Another somewhat good film from the animation company that just keeps on swimming",7,1,7,19 August 2016
Arrival," 2016: A Space Odyssey
","2016 has been a pretty odd year for the most part, but for the characters in Arrival the year is going to get even more memorable as their world has itself some alien visitors. Starring Amy Adams and directed by Denis Villeneuve, Arrival keeps the director on a good streak, remaining without a bad feature film under his belt, while also paying homage to Kubrick's 2001 as evident by the orange spacesuits and the curvature of the hospital corridor in the films opening sequence. Lets hope Villeneuve' influence and streak continue with Blade Runner 2049. Please God.This film for the most part is a rather enjoyable aliens-arrive-on-earth movie. A team of scientists and language experts are brought together by the government to attempt to make contact, it follows basic plot conventions and plays as the most realistic and logical reaction America would have to an event like this (other than opening fire immediately). So for the most part the film is an enjoyable viewing of evident plot conventions.However this is not all there is to the film. No sir. The film focuses mainly on language expert, Louise Banks played brilliantly by Amy Adams. Adams' performance in conjunction with Villenuve's heartfelt and realistic construction of the character are a winning combination. Right from the opening sequence you already feel for Louise and are drawn to her as she is established beautifully in an opening montage that meets the ranks of Disney's UP. A short sequence but one that brings great emotion and establishes the protagonist extremely well.As well as a well established lead the film also has a well executed narrative progression. Events progress naturally and questions that both you and the characters have been asking finally get some answers. Thankfully these answers don't disappoint at all, in fact they will blow your mind. Take my word for it that is not an understatement. So please go watch it and tell them Dan sent you.Unfortunately the only issue with this film is that it peaks just a bit too early. Once all questions are answered and the film has hit its peak, the film then continues on and gradually starts to decline a little before the credits actually roll. There is a particular sequence with the Chinese President at a party which I personally felt to be simply ham-handed and thus almost ruins what was a very enjoyable and intriguing film.Overall, Arrival is fantastic sci-fi film with a slightly ham-handed finish but that is largely forgotten about thanks to Amy Adams great performance and Denis Villeneuve's masterful directing. A must see for fans of the genre and film fans. Now that's a proper introduction.",7,1,6,16 December 2016
The Big Short," CDO's CDO's CDO's CDO's CDO's CDO's CDO's
","Have you ever sat down and watched a film, enjoyed it, but have no f*cking idea what just happened and what you just watched? Well that was my experience with the Big Short.Adam McKay, director of many a Will Ferrell comedy including Anchorman, presents the best comedy about the 2008 American economic collapse to date. The screenplay is extremely intelligent and funny as it attempts to explain how exactly the banks ran the housing market into the ground because of greed and stupidity.Christian Bale was underused in this film as Michael Burry, not really given much to do, confined to one room for 90% of his scenes, but to be fair there wasn't much more he could have done due to the truth in the story. Steve Carrel was brilliant as Mark Baum, constantly driven by anger and cynicism. His motivation certainly rubbed off on me as I left the theatre rather riled up (in a good way) for unknown reasons.I don't know anything about banking, not even the basic knowledge the average person would know. CDO's are said a hell of a lot but I still have no idea what a CDO is. Because of this I feel that the problem I have is not necessarily the films fault. It tries to explain how simple banking is and how the bank complicated things through its choice of vocabulary and acronym's, but ultimately, it's narrative was lost on me as I feel it easily could do with some audiences.I would imagine that if I saw this film a second time and really got into the zone, concentrating hard, I would probably understand it. I would still recommend you see the Big Short (especially if your IQ is large) but I would also highly recommend multiple viewings as I think there is more to be learnt and understood about the economic crash the more times you watch it's Oscar nominated film.",6,1,1,12 February 2016
The Conjuring," I came I saw I conjure
","When there's something strange in your neighbourhood, who you gunna call? Real life Ghostbusters Ed and Lorraine Warren. Okay so they don't have proton packs or the Ecto-1 car but what they do have is lots of experience and the the power of Christ on their side. The Conjuring follows the Perron family haunting to which Ed and Lorraine use their ghostbusting abilities to force away the evil witch's spirit that has bonded itself to the family of 7.The opening sequence of the film is creepy as hell and is probably what green lit the Annabelle spin off film. This terrifying opening which acts as a brief introduction to Annabelle makes me wish that James Wan himself made the spin off as the director has proved yet again that he is the best horror movie director of the modern era.James Wan has created a truly scary film that is so thick with tension you would struggle to cut it with a knife. The films scare factor is massively down to the drawn out build up and the fear of the unknown. The escalation of events is fantastic as the film follows Ed and Lorrains three stages of possession, gradually building to full on exorcism. I especially loved the motif of Hide and Clap and the ambiguity of Rory joining will send shivers down your spine.The idea of the conjuring is fantastic as the 'Based on true events' fact brings another level of fear and authenticity that helps make film even more frightening. The cases Ed and Lorraine worked on can make for more films such as the Enfield Case that is being made helmed by James Wan also. I hope there are more Conjuring films to come directed by Wan.Overall the Conjuring is a good horror film helmed by a great director. If you want proof of the films scare factor then look no further than the certificate rating as the film has been rated 15(R) for no other reason than strong horror. Its the start of what looks to be a great horror franchise and I'll be waiting to see what conjures up next.",8,0,0,10 June 2016
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman: The First Avenger
","If you have followed the DC extended universe like I have, you would know that it's the cinema equivalent of a delayed flight. It just hasn't gotten itself off the ground yet. Man of Steel had a mixed reception (I personally liked it) while Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad were simply bad films. Fortunately this isn't the case for Wonder Woman that has not only managed commercial success, but has gotten both critics and commercial audiences to do something almost unheard of in the world of film... Positively agree. Wonder Woman is the take off the delayed flight that is the DCEU needed, and boy was it needed.Wonder Woman is by far the best DCEU film and this is thanks to Patty Jenkins's brilliant direction. It's been 14 years since Jenkins brought us the very human account of America's first female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos, in the fantastic film that is Monster. Its surprising how long its been since Jenkins did a feature film, but fortunately she hasn't lost her footing with this considerably larger film. Jenkins's greatest success with this film, to me lies in the way she empowers women and handles the characters in this film. Yes this is a feminist film, or at least a film feminists can enjoy, but it doesn't mean men can't enjoy the film either. Wonder Woman doesn't empower woman at the expense of men's masculinity, but instead presents both men and women as equal which must be a film first and is extremely refreshing to see.The film is also visually stunning and surprisingly full of colour, as opposed to the previous three entries to the DCEU. Patty Jenkins finds this sweet spot as the film is paced in such a way as to move quickly and so not to bore audiences, but also slow enough for relationships and characters to develop. Wonder Woman still maintains the DC style established by Zack Snyder in Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, with slo mo speed up action scenes and metallic colour tones, this further express' Jenkins's unbelievable directing, as she is able to make Wonder Woman her own, while also staying true to the traits of the DCEU franchise thus far. I feel Wonder Woman had a lot to prove, with Ghostbusters last year and the failure of live action, female superhero films such as; Elektra, Catwoman and Supergirl. So I'm very pleased that Wonder Woman is a film about a woman, directed by a talented woman, starring a talented actress, and is actually a really good film. The film and those involved have definitely proved themselves/itself even if it/they shouldn't have had to.Which brings me to the next person who should be praised for Wonder Woman, and that is Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot does as Michael Keaton and Heath Ledger did before her, took quite a bit of criticism when initially cast in a superhero film, and then proved the naysayers wrong. Gadot plays Diana Prince with an air of childlike naivety and optimism that really warms you to her, and makes her reminiscent of other heroes you love like Superman and Captain America. Chris Pine is also good in this film, playing more than just the male love interest role and actually being as much of an asset as Diana in this story. The two have a good on screen relationship which, although could have benefited from slightly better dialogue or just something that's a little more mature, the two manage to make the best of it and make a believable pair.Although this film was very good there are some flaws within it. The film is intertextual to other superhero films such as when Diana deflects the bullet in the alley way, as well as the revolving door scene, both of which being references to Christopher Reeves' Superman. I don't have an issue with this reference, however, the film feels very similar to Captain America: First Avenger in several ways; the character of our hero, the World War setting, the real life German soldier villain, the colour palette/ visual style etc. Although Wonder Woman is, in my own opinion, miles better than First Avenger, I can't help but feel the studio is attempting to copy it. Thankfully Patty Jenkins makes the best of this, making Wonder Woman her own. Secondly, although I enjoyed the pacing and relationship of Steve and Diana, I do feel that the film, and their relationship, lacked a little bit of depth. The film is fast moving and their relationship is believable, but I feel that they just reach the minimum amount of depth and development required for the film to be considered good, and so would like to hopefully get a little bit more out of them... But then again I may be being unfair. Finally, there are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of the film, such as; how come she doesn't seem to age in the human world yet aged in the Themyscira? The comics will have the answers to the questions I'm sure, but not everyone is aware/ has read/ has the time to read the comics. However I will give the film the benefit of the doubt that it may explain things in future films.To conclude, Wonder Woman is the best DCEU film and the first good female lead superhero film. Handled phenomenally by a used-to-be-underrated director and with great acting performances from Chris Pine and Gal Gadot, Wonder Woman is a solid origin story that incorporated it's feminist messages correctly. Although some aspects remain unexplained, the depth of the film is merely passable, and the last act verges on the cusp of being too CGI heavy, Wonder Woman is able to overpower and overshadow its minor flaws with the mountains of good it was able to achieve. I wanted this film to be good and thank goddess it was.",8,3,9,12 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Battle of the Butt Chins
","Batman and Superman, two of the greatest superheroes of all time squaring off in toe to toe. It's going to be epic... Until you actually see it that is. This film had the making and source material to be one of the greatest superhero films but this film just isn't a good film period.The film opens with the Wayne family tragedy which everyone and their grandma knows all too well, coupled with narration from Batfleck himself going for the most unoriginal movie opening sequence imaginable.This is then followed by Bruce Wayne driving into a collapsing Metropolis as Superman and Zod fight at the close of Man of Steel. Although being a kick ass scene I cannot help but say to myself 'Wouldn't he be of actual use and actually be able to save someone if he was in the bat suit flying the bat wing?' You could argue the lack of time on his part but when has movie magic stopped you from doing anything. In fact I would argue if he was in the bat suit it would actually establish why the two hate each other...... Which brings me to my next point. Why do they hate each other? I can understand why Bruce Wayne hates Superman because he killed that one employee he liked in the opening, but it is not explained as to why Superman hates Batman. Clark Kent does talk about Batman being a vigilante being the reason, but hello, superman is a vigilante too in fact that is basically the basis of the film for the majority. The film really did fail in being clear in its motives.There is a continual lack of logic and continuity as the film progresses and becomes so apparent that it leaves you scratching you head thinking 'WTF???'. I have no idea what the dream within a dream sequence about a post apocalyptic Batman and a weird dude crawling out a light portal to tell Bruce something was all about, and the latter isn't even followed up on. This even reaches the point of being laughable when Wonder Woman watches a live news broadcast on a TV located on the back of a air plane passenger seat. The filmmakers must know that those TV's don't do that right?Which again brings me swiftly on to my next point of Wonder Women. What was the point of her? She was literally pointless. This leaves me to conclude her inclusion in this film to be purely economic rather than serving any real purpose to this particular film. Her only saving grace is her involvement in future films being made perfectly clear but she really could have been placed in the film the same way that the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg where.I enjoyed the action sequences for the most part. That I will admit, but the final fight against Doomsday takes the mick. The film becomes more of a Lazar light show which if you are lucky you may be able to work out what is going on. Also add to that the slightly rushed feel of the final act of the film and that the kryptonite spear is placed in water for some reason and not retrieved by Aquaman creating a missed opportunity that I'm sure many where expecting and exited to see happen but didn't. And you got yourself a rather less than satisfactory showdown on your hands.Overall Batman vs Superman is crushed by hype and is sadly a deeply disappointing movie. Constant cuts to black and white as well as confusing plot development, lack of logic, CGI overkill, unclear or unexplained plot points etc etc etc. The film is a massive waste of potential which disappointed me even when I had average expectations. This is the start of the DC universe calendar and I sure hope they get better. Plus I'm not looking forward to seeing that annoying little not-Kevin-Spacey Lex Luther again that's for sure. Fingers crossed Suicide Squad is good.",3,3,6,5 April 2016
Rear Window," Jeff be peeping while you sleeping
","From cinemas leading auteur, Alfred Hitchcock comes the story of L.B. Jefferies, a photography who has been bound to a wheelchair after getting in the middle of a race car crash and now spends his days spying on the neighbours. One day the curious Jefferies begins to notice something isn't quite right with his neighbours the Thorwarld's and thus begins an investigation in search of the truth. It's a classic Hitchcock suspense thriller that plays on the themes of paranoia and voyeurism ans not only deals with issues behind other peoples closed doors but also talks of the voyeurism associated with cinema going.The film keeps you guessing as the suspected crime remains just that, suspected. What unravels is an ambiguous psychological mystery for the most part as we are lead to question whether a crime has actually been committed or is Jefferies simply fixating on little things and trying to make his own narrative from them. As I previously stated if we step back and point the finger at ourselves and see what Hitchcock is saying about us, the viewer and our attempts to piece together the plots of peoples lives be it in real life or magnified on a cinema screen.The film, like Jefferies, not only fixates on the the Thornwald's but also shows follows the lives of the other, rather eccentric neighbours, such as the fire escape couple and Miss Lonely hearts and the songwriter. These stories are intriguing as they seem to remain rather realistic as in little transpires in their lives over the course of the film with a few exceptions, but somehow you find yourself intrigued by their lives despite of the seemingly eventfulness of their home lives. This again speaks to the voyeurs in the audience, which it appears I am one of.Overall, Rear Window is a contained film (pun intended) that conveys an intriguing message about voyeurism and cinema going. It's interesting to see as one of Hitchcock's essentials as that in itself could begin a debate of whether that is accurate but I think I'll just leave it here.",7,1,2,30 September 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Let the Nightmares begin
","Horror movies aim often aim to keep their frightened audience up at night, and no film has made this their aim more that the Nightmare on Elm Street series. This classic horror film is very much of its time but its rather original concept will leave you paranoid once the lights go out for bed.The acting of this film is as expected from an 80's teen slasher movie. Heather Langenkamp makes a decent scream queen but overall its not great, but it did introduce the world to Johnny Depp who plays the incompetent boyfriend who just can't stay awake to save his life (literally). Robert Englund doesn't have much to do in this film at all, hiding in the shadows for the majority of the films run time, but there are many sequels to which he features more heavily.The film is interestingly both generic and original. The idea of a man killing people in their dreams is a really unique concept that is one of the reasons the film has become infamous, but the film also follows many teen slasher movie genre conventions. The parents are useless, the teens are dumb and there is also a scene where a teenage girl investigate strange sounds in the dark while wearing nothing but a mans shirt. The film has this interesting concept with creative kills but at the same time divulges into another generic slasher film.One thing I came to notice about watching this film in 2016 was how of-its-time this film is. I slept like a rock after watching the film, it did not scare me. But I realise that if I was watching this film in 1984 then it would most likely be the complete opposite, but then again i'll never know.Overall A Nightmare on Elm Street is a generic teen slasher film with a creative concept that appears rather dated today. I have no idea what happened at the end of the film other than it was still a dream but maybe there are Easter eggs hidden throughout the rest of the series to explain that. P.S. I swear the street name is never addressed at all in this film.",6,0,2,1 June 2016
Life," Alien Appetiser
","In the same year as Ridley Scott's official return to the Alien franchise since 1979 (Prometheus wasn't really an Alien movie more a teaser for one), we are given another Alien vs astronauts, Sci Fi horror film from the director of Safe House, the screenwriters of Zombieland and Deadpool, as well as starring Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds, and one of the best working actors today, Jake Gyllenhaal. Life is about a group of astronauts that discover alien life, but as it turns out they don't 'come in peace' and now it's a fight for survival. The film is a fun genre thrill ride but doesn't offer anything new to the genre pioneered by Ridley Scott's Alien (1979).The most enjoyable aspect of this film by far is its genre thrills. The film takes the claustrophobic space horror genre and does it justice. The films sinister tone and nail biting tension are created effectively and there are some decent scares in this film. The film takes its genres formula and uses that formula effectively to create what is a very enjoyable sci fi horror genre film. The film also looks gorgeous, the visual effects are beautiful and the cinematography is OK albeit a little sea sickening with the upside down low gravity scenes. So on a consumer level, this film is good, it looks great and uses a winning formula effectively. The film is also well acted by its whole cast. No one really stands out, Rebecca Ferguson was good, Ryan Reynolds was Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal is good, but isn't on his A game here. But overall there is little to fault the actors on in this film.Now, what frustrated me with this film was it's ending. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a really good twist, but unfortunately for me it was ruined by a particular fan theory circulating this film. The theory is that this film is the origin story for the upcoming Venom movie. I still love the films ending but having that theory in mind I found myself predicting the films final moments minutes before they happened. I believe the Venom theory to be false and that this is an original standalone film, and the fact a Venom film is coming out is pure coincidence, but either way we will have to wait and see to find out if that was Sony's plan all along.Also, the film could have tried to be more risky and original to make the film stand out and simply be better. As I said the film uses its genre very well but does nothing new for the trapped-in-space-with-a-malevolent-alien genre. This film is literally a retelling of Ridley Scott's Alien which I like to think I've made clear by the name dropping in my introduction. Character development could also be improved on, as it is attempted to an extent and works with some characters, such as Sho, but the majority of the cast are given little to no background information, and so later plot points had little impact.Overall, Life is a fun and enjoyable genre film. With fun thrills, a decent cast and beautiful visuals, Life is a winning formula of sci fi horror. Character development could be improved upon and the film could be more risky, but Life acts as a nice appetiser for Ridley Scott's return to Alien with Alien Covenant.",7,2,7,17 April 2017
Deadpool," Ryan Reynolds Redemption
","I, like most people, am so glad that Deadpool fondled Wolverines smooth criminals to get this movie made, ironically making a movie better than both stand alone Wolverine films. Deadpool is funny, exciting and meta as f, more than redeeming itself from X men Origins Wolverine... *shudder*From the opening title sequence of the film it is clear that we are in for a kick ass ride with a film that will take the mick of itself and everything else in pop culture with it.Van Wilder himself, Ryan Reynolds was great in this film, proving to everyone that he was born to play the merc with the mouth. Everyone's least favourite Transporter Ed Skrein plays the evil British villain Ajax really well in this film, gaining some redemption of his own.What I like about this film is how it is able to be funny but have heart as well. Wade Wilson isn't just a 4th wall breaking, sex and chimichanga joking loud mouth, he is also a guy dying of cancer who has fallen deeply in love. The film also has some rather dark and disturbing moments but also manages to blend back into the wise cracking ways of Wade Wilson.This film had to be rated 15 (R) as the film just simply would not have worked if it was commercialised for everyone with a 12A certificate or lower. Deadpool has to be the Merc with the mouth and a 15 certificate allowed Deadpool to be Deadpool rather than a bald mutant with his mouth sowed shut... oh wait.Deadpool is an absolute blast. The action is good, the jokes are hilarious and the film even has its emotional moments. It'll make you laugh, cry and both at the same time. Tim Miller's Directorial Debut is a good one with a good script and great acting throughout. My hopes for the future are that they stick true to the character with it's Rated R certificate and don't do to Deadpool what they did to John McClane..... Stick to 15 Fox.",8,2,10,18 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Kick Ass Keanu 2
","Keanu Reeves is back as John Wick, An unstoppable retired hit-man now with a new pooch by his side. But, when an old debt must be repaid, John finds himself pulled right back into the criminal underworld he has tried to leave behind. The first John Wick was a great, straight up high concept action film, and arguably won the retired-hit-man-comes-back-out-of-retirement movie clash with Antoine Fuqua's The Equalizer. So I went in with rather high hopes for John Wick: Chapter 2... And thankfully the film does not disappoint.Say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting ability. Yes his British accent was terrible in Bram Stoker's Dracula and aside from the stoner/ surfer dude character he plays in films such as; the Bill and Ted series and Point Break, Keanu hasn't really pulled off a great acting performance, and I'm not saying his acting is Oscar worthy here either... But Keanu does have something going for him.... Boy can he do stunts. What makes John Wick: Chapter 2, and the series thus far, so satisfying is that it is obvious to us, the audience, that the lead actor is actually performing his own stunts. Keanu is very gun savvy, and he is very believable as an expert hit-man through his physical acting. All that training on all his action movies throughout his career really shine through in this film.Speaking of stunts, Oh my god the stunt work in this film is phenomenal. Chapter 2 is directed by, director of the first John Wick film, and long time Keanu Reeves stunt man, Chad Stahelski. This man clearly knows his sh*t as proved by his stunt work for such great films as; The Matrix, Point Break, 300, Spider-Man 2 and The Hunger Games 1 and 2. As well as this, Stahelski has also directed 2 brilliantly choreographed and all round great action films. Not only does the film have fantastic fight choreography, but Stahelski positions the camera, in such a way, so that we can actually see and understand what is happening in these sequences. It's very common for an action film to use shaky hand-held camera and rapid fast editing in their action sequences, and this always makes the sequence hard to follow as well as disorientating for the audience. Stahelski doesn't really use these techniques, he instead has the stunts take place in camera in a long shot, so we see Keanu Reeves fight about 4 or 5 guys in a row all in one take. This is very refreshing to see in an action film and it is obvious that Stahelski knows what is good and bad in stunt choreography as well as presenting that choreography to an audience through his direction. I would also like to applaud the sound guys on this film as a lot of the heart pounding action is attributed to the films earth shattering sound.The films story is also rather interesting as it unearths the underworld within the John Wick series. This film is a mafia film of sorts, filled with criminal bosses, organised crime on an international scale, and of course, Italy. The film does everything a sequel should do, it expands on the world established in the original Film, while also staying true to what made the original film so good. Chapter 2 tells another high concept, hero-pulled-back-into-their-old-life and revenge story, filled with excellent action sequences, as well as expanding the John Wick universe in the form of a mafia movie. This film just simply does everything expected of it and more.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a movie sequel that should go down in history, as it is a perfect example of a sequel doing everything it should do. Brilliantly directed by Chad Stahelski, a well written script by Derek Kolstad, great sound, great stunt work and a decent performance by Keanu Reeves. What more can you ask for? John Wick: Chapter 3 that's what.",9,2,5,23 February 2017
Joy," Jennifer Lawrence and her asshole family
","Joy is the third time David O Russell, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper have worked together, and this time its meh. It's an average film, not amazing, not awful, just OK. This film is one for the feminists, a woman becoming successful no matter how much the white man tells her no.The only likable character in this film is Joy herself (her ex husband as well sort of). Everyone else in the film is so irritating as they are such horrible people especially toward Joy, who they treat more like a slave than there blood relative. This does help in making the audience like Joy even more but it also wants them to see her gun them down in the films climax, which I'm sad to say does not happen.I don't know why the film was narrated by Joy's grandmother, I guess either to save money or Morgan Freeman was busy.One other thing which I thought was particularly good about Joy was it's parody of soap operas and how they are complete and utter bull, but lazy and stay at home mothers lap up every second of it. I believe that, because of this, the film gained it's comedy genre as this film is not funny at all and it doesn't even seem to try, I do not understand why its been given that genre.Plus I swear Joy was an absent parent to her son as she does have one, we just see her spend time with only her daughter, this is probably more due to the feminist messages the film aims to convey but because of the amount of things Joy has to juggle, it to me, came across more that she (and the filmmakers) simply forgot about him.Joy's OK, it isn't at all high on my recommendation list but if anyone was thinking of seeing Joy I wouldn't encourage or discourage them.",5,4,10,12 February 2016
The Nice Guys," A Shane Black comedy n'stuff
","What do you get when you cross Cutris Hanson's LA Confidential with Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang? The answer is this entertaining crime comedy centred around a porn film in 1977. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe make an unlikely pairing as together they investigate a missing persons case which escalates quickly into insanity and hilarity.Russell Crowe portrays Jakson Heely, a character who shares similarities with his LA Confidental character Bud White. Crowe plays the brute with a softer side fairly well, making a mini comeback after some less than stellar performances in films such as Les Miserables. As good as Crowe is, he isn't the stand out star of this show, the would go to Ryan Goslings brilliant performance as the alcoholic buffoon Holland March. Gosling embodies the clown role of the film, perfectly executing the many, many gags he's faced with delivering. Goslings performance plays a big part in my enjoyment of this film and finally shows that the actor isn't just a pretty face.The film is a funny film, thanks to Crowe and Gostling for their delivery is definitely in order for the films humour working, but their delivery would have been for nothing if the script wasn't funny to start with. Also the direction and editing are also great in pulling off some of the physical comedy of the film. Long story short the team behind this film work brilliantly together to compliment one another and create a genuinely amusing movie.The only issue I had with this film was the crime story itself. As the film progresses it seems to shift from a mysteriously cursed porn film to yet another government conspiracy to which I am still confused as to how that was resolved. The films climax centres around our protagonists retrieving a porn film to which the story is evidence against the department of justice for illegal activity... But everyone involved in the films making is dead and its a PORN film, so I'm struggling to see how this singular piece of pornographic evidence is enough to take down someone high up in the ranks of the police force. Sure Chet is alive to testify but that is never specified and is that really enough?Overall The Nice Guys is a really nice film. Although the overall story gets a bit sh*t the characters and the humour will compensate for this to the end. Ryan Gosling gives the performance of his career so far and deserves a special mention for his work on this film. This is a cool movie filled with porn, murder n'stuff.",8,2,5,5 June 2016
Warcraft," League of Dota
","Video game based movies have a pretty bad track record and has yet to have an adaptation that is critically acclaimed. Is Duncan James' Warcraft: the Beginning the film to end that bad streak? Sadly not as the film has been panned by critics and doesn't get a particularly good review right here either.The visual effects in this film are OK. The CGI looks very similar to Blizzard's cinematic adverts for the World of Warcraft games. The effects are a focus for this film as the fantasy genre demands lots of practical and visual effects for it to work. Although impressing in some shots, the special effects look really fake in other scenes, taking the wow factor out of the World Of Warcraft.The acting is fairly poor. Travis Fimmel's, Paula Patton's, Domonic Cooper's and Ben Foster's performances bring nothing good to the film and their characters are ultimately uninteresting. The film also brings in some kind of young mage who I think is only there to explain to the other characters and the audience whats going on, both in Technical jargon followed by layman's terms. The lack of care I felt towards the films characters is not solely down to the acting as the script doesn't help them much either, not really giving the actors much to work with to some extent. There were attempts to bring a personal touch to these characters such as Lothar's son and Garona's backstory told at a fire place, but these are a too brief to bring any real impact.The films plot to me felt like you needed to have some knowledge of the realm of Azeroth to which the film is set. Being a noob of the WoW world I only understood the plot at its most basic level. The Orc's ruthless dictator steals the souls of people as a source of energy to open up a portal so the orcs can take over the human world. Then generic heroic man leads humans to stop this threat. This feels like a movie made for the fans of the game which it should be. So for fans of the WOW games this is a must see but for novices like myself, maybe not.Overall, Warcraft is an OK movie but is one that you should go in with some knowledge of the game if you want to understand the film better. This is sadly not the film to break the video game to movie adaptation curse. Hopefully the Assassin's Creed movie fairs better. Fingers crossed because I love me some Assassin's Creed.",4,20,37,12 June 2016
Alien: Covenant," It's Xenomophin Time
","The Alien film franchise has had its fair share of ups and downs ever since the Xenomorph burst, pun intended, onto the big screen in Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece. Now after 1 average prequel, 1 good sequel, 2 bad sequels and 2 crossovers that sadly happened, the Xenomorph is back in the prequel sequel that is Alien: Covenant. Ridley Scott directs his 3rd film in the Alien world and 2nd 'Alien' titled film, which aims to link his two previous instalments to the franchise, Prometheus and Alien, in what is a fun genre thrill ride, but alas never reaches its true potential.Ridley Scott is one of the greatest sci fi directors of all time, bringing us such classics as Alien, Blade Runner and recently, The Martian. Similar to Prometheus, regardless of what people actually think of the film, we can all agree that it looks beautiful. Scott yet again proves that his visual sense for sci fi is simply unmatched, the cinematography and sheer amount of in camera visuals are mind blowing, deeply disturbing and brooding as hell. Covenant's sci fi horror genre thrills are extremely effective, thanks to Scott's impeccable eye for the genre's in question, as well as his longstanding relationship with the Alien franchise. He was the man who introduced us to H.R Giger's iconic monster.The genre thrills in Alien: Covenant are most effective, in my opinion, because you care for the characters within the Covenant team. With all horror films you know many characters are simply disposable. In Covenant however this isn't entirely the case. There are obviously some characters that you know are dead the second they walk on screen, but a lot of relationships are established and thus emotional involvement is encouraged with our hopeless protagonists. I found myself drawn to the character Daniels, not necessarily because of Katherine Waterston's performance as she wasn't that great, but because of the personal story she is given throughout the film.Speaking of performances, the acting was top notch in this film and actually surprising. Katherine Waterston is decent in this film and I believe I owe her a little more credit than I've given in my last statement. Also, to my surprise Danny McBride didn't play the terribly annoying comic relief you would expect in horror films, he was actually one of the best actors in this film with what is easily the performance of his career. Best of all is Michael Fassbender's characters, who are both extremely compelling and to which the scenes they share are simply an masterclass in sophisticated acting.It is a shame however that one of the films biggest flaws lies with the treatment of Fassbender's character towards the films close. The films twist is hinted at quite subtly at first but in the films climax the clues given are far too obvious that you can see the twist immediately. There are several shots Scott should have cut from the film in order to maintain the mystery, rather than clumsily giving it away before the third act has even started. This loss of subtly subsequently takes all impact away from what could have been a fantastic ending and leaves all who watch it rather disappointed, regardless of what they thought of the film as a whole.There lies Covenant's greatest let down, it offers interesting concepts but fails to follow through on that idea to its full potential. The Neomorph is one of the biggest missed opportunities with this film. Far from the monstrosity that was the newborn in Alien: Resurrection, the Neomorph has a very gruesome introduction that is morbidly satisfying, even if Faris (the mechanic/medic) was extremely annoying. As well as this, the Neomorph's development to something almost humanlike is absolutely fascinating, but unfortunately this is only the free trial, if we want to see more we'll have to wait for Alien Prequel 3/ Prometheus 3, and hope there is more to the Neomorph than what we have already seen. Please Ridley don't let us down.. Again.Alien: Covenant as a whole offers some very interesting ideas which it unfortunately doesn't utilise to its full potential. The film also leaves us with a lorry load of questions which leave you wanting more, but at the same time underwhelming unsatisfied. However with a surprisingly strong cast and a legendary director, Alien: Covenant is an enjoyable genre film that acts as the 'The Empire Strikes Back' of the Prometheus trilogy (although obviously not a patch on 'The Empire Strikes Back'). I'm intrigued as to the possible 6 films Ridley Scott has planned for the franchise, 'Are you not entertained?'",7,1,8,19 May 2017
