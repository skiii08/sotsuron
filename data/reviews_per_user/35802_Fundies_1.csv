The Blair Witch Project," You'll never go camping again
","This mock-documentary is the most terrifying film I've ever seen. Three film students get lost in the woods while shooting footage about a witch legend in New England. The bodies are never found, but all of their equipment turns up, including this extremely raw, realistic footage. Shot on hand-held cameras, both black/white and color. Virtually no gore, but non-stop suspense.",10,1,2,25 June 1999
