Ford v Ferrari," Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing
","Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.This gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.The actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.The story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.In the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre.",9,3,5,2 December 2019
Insidious: Chapter 2," It's different but it does live up to the first chapter
","If you happened to like the first chapter, you will also like the second even though there are a few differences between both movies. First of all, the second chapter kicks off with a more gripping story line and a few good scares while the first part took its time to introduce everybody. As the second movie is based on quite the same characters as the first movie, there is no need to lose precious screening time and the movie doesn't. This movie's pace is definitely faster and quite gripping from the beginning to end.The second movie also has a more complex story line. While the first movie left us with a few unsolved questions and problems, the second film resolves them all in a quite logical way. In fact, there are multiple story lines here that are though easy to digest and to follow and that all lead to a dramatic ending. We see some scenes that happen in Josh's past, other things that have happened in the first movie or just after, a couple of scenes playing in 'The Further' and finally the main story line in the now and here. Some scenes show us the past and present family life of Josh, others focus on the works of the ghost busters who try to help them. All in all, the story in here is much more intelligent and profound than in the first film which is something I didn't expect. The characters are even more attaching than before and you are really happy to see some of them again. In addition to this, the few new characters of good or evil character are really great and welcome additions to the plot. That's why this movie is one of the rare really convincing sequels as it lives up to the brilliant first movie.The movie has a few really good scares of course but overall the first movie was a lot creepier and more disturbing. In fact, you happen to know what is going on if you have seen the first movie and that's why you aren't that shocked or surprised anymore. This being said, you absolutely need to have seen the first film if you want to try out this one because if you don't know the first chapter, you won't fully understand the second.'Insidious - Chapter 2' has a few very memorable scenes and maybe even more than the first one. My favourites were the dice play that unveiled the hidden knife, the creepy but not evil mystery man in the first scene in 'The Further' and the scene with Marilyn and her mother. In some scenes, you can see that the second chapter is not only influenced by its own first part but also by several genre classics. The mystery man recalled me David Lynch's 'Lost Highway' while other scenes reminded me of the evil Bob of 'Twin Peaks'. The ending of the movie has many moments that made me think of the legendary 'The Shining'. I guess these references are more than just good as so is this movie.In the end, you really should watch this horror film of the year in the movie theatres but I may give you a few advices to end up my review. Just avoid going to the movies at popular screening times such as Friday or Saturday night. I have read and also personally experienced a lot of noisy people who are talking all the time and laughing out loud just to calm down and try not to show how afraid they really are. Second, you should keep your feet on the ground and not try to eat or drink too much during the movie. Some scenes suddenly get very scary and could lead you to throw away your popcorn and pour some coke on your clothes or those of your neighbour. If your potential girlfriend isn't all that much into horror movies or a Gothic, please don't take her out to witness such a movie. Third, you shouldn't drink or eat too much before watching this film. The movie has a few uglier scenes than the first one even though they are not disgusting. The thing is that you have a glimpse at a few disturbing things but your vivid imagination might think further and that's where this fantastic movie automatically leads you to a few nastier thoughts. If you have a weak heart, if you are a very nervous person or if you are pregnant, please avoid this movie for your own security.Anyone else, please enjoy this atmospheric contemporary horror masterpiece.",9,57,100,15 September 2013
The Avengers," Nothing truly outstanding but among the better superhero movies
","I will try to analyze this movie from a different point of view than most of the critics do. I went to see this movie without any expectations because of many favourable critics but I haven't seen movies such as Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and so on. Usually, superhero movies are not my cup of tea and I find them rather childish and only focused on special effects and the same old redundant stories.This movie is among the better superhero movies but it's definitely not the big thing many people claim it to be.On the positive side, we have the great 3D effects that are really worth watching this movie in the cinema in comparison to many movies in 3D that are not quite spectacular and only try to raise the gross. The graphics and special effects of this movie are flawless and of the highest modern standards thanks to an exaggeratedly high budget of course.But there are other positive things to find. Robert Downey Jr. does once again an incredible job and becomes a better actor in my estimation each time I see him in a new movie. He is some kind of a slightly crazy but charming dreamer with a sense for romance and cool humour and incarnates the Iron Man in a perfect way. Mark Ruffallo plays a rather calm and intellectual gentleman that becomes the Hulk as soon as he doesn't control his anger. His acting is also very authentic and grounded in this over the top movie. These two actors really impressed me the most but Tom Hiddlestone as the egoistic avenger and half god Loki and the great Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury are also quite convincing while the other actors can't catch up with these four talented actors.On the other side, the story kicks off way too fast and if you don't know much about the Marvel characters, you will feel a little bit lost in the beginning. It's not quite clear who is attacking whom and why in the first couple of minutes but after that, the pace of the movie slows down and introduces the different characters in a solid way. In the case of the Hulk or Natasha Romanov (as she seems to be of Russian origin, her actual name should be 'Romanova' - it's a pity that such a famous movie with such a big budget has this kind of stupid error), the introduction's scenes are amusing and entertaining while the presentations of Captain America or the Iron Man are not very well thought out in my opinion.On the other side, the story of this movie is pretty generic and also predictable. The movie also has some important length in the middle of the film as the superheroes are discussing on the giant airship. The battle scenes in the end of the movie also get rather boring after a while and lack of diversity. The ending is also too much of a common standard to truly impress.In the end, there are almost as many negative as there are positive things to mention but as the quality of the positive facts is quite elevated and a more important factor than the pure quantity and as this movie was almost very well entertaining me over a quite long running time with two little exceptions, I may give a shyly positive seven points to this flick. After all, I might now try out the movies about Hulk and the Iron Man who are my favourite characters in this movie and can't deny that this movie awoke some interest in me to dig a little bit further into the Marvel world I have missed out.",7,2,8,16 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A remedy against sleepless nights
","Are you seeking a remedy against sleepless nights? You won't need any prescriptions to solve your problem. You simply need to watch Blade Runner 2049. Almost everything that could be wrong with a movie is wrong with this one. To start on a positive note, the visual effects are faithful to the original film, the directing is precise and doesn't feature any annoying contemporary shaky camera passages and the last third of the movie quickens up the pace and is at least slightly interesting. These three positive elements explain my rating but I really had to think very hard to find these reasons.Let's talk about this movie's massive problems. First of all, the film is way too long and takes nearly three hours to tell a story that would have justified a length under a hour and a half. The original movie wasn't the most fast-paced genre film ever made but it was bearable with a length just below the two-hour mark.Secondly, the plot is quite tiresome and can be summarized in three sentences. When things finally could start to get interesting, the film actually ends without a resolution. This makes me fear the worst. It's quite probable that there will be a sequel to this sequel which means that even those who haven't appreciated Blade Runner 2049 might feel forced to watch the sequel to know how the story actually ends. If you don't want to go through that dilemma, don't watch Blade Runner 2049 in the first place. While the original film is overrated in my book and doesn't do Philip K. Dick's novel justice, it had at least a coherent plot diagram featuring an exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution.Thirdly, the movie tries to be overtly atmospheric but ends up being pretentious. There are numerous shots when characters walk through decayed landscapes in slow-motion. This idea might work every now and then to emphasize on the dystopian future that serves as setting but the idea is overused and prevents any momentum or pace to build up. The original film was slow as well but also had a few emotional and vivid sequences that contrasted the bleak vision of the future.Fourthly, the soundtrack of this movie is awful despite being written by renowned composer Hans Zimmer. Whenever the movie is dragging on and showing the main character walking through empty buildings for five minutes, the soundtrack suddenly gets louder for no apparent reason but to keep the bored audience awake. This surprising effect got my attention in the beginning but after it was used for a third time in a row, this strategy became laughably predictable. The present soundtrack tries to capture the essence of Vangelis' gloomy compositions for the original film but doesn't even manage to be a rough blueprint of the original score.Fifthly, aside of Harrison Ford's character who returns in the last third of the film when the pace quickens up a little bit, most of the other characters are quite pale. Especially Ryan Gosling's characters is so faceless that you won't care about his destiny at all. Jared Leto's villain character seems to be stolen from a weak episode of a science-fiction television series of the late sixties at best. The few interesting side characters such as Carla Juri's are underdeveloped and only have a few minutes of screen time despite the film's epic length. It's quite ironic that the most interesting character is the main character's holographic girlfriend played by Ana de Armas. The original film had several memorable performances by less talented actors like Rutger Hauer who were pushed by a great director while this film doesn't have that chemistry despite the skilled personnel involved.It was a pain to sit through the entire movie. I felt like walking out of cinema numerous times but I stayed because I had paid for it and because I was expecting a surprising ending. Now I know that I should have walked out. Despite the great director involved, several outstanding actors and actresses on board and even one of the best soundtrack composers in the history of cinema, Blade Runner 2049 is boring, hollow and uninspired. The original film was overrated in my book but this sequel is plain horrible. It's a mystery why this film got such a solid critical acclaim but hundreds of negative reviews prove that I'm not the only one who disliked this vapid flick. For me, Blade Runner 2049 even beats the shallow Kong: Skull Island in terms of negativity and is what I consider the worst film of the year. My suggestion for you is to read Philip K. Dick's novel instead of spending any money on this disaster.",3,18,38,7 November 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Bore Inc. 3.1.: Mocking Gay
","I appreciated the first two movies of the dystopian coming-of-age franchise that is a little bit too closely inspired by 'Battle Royale' but this first part of the third and last instalment is a massive waste of time and a cheap attempt at grabbing some cash from the numerous fan-boys and especially fan-girls. In my opinion, both occasional viewers and faithful fans should ignore this release, read the novel instead, and come back to the cinema for the second part of the grand finale. This movie only prepares for the last part of the series, a little bit like 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' but it's even worse.Everything that I enjoyed about the entertaining first two releases is completely absent in this movie. The story has no tension at all and consists almost only of hollow dialogs. One could almost say that there is no real story. The rebels are trying to turn a few propaganda movies, the population is demonstrating against the Capitol and that's it. Instead of survival action, we get to see depressive and lengthy chamber play scenes in grey bunkers. The colourful and exciting locations are gone and replaced by dark concrete structures that make even the most functional Soviet cities look beautiful. The special effects in this movie are not even close to the breathtaking images from the first two parts. Even the soundtrack of the movie is a lot more generic than before. One of the worst parts of the movie was when main actress Jennifer Lawrence suddenly started to sing. It sent shivers down my spine but in a very negative way and it reminded me of some lyrics from an old Puddle of Mudd song: 'I never wanna hear you sing, you sound just like a little kid.' Jennifer Lawrence' vocal performance must be the worst I have ever witnessed in cinema. Nothing improved in this movie and everything that made the Hunger Games franchise so popular is gone.Even the acting is a lot less convincing than in the first movies as it mostly feels numb and unreal. Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin is pale and not credible at all in her role as nobody would follow such an uncharismatic leader in real life. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee looks like an annoying and old guy who thinks he is funny and cool but happens to be only embarrassing and stupid as he acts like he was mentally retarded. Even the characters I appreciated in the first two movies seem like pale copies of their former selves. I was eager to see Woody Harrelsen in his unique role as Haymitch Abernathy again but he only has a very small role and feels like a completely different character all of a sudden. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is a lot less colourful, eccentric and sarcastic than before. I'm aware of the fact that the general mood of the movie is supposed to be darker and more mature but the acting hasn't become more credible but simply shallower. In an unfitting contrast to this, Jennifer Lawrence is simply overacting her role as Katniss Everdeen. Every five minutes, you see her crying in a corner of her bunker, exaggeratedly hobbling through some ruins and yelling at everybody and everything when she's not pleased with something. In the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie, this acting seems like a welcome change to the tame acting of the others but a few minutes later one gets the impression that the main character has not only become a lot less mature than before but that she is simply out of her mind and dealing with important mental problems. It's not realistic at all to count on a bipolar princess who acts less mature than a twelve-year old and who only cares about her lover even though this is one of the least credible cinematic love stories I have ever seen to lead a revolution. At some point, her cringe-worthy emotional outbursts become unintentionally funny and would rather fit into a slapstick comedy movie.It was incredibly hard to sit through the entire movie. I kept believing as I was hoping for an explosive ending and the only interesting scene of the entire film takes indeed place in the last fifteen minutes but it isn't worth the wait either. Giving three points out of ten in here is still extremely generous. Instead of making me impatiently wait for the final chapter, I'm now seriously asking myself if I should not give up on the franchise. I really liked the first two movies but this one here is plain awful. As I said before, read the novel or a short synopsis but avoid this hollow flick at all costs. It's not worth spending money on it, it wouldn't even be worth watching it if it was for free. This movie is easily the biggest cinematic disappointment of the year.",3,16,22,17 December 2014
The New World," Slow paced documentary instead of a real movie
","Well, first of all, I would like to tell you that I am really interested in history, especially the North American History. I'm a history and geographic teacher and I'm also learning innu-aimun and watch Inuit movies. When I read about this movie, I was kind of happy because this could have been my kind of film. Well, it wasn't it at all.The movie shows a lot of beautiful landscapes, offers some interesting costumes and historical stuff. The movie is like a documentary or a walk through a museum. But there is nothing that happens! The development of the story is very slow and there is no point of acceleration anywhere in the movie. There are almost no dialogues, instead of trying to develop the characters or to create an interesting story about a forbidden romance, the director prefers to show us some birds and trees. I don't get any approach to the characters and their story which should be the core of this movie. When I was watching this first I've almost fallen asleep many times, I was wachting the clock like very five minutes, but I'm a tough guy, so I wanted to finish the movie and hoped for an interesting ending, but it was all in vain. It's just a boring documentary without a real story, without interesting acting, without surprising elements in the story... just avoid to watch this! If you like the general topic of the movie, go ahead for 'Nouvelle-France' or 'The last of the Mohicans', but not for this one...",1,1,6,5 April 2010
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Highly entertaining but less innovating than the first feature
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows is an enjoyable follow-up of the first movie with the same line-up and includes everything fans and critics likes about the first feature: the camera work, the images and the exotic locations are breathtaking, the visual special effects and action scenes are also mind-blowing, the soundtrack is once again very intense, the movie contains a lot of humour and slapstick scenes and the flick finally features a solid acting that is rated up by some new actors like the Swedish shooting star Noomie Rapace. You will get very well entertained for almost two hours in this ride of action, humour and tension.The reason why this movie though can't keep up with the first part is that its story is less intriguing, less surprising and simply less twisted. Many elements of this movie are quite predictable and stereotypical for this kind of genre while the first part had several well thought twists. Some scenes of the movie are simply too exaggerated like the escape scenes in Germany and the final showdown in Switzerland. This is effect loaded Hollywood popcorn cinema as we see it every day and the talent of many great actors and some great pieces of literature are somewhat wasted in here.Another important problem is that the actions and goals of the main villain remain somewhat superficial. In general, the different new characters should have been more developed. The actors do their very best to give the somewhat ordinary characters a unique soul but sometimes they struggle a little bit and their talent gets a little bit wasted in this movie.The script should have been more detailed and precise and the movie could have needed a healthy dose of around ten minutes of additional running time to portray us the uprising and the first evil actions of the main villain and his first acts of terrorism in the beginning. On the other side, the ending on the castle in Switzerland could have been more detailed and one could have shown us what happened to the different characters after the final showdown.Even though these important flaws, the movie is saved by all the positive elements mentioned in the beginning of my review and the ending creates some high hopes for a possible third part. I hope that a possible third feature might unite the amazing script of the first part with the solid acting of the second part with more impressive sound and image effects to create a nearly perfect flick honouring one of the most fascinating characters in the history of literature where the traditional meets the modern.",7,0,1,8 January 2012
Captain Phillips," Four new star actors are born
","'Captain Philipps' is an American action-drama inspired by but not closely based on actual events. The real Captain Philipps acted a lot less heroic and more ignorant than in this movie adaption that simply tries to do what many recent Hollywood movies do. They portray the hard but honest everyday life of a seemingly normal American citizen who suddenly faces big challenges and becomes a national hero. In times of governmental shutdown, economical problems and a slowly progressing decline as the world's most important nation, the people needs a few new heroes to believe in American society again. In this movie, you see how democratic institutions, dominant military forces and social cohesion defeat corruption, exploitation and selfishness in the worst among the developing countries. The film presents the United States of America and Somalia as complementary antitheses which feels a little bit like lazy propaganda. While the main villain constantly expresses a positive opinion about the American dream and how he could have a better life in that country, I must though admit that the movie also shows us the dark sides of some typically American values as individualism and weapons happen to be completely useless to resolve this movie's issues. Diplomatic elements, earthiness and shrewdness are the key elements leading to a predictable happy ending instead of a loner's brute force. Apart of its minimal propaganda tendencies and the predictable ending, I didn't like the character of Captain Philipps at all. I'm not sure if Tom Hanks wanted to portray an arrogant and unsympathetic old bourgeois but if this was the intention of the makers, his acting is simply perfect. If the intentions were to create a sympathetic main actor, he completely failed though. It's hard to tell but usually, this kind of movie tries to create an emotional connection between the main character and the viewers and this movie just doesn't manage to build this up. From the beginning on, I had no connection with the main character and didn't really care about his fate.Another small but important element I didn't appreciate was the fact that the main villain's English was so good. It's more than just a surprise that a pirate living in a desperate country ridden by a bloody civil war for more than two decades is able to speak English so well. I'm not sure if a young man like this ever had the chance to go to school at all. That's why this little detail and the general profound interactions between Captain Philipps and Muse feel a little bit too fabulous to me.The movie's strengths are elsewhere. First of all, this film is filled with incredible tension and especially the claustrophobic and uneasy last third feels very intense and real. The acting is only one part of the gripping formula. The great soundtrack, the efficient light effects and the out-thought camera positioning create this nervous feeling. The movie starts as a documentary in the first moments, slowly turns into an atmospheric thriller towards the middle, then it gets a refreshing action boost between the second and last third and it ends as an oppressive chamber piece. This mixture is very well balanced by the makers and the movie never gets boring in my opinion. Even though the content of the script is sometimes flawed, its general segment linearization is of the highest quality.The film also has its dramatic and philosophic elements as the villains aren't just brutal criminals but four very young and sometimes naive men who have no choice but to go through this hell to stay alive and take care of their elders and own families. The acting of the four Somalian pirates is simply outstanding and especially the performance by Abdi Barkhad is absolutely authentic and intense. Sometimes, the movie doesn't feel acted at all as if the real persons were replaying the tragic events that really happened in a slightly transformed way. This is where the movie almost looks like a documentary of the most intense kind.Despite its little flaws, this movie is truly intense and feels authentic. The first third has a few lengths but the last two thirds will keep you on the edge of your seat as almost no other movie this year. While the story itself and Tom Hank's acting aren't very good, the claustrophobic atmosphere and the incredible performances by the four young African actors are worth a few Academy Awards. I hope to see more from these four actors in the near future.",7,1,3,20 October 2013
The Expendables 2," More of the same with some good and some bad points
","If you liked the first part of The Expandables franchise, you will also appreciate this follow-up but if you didn't like the first part, the chances are elevated that you won't adore the second strike, too. The story of the new movie is pretty much comparable to the first one, the action scenes are also quite similar and most of the characters of the first feature are back for good in this sequel.Let's kick off with the negative aspects about this film first. Honestly said, the movie doesn't come as explosive as the first part as this one is even more predictable than the first feature film because of a quite parallel story line. Second, there are still some humorous moments in the movie but some one liners already start to be quite repetitive and feel a little bit too forced, old fashioned and used and that's why this movie has a lot less laughs than the first film. As a third point I must admit that I miss the aesthetic fights that Jet Li brought to the franchise as he has only a minor role in this movie and the combats are therefor rather limited, repetitive and only focused on brutality, effects and explosions. I might also add that I miss a truly good secondary role as Mickey Rourke was in the first movie.On the positive side, I think that the story in here is still slightly more interesting as in the first movie. The locations in this film really exist and are much more intriguing as in the first part in my humble opinion and the makers of the franchise should even expand this concept in the future. Concerning the acting, I was positively surprised by the good work of Jean-Claude van Damme as main villain in this film. Usually, his acting is only focused on action and appears quite mediocre to me but he definitely does one of his best jobs ever in this flick. The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis play a bigger role in this film is not only a positive thing for the gross, promotion and reputation of the movie but they bring back some good memories of the first part and their characters are as cool, funny and old school as in the first feature. The addition of Chuck Norris to this film also happened to be a good idea. His role is a little bit too short and honestly said filled with stereotypes but that's what people seem to want to see and his appearances turn out to be quite amusing, entertaining and memorable. The new characters in this movie played by the quite charismatic Liam Hemsworth and the tough but charming Yu Nan are interesting but first of all they are introduced in quite a hurry and lack of depth and then, they don't have a lot of screen time to fully convince.After all, this movie is pretty much comparable to the first feature film and you simply get more of the same. The biggest plus points in here are the exotic locations and some new actors that appear and do a quite promising job. On the negative side, you have a very predictable story, less diversified fighting scenes and a lot less humour than in the first flick. Fans of the first part should not miss this flick but those who were sceptical about it surely won't get a better approach to this second flick and should simply stay away from it. This movie is maybe a little step down for the franchise but still on a quite comparable level in comparison to what Stallone and his men had put out two years ago.",6,0,6,25 August 2012
Source Code," Where Avatar meets Inception meets the Green Zone
","I was really intrigued by the trailer of this movie and decided to go to the cinema for the first time for a pretty while. The film is very worthwhile and touching with a great main actor, an interesting plot, a lot of suspense and action, a twisted part towards the last third of the movie and a happy ending with a philosophical focus.The only problem is that we have recently had movies such as 'Inception' or Avatar where people are getting transfered to different place and sometimes in the body of different persons in order to save the world or where they fall in love with a stranger. The conspiracy story surrounding this movie makes me rather think of 'The Green Zone'. 'Source Code' is surely an entertaining and intriguing movie but it somewhat lacks of originality. A good twist, some emotional and dramatic touches and a very good acting still make this movie stand out and pardon for a rather mediocre script that also has a plot hole concerning the explosion of the two trains that works well timed even though the villain isn't able to observe the right place and time to commit his attack while the first train is also too late and should indeed have meet the other train a couple of minutes earlier than we see. Another thing that I must criticize is the weak villain that is not charismatic enough and I didn't like the rather superficial reasons and motivations for his devastating acts.Finally, 'Source Code' is a very entertaining and worthwhile movie but slightly overrated and not as stunning, innovating or gripping as one might think. It's worth to be watched at the cinemas because of the visual and sound effects but a part of that, I would rather suggest to wait and loan this flick later.",7,0,1,11 April 2011
Skyfall," Another big step forward to depict the new face of the world's most famous spy
","Since Daniel Craig incarnates the role of the most famous spy in the world, the James Bond series have profoundly changed. The movies got away from the image of a slightly arrogant but somewhat charming heart breaker who has superficial sexual relationships with the most exotic women in the world and who faces megalomaniac but vulnerable enemies and beats them with the weirdest gadgets. These movies certainly had a unique charm but when one objectively looks back on these films nowadays, they were often somewhat limited. A big portion of charm, humour and sex has gone and the new special agent has become a more emotionally driven character instead of the unbeatable superhero he has been before. While 'Casino Royale' perfectly showed the new face of James Bond and can be considered as a milestone of the series, the direct follow-up 'Quantum Of Solace' had its lengths and lacked of consistency.'Skyfall' is just in between the quality level of its two predecessors. It features a more emotional agent who has faced death, who gets isolated, who has alcohol problems as well as mental weaknesses and who finds himself in the abyss of his existence. The special agent becomes a quite authentic character who shows us the darker side of his personality one has never known before. One also learns more about his special relationship to his superior and the movie even takes us back to the childhood of the character. The latter part is particularly atmospheric and intriguing and innovates the series fifty years after the cinematic creation of this format.The main problem with the new movie is that the personal story of James Bond gets so important that the plot about the new main villain almost gets too secondary even though Javier Bardem does an excellent job and incarnates a smart madman who has many similarities with his opponent. On the other side, the plot has its lengths. The parts turned in China are visually stunning and Bérénice Lim Marlohe convinces as mysterious femme fatale but the whole thing is too long and features too many unnecessary dialogues. The final showdown also has its length and doesn't come along very spectacular. These parts are saved by an authentic and strong acting but anybody who is waiting for breathless action scenes may only be satisfied by the explosive opening. Action fans should rather check out 'The Bourne Legacy' that has come to the movie theatres last summer.In the end, the series still head for new shores fifty years after 'Dr. No'. The focus in this film lies on James Bond's personal story and the character development and not on the action scenes, locations or villains. From time to time, this film feels like a drama and not like an action flick. It introduces though a couple of famous characters of the traditional James Bond series again which is quite addicting for old and new fans and makes the wait for the twenty-fourth feature even more exciting. 'Skyfall' follows the tendency of its two predecessors but makes a more radical step forward. It's up to each fan to decide if he or she prefers the new face of James Bond or the traditional one or if they happen to be intriguingly complementary which would be my personal description. In the end, I enjoyed the movie despite a few flaws and I would put it in the upper midfield of the table featuring all twenty-three features but it still doesn't come close to my personal favourites that are 'From Russia with Love', 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and 'Casino Royale'.",8,2,13,19 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Average survival horror in a prison and on a tanker
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth entry in the live action franchise based upon the Japanese video game series that started in the mid-nineties. The story revolves around the urban legend of a safe haven called Arcadia that seems to be located in Alaska. Former private security operative Alice attacks the headquarters of her former employer in Tokyo before heading for Alaska where she expects to join the group of survivors she had met eighteen months earlier. However, there is no safe haven to be found and Alice even gets attacked by a former companion who seems to have lost her memory and acts erratically. Alice manages to calm her former friend down and they travel south to Los Angeles to find out what happened to the group of survivors and unveil the secret behind the urban legend. The duo meets a group of survivors hiding in a maximum security prison that is surrounded by undead victims of the infamous T-Virus. Alice learns that Arcadia isn't a fixed place but a cargo tanker that is now situated in the port of Los Angeles. She tries to get on board to find out what happened to the survivors but realizes too late that the ship is a trap.On the positive side, the new characters Alice encounters in Los Angeles are overall quite diversified, quirky and unique which leads to a few emotional scenes. The locations in and around the abandoned prison are quite haunting. The action scenes are particularly intense and are truly impressive in the film's middle section and ending. The special effects are fluidly crafted and blend in very well. The showdown on the ship is truly gripping but also ends on a cliffhanger leading to the fifth installment.On the negative side, the transition between the third film and the fourth movie isn't exactly fluid as there is a gap of twelve months between the third film's last scene and the fourth movie's first scene. Furthermore, there is another gap of six months after the opening sequence. The scenes in Alaska are rather disappointing and basically only consist of a fight between Alice and the lone survivor who attacks her. The story is simplistic and unrealistic, even by the franchise's low standards. Some side characters such as the one played by Norman Yeung are rather exchangeable while former intriguing characters such as the one played by Spencer Locke only have cameo appearances here.In the end, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty much on the same level as its predecessor. It's a slightly above average science-fiction movie with impressive effects and stunts, a healthy dose of creepy atmosphere and intriguing lead characters while it's suffering from a lack of fluidity, a ridiculous plot and boring side characters. Fans of the live action franchise can watch this film without any regrets but this is neither a good movie to discover the franchise nor a film that will change your mind if you have never managed to get into this particular franchise in the first place. At the end of the day, this movie is solid and entertaining but fails to innovate or leave a lasting impression.",6,0,0,4 July 2020
It," Brilliant mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie
","IT offers an excellent mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie. What I like about this film adaptation is how the film respects both sides on a perfectly balanced level. We are introduced to the lives of outcast teenage boys and one teenage girl who have to deal with severe cases of bullying, complicated family issues and their conflicting feelings for one another. As if that weren't enough to deal with, they also realize that the fact that numerous kids have been abducted in their hometown Derry isn't a mere coincidence. Behind its peaceful, calm and boring small town appearance, Derry seems to be a cursed place with a hideous past where a mysterious supernatural entity feeds on children's fears before consuming them literally. The outcast teenagers decide to take action and stop the monstrous entity with their curiosity, friendship and perseverance as weapons.IT takes place in the late eighties and this movie manages to take its audience back in time thanks to the timeless small town buildings, particular hairstyles and clothes and a fitting soundtrack. The film works so efficiently because it's easy for the audience to picture itself in these settings during their childhood years. The acting performances only increase this movie's authenticity. The teenagers all have different strengths and weaknesses and are refreshingly grounded and normal which is a welcome alternative to the popular world of superheroes and super-villains. The movie also has a strong cultural and intellectual side as it includes many allusions and references to Stephen King's other works. Some examples for this would be the town of Derry that serves regularly as setting for Stephen King's novels, the friendship between outcast teenagers in the key of Stand by Me and several allusions to thrash metal band Anthrax that has written numerous lyrics inspired by Stephen King's novels.You won't see the one hundred fifteen minutes pass as this immersive movie is very entertaining thanks to its mysterious story, authentic settings and profound characters. Due to the fact that the film takes place in the eighties, it is quite accessible for adults who will experience numerous deja-vu moments but its timeless brilliance should also be appealing to older teenagers who might easily identify with one or several characters in the movie. IT is a late summer blockbuster you shouldn't miss.On a closing side-note, this movie is the first part of a duology. The content of this movie takes place in the late eighties while the second movie is supposed to show what the characters, the supernatural entity and the town have become twenty-seven years later with some flashbacks from the past. These two story lines are similar to the way the original novel was written. You can watch this movie separately from the sequel but it wouldn't be possible to watch the sequel without watching this first instalment.",9,4,8,21 September 2017
Hereditary," Red flags
","I'm one of the few who watched Ari Aster's second feature Midsommar before his first full length movie Hereditary. Hereditary is slightly better than Midsommar because it slowly develops a haunting atmosphere until a vibrant final quarter that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hereditary isn't a masterpiece like The Wailing but certainly among the better Hollywood horror movies in recent memory.The acting is certainly one of the movie's strongest points. Milly Shapiro is absolutely astonishing as eccentric young teenage girl with odd and at times disturbing behaviour. She is a name you have to keep on your mind for future endeavourments. This movie would have been even better if she had been given more screen time. Alex Wolff plays a completely different character as a seemingly normal teenage boy who likes to party but soon becomes an isolated loner confronted with abominable dangers. Toni Collette is fully convincing as desperate, gloomy and unstable mother whose beahviour becomes more erratic as the film progresses. Gabriel Byrne complements her perfectly as calm, diplomatic and rational husband who handles the pressure around him better than anyone else. The four characters have great chemistry and complement one another perfectly.Another strong point of this movie is its atmosphere. Right from the start, you realize that something is wrong with this family. There are numerous red flags throughout the film. The daughter plays with a dead bird and cuts its head off. The son comes home at night after shocking events but decides to go to bed instead of calling the police. The mother starts to believe she is a medium who can speak with the dead. Only the father's behaviour is rational and he is easily the character worth rooting for.The movie has a few minor downsides however. Even if this is a supernatural horror movie, some decisions of the characters are baffling. How can a mother send her antisocial daughter who suffers from severe allergies to a party with her older brother? How can the father quietly observe how the family members around him show more and more erratic behaviour instead of taking them to the hospital? Why does the mother not call the police after she discovered several more than disturbing elements in her house? Some of the actions, decisions and reactions of the characters make an otherwise solid plot slightly unconvincing.In the end, Hereditary is an atmospheric horror movie with psychological and supernatural elements. Instead of delivering predictable jump scares, the movie fleshes out its characters and plot and remains refreshingly unpredictable until the very end. Despite a slow pace and a few weird decisions made by the characters, Hereditary is one of the better horror movies of the past few years. If you like this film, watch the even better The Wailing and give the less supernatural but more psychological horror movie Burning a try.",8,1,3,1 October 2019
In Bruges," An unusual experience with extreme pleasure and radical boredom
","'In Bruges' is a rather unusual genre mix with many funny moments but also a couple of lengths and a more or less convincing story line. The movie mixes many comedy elements with romantic bits and pieces, a suspenseful background story, some cultural elements and a little bit of action.Sometimes, this mix gets a little bit odd. At some points, this movie is more like a tourist guide through Bruges and therefor a weird kind of documentary rather than a film with a coherent development.But the true problem lies elsewhere. The characters are so diversified that they simply aren't authentic anymore in my humble opinion. The funny guy in love suddenly is the calm and suicidal victim. The pitiless and very emotional boss suddenly becomes the consequent killer that discusses about the morality of life and death. The old and very rational killer is suddenly let by strong emotions and risks his whole existence. The sadly inevitable love story of this flick is also overused and not authentic at all.Next to these complex and strange characters, there are many stereotypical persons that appear in this movie that might make you laugh at first sight but that get quite redundant after a while, for example the dwarf or the gunrunner. This contrast is what makes this movie quite entertaining and surprising on one side but also rather odd and torn apart on the negative side. I can understand people that would rate this movie under five points and people that would give it a top rating, the whole thing heavily depends on your personal taste. If you're open-minded and just want to live a strange odyssey, the chances are good that you might at least appreciate this somehow experimental film but if you're looking for something coherent, gripping and more traditional in terms of suspense or comedy flick, you should watch a detailed trailer before you get your hands on a copy of this.The strongest point of this feature is definitely the dirty humour. I know many people that actually adore Bruges. I have been there and must admit that even though I'm pretty much interested in arts and history, this town is pretty boring and almost appeared as a sleepy ghost town to me filled with tourists and their guides and a couple of old people. That's why I can really laugh about the stereotypical descriptions of that city and the extreme discussions about its strong and weak points. These discussions and the slapstick elements in many unpredictable situations were my favourite parts in the film.I disliked the character development, basically the whole plot and the lack of true suspense after all. There were only episodes, bits and pieces of the movie that I appreciated while there were also many unnecessary lengths. Sometimes, I was extremely bored, then suddenly extremely addicted to this movie. In the end, this feature was worth to be watched and gets some credit for its experimental originality. This is something different from anything I have seen before. It's not always different in good terms but it was refreshing but also exhausting to discover something that unusual. I would though watch it again as this flick has the potential to become a cult movie and might also grow on me.",7,1,3,11 June 2012
John Wick," Switch your brains off and jump on this roller coaster ride
","'John Wick' is another fast-paced and graphic revenge movie with some entertaining action and black humour, a fitting soundtrack and the usual stereotypical characters from the Russian mafia. When it comes to gripping revenge flicks, you should rather watch South Korean movies like the intense 'The Man from Nowhere' which is twice as good as this film, 'I Saw the Devil' which is probably one of the most brutal movies ever made, the emotionally heart-breaking 'Blood Island', as well as the philosophical trilogy around 'Sympathy for Mister Vengeance', 'Oldboy' and 'Lady Vengeance' if you are looking for some originality, depth and character development. 'John Wick' is only a hollow entertainment for genre fans. If I wasn't a fan of this kind of movies, my rating would be much lower than it is.The story is simple. John Wick was a hit-man working for the organized crime in New York City. He retired from his job and started a new life when he met the love of his life. Roughly four years later, John Wick loses his wife to cancer. He receives a posthumous gift from her in form of a puppy with a letter from his wife saying that she is gone and that John Wick should cope with her demise by loving the dog. Coincidentally, he encounters the son of his old boss who doesn't know him. The young Russian mafioso wants to purchase John Wick's vintage '69 Mustang but the grieving man refuses. A few hours later, the Russian mafioso breaks into John Wick's house without any problems as there seems to be no alarm system at all. With a few friends, the young criminal kills John Wick's beloved puppy, steals his car and is bright enough to take off his hood to show his face so John Wick surely knows who he is. The victim survives and goes on to kill around eighty criminals in the next ninety minutes of the movie. Of course, killing the naive culprit is not enough, he also kills his partners, colleagues, bodyguards, his old boss and a few guys in a church. In the end, everybody but John Wick is dead and he goes to the next veterinary hospital, walks off with a new dog and goes home as if nothing ever happened.This story is so bad that it could have been written by a twelve-year old. First of all, there are too many coincidences concerning the encounter with the Russian criminals who want to steel John Wick's car. In the entire movie, everybody is talking about John Wick's incredible reputation and everybody knows him wherever he goes but the son of the most influent criminal is the only one who has never heard of him. It's not credible that a smart hit-man doesn't have any alarm system to protect his home. One can understand that the killing of the puppy his wife gave to him really hurts John Wick but taking this event to justify eighty or more murders is not credible at all. In the entire movie, there is no police or anything despite all the shootings in downtown New York City. All of John Wick's enemies are extremely stupid, unexperienced and wooden. Even thirty men in one building can't manage to fight him. I could go on for hours as this movie is filled with so many coincidences, plot holes and unrealistic scenes that it's amusing. If you tell me know that the story doesn't matter in a revenge action movie, just watch any of the movies mentioned in the introduction that prove that even the grisliest revenge thriller can have some depth. Even 'The Raid' franchise is more realistic and has better plots. 'John Wick' rather feels like a simplistic ego-shooter for video game consoles than an actual movie. I must though admit that the last Splinter Cell games had better story lines than this film.Another thing that feels out of place is the fact that fifty-year old Keanu Reeves is playing the unbeatable hit-man. The fighting scenes are somewhat wooden but he still manages to fight off his enemies because their acting is even slower. On the other side, Keanu Reeves also has a certain charisma to fit this role. Fifty-nine year old Willem Dafoe as veteran hit-man who has to kill John Wick is also a questionable choice in my opinion. Still, he is a respectable actor and has charisma. The most annoying thing is the fact that the evil guys are Russians again but that they are portrayed by actors from all around the world like England, Sweden and even Switzerland - except Russia. One can feel that these are wannabe Hollywood Russians and not real Russians.You may now ask yourself why I still gave a favourable rating to this flick. It's actually simple. This movie never gets boring. The action scenes are sometimes wooden but most of them are just shootings so it doesn't really matter. These scenes are well directed and include no annoying shaky cameras or overloaded special effects. The settings of the movie are well chosen and vary from dirty chop shops over elegant bath houses to Orthodox churches. There are a few memorable lines in this film as in many other action movies. Some graphic content is related to some dark and dry humour which made the whole thing easier to digest. I actually liked this combination of contradictory extremes and had to laugh quite a few times during the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is also enjoyable and fitting. For genre fans, there are enough entertaining and well-executed elements to enjoy this movie despite its obvious flaws.If you are looking for some fast-paced and superficial entertainment to switch your brains off, you will like 'John Wick'. If you are actually looking for a good movie that has more to offer than stylish violence, go for the movies mentioned in the introduction.",7,5,15,31 October 2014
Wind River," This summer blockbuster will make your blood freeze
","Wind River is the blockbuster you didn't know you had to watch this summer or autumn. The movie is a gloomy mixture of a sinister drama with a set of authentic, flawed and haunted characters and a quite gruesome, mysterious and tense thriller. The fact that the movie was inspired by true events makes it even more haunting.Even if you're watching this movie in the summertime, it will definitely send cold shivers down your spine. The film takes place during a heavy snow storm in the isolated Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The story follows a quiet outcast and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent who is divorced and has lost his daughter under mysterious circumstances and a female rookie F.B.I. special agent who must be resilient in unfamiliar territory to earn some respect from hostile Native Americans and closed-minded white drill workers alike. This unlikely duo, supported by local Native American police officers, must find out the truth about the mysterious death of a young woman.The movie's only weak spot might be the slightly predictable plot but the authentic, brutal and emotional ending still suits the movie perfectly. Among the most convincing elements, the superb acting performance by Jeremy Renner must be pointed out. I have always appreciated him as entertaining sidekick in several action thrillers but in this dramatic thriller, he shows his entire potential and really convinces as haunted outsider. Another strong element of the film is the fact that it authentically shows the problematic relationships between disillusioned Native Americans and arrogant White Americans and points out the difficult coexistence between traditional reservations and greedy companies. Finally, the bare but beautiful snow landscapes fit perfectly to a story between bitterness and hope. They aren't only stunning to watch but play an important role in the opening sequence as well as in the final scenes.If you like authentic dramas and thrillers with credible stories and outstanding acting performances, there is no way you can get around Wind River. I would suggest watching this film in the wintertime as you will find it even more immersive. Still, Wind River is easily the best movie I have watched last summer and I would recommend it to any family member or friend and surely buy a copy on DVD or BluRay to support the makers of this film.",9,2,5,3 November 2017
Fight Club," Brilliant acting, a famous twist but still overrated
","Yes, this one is are very good and entertaining movie with an interesting twist, not the best one in film history as some people say but still a quite good one, and a good acting of the two brilliant main characters without any doubt.What I dislike about the film is its slow paced introduction which I found somehow long and boring, the idea of the fight club and its intentions itself and that the whole thing seems logic to its members, the somehow exaggerated end and the fact that you don't get to know what the whole sense or intention of the terroristic organisation has to mean or not to mean in the end.All in all, this one of the movies you should have watched once in your life and which you should know to make yourself an opinion. This one is very popular and many friends from different countries are quite often talking about this movie so you should watch it to be able to discuss about it. I'm one of the rare people who don't give 9 or 10 points because I know weirder non mainstream movies with better twist, but from the popular ones of the genres, this one may be the most interesting movie and become somehow a kind of drug you get addicted to which may introduce you to other movies of the genre, for example the movies of David Lynch or Shyamalan or the real underground stuff.",6,2,6,2 May 2010
Train to Busan," The best zombie movie ever made so far
","There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.'Train to Busan' convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film 'The Wailing', the epic 'Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016.",10,7,18,25 January 2017
The Birth of a Nation," Technically stunning but far too long and sadly openly racist
","Griffith's 'The Birth Of A Nation' is very particular movie. From a purely technical point of view, this movie is quite epic, experimental and mind-blowing for the time when it has been created. True fans and experts of cinema can't pass around this movie that also features some of the most appealing actors of the early years of American cinema such as the charming and gifted Lillian Gish.The movie shows us many bits of the history of the United States of America. The American Civil War is portrayed in detail and especially the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is filmed in an unforgettable manner. Note that Francis Ford Coppola seems to be clearly inspired by this dramatic scene that he almost exactly reproduced in the third part of his legendary Godfather legacy.On the other side, the movie is truly slow paced and takes a lot of time to introduce many different characters. Even for people interested in early cinema and American history, it's difficult to sit through a movie with a length over three hours. This movie has many low points and its narration is not very dynamic.What really leads this movie down is its wrong interpretation of history and its open racist resentments. Right from the beginning on, there is a quotation that tells us that the arrival of African slaves brought the first seed of separation among Americans. Later, the movie talks about obscure topics such as Aryan birthrights and similar stuff. This movie shows us many scenes where black-faced white actors rape a white woman, fear white children or menace white farmers. The role of the Ku Klux Klan is idealized in the movie and The Birth Of A Nation was in fact used as a recruitment tool of this racist organization and it even led to the creation of the second Ku Klux Klan in Georgia back in 1915. The fact that this was the first movie to be shown inside the White House tells us a lot about the society and politics of the United States of America back in the days but there were also negative responses as some movie theatres refused to play this motion picture for example. This movie is an interesting document of its time but definitely not easy to digest and to approve nowadays and it's good that things have changed. There is more racist and pro white propaganda in this American movie than I have seen in many propaganda flicks coming from USSR and the Third Reich.In the end, this movie is an important work for the early history of cinema. It's impressive from a technical point of view and at least interesting for historians. On the other side, the movie has many lengths and is certainly too long. The worst and most intolerable thing about this movie is definitely the openly racist, wrong and closed minded analyze of history. There is a lot of anti-black brainwash propaganda so you should be careful when you watch it and not believe everything the movie tells you about American history.",3,2,6,18 December 2011
The Maze Runner," First instalment in a solid dystopian science-fiction trilogy with a cast of youths
","Based upon the novel by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is the first instalment in a dystopian trilogy that follows a group of youths as they fight for survival and against manipulation in a desolate world destroyed by heat and disease. This first movie follows a very young man who awakes in an elevator that transports him to a group of male youths that is living in a restricted natural environment surrounded by a gigantic maze. This society calls itself the Gladers. The young man doesn't remember his past and only recalls his name after a few hours of confusion: Thomas. He soon realizes that the other boys and men share his fate. They have established some basic rules to live together in peace and harmony as everybody has specific tasks to do. The most important group of people are the athletic runners who go inside the maze when it opens up in the morning and return late at night before the gates close again. The runners are trying to solve the maze to find a way out. However, there are mechanical creatures called grievers who live in the maze which can attack, kill or sting their human victims in a way that makes them go berserk. Thomas is a curious individual who doesn't like following rules and his appearance soon devides the group of youths. Some people support him as they believe he can help them solve the maze while others have gotten used to their lives in a restricted environment and consider him a nuisance. Things take a more dramatic turn when a last human being is sent up the elevator: a girl named Teresa who seems to know Thomas from the past.There are several elements that make The Maze Runner stand out positively. The idea to live the story through the eyes of the charismatic Thomas who gradually tries to find out what is going on around him makes the film captivating, mysterious and suspenseful. The fact that the film takes place in a restricted environment soon leads to quite intense relationships which help the story move forwarde. Most viewers will identify with one character or another. If compared to similar dystopian films, this movie doesn't seem to overuse special effects which gives it a more authentic atmosphere. The final half hour is quite tense and violent and leads to a bittersweet finale. On one side, one finally gets some important background information that explains most of that happened in the first ninety minutes but on the other side, the new answers lead to even more questions as the movie ends on a cliffhanger which almost makes it mandatory to watch the second instalment as well. If you're not planning on watching a trilogy, don't watch this movie in the first place.The story also has a couple of flaws. The background story seems surprisingly basic and is lacking many details. Some events in the story are illogical or simply left unexplained such as the Glader who got stung outside the maze which is never fully explained. The story obviously also has some similarities to other dystopian movies, especially concerning the bleak future of our planet and the basic main protagonists and antagonists. The movie's middle section is somewhat plodding and the movie could have been shortened by about ten minutes without leaving out anything essential.In the end, you will like this film if you're a fan of other dystopian science-fiction movies with a set of young characters like The Hunger Games or The Divergent Series. The unique setting and the mysterious plot certainly make this movie stand out. If you are looking for a creative and unique experience, you might find the movie somewhat boring and predictable.",7,0,0,5 June 2018
The Hunger Games," A step in the right direction for Hollywood fantasy movies for younger audiences
","After the overrated hypes around series such as 'Twilight' and the last 'Harry Potter' movies that are based on artificial special effects and rather mediocre acting I didn't expect too much from this new series that start with 'The Hunger Games'. To my surprise, this movie is easily better and plays in another league as 'Twilight' or the last two 'Harry Potter' movies.This movie is also based on many special effects but they are visually truly beautiful and the strange future world is quite interesting to discover. The acting is also solid at many points I really appreciated the appearances of the charismatic Donald Sutherland, singer Lenny Kravitz and the very talented young actress Isabelle Fuhrman. The movie also contains some decent criticism about media and society but it could dig deeper at some points. The open ending makes you want to see the evolution of the characters and the addicting future world in the upcoming two movies. This movie is a solid Hollywood popcorn movie for teenagers but might also please to older fans of fantasy and science fiction movies even though I prefer the more mature 'John Carter' that has been released a few weeks before this output. I was positively surprised by the high amount of brutality and raw killing scenes in the movie that make it more dramatic towards the end. After horrible adoptions from fantasy books such as the teeth-less 'Eragon' in the past, this is definitely a step in the right direction even of worried parents, conservative Hollywood maniacs and too religious watchers might feel shocked about these tendencies.On the other side, this movie offers nothing new after all. The dystopian context and the brutal games make me think of 'Rollerball' and other classics and this movie has not enough originality and soul to come close to this masterpiece. It could though initiate a younger audience to this genre and make them discover further great dystopian movies such as '1984', 'Equilibrium', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Renaissance' and 'V For Vendetta'. In comparison to these movie this one we have here is rather forgettable and only worth to be watched once even though you get well entertained in over two hours of running time. I also disliked the choice of the main male character who lacks of charisma and guts in comparison to the convincing female lead role. Josh Hutcherson seems to be like a mixture of Justin Bieber and Robert Pattinson and seems only to be there to attract young girls to this movie. He might be a sweet guy for them but he honestly is a rather mediocre actor. The love story between him and the female lead role is simply not convincing in this movie and I'm looking forward to read the book to see if the whole thing is more authentic in the written version. The next time I wish the studios would chose an edgier and more unique actor or change the character of the book a little bit to make him more interesting. The soft guy simply feels out of place in this rather brutal survival movie towards the end.In the end, it's worth to watch this movie once and to get out and watch the two sequels if their quality is as good or better than this movie. It's nothing groundbreaking though or something I would watch twice or purchase. A younger audience might though like it and overall the flick is well done and a step forward after the last rather mediocre Hollywood fantasy blockbusters with the exception of 'John Carter' and 'Super 8' that were approximatively as good or slightly better than this.",7,2,7,7 April 2012
Argo," Wasted potential because of a one-sided attitude with many lengths and a lack of depth
","Argo won three Academy Awards, including one for the best movie of the year 2012 and this award was even presented by honourable First Lady Michelle Obama due to the patriotic and political content of the film. On my list, this movie though didn't even make it into my personal top twenty of that year. Let me explain you why.Let's start with the positive things first. The costumes, decorations and locations of the movie are authentic and seem to be quite close to the actual events that inspired this film. The tension filled scenes in the very beginning of the movie at the embassy and at the very end at the airport are well done as well.Now, let's talk about the negative facts. The movie includes too many overlong dialogues that go straight nowhere. Instead of showing the raising pressure inside the Canadian embassy and conflicts between all involved persons, one sees a terribly faceless main actor going around to make publicity for his fake movie and talk to more or less important people of Hollywood nobody cares about. After twenty first great minutes, this movie falls flat and bores until the final fifteen minutes or so. Add to this that the movie has no depth whatsoever. It only explains in a quite short opening sequence what led to the revolutionary events in Iran. The movie never explains further how all of this could happen and what that country would become afterwards. The emotions, fate and suffering of the people aren't portrayed at all by this film. One only sees a bunch of angry citizens that play the bad guys while the American diplomats portray the good guys. This one-sided view is quite shallow and filled with the usual stereotypes but one starts to get used to it by Hollywood by now. Add to this a sometimes more or less audible sound quality and some annoying shaky camera positions even though the overall production is quite decent.In the end, the movie is rather disappointing for me. I was really looking forward to discover this flick as the historical events are really intriguing. The idea behind the script had in fact a lot of potential in my opinion. In the end, you won't learn anything new from this movie and it only superficially portrays the events that happened. Half of the movie or so shows us scenes in Hollywood or Washington instead of showing us what happens in the streets of Teheran and the true soul of that revolution. The entire middle part of the movie has important lengths, unnecessary dialogues and lacks of consistency. The actors are exchangeable and fail to touch me. This film is only saved by its promising beginning and its gripping ending.",6,1,2,29 March 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A convincing revamp with outstanding actors
","To set things straight, I'm definitely not a die hard Star Trek fan and I didn't enjoy some of the later movies made in the early nineties as some of these movies were overlong and soulless. I was though rather positively surprised by the reboot and beginning of the new trilogy that came out in 2009. This sequel which is overall already the twelfth Star Trek movie is just as good as its direct predecessor or even slightly better.Let's start with a couple of negative things first. The special and visual effects were decent but not as good as those in other current science-fiction flicks like 'John Carter' or 'Oblivion'. The soundtrack was decent as well but not outstanding. The story was intriguing enough from the beginning to end and kept my attention high. It will surely please to old and new fans of the series but in my opinion the story was too predictable at some points for many experts of the series. You simply know that the good ones will survive and that the evil guy is truly evil and that's why some parts of the movie lack of suspense.What I really liked about the movie was something else: the acting! I really appreciate the original cast and many nostalgic and closed-minded fans might claim that no actors can equal the originals. In my opinion, this is not true. Chris Pine's version of Kirk is much more diversified, down-to-earth and human than what I recall from the originals. Zachary Quinto's way to take the role of Spock is simply incredible and his acting is simply outstanding throughout the entire movie. Add to this a brilliant over-the-top incarnation of Scotty by Simon Pegg and an obscure and unpredictable main villain like Khan who is very well portrayed by Benedict Cumberbutch. Even the secondary roles were very well cast and I couldn't find any faceless actor or actress in this movie. They all did a very good job which hasn't always been the case in the past of the series.Thanks to this amazing acting and the gripping and very typical story line that makes you rediscover many characters of the original movies, any fan of the series and anyone who is ready to give the fresh revamp trilogy a chance should go to the cinemas and enjoy this movie. It's not groundbreaking and remains somewhat nostalgic of course and I'm normally not a big fan of endless sequels and remakes but this new episode in the Star Trek universe is quite entertaining and addicting. I wouldn't buy the DVD but I will surely watch the third part in the cinemas when the time is right.",7,14,27,18 May 2013
Us," Gloomy mystery
","Us is an American horror movie with and by Jordan Peele who is the mastermind behind the Academy Award winning Get Out, a horror movie dealing with social issues such as racial discrimination. His most recent film doesn't deal with social issues and balances horror elements with mystery sequences.The film's weakest point is the plot. Even though it sounds intriguing at first, it leaves many questions unanswered and even comes around with quite a few plot holes towards the end. The predictable twist can't save the messy script either. The movie revolves around a young girl who encounters a mysterious doppelgänger in a hall of mirrors which leaves her mentally tormented. Several decades later, she reluctantly returns to the region where she experienced this trauma and soon starts noticing strange occurences. She tries to convince her husband to depart with their two children but her doppelgänger and her family soon break into their cottage and attempt to kill them to take their places. The family manages to escape and realizes that citizen all around the region are being attacked by their doppelgängers. The young woman must confront the demons of her past in order to find a way to stop them.This horror movie convinces with numerous elements. It has an uneasy atmosphere right from the start that never lets go until its partial conclusion. The acting performances are authentic and especially lead actress Lupita Nyong'o is incredible as tormented soul with a heart of gold and remarkable resilience. Even the child actresses and actors deliver the goods in this film. The opening sequence takes place in the eighties and has a cool nostalgic flair. The locations are carefully chosen and especially the scenes in the hall of mirrors are memorable.Even though the movie isn't particularly scary and frustrates with a few plot holes, it is overall very entertaining and its strong acting performances, intense atmosphere and intriguing locations pardon for the film's minor flaws. I hesitated between giving the film seven or eight points but since I was thoroughly entertained by it at the local movie theatre, I decided to give it the better of the two grades. If you like mysterious horror films, you are going to appreciate this film.",8,0,5,28 March 2019
Knives Out," Old-fashioned murder-mystery thriller executed with wit
","Knives Out is a murder-mystery movie in the key of old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Edgar Wallace novels and their cinematic adaptations throughout the sixties and seventies of the last century. This sounds worse than it is because a movie without an overdose of special effects that goes back to the basics is actually quite refreshing. Elderly audiences will adore this movie and it might as well introduce younger audiences to this almost forgotten type of cinema.This thriller works well for numerous reasons. The actors and actresses are veterans and talented youngster who complement one another perfectly. Young Cuban actress Ana de Armas delivers the goods as good-hearted caretaker who ends up mingled in a crime. Veteran Christopher Plummer is excellent as eccentric author who despises his own family. The diversified Daniel Craig convinces as mysterious investigator who tries to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.The locations and settings are simple but very efficient in this movie. Most parts of the film take place in a gorgeous mansion and even though the architecture and landscapes look splendid, the tight rooms and sinister decorations give the film a gloomy vibe. The few scenes that are filmed away from that location offer some refreshing diversity in form of small appartments, charming downtown areas and rural restaurants.The plot obviously comes around with a few twists and turns. However, those don't come as big surprises if you are familiar with this type of storytelling. Another minor issue is that too many details are revealed rather quickly through flashbacks. This movie would have been even better if it had given its audience the time and occasion to come to its own conclusions and put the pieces of the puzzle together.Still, Knives Out offers one hundred thirty minutes of old-fashioned but well-executed murder-mystery entertainment and convinces thanks to a solid plot, great locations and gifted actresses and actors. In addition to this, this film also offers some soial criticism by pointing out the egoism, greed and manipulation of the rich and the famous. If you want to know what kind of movies your parents or grand-parents enjoyed when they were younger, give this film a fair chance. Sometimes, going back to basics means advancing in the right direction.",8,13,27,29 November 2019
Oldboy," A true piece of Asian culture!
","This movie got everything that a good movie needs and deserves absolutely its place within the one hundred best movies of all times on this site! It has its own and unique character because of a typical Asian strange atmosphere, an excellent acting, some very good ideas and interesting twists throughout the movie. You have a twisted revenge story mixed with a fatal love story in a very philosophical and moral context that makes the viewers judge and think a lot. Topics and antithesis like future and past, love and hate, revenge and forgiveness are all covered by the story and lie much closer than one may expect. The topics and the story with all its twists are complex, but very easy to understand for everyone and it is easy to approach to this movie although it is a very unique and special one. Even after several views, the movie remains profound and surprises you and is still entertaining - no matter for watching it alone at home or during a little alternative DVD night with friends with whom you may surely discuss about this piece of art! The film is a rare masterpiece, heavy and disturbing, but not because of a few very well done gore and action scenes, but because of the profound and twisted stories of the main characters who are all lost sinners in a very fatal way. The movie has the class to be more than an inside tip but a mainstream movie, but in the same time, the movie is far away from the ordinary revenge stories and doesn't deny his Asian flows and roots. It is a very intellectual, philosophical and personal movie, but some excellent, absurd and even artistic action, crime movie and horror elements keep the tension high so that this movie doesn't have any lengths. It is more than an entertaining movie and when you've seen it once, you will surely fall in love with it and this film request multiple viewings! It is fascinating how profound and artistic the Asian cinema is in comparison to a too serious European cinema and a too superficial North American cinema an this movie is an excellent example for this fact and may convince you to get more connected to the Asian cinema. Let's hope that there will be no American remake because of this movie's international inside success, because they won't be able to create the same kind of uniqueness and atmosphere. This movie is a true piece of Eastern culture!",9,2,5,20 August 2010
Blade," Ordinary action blockbuster instead of a horror movie
","I really have a lot of difficulties to appreciate modern movies about vampires as the 'Underworld' saga, the 'Nochnoy dozor: Night watch' and its sequels or the Blade saga. I'm a fan of old and sometimes even modern horror movies ('30 days of night' is a nice modern film about vampires for example) and I leak to read horror literature too, but this movie is not convincing me at all.Wesley Sinpes plays a cool and tough guy and is doing a quite well job even though he is maybe a little bit too 'gangsta' for such a movie, there are also some nice fighting and gore scenes, but this film has an important lack of horror elements, of an interesting and suspenseful story and a horrifying atmosphere.The movie is much more an action movie with some surprising lengths in the middle of the movie (while movies as 'Dead snow' or parts of the 'Underworld' saga still have much more adrenaline) rather than a horror movie. I would compare this movie to the first 'Matrix' movie, this one being also a wanna-be cool action movie with a pseudo science-fiction background instead of a horror background like in this one.I give the four points for the acceptable first thirty minutes, the action effects, the style of the actors and the special acting of Wesley Snipes. I haven't seen the sequels but this one didn't give me the state of euphoria to head for the other ones at all.",4,1,5,27 May 2010
Aquaman," Predictable fun
","Aquaman is another exchangeable superhero movie but it's so dynamic and visually stunning that you won't care about the insultingly predictable plot and the repetitive superhero tropes.The movie has a short and appropriate introduction before the epic adventure unfolds and ends on a concise positive note going back to its opening sequence. The underwater world looks fantastic and especially the animals like sharks are lovely. The quest that leads the main character and his female sidekick across the planet includes stunning locations like Sicily and Morocco that offer a welcome change from the seas. The settings are carefully chosen and cleverly mixed with computer animations. Director James Wan filmed everything calmly, extravagantly and precisely. Even the dramatic action scenes like the breathtaking escape sequence in Sicily avoid shaky cameras and exaggerated special effects which makes the film enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The final duel between the courageous half-breed protagonist and his sinister half-brother is visually spectacular and emotionally engaging.You will get exactly what you expect from this movie: shallow but gripping entertainment for the whole family with a big budget. It's pleasant while it lasts but also quickly forgotten because of predictable tropes, an overall tiresome story and mostly average acting performances. Up next, let's create another exchangeable superhero movie called Airwoman, Earthtransgender or Firetiger.",7,0,1,10 January 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Johnny Depp is really great, the rest is a real disappointment
","First of all, I was a huge fan of the first movie of the series and the second one was much weaker, but still a quite nice and entertaining movie to me.But this third one is just disappointing. This movie lives only from the great acting of the charismatic Johnny Depp. All other actors look really poor, silly, limited, ordinary and unnecessary next to him.The story is quite weak, the movie way too long and it all seems to be too forced on some action elements and a showdown with some visual effects, but this is all destroying the charm of the first two movies and the originality of the first one.I've read somewhere that there would be a fourth part. Maybe the studios want to make some money, because the fans and critics can't be happy about a new film after having watched this soulless and superficial movie. My three stars are for Johnny Depp, forget about the rest...",3,1,1,5 April 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," Mad Max meets The Birds
","Resident Evil: Extinction is the third of six entries in the live action series around former security officer Alice who fights her former employer known as Umbrella Corporation. She joins a group of survivors in Utah who plan on traveling to a safe haven in Alaska that hasn't been affected by the deadly T-Virus. However, the group gets caught in a deadly trap in Nevada and must fight against Umbrella Corporation's powerful administrators, security officers and soldiers.The film's biggest flaw is its beginning. While the transition between the first and the second movie was smooth, this movie takes place several months later and only explains rather vaguely what has happened in between. Some important characters of the predecessor have disappeared without any explanations while completely new characters show up without any introductions.Among the new characters, a tough but charming female teenager named K-mart played by a charismatic and quirky Spencer Locke steals the show. Another strong element are the dusty, isolated and hot locations that recall the Mad Max franchise. The film's highlight is when mutated crows attack the survivors which recalls animal horror masterpiece The Birds. The final showdown in Las Vegas is also highly entertaining and has a lot of symbolism as it shows how ephemeral this desert city of steel and class actually is.The plot is even thinner than in the previous movies and this film obviously ends yet again on a cliffhanger. Thanks to interesting characters, fascinating locations and creative special effects, this third entry in the franchise is however a step in the right direction after the painfully average immediate predecessor. Fans of dystopian science-fiction tales should give this franchise in general and this movie in particular a chance.",6,0,0,25 June 2020
Ready Player One," More than meets the eye
","In the seventies, women were into sharp-dressed revolutioners. In the eighties, athletic types became more and more popular. Throughout the nineties, ideals became more material and people with beautiful and fast cars would attract people. Nowadays, geeks are all the rage. Twenty years ago, those people were outsiders because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Today, these outsiders have become trendy because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Sometimes, this world is a strange place. In order to understand more about this stereotype and pimp my trendy knowledge, I decided to give Ready Player One a shot.I didn't expect much but got a very rewarding surprise. Ready Player One avoids stereotypes as opposed to my somewhat exaggerated yet quite accurate introduction. This movie could have focused on great-looking main characters who are destined for each other. But this isn't Divergent. The movie could have been overacted with overtly dramatic emotional ups and downs portraying immature teenagers. But this isn't The Hunger Games. The movie could have overwhelmed us with eye candy in form of massive flashy special effects without any depth. But this isn't Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The film could have had a quite emotionless plot without any interest set in a stereotypical dystopian world. But this isn't Ghost in the Shell. The movie could have felt quite stretched with its ambitious running time of one hundred forty minutes and included vapid lows throughout the middle section. But this isn't Blade Runner 2049.Ready Player One is better than all the movies mentioned before. The two main characters are grounded and sympathetic which makes their love story surprisingly credible and emotional. The acting performances are balanced as the characters are sometimes overwhelmed by emotions but often have to use their intellect to solve problems. The only moment when the movie overwhelms us with flashy colours is in the first five minutes to briefly introduce the virtual reality of OASIS but the rest of the movie doses special effects very well as the movie balances calm and intellectual moments with dramatic and vivid passages. The plot centered around a massive treasure chase might not be revolutionary but includes numerous clever references to pop culture of which I particularly liked the setting of The Shining, the nod to Mechagodizilla and the allusions to progressive rock veterans Rush. Moreover, the movie has several interesting messages such as the fact that nothing is as magic as our own reality. I also liked the side characters, especially the unique inventor of OASIS who reminds me of a mixture of Olaf Schubert and Tommy Wiseau. Finally, the movie didn't waste one single minute and was entertaining from start to finish thanks to an already interesting novel this movie was based upon, outstanding scriptwriting efforts and very solid directional work.In the end, I can only recommend watching this movie at your local theater. You don't need a distracting, expensive and headache-inducing 3D version at Cineplex though, just go along with the old school 2D version in your small local cinema. It would suit the message and intention behind the novel and film much better. Now I can realate much more to geeks with their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards who spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos.",9,3,6,9 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," All of Quentin Tarantino's trademarks united in one movie
","''The Hateful Eight'' is a typical Quentin Tarantino movie. It has a slow build-up that carefully introduces the eight different characters. The dialogues are very elaborated and mix crude vocabulary with more intellectual expressions to create an emotional balance. The tension of the movie is based on the cold landscapes, the long dialogues, the restricted setting, the excellent gloomy soundtrack and an overall simple yet efficient story with a little twist. It takes nearly two hours before the first main character dies and the killing scenes are then very graphic, purposely exaggerated and chillingly refreshing in contrast to the lengthy conversations. Anyone who knows Quentin Tarantino gets exactly what one can expect from him.This factor has its advantages and disadvantages. The dialogues are among the very best in modern Hollywood cinema. The camera techniques are epic, the settings add to the atmosphere of the film and the score composed by Ennio Morricone is great. The eight characters are unique and very different from each other. They are incarnated by eight actors who really shine in this movie. All of them do an outstanding job but I would like to point the acting of the only female lead character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who perfectly portrays a sneaky, sadistic and opportunistic criminal that constantly tries to manipulate people around her. The relations between the different characters are what makes this movie even more outstanding. Unlikely rivalries and alliances come and go during the movie and none of the characters is predictable.On the negative side, the movie is comparable to several previous movies by Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion, the film has too many similarities with his last western ''Django Unchained'', including the setting, discussions about slavery and the Civil War background. Another negative element is the length of the movie. While the film builds up a lot of atmosphere, some momentum gets lost in the middle of the film before the first character dies. The movie could have been shortened by at least twenty to thirty minutes to assure a more fluid experience. Another element that bothered me a little bit was the perspective change in the movie. Right before the climax, the film introduces an entire chapter set in the early hours of the same day that reveals all the twists in about twenty minutes which decreases the impact of the following climax and interrupts the flow of the movie in an odd way. This background story could have been told differently, quicker and especially at a different moment in the movie.In the end, ''The Hateful Eight'' might not be Quentin Tarantino's best movie so far but it's a good or slightly above average film by him. The dialogues of the script are worthy of an Academy Award, the camera, light and sound techniques have both a retro style and are up to modern standards and the actors and actresses deliver some of their very best career performances. If you like westerns, the stunning landscapes and the story are two more reasons for you to adore this movie. If you are looking for a more graphic, short-paced and violent movie, ''The Hateful Eight'' might bore you since the film is unusually long and at points hard to sit through, focuses almost only on dialogues and character developments and only gets physically intense in the last sixth of the movie. Personally, this was one of last year's greatest movies in my opinion but you will only admire this movie if you are familiar with other works of Quentin Tarantino, like western stories and settings and adore elaborated dialogues.",8,4,13,20 January 2016
BlacKkKlansman," Speak and stand up for civil rights
","Based upon true events, BlacKkKlansman tells the story of Colorado Springs' first African American police officer who spontaneously calls the local Ku Klux Klan branch and pretends to be interested in joining the group. The white supremacist group falls for his trick and members of the local branch propose to meet him in person. The African American police officer teams up with a Jewish coworker who inflitrates the group in his own stead. As civil rights activists become unsettled in the city and clash with the local Ku Klux Klan branch that prepares for their Grand Wizard's visit, the two police officers must keep the population save and prevent a dangerous bomb plot.The movie convinces for numerous reasons. First of all, it's based upon true events yet tells a very improbable story. Secondly, the characters are authentic, diversified and intriguing. Thirdly, the actresses and actors did expert jobs and play their roles with conviction, energy and wit. Fourthly, the films truly reincarnates the spirit of the early seventies in the way people were dressed and talked but it also respects cultural and political circumstances that give the film the vibe of a documentary at times. Fifthly, the film doesn't only include documentary segments but is also an adventurous mixture of a tense crime film and an emotive drama. Sixthly, even though the movie has a clear message, it isn't too judgemental and shows that some civil rights activists are as radical as their opponents. Seventhly, the film has a strong message: racism isn't acceptable under any circumstances. Eighthly, the film has a connection to the present, showing how civil rights activists still get attacked by white supremacists in present-day United States of America while the President of the United States of America fails to address the issue properly and attempt to solve it. Ninethly, the movie is filmed with care in form of calm and precise camera work and a lack of special effects to give it a more authentic vibe.You can watch BlackKklansman for many reasons. It certainly portrays an intriguing if horrifying part of the history of the United States of America. It's a gripping drama with credible characters. It's a thriller that becomes more and more intense and literally ends with a bang. Most importantly however, this movie makes you think about civil rights and racism in the United States of America. Even though the overall situation has improved since the early seventies when the movie takes place, some issues have always remained present and have even become more critical over the past few years. BlacKkKlansman shows what the United States of America really are: a divided country torn between progression and regression. With its intense epilogue that offers a clear statement after the main part of the movie was mostly neutral, BlacKkKlansman invites to speak and stand up for civil rights. If you're a true American, this is what you ought to do. If you're not, take the film as a dynamic mixture between entertainment and lesson that offers some food for thought.",9,10,19,20 November 2018
The Expendables," You really get what you should expect
","The Expandables is a action super movie that puts together some of the most famous genre actors of the last decades. The movie exactly delivers what fans might expect. That's why you should not expect profound dialogues, too many romantic moments or a truly original story line. This movie is about cool quotes, many explosive action scenes and a quite fast paced and simple story line. Anybody who doesn't accept this kind of nostalgic and relatively simple genre should just not watch it and stop bashing this movie as you clearly know what you will get.There are many cool one liners and funny hints, homages and references to classic vintage movies or characters of the genre. A good example is the scene when Sylverster Stallone meets Arnold Schwarzenegger as well as Bruce Willis in a church. When I went to the cinema, the whole crowd was laughing out loud during this scene and almost anybody understood the quite famous inside jokes in this movie. It was not the only funny moment in this fast paced movie and it was definitely better than many immature and though overambitious comedy flicks from Hollywood. I was even positively surprised by the many amusing moments that created a solid balance to the brutal action scenes without making the whole thing childish or ridiculous. The movie just managed to be humorous and cool at the same time.The acting is of course not very deep or challenging but the characters fit very well to the different actors and you really feel that some of them go as far as to personalize their roles. Especially Dolph Lundgren, Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham shine in this movie and even have some sort of depth. The minor roles involving actors like Mickey Rourke or Bruce Willis are more superficial but fit very well and are clearly orientated on similar characters they have played before. These roles are made to appear as cool, experienced and male as possible and that's what you get.The fighting and action scenes are varied enough to keep you addicted to this movie until the end. While Jet Li or Jason Statham really show that they are quite flexible and know their martial arts skills, Randy Couture or Dolph Lundgren represent a less aesthetic and more brutal and pitiless fighting style involving different explosives and guns. From time to time, there are even some experimental and original sequences where the characters don't only use their male force but also their brains to find a way out of a difficult situation. Some scenes are on the other side completely overloaded, especially towards the end as every few seconds, one switches from one character to the other and observes a pitiless massacre. Of course, this is neither profound, nor original but in contrast with the humorous parts, the whole thing turns out to work surprisingly well.Concerning the story line, it's probably useless to say that the whole movie is pure fiction and quite predictable from the beginning to the end by dealing with the usual stereotypes. Of course, the leader of the wolf pack falls in love with a local beauty. It's quite clear that a traitor appears quite soon in the rows of the heroes that confronts his old friends. It's not surprising that there is some sort of a conspiracy and manipulation story around the main villain. You may quickly realize that the main villain is probably not as bad as it seems and has to face the demons of his past as one of his most important family members tries to fight him. The ending of the story is probably what you've expected from the beginning on. This is clearly the weakest part of the movie but the solid acting, the great actions scenes and especially the cool and humorous moments pardon for these obvious flaws.In the end, this movie is recommended to all those that are into the action genre and like at least a couple or even all of the involved main actors. The humorous scenes could please to a larger public, though, for example when the guys bring their girlfriends to the cinema that only expect one hour and a half of raw male brutality. Apart of this humorous factor, you really get what you should expect. Take it if you like the actors and their kind of movies or just leave it and don't watch it because this movie won't make you fall in love with the genre. It's a truly entertaining flick but clearly far from being a modern milestone as it copies way too much the elements we already know but on the other side it's this rude simplicity that gives the film a rather classic, honest and sympathetic image.",7,3,9,25 August 2012
Scary Movie 2," Easily a better party movie than the first one
","The first part of the series was very superficial, dumb and boring and only turned around movies such as 'Scream' or 'I know what you did last summer'. The second movie is easily an improvement as the number of referenced movies is much bigger and even some of the cinema's classics are ridiculously honoured in this follow up. You may really laugh about some scenes if you have seen movies such as 'The Amityville Horror', 'The exorcism of Emily Rose', 'Rose Red' and so on. There are not only childish teen horror movies but some really solid flicks that inspired this movie. Even some movies that have nothing to do with the horror genre such as 'Charlie's Angels' are referenced in here. One can say that this movie is more diversified and surprising than the first one.The sexual jokes are still the majority of puns in this movie but they are not as present and childish as they were in the first one. Some of the highlights in here are for example the vomiting scenes during the exorcism, the insulting and weird parrot or the wheelchair rat race between a scientist and a ghost. The puns are still predictable and childish but more diversified and far more entertaining than the jokes of the first movie.On the negative side, there is only the fact that some chase scenes in the haunted castle are way too long and get quite boring after a while as well as the bad ending that indicates a lack of ideas and seems somewhat suddenly.Nevertheless, this movie should not be criticized too hard as it is once again a good party movie with some absurd jokes that is mostly well entertaining if you have some good friends and some good beer around. Rent this one to have some fun but once you have seen and enjoyed it, there are no further reasons to purchase or watch it again very soon.",6,0,2,6 March 2011
The Flowers of War," Acting with true emotions
","This is one of the more interesting movies about the infamous rape of Nanking during the Japanese invasion. In comparison to many other contemporary Chinese history flicks, this one is gladly not so much overloaded with patriotic propaganda aspects apart of a lonesome Chinese solider who easily kills dozens of Japanese soldiers in one scene.The movie focuses much more on stunning costumes, epic graphics and a great camera work. Zhang Yimou is definitely one of the best directors world wide in this category and just this aspect is worth experiencing this film.The film also has a very strong character development. Christian Bale really shines in his role as alcoholic mortician and goes through quite some changes. Another amazing acting comes from the young and highly talented Ni Ni who is not only one of the most beautiful women in modern cinema but also a convincing actress in her role as a tough prostitute with a breakable heart. The acting of Huang Tianyuan as desperate but energizing assistant and protégé of the deceased head father of the convent is also stunning and I hope to see more movies with him in the future.The characters all get some depth and have a quite good chemistry that grows over the movie and makes the heroic sacrifice of the prostitutes for the convent schoolgirls credible in the end. This is where the drama gets really human and touching and you may have a little tear in your eyes by watching the final moments of this film. Despite the dark and desperate historic context and many tension filled moments, this film also some humorous moments that light up the atmosphere and where Christian Bale really shines. Let's also mention that some of the Japanese and especially Colonel Hasegawa who is portrayed by the strong Atsuro Watabe get some depth through this film and are not only represented as brutal killing machines but as cultivated and intellectual characters with a slightly sadistic core which makes them more realistic.Even though this movie has a few lengths, it's strong enough to convince thanks to a very great acting with true emotions. The ending is a little bit too open in my humble opinion and I would have liked something more concrete but this only shows how much one gets to adore all these characters in a little bit less than two hours and a half of running time. Any fan of contemporary Chinese cinema should definitely check this very detailed, passionate and visual movie out.",8,1,2,24 October 2012
The Book Thief," Another sophisticated and lengthy drama about Germany's most evil twelve years in history
","Here comes another Nazi drama set in Germany under Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. It's so sad that a country with such a rich history is often reduced to only twelve years of its past. Where are moving dramas about the fight for German independence in 1848? Where are war movies about the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 that changed an entire continent? Where are conspiracy thriller related to the dramatic Spartacist uprising in 1919? Where are tragicomedies about the sad period of the Weimar Republic? What about a valuable movie about the creation or the fall of the Berlin Wall? All people get to see in relation to Germany are movies about evil Nazis. It's getting really redundant and closed- minded by now.Despite its content, I decided to watch the movie because it had received excellent critics and because the events are shown through the eyes of a young girl whose mother was a Communist, whose young brother died and who must integrate into a small town where she lives with her new parents and meets a lot of interesting people from an imaginative but sick Jew hiding in her host parents' basement over the literate and melancholic major's wife to her new best friend and neighbour Rudi who is in love with her and some Nazi bullies and her rude children. The concept is interesting enough and ultimately works thanks to a convincing acting by the empathic and wise host father played by Geoffry Rush, his emotional and severe wife portrayed by Emily Watson and some convincing youth actors such as Nico Liersch. I'm still asking myself why the Germans weren't portrayed by German actors in here which would have been even more credible, especially concerning the main character, but this is only a slightly irritating detail.Apart of the acting, the movie convinces with greatly detailed settings and appropriate moods that really put you right inside a small German town during wartime. The movie is atmospheric and feels authentic and realistic as well. The camera and light work as well as the choices for images and words are very well done. The use of a few German words here and there works well but would have needed a few subtitles for those who don't speak that language.The problem is that it takes quite a while to get into the mood of this film and until significant events happen like the host father's departure for war or the dramatic bombings of the small town. It's a good idea to show the everyday life of those villagers but this movie definitely has its lengths and lacks a coherent story line. Some people might leave the movie alone after thirty or even forty minutes because of its slow pace. You definitely need to bring some attention, patience and some historical knowledge to fully appreciate this film. I didn't have any personal problem with that but it might definitely be considered as a weakness by many.What I found even worse is the idea that the story is told by a voice that introduces himself as the Death. I think this adds nothing to the story and it feels like a pseudo-intellectual touch close to arrogance. I also had my problems with the abrupt ending and the movie's epilogue. Where the almost sarcastically incidental but grisly expectable ending of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' worked very well, the similar idea used for 'The Book Thief' isn't what you have been prepared for since the beginning of the movie and feels rather random.Fans of sophisticated movies set in Nazi time and slow paced dramas with a lot of details will appreciate this movie which might even get some Academy Awards nominations because this kind of challenging movie is what older critics like. Anyone else should be sure to bring some background knowledge and patience to enjoy this film. It's a quite solid book adaption but definitely not a classic or the biggest highlight of the year.",7,3,11,6 December 2013
Underworld Awakening," Stunning visual and sound effects pardon for a weak story
","The Underworld saga goes in a new round with more action and vivid special effects than ever before. The characters are as cool and unique as before and have some cool fighting scenes and dry dialogues. If you have a chance to watch this movie in the cinemas in the best possible quality, just go for it because the movie is all about sound and visual effects and won't work that well on your home cinema or later on television. I would probably not buy a copy of this movie or maybe only if this was released one day in a collector's edition with all movies of the entire saga.I have only seen the very first part of the movies back in the days and have been attracted to other movies as time went by. I checked this movie out thanks to the interest of my girlfriend and now I definitely want to watch the other movies that I have missed in the past years. From this point of view, the movie grabbed my attention and did a good job in one and a half hour of entertaining power.On the other side, this movie is clearly weaker than the first strike in my opinion. It focuses a lot on the special effects and is a great action movie but lacks some thrilling scenes, some horror moments and some additional elements that would have helped to create a more profound story even though this movie may initiate a lot of viewers to get back to the series just like me as this movie can be understood as the beginning of a new era rather than a final chapter. The story is easy to follow but I missed some epic scenes, new and intriguing supporting characters and some mystic or mysterious moments.In the end, this is a fast paced movie with some stunning scenes. It is filmed and mastered in a very professional way. It's a relief to watch movies like this in times of the Twilight saga that waters down the image of those fascinating creatures of the dark. On the other side, this is no essential masterpiece of its kind but a great movie to watch in your local cinema with some drinks and food during the happy hour with a lovely person by your side.",7,2,4,25 January 2012
Battleship Potemkin," The political message is questionable but technically this movie is a milestone
","The works of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein in the early days of Soviet Union's cinema easily beats anything Hollywood published at the same time. The score is bombastic, the images are intense and the avant-garde camera shootings and runs are innovating. Even a century after its creation, the scenes on the Odessa staircase are still highly impressive.For Eisenstein, cinema was an art with many facets and his attraction montage fusions the meanings of images, words and music into a powerful and baffling piece of art. This movie works a lot with contrasts. You can see the small and dark rooms of the sailors and the big and light rooms of the tsarist officers. You can see the beautiful dishes with religious inscriptions for the rich personal on board and the foul dead meat for the sailors. You can see the sadness of a despaired woman that loses her young child that is shot in the back while you can see the pitiless army that creates an incredible bloodbath. The movie focuses on the rebellion and solidarity of a crowd and not of a single hero and already represents early Soviet ideals but the acting of many single persons is simply incredible and very close to theatre if you take a look at the expression on the faces of the actors. This movie is filled with details and close to perfection from an artistic point of view.Of course, there is a lot of symbolism in the movie and a lot of propaganda but as censorship wasn't yet as extreme as it would be during the next three decades under the tyranny of a powerful madman called Stalin this movie still portrays the opinion of Eisenstein who comes from Latvia that had been annexed by the Russian tsar. It's more a revolutionary movie than a propaganda movie and is not so far from true historic facts as it is the case for movie such as 'The Birth Of A Nation' or 'Der Jude Süss'. Still, this slight slices of propaganda are reason enough to cut off one point from the final rating.This is a truly artistic movie that any fan of cinema should at least once see in his lifetime. If you haven't seen it yet and doubt its quality, don't hesitate any longer. Even if the political message is definitely questionable, this short flick is definitely bombastic, epic and always entertaining.",9,2,2,18 December 2011
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A highly emotive movie that restores some faith in Hollywood
","The unusually titled Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a big cinematic surprise towards the end of the year, receives massive critical acclaim and is even considered a favourite for the upcoming Academy Awards. All these positive reactions are well-deserved.The only reason why I don't consider this film excellent is because of the rushed exposition and the aborted resolution. It would have been interesting to get a more detailed introduction instead of being thrown right into events based upon something that happened seven months earlier and which the viewers will have to figure out step by step. The open ending certainly has an intriguing artistic approach but my curiosity was certainly longing for a few more answers.Everything that is actually shown on screen is though excellent. The story revolving around a bitter mother coping with the brutal death of her daughter is desperate, infuriating and touching. The characters is in this movie are dynamic and round as they have a lot of depth and smoothly change throughout the movie. Even the side characters such as an abusive ex-husband, a determined black sheriff and a provocative war veteran with a filthy secret are very interesting.The acting performances by Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell are incredibly authentic and powerful. The movie manages to combine tense moments related to classic thrillers, tragic moments inspired by heartfelt dramas and a solid dose of absurd and black humour in a balanced way. Especially the humorous parts make the tragic story more bearable and the characters more human. As a spectator, you are constantly torn between wanting to cry, laugh and yell at the screen. The emotional power of this movie is of the grandest kind.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the movie you didn't know you have to watch this winter. It's a detailed, emotional and intelligent film with an immersive flow that requests multiple views. This film restores some faith in Hollywood cinema which had been rather unconvincing this year. I certainly hope the movie gets even more recognition and that cinemas around the world keep screening movies like these that take their audience seriously instead of only focusing on shallow sequels and superhero flicks.",8,1,4,11 December 2017
Incendies," Probably the best drama of the last few years!
","I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's 'cegeps', some kind of a post-high-school, and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed, I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year, this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry, it makes you angry, it shocks you. Once again, it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will, you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors), but also magnificent and intense landscapes, shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end, but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate, peace and war, love and hate, vengeance and forgiveness, saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all, I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one, for example 'The pianist'. Second, some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room, the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness, because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece, this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time, they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all, I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars.",8,72,123,12 October 2010
Rush," Incredibly intense and recommendable for everybody
","'Rush' is definitely one of the best movies of the year and has many strong points to offer - even to those who aren't into motor sports at all. First of all, the acting is simply incredible. Chris Hemsworth performs the slowly dying kind of charming and charismatic pop stars among athletes that doesn't exist anymore in modern motor sports. He portrays a self-confident daredevil, playboy and sex symbol who seems superficial and unsympathetic at first sight but who turns out to be courageous and have more values than one might think. Behind his arrogant appearance is a breakable young man destined to live in the fast lane and die young. Many real persons from that time and especially the real Niki Lauda said that Chris Hemsworth acts and speaks exactly as the real James Hunt did which proves his incredible acting job. His antagonist is portrayed by Daniel Brühl who incarnates a young and motivated man who seems to be an arrogant and bourgeois nouveau riche at first sight but who turns out to be as breakable, courageous and determined as his concurrent. The two main characters are very different from each other but at the same time they have enough things in common to be at eye level during the most exciting Formula One season in history. I think that Daniel Brühl's acting is even better. He had to incarnate a real person that is still alive which is always tough. As a German he had to learn an Austrian accent to speak German and English in a credible way, he had to have the same gestures and he had to incarnate the same temperaments the real Niki Lauda. Thanks to a lot of details and time put into this acting job and many meetings with the real Niki Lauda, Daniel Brühl perfectly succeeded and delivers without the glimpse of a doubt the best acting performance of his career. The thing that impressed me the most was that the real Niki Lauda said that he thought of people being cruel and superficial when they have watched him with disgust or scare after his accident but when he watched this movie he had the same terrified reaction and finally understood why I all people had reacted that way so many years ago. His reaction proves how intense and real this movie is even though a few historical facts are of course exaggerated to put additional tension into this film. Next to the incredibly gifted two main actors who almost have the same screening time and are equally treated in depth even though the story is told by the film character Niki Lauda, one should not forget about a whole bunch of great supporting actors in this movie. There is simply no bad actor or actress in this film.Another strong point of this movie is the way it mixes the incredible true events by using many original settings from museums or archive footage with well integrated cinematographic elements such as an atmospheric soundtrack, intense dialogues and very well done special effects that are not overloaded with cheap effects but that feel as real as the rest of the movie. The camera work is quite perfect as it has a balanced mixture of cinematographic and documentary shots once again.And then there is the story which is highly based on true events. You don't need to be a fan of motor sports to get into this film. The story is about the clash of two very unique and different characters who seem to be antagonists and the roughest kind of competitors at first sight but who turn out to be more similar to each other than they might think. This movie is about competition, sportsmanship and more than all the precious value of life. It's also about the ups and downs that come with success. It's a movie about family values, love and friendship but also about extreme loneliness and despair. Many people don't understand why motor sport athletes are risking their lives for this sport. This movie gives us the answer. This sport is a lifelong dream of both characters and they entirely owe the lives they are living to their successful career. At the end, the movie shows us two very different ways how to deal with the risks of this dangerous job and where to stop playing with fate. This opens an almost philosophical and quite profound perspective that makes this movie something more precious than a simple action film or drama. It inspires you to think of which path you would have chosen as anybody should be able to at least partially empathize with the characters. In the end, I recommend this film to any movie fan. No matter if you are a fan of action movies, biopics, dramas or suspenseful movies, this flick has it all and even more for you and the incredible acting plus the detailed settings are the cherries on the cake. The movie even includes a few humorous scenes, erotic moments but also philosophical elements. It's hard to create a more complete movie than this one but at the same time, this film always feels consistent and never loses track of its clear guiding line. Right now, this movie is worth nine out of ten and time will tell us if this might even be worth the perfect rate. I think this might be the case and hope that the movie will win a few Academy Awards along with the superb crime drama 'Prisoners'. These two movies are definitely the best of the year until now and the year is almost over. If you were hesitating whether to watch this film or not, you should by now have made your decision to go to the cinemas as long as this film is still there. Needless to say that the great camera work and the impressive sound effects work even better in cinema than at home.",9,4,6,6 October 2013
Oblivion," A well crafted blockbuster but there would have been even more in this
","From time to time, it can happen that a new American blockbuster hits the movie theatres that is not a prequel, sequel or remake. This is also the case for the effect loaded science-fiction epic 'Oblivion' and I decided to give the film a fair try.On the positive sides, there are the graphics and special effects. I don't know why this movie didn't get a 3D release. Usually I'm not a big fan of 3D movies and in most of the movies I've seen that way it all just seemed like a quick way to grab some more cash and wasn't all to outstanding but 'Oblivion' could have become a milestone of science- fiction cinema like 'Avatar' if a few more efforts were put into these spectacular scenes. Besides that little flaw, the images of this movie are very inspiring.The science-fiction side of the film isn't bad either. The buildings, engines and machines one can observe are very well crafted such as the luxurious main residence, the white flight object and the white motorcycle. Architects and artists will fairly enjoy these detailed inventions. On the other side, the movie didn't only include visual gimmicks but also a few more down to earth aspects. The hidden valley is gorgeous and the remains of several famous buildings of the past make me think of 'The Day After Tomorrow'. I also like the fact that this movie still keeps a focus on the human side. Of course there are spaceships and drones but this movie doesn't include intelligent robots, scary aliens or similar ordinary stuff we have seen over and over again. From that point of view, the film just includes the right mixture between fictional elements and a focus on the human characters.Concerning the artistic aspect, I must also add that the soundtrack of the movie is really epic and well crafted. Until now, it's by far the best score of the year 2013. Along with the flawless score of last year's 'Django Unchained' and maybe the new blockbuster 'The Great Gatsby', the soundtrack should definitely get a nomination for the next Academy Awards.Let's talk about the actors now. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but his acting was better than I expected and is solid enough to carry the movie. Olga Kurylenko has always been an actress that I liked but she is not very impressive and rather pale in this movie. I miss a profound side and some development on her character. The secondary roles are far more convincing. Morgan Freeman is great as usual but his role is definitely too small. The biggest surprise to me was Andrea Riseborough. Her acting is charming and highly emotional. I didn't really know her before but after watching 'Oblivion' I sure won't forget her anytime soon.What about the story now? I think that the movie takes way too much time in the beginning to introduce us into the everyday life of the two main actors. The first thirty minutes definitely have their lengths before anything intriguing happens. The plot that kicks off then has a few weird elements or even slight plot holes such as the obscure crash landing of a space shuttle but the story gets more and more vivid and intriguing. The movie has a few twists that are quite well done. They didn't really surprise me because I have seen rather similar movies in the past but they will surely surprise many people and I had no problem with a few more evident twists because they were well thought out and played as well. The story is not all too complicated to follow but keeps an intellectual touch with many aspects you may still think about a few days after you've watched this movie. This flick has indeed a slightly philosophical approach and this aspect makes the movie stand out from similar features.As a slight letdown, I thought that the ending was a little bit unspectacular after all but I wouldn't call it butchered either.In the end, we have a technically and visually impressive movie with a solid and twisted story line and an intriguingly philosophical or intellectual touch. I still think that there could have been more in this with a few more efforts put into the effects and the story itself that had its lengths but it's nevertheless among the best movies I have watched so far in this year. Science-fiction fans shouldn't expect a milestone but will discover a very entertaining and well crafted blockbuster that is worth some time and attention. I will surely watch this movie again in the years to come.",8,0,3,16 May 2013
Burn After Reading," Quirky acting performances but not living up to its potential
","Burn After Reading is a quirky spy parody directed by renowned Coen Brothers and starring a set of outstanding actresses and actors like Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The confusing story revolves around a retired CIA analyst who is going through a divorce. A disc with information about his finances and memoirs ends up in the hands of two idiotic gym employees who try to blackmail him. Soon, CIA agents, Russian double-agents and private detectives are watching and being watched around the analyst's house when things go berserk.The premise of the movie is quite intriguing. The story is original and filled with surprising twists and turns while also criticizing and making fun of American bureaucracy, cinema and society. However, this rather short movie takes too much time to introduce a bloated set of characters. The characters are often quite flat, predictable and stereotypical. Later on, the story develops draggingly and only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace. The conclusion to the movie feels somewhat aborted and is mostly told and not shown which is a sign for limited filmmaking in my book. The worst thing however is that this parody just isn't funny. I'm not the most serious guy and sure like to laugh from time to time but everything this movie evoked was a tired smile in two or three scenes. There is some creative situation comedy for sure but not one single truly hilarious scene. Since there are few action scenes and only a few small doses of suspense, this movie is only kept alive by its quirky characters and story.On the positive side, Burn After Reading has a mostly original script and offers memorable scenes with plenty of strange situation comedy you will remember long after having watched this film. The actresses and actors are also delivering the goods and very convincing as they manage to make the most of their one-dimensional characters. John Malkovich is brilliant as disillusioned analyst, Tilda Swinton convinces as his cold-hearted wife, George Clooney mesmerizes as lying womanizer, Frances McDormand excels in her role as hectic gym employee who makes all the wrong decision and Brad Pitt is quite amusing as dim-witted sportsman who is constantly and stupidly singing and smiling.In the end, you can give this film a try if you know and like the aforementioned actresses and actors as well as other movies by the Coen Brothers who certainly have their very own style. If one leaves out the brilliant actresses and actors as well as the situation comedy, one gets a movie with a confusing story line that just isn't funny though. I would recommend this flick if there really isn't anything else on television on a rainy night but it's overall slightly overrated.",6,1,3,22 July 2018
Watchmen," A great starts that leads to a mellow flick with many lengths
","Here comes another superhero movie after all those Supermen, Batmen, Spidermen and so on. Many movie experts simply start getting tired of all these quite similar movies and I only watched this one because somebody told me that this was a standout of its genre. The story is indeed interesting as somebody tries to murder a gang of retired superheroes that all have their dark sides in this atmospheric movie that has some film noir tendencies and a couple of solid ideas.This all sounds promising but the movie is simply way too long and has many lengths. The film kicks off very well and especially the narrative parts of Rohrschach, the best character among the superheroes played by the best actor in this film with Jackie Earle Haley, is highly addicting. The movie simply develops too many flashbacks and uninspired side stories that slow down the starting dynamics after a while. Especially the typical Hollywood love story stereotypes bring what could have been a different kind of movie on a more commercial and ordinary flick for the masses. The dialogues are quite cheesy and there are too many of them. The characters are not sympathetic enough to really care about them. If they had all died, I would not have been unsatisfied. In my opinion, there is quite a waste of time and potential in this film.The acting is not bad but not outstanding, the action sequences are the same and the story has its ups and downs so that the only solid thing are the special effects but they can't save this movie from mediocrity. Another letdown is the ending of the flick. I've waited for more murders, chasing scenes and the proposal of diversified possibilities to guess who's behind the crimes. In the end, there aren't so many murders and the final solution doesn't come as a big surprise and what happens in the big boom just won't come. The conclusion is not that standard and can be described as courageous as it differs from your usual happy end but I disliked the movie's philosophy and would have expected something more emotional, engaging and surprising.In the end, I would only recommend this movie to those who like superhero movies and would like to see a darker side of some heroic characters. Anybody who likes Hollywood cinema and modern special effects will surely adore this movie. Anybody who's expecting something gripping, original or profound should simply avoid this kind of movie.",6,1,4,3 July 2012
Baby Driver," Slightly overrated but overall entertaining action blockbuster
","Baby Driver is an above average action movie but definitely not the perfect blend so many critics seem to see in it.On the positive side, the action sequences of the movie are vivid, spectacular and diversified. They also look rather realistic and don't overuse CGI technology. The last third of the movie has a great balance between an overall gloomy atmosphere and few more hopeful scenes between the characters. CJ Jones and Lily James played really likable and profound characters one could easily identify with. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm played two quirky gangsters with their very own styles. It was also great to see Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a side character in this film.On the other side, the backstory isn't very original. The stereotype of a tough guy with a soft core because of a rough childhood is simply overused in Hollywood. The underlying message that he is still a nice guy and didn't have any choice to become a criminal is also very dangerous. Some of the characters' decisions are plain unrealistic, especially the typical Hollywood ending is filled with laughable stereotypes. Another issue is that every second Hollywood movie uses rock music of the seventies these days. While I like this type of music, it's simply wrong to praise this movie for its original style that isn't that original after all. I also thought that the middle section of the film dragged on for too long. The main character was introduced as a cool character that doesn't speak or think much but the middle section suddenly tried to give the character a more intellectual and profound touch which was completely misplaced.In the end, Baby Driver is without a doubt an overall entertaining, fast-paced and stylish action movie that you should enjoy at your local movie theatres. But it simply isn't anything more than that. It's the kind of movie you will enjoy while you're watching it but you probably won't remember much of it after a few months or years.",7,3,7,31 August 2017
The Village," Interesting intentions destroyed by a superficial story and conclusion, weak acting, silly atmosphere and a wrong preview and publicity
","When I saw the preview of the film, I thought that I would watch a horror movie with a dark atmosphere, in an interesting place where many weird characters live isolated from the modern way of life. Well, I know that it was Shyamalan's intention to do a superficial preview and then to surprise those who expected a slasher movie. He wanted to cheat and laugh about us and to present his critical story about the society of the village to a larger public. Many viewer talk about the philosophic intention of the film which should make it more interesting, intellectual and profound than an ordinary horror movie.Okay, I understand all of those viewers... but when I go to watch what is announced and presented as a horror movie, I don't want to see a slow paced portrait of an isolated village that is manipulating population. Another thing is that the story is very low, has a very weak development, but normally, Shyamalan surprises us with an interesting ending like he did in 'The sixth sense', but here, he fails, because the ending is not only quite disappointing to me, but was also very clear after I've had seen half of the movie. You expect something else than and in the end you have to realise: 'Oh no, he really made it end like this!' A part of this wrong publicity and quite unspectacular ending, the actors are not touching the viewer and do almost all a quite poor job, the atmosphere is too forced, too exaggerated so that it isn't a menacing, dark atmosphere any more, but a quite silly one after a while, especially while the girl is walking through the forest in the end. And concerning the critical or philosophic element of the movie, Shyamalan just touches the topic, but doesn't go deep or intellectual enough to underline his thoughts and intentions with which I would mostly agree. This element could have been very interesting and open-minded, but the explanation in the end seems just to be a weak excuse for a slow and boring movie without any shocking element. It,s quite interesting to discuss about those intentions, but it isn't sadly worth watching this movie.If you'd like a horror movie taking place in an isolated old school village, check out a movie like 'Population 436'.",1,1,3,5 April 2010
Split," The best psychological thriller of the past five years
","Just like 'The Visit' a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie 'Split' offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's 'Shutter Island'.The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works. Still, 'Split' is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that 'Split' is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets.",9,40,81,3 February 2017
North by Northwest," Influential spy epic
","North by Northwest, which has horrible translations to French with La mort aux trousses and German with Der unsichtbare Dritte, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies. This vivid action-thriller and spy epic has influenced franchises like James Bond and many others. Despite a certain nostalgic charm regarding clothes, lifestyles and settings, the movie has aged quite well and is still very entertaining sixty years after its initial release and beyond.The story revolves around a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent, kidnapped, poisoned and left for dead. He survives by chance but nobody seems to believe his story and he is instead charged with driving under the influence. The ambitious young man desires to clear his name and starts investigating. Soon enough, he is in the middle of a dangerous conflict between a shady businessman and his associates and the real government agents he has been mistaken for. Along with a mysterious woman who befriends and helps him on a train ride, he travels northwest through the United States of America to figure out what he has been involved with.North by Northwest convinces on numerous levels. The story is twisted, mysterious and dynamic as it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The iconic action sequences have stood the test of time and are still breathtaking to watch. The unfirgettable locations are chosen with care, intellect and precision. The camera work is very precise and still an example to follow by contemporary standards. The acting performances are charismatic and especially the lead character is truly unique.There are only two minor elements that need to be criticized. The female lead character feels somewhat superficial as she almost instantly falls in love with a perfect stranger despite her pivotal role in the story. Another thing that bothered me was the abrupt ending which could have been a little bit more fluid without overstaying its welcome.Still, North by Northwest is a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime if you like crime films in general and spy movies in particular.",7,1,1,5 January 2019
Divergent," A rip-off of a rip-off
","Dystopian teenie movies are all the rage these days. In my opinion, 'The Hunger Games' and Company can't catch up with classics like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Equilibrium', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Rollerball', 'Soylent Green' and so on. 'The Hunger Games' was already almost just a rip-off of the famous Japanese book and movie 'Battle Royale'. At least, 'The Hunger Games' had a few great actors, stunning costumes and settings and loads of action. 'Divergent' is now a rip-off of 'The Hunger Games' series. My advice for you is to watch the originals instead of what Hollywood wants to be the next blockbusters.So basically, this is a rip-off of a rip-off. But 'Divergent' features less impressive actors and actresses that portray more or less convincing characters. I could not connect with any of them but maybe the target audience of teenage girls would see things differently. The costumes and settings are much duller than those in 'The Hunger Games'. The action scenes are a lot less urgent. Even the story is rather frustrating in here, feels rather random and is even a little bit hard to follow at some points. The movie's villain has not much charisma either.The film wants to introduce the female main character Tris as somebody special. She passes a mental test that should indicate one of the five factions she would best fit with. People in dystopian Chicago are either brave, intelligent, peaceful, selfless or truthful in an isolated and precisely structured society after a great war that is not further explained. Tris doesn't fit to any of these factions in particular and is divergent. This is already rather strange. The so-called test lasted for maybe one minute and the main character acted in a completely normal way where I would have taken the same decisions if this test was for real. One doesn't really believe the movie that Tris is so different and special. She is an ordinary looking girl with ordinary skills who is about to go through an ordinary bad meets evil plot and to fall in love with an ordinary good-looking young man. The base of this story is already rather odd.The entire story is not much better. The so-called divergents are considered being a danger for the elite and are chased down by governmental forces. Tris joins the brave faction and tries to hide her secret. One day, the intelligent faction tries to overthrow the leading selfless faction with the the help of the mentally manipulated brave faction. Tris and her boyfriend who turns out to be the son of the leader of the selfless faction (what a surprise) will obviously save the world in a few minutes.Between the initial test and the final battle scenes, this movie is filled with endless mental and physical games and simulations that portray the main characters everyday life among the brave faction. The fighting scenes vary between being visually stunning and being ordinary. The supporting characters in the brave faction are superficial and don't add anything to the plot line. The failed assassination attempt of the main character feels completely random and out-of-place. Basically, the first and maybe the last thirty minutes of this movie are addicting while the rest tries to kick off some character development and dystopian world exploration that is mostly uninteresting because both characters and the dystopian world are rather ordinary. This all sounds rather negative and it is. So you might ask why I still gave this movie half of the points. The reasons are simple. I'm a big fan of dystopian books and movies and even the worst examples still attract my attention. The special effects are well done and worth to be seen in the cinema. The capture-the-flag game at some point in the movie is my personal highlight set in an interesting atmosphere and location. As I said, the first thirty minutes of the movie are rather entertaining and promising. The final thirty minutes are filled with action and tension. Even though the outcome of the story is highly predictable, the last thirty minutes will get you on the edge of your seats. There are even a few emotional moments in there when some characters need to do some important sacrifices. Not everything is bad in here. Half of the movie is well done, the other half really ordinary.In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you would like to watch the rip-off ('The Hunger Games') of a rip-off ('Battle Royale'). If you liked the rip-off, you might also appreciate most parts of 'Divergent'. If you thought the rip-off was of an average quality or below, let me tell you that this movie here is clearly below the rip-off's quality. Don't waste your time on it then. As a fan of the genre, I had a little bit more than two and a half mostly entertaining hours. The movie was made to watch it in the cinemas because of its solid sound and visual effects. On the other side, I would certainly not watch it again and I wouldn't buy or rent this film either. If there was a sequel in a few years, I would probably feel like watching it for the sake of having already watched the first part but I would feel hesitating. Don't get yourself into the same situation. I would rather suggest you to avoid this movie and watch something more original which basically means that you should look for the original dystopian movies.",5,6,13,25 April 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," For fans of 'Snow White And The Huntsman', 'The Hunger Games' and 'Twilight'
","I've recently watched the Korean 'Hansel and Gretel' movie which was an incredibly imaginative tale with a haunting atmosphere and stunning kid actors. This Hollywood version rather heads for a public that recently enjoyed movies such as 'The Hunger Games', 'Snow White And The Huntsman' or the 'Twilight' series. This film is addressed to a teenager or young adult public. Younger auditors might find this flick too tough, even though old German fairy tales often head for younger auditors and are generally brutal for education purposes. Older auditors might find the film a little bit lifeless and vapid after all. It features some mild action scenes, several small gore effects, a few witchcraft elements, the usual love story and the predictable good versus evil story. This is nothing new but the movie is quite entertaining without having any lengths and for one of the rare times, the three dimensional technique is well employed in a movie and worth the money you have to spend on it.The acting by the main characters is not that spectacular. Gemma Arterton remains surprisingly faceless while Jeremy Renner who was last involved in 'The Bourne Legacy' seems quite out of place and especially a little bit too old for this kind of movie by now. A great job is though delivered by the absolutely charming Famke Janssen who delivers a reserved but efficient acting and who looks very stylish in this film.In the end, the good special effects, a few well chosen secondary actors and the fast paced story that never gets boring save this movie and make it watchable for a young but not too young auditory. Anybody who is expecting something more original should absolutely go for the Korean movie.",7,1,4,2 March 2013
Dunkirk," Interesting approach but hard to sit through
","Dunkirk was a disappointment and is easily Christopher Nolan's weakest movie to date. There were many issues I had with that movie: confusing overlapping story lines, exchangeable characters without any depth, mostly faceless acting performances, a constantly numbing, overtly dramatic and repetitive soundtrack and lots of headache-inducing shaky camera passages, even in parts of the movie when nobody is getting attacked. Those who call this movie one of the greatest war movies of all times clearly haven't watched many films of that kind. Over the past twenty years, films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War, My Way and Battle for Incheon: Operation Chromite all had intriguing characters, gripping tension, memorable scenes, moving soundtracks and spectacular special effects. Before you voice your opinion about Dunkirk or any of its reviews, you should be familiar with movies like these.However, there were still a few elements that I liked about Dunkirk that made the movie entertaining and overall slightly above average. First of all, the storytelling is an interesting experiment, as it follows the Dunkirk evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea and air. The land perspective is the most gripping one and follows the epic odyssey of a young British Private. The sea perspective has its strengths when a tragic accident happens on the boat of a courageous civilian who wants to support the Royal Navy but the characters could have been a little bit more fleshed out. The air perspective is the weakest one in my book despite an epic finale because the fight sequences always exactly look the same and it's at times hard to follow what happened to whose plane. A strong element of the movie is its historic accuracy despite a few fictionalized characters here and there. The settings look authentic and especially the uniforms and planes look realistic. It must also be added that stories about the war shall not be forgotten as history tends to repeat itself and as it's important to honour those who fought for the freedom of the future generations.In the end, Dunkirk has its merits and doesn't go the easy way with heroic characters, stunning special effects and traditional plots. However, the numerous overlapping plots are at times confusing, the characters are mostly redundant and the omnipresent score doesn't add to the movie as it was intended by the makers. If you are interested in the Second World War and have watched numerous war movies already, you might be interested in giving Dunkirk a shot as well. However, if you are less familiar with war movies, you might easily get bored with this film and should watch the movies I have mentioned in my introduction first.",6,3,6,23 August 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Average fantasy flick for die-hard fans of the Harry Potter universe
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is for die-hard fans of the Harry Potter universe only. The movie has a lack of interesting characters, plodding length and weak plot that make it hard to sit through. Especially the first hour is a lengthy tale without a proper story line that mostly focuses on mild slapstick humour.However, the film is saved by its creative universe, excellent special effects and of course the numerous intriguing beasts discovered throughout the movie. The second half of the movie quickens up the pace, becomes more sinister and ends on a high note in form of an epic battle.This movie never comes close to even the worst movies or novels of the Harry Potter franchise and is simply stated an average fantasy film. The hype around this film and its sequels is exaggerated and the cinematic Harry Potter universe should have concluded with one single movie about the seventh novel ten years ago. You can watch this movie if you are an avid fantasy movie fan but anyone else can ignore this start of a new series.",6,0,0,8 January 2020
Saw III," Facing the philosophical aspect of forgiveness
","After a grilsy yet intellectual first movie and an intense psychological duel for the sequel, this third entry in the franchise deals with the philosophical aspect of forgiveness. Serial killer John Kramer is on his deathbed but he keeps organizing his twisted games in order to make people value their lives until his final breath. He asks an accomplice to kidnap a doctor who must make sure the serial killer survives until his latest victim succeeds in completing a series of particularly intriguing tests as a broken family father must decide whether he forgives those who are responsible for his son's tragic death that also destroyed his life. However, it's not only his latest victim who has to decide to be forgiving as another person is also playing a game without even knowing it.The strongest element of the movie is its philosophical depth when the viewers needs to wonder how they would react under specific circumstances. Could you forgive a driver who hits your son so badly that he dies? How would you feel about a witness to this accident who doesn't intervene? What would you do to a judge that spares the reckless driver from a harsh sentence? The movie teaches us that we are all monsters inside but have different capacities in controling them.This third entry is also the one with the greatest depth regarding the dying serial killer. One understands his motivations better than in previous installments. He is open to discuss his points of view on his deathbed which gives us a strangely fascinating yet gloomily repelling insight.The film's stunning conclusion manages to surprise yet again as all loose ends are tied together and lead to a dramatic showdown that viewers won't see coming. The scriptwriters still manage to add intellectual depth at the most unexpected moments. The clever ending is rewarding and already leaves the viewers wanting to watch the next installment.The philosophical aspect of forgiveness makes this movie stand out. The dealy traps are slightly less twisted than before but much more personal for the test subjects. Thanks to this fresh approach, this film is only slightly less intriguing than the strong immediate predecessor. Fans of the series can't get around watching this film. Saw III underlines the franchise's status as greatest horror film series of the new millennium.",9,1,2,24 January 2019
Resident Evil," Science-fiction horror classic of the early years of the new millennium that has aged surprisingly well
","Resident Evil is the first of six live action movies based upon the Japanese Biohazard video game franchise. The movie tells the story of a mysterious attack on an underground research facility known as The Hive that is owned by Umbrella Corporation. A specialized commando attempts to enter the vast complex and find out what has happened. Three amnesiacs who are found near the facility are captured by the the commando. The group soon realizes that the scientists have been murdered and that the research facility hides abominable secrets that put their lives in danger.This movie has aged surprisingly well. The special effects look barely dated and convince with a gripping dystopian atmosphere. The locations are particularly intriguing as the entire movie takes place in a dark underground research facility and its immediate surroundings. The soundtrack underlines the film's atmosphere and comes around with sinister, liberating and gripping nu metal and alternative rock music. The story comes around with a few twists and turns. The characters are quite intriguing, especially enigmatic lead character Alice played by an excellent Milla Jovovich, tough police officer Rain Ocampo played by Michelle Rodriguez and the holograph played by Michaela Dicker who represents the facility's artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen. Resident Evil offers a balanced mixture of atmospheric and tense sequences and brutal and dynamic scenes. The combination of action, horror, mystery and science-fiction elements is also quite balanced.In the end, Resident Evil is certainly one of the very best live action movies based upon a video game franchise. I initially watched this film as a teenager and liked it but I have recently been watching it again as an adult and have come to the conclusion that I like it even better today than I did back in the days. The movie is in the spirit of numerous horror and science-fiction movies of the late nineties and early years of the millennium such as Cube, Equilibirum and My Little Eye. If you like these films, you are going to adore Resident Evil. Make sure to check out the video games as well if you haven't done so already.",9,3,3,12 June 2020
Climax," Homo homini lupus
","Caspar Noé's latest movie Climax is an experimental combination of a musical, drama and horror film.Climax is a musical because it revolves around a group of young French dancers who get prepared for their new show over the course of three days in an abandoned school building. The movie starts with interview sections as the different dancers talk about their motivations to join the group. The second scene shows the elaborate dance choreography. The third scene is the party after the last practice when you can see the characters dance to electronic music. The entire first quarter of the film focuses on dance moves and electronic music to portray how the characters express themselves artistically.The movie slowly shifts towards a drama. Someone has poisoned the sangria with LSD and the dancers start acting erratically, emotionally and aggressively. We observe a brother who overprotects his younger sister who is longing for more independence. We get to know that one of the female dancers is pregnant and she doesn't know who the father of her child could be. We come across a nervous mother who is desperately trying to protect her son from the dancers.The film ends as a horror movie as the situation escalates. Prejudice, rape and murder occur as the drugs bring out the worst in each and every single character. The film's second half and especially its final third are certainly hard to digest. This movie should only be watched by adults with an open mind and a strong stomach.The cinematography of the film needs to be pointed out. There are almost no cuts as the camera randomly follows characters throughout the fateful night which gives the movie a quite fluid vibe. The fact that the movie values music and movements over an actual plot or even dialogues is also particularly outstanding. The film starts with the credits, introduces chapters like silent movies used to do and the camera sometimes turns around to portray a world that has been shaken upside down.As nightmarish as the film might seem, Climax is actually based upon true events. Without pointing fingers, the movie certainly includes a lot of social criticism. It shows how partners, friends and even family members turn against each other once a drug has eliminated their self-control. The film also uses a lot of stereotypes that may be shocking at first contact but that turn out being more realistic that one might be willing to admit. It leads the viewers to question their societies and their values.In the end, Climax is a mindblowing experience unlike any other film. It's not easy to digest because of its explicit violence, thin plot and absence of dialogues but the aesthetic aspect, vibrant atmosphere and underlying messages pardon for its minor flaws. If you are an adult, have an open mind and strong stomach and like experimental cinema, this might become one of your very favourite movies.",9,1,2,13 March 2019
Non-Stop," A great Liam Neeson is starring in an average action-thriller
","'Non-Stop' is a solid action-thriller with the extraordinary lead actor Liam Neeson. I watched this movie because of him and even though he doesn't beat his best performances, Liam Neeson is absolutely convincing as cold-hearted human wreck and sorrow-ridden air Marshall. It's sad that his character isn't more developed in this movie as we never get to know whom he was talking to on the telephone in the beginning for example.The story itself is nothing new but could have been more convincing. The movie starts in a great way when the alcoholic chain smoking air Marshall gets text messages via a secure network on a flight from New York City to London, England. An unknown criminal announces that every twenty minutes a passenger will die if the air Marshall won't send 150 million dollars to an untraceable Swiss bank account. After an initial suspense, the story gets a little bit ridiculous when the first victims die. The first murder could have never been planned that way by the terrorists. The second murder isn't well explained either and even the third murder feels random even though it makes more sense than the first two. These are not the only plot holes in here. At that point, the story is running in circles, though. People are dying every twenty minutes, all characters are judging too quickly and the air Marshall loses control all the time. After a promising start, one just waits for something spectacular to happen but there is nothing more to this.Of course, we will get the so-called twist in the end and know who is behind the hijackings and killings. The solution though feels half- hearted and isn't really credible. It somehow doesn't make much sense to me. For me, this moment was a little letdown and the twist is (almost) more of a deus ex machina thing than anything out-thought.What else is there to say? Liam Neeson's acting is good and some secondary actors are doing a solid job as well but the characters represent too many stereotypes. It's the same for the story that feels as if one had already watched a similar movie before.The action scenes, special effects and the soundtrack are well done. The numerous text messages on screen get quite annoying and how could anyone write that fast as it's the case in the movie anyway?In the end, fans of Liam Neeson should watch this movie without a doubt. Anyone else will get a tension filled action-thriller without any big surprises. It's an entertaining movie to watch but also the kind of film that you will have forgotten in a few months. It's nothing truly impressive but still a good average effort. Instead of showing more or less convincing Hollywood cinema, I'm asking myself why the North American and European cinemas are not showing us more memorable and poignant films from Asia, Europe or South America.I was hesitating between six and seven points for this movie. The film is not overtly original but it's entertaining and it has Liam Neeson in it. Still, I was expecting more than this and that's why I went for the lower rating. Actually, 6,5 out of ten points would have been the perfect rating for me.",6,1,3,4 March 2014
It Follows," Interesting concept falling flat
","'It Follows' is an independent supernatural horror movie that takes place in and around Detroit, Michigan. The nightmarish story, the electronic score and the use of wide-angel lenses are inspired by classic American and European horror movies from the sixties and seventies. Especially the works of Dario Argento, John Carpenter and George Romero come to my mind.The main idea of the movie is fairly interesting. After sexual encounters, people are somehow infected since they are slowly followed by a supernatural entity that can take any appearance and which is trying to brutally kill them. Only infected people can see the danger while the supernatural entity isn't dangerous for anybody else as long as they don't try to interfere on purpose. It's impossible to kill the supernatural entity but one can chase it away by violently attacking it. Infected victims usually try to pass on the curse by having sexual encounters on their own but this doesn't seem to be an efficient solution either. The whole thing gets even more mysterious since it's not possible to pass the curse to everybody. Some people get infected during sexual encounters while others don't.The movie tells the story of a female college student that got infected by her new boyfriend who tries to hide his real identity and whereabouts. Along with her sister and several friends, she tries in vain to escape from the supernatural entity. She also tries to pass on the curse to several friends who want to help her. The movie features in fact three quite boring sex scenes and much more useless sexual innuendo that only distracts from the story. Since the danger is still present, the college student and her friends finally try to set a risky trap to kill the strange entity for good.The movie has sparked numerous interpretations in regard to the source of the supernatural entity and the film's symbolism. Some critics believe that this movie is simply portraying a nightmare and that there is no deeper meaning behind it. Others have interpreted the film as a parable on sexually-transmitted diseases and its consequences. Some people claim that the movie deals with primal anxieties about intimacy and first sexual relationships. As you can see, there are a lot of interesting questions around this phenomenon but none of these are actually answered.Sadly, the interesting concept, the great vintage atmosphere, the brilliant score and the clever use of wide camera angles aren't enough to make the entire movie enjoyable. One of the main flaws of the movie is its constantly slow pace and lack of gripping tension. I have no problem with restrained supernatural horror movies but most of them get more and more menacing and end in a really intensive way. This isn't the case at all with this film. One constantly expects the movie to get a little boost as time goes by but it ultimately falls flat. Another problem is the generic acting and the exchangeable characters. I'm aware of the fact that this movie tries to portray a bunch of ordinary teenagers that get shaken up by things they can't fight or understand but the actors and especially actresses are so dull that one simply doesn't care about their fates at all. In the end, this overrated movie wastes a really mysterious plot idea and great inspirations from classic genre films for a lackluster flick without any true highlights. Since this amorphous film doesn't have a real ending, there are rumours about a sequel with another interesting story. In this potential project, some infected teenagers try to trace the supernatural entity back to find out where it came from and how the curse started. That's why I'm not yet giving up on this project but as it is now, I would recommend you to skip this over-hyped revival flick and wait for a more interesting second instalment.",5,2,57,15 April 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A plodding fairy tale saved by extraordinary acting performances
","Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is one of the Quentin Tarantino movies that is the most difficult to describe. Usually, there are movies of his that convince with atmosphere, depth and twists such as Inglorious Basterds or films that are rather shallow, referential and confusing like Kill Bill. The only movie that is somewhere in between both extremes might be Jackie Brown that convinces with great acting and cool retro atmosphere but disappoints with unnecessary lengths and a weak story. This new movie could be compared to Jackie Brown.The acting performances, especially by a very cool Brad Pitt and a vividly emotional Leonardo DiCaprio, are absolutely outstanding. Without the two brilliant main actors, this movie would have been painfully average but the strong acting performances make it a good movie, neither more nor less. The movie truly manages to capture the spirit of the end of the golden age of Hollywood with numerous references to popular television series and movies such as The Green Hornet and Rosemary's Baby. The movie cleverly mixes facts and fiction.However, the movie clearly overstays its welcome with a running time of one hundred sixty-one minutes. The film takes more than two hours to introduce all characters and settings until the climax unfolds in about ten minutes. While most of Quentin Tarantino's movies have a clever twist, the one used here is slightly disappointing at first contact but at least offers some food for thought in hindsight. This is the kind of movie that grows on you as you think about it later on while it slightly disappoints while watching it.This movie should be recommended to those who are either interested in the history of the American film industry or admire Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio who would both deserve Academy Awards for their extraordinary performances. The movie however has massive lengths and an almost unspectacular story. It's worth being watched at the cinema but overall slightly overrated due to the massive critical acclaim any Quentin Tarantino movie seems to receive.",7,0,2,26 August 2019
Django Unchained," Many lovely details and an outstanding acting disarm the mediocre story
","Here it comes, Quentin Tarantino's new blockbuster and Italo Western homage 'Django Unchained'. Personally, I happen to find Tarantino's movies quite a mixed bag as he has done anything from stupid disaster pieces such as 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' up to very thought out stuff like 'Inglorious Basterds'. His new movie is among the better ones he has released but still not the best.What I immediately liked about the movie is the camera work with many wide angles, natural Stillleben and shots on the eyes of the actors to capture their emotions. If you like directors like Sergio Leone, you will know what I'm talking about and if you happen to like him, you will also adore this movie. The opening scene presenting the cast already gets you into an old school western atmosphere. The amazing soundtrack is another strong point all along this movie. After some very explicit scenes, Tarantinos puts a vivid and catchy track that grabs your attention and makes it easier to digest what you've just seen. Tarantino certainly has a good feeling for impressive settings and gripping atmospheres.He puts a lot of details in his movie once again but only good connoisseurs may detect all of them. In one scene, the new Django Jamie Foxx sits next to a bar and an old guy who spoke Italian asks him his name and how it's spelled. Well, this old guy is Franco Nero who portrayed Django for the very first time and that's what makes this scene so funny as he knows off course how this name is spelled. If you recognize Franco Nero, you will laugh out loud during that scene, anybody who doesn't know him may just find that scene overlong and strange. A similar event happens towards the end when Tarantino appears himself as an actor which is another funny moment.In general, this movie has a lot of humour once again that contrasts the long dialogues as well as the detailed killing scenes. This aspect works very well thanks to the acting of Christoph Waltz who is just amazing and incredibly diversified. He's not as great as in 'Inglorious Basterds' but comes very close and would deserve one more Academy Award for his acting in my opinion. That being said, the actors simply do an incredible job in this film. Jamie Foxx is a quite diversified character and one really cares about his fate until the end of the movie which is very important. Samuel L. Jackson plays a great villain and does it in a very credible way. Leonardo DiCaprio happens to play in more and more dark and mature films and convinces once again as unpredictable maniac.This being said, everything about this movie seems to be perfect but one very important thing is missing: the story. The movie has no twists or surprises and also includes many lengths after a strong beginning and just before an explosive ending. These lengths include the scenes on the way to Candie Land or several dialogues inside the mansion. These scenes are only saved by the strong acting by Waltz, Jackson and Co. but would ruin a movie if they were done by average actors. This movie would have been much more fluid if it was cut down to two hours of running time. The original Italo Westerns like 'Once Upon A Time In The West' had better story lines and a few mysterious characters that would only reveal their true intentions in the very end that are missing in this modern adaption.Nevertheless, apart of the story line and the lengths, this movie is a definite must see and lovely done homage to the era of Italo Westerns. Any fan of Tarantino should be satisfied with this flick even if it's not his best and even if there were a couple of better movies than this one in 2012.",8,6,15,12 January 2013
Get Out," Fighting stereotypes with stereotypes. OR: Horror hype: Once again, it doesn't follow.
","As a horror movie connoisseur, I couldn't get around this movie that has become a surprising box office success, has got positive reviews from critics and fans and has developed a hype that might classify it as future cult movie. Behold! The same was said about It Follows not so long ago, a movie I thought was tedious and overrated. As it turns out, Get Out is another genre movie that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, it's better than another Paranormal Activity sequel and is overall a slightly above average film but it surely isn't the stunning masterpiece most people make of it. Just to be clear, this film barely classifies as horror movie. I would call it a psychological thriller with some misplaced supernatural scientific elements. The movie had an overall vaguely mysterious atmosphere but it didn't get scary aside of two minor jump scares involving a deer and a servant.Let's start with the positives. First of all, the movie has a continuously intriguing mysterious atmosphere. This atmosphere isn't only supported by the gloomy plot but also by calm and precise camera work that offers a more than welcome alternative to cheap shaky camera stylistics in contemporary horror cinema. The movie features a moody soundtrack that blends in without being as eccentric as the Insidious scores. A movie is carried by its main character and British newcomer Daniel Kaluuya is a gifted actor. The character's emotions are portrayed accurately. You can see how the main character starts as calm, grounded and smart person and becomes nervous, hectic and confused. Daniel Kaluuya is a name you should keep on your mind because we might see more stunning movies with him. I could even see him becoming the next incarnation of James Bond.Let's talk about the negative parts. First of all, the trailer is basically the entire movie, so don't watch it. I didn't even watch it and it still took me less than five minutes after the main character arrived at the mansion to figure out what was going on and what would happen next. The fact that the movie is so predictable has a negative impact on its otherwise intense atmosphere. The movie fails to offer any surprises to people who are familiar with horror movies. Despite a short running time, the movie feels stretched. When I'm watching a horror movie, I'm not expecting any action and I'm ready to wait until the movie quickens up the pace but some elements in the film are either irrelevant or repetitive. Instead of showing us one scene where specific characters act weirdly, the makers offer three similar scenes until the most feeble-minded viewer has realized what's wrong with these specific characters. A subtle horror movie should take its audience more seriously and offer less redundant clues.This leads us to the acting performances. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a stunning performance. Allison Williams offers a solid performance but the two main characters have no chemistry and fail to represent a realistic couple. I could still accept this because that hint might have been intentional. What I can't accept is that every single other actor acts over-the-top, no matter if it suits their roles or not. It starts with the main character's hyperactive friend, goes on with repulsively rude police officers and ends with an entire family and its friends who behave as if they came from a different planet. This acting strategy is repeated to death until the characters have become parodies of specific stereotypes. That doesn't fit to a movie that relies on its gloomy atmosphere and intends to spread a message against stereotypes.On the other side, the movie takes itself too seriously. The scene involving a car accident and an encounter with a local police officer is obviously included as an element of foreshadowing announcing the main character's struggle with his mother's death and with white people with debatable stereotypes. However, this scene feels so forced and pseudo-intellectual that it takes away from the movie's atmosphere instead of adding to it. A very similar thing happens at the end, when the writers offer awkward science-fiction elements appropriate for old-fashioned Frankenstein movies but not for a film with such a relevant message when police violence against black people has increased in what is supposed to be the flagship of democracy, equality and liberty. It seems that the movie makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to offer an entirely serious psychological thriller with relevant social critiques or a clever parody playing with stereotypes. In the end, they failed at both attempts. The movie feels directionless.My guess is that it got such praise because it portrays an admittedly sympathetic black man struggling with abusive white people. It's funny how a movie that intends to mock stupid stereotypes is itself based upon stereotypes. Would this very same movie have had the same positive reviews if it had portrayed a white main character being abused by black people? I'm quite confident that wouldn't have been the case because people would have called the makers of this movie racist and the film's message debatable. This proves that the reason why this film receives such approval is because of its message that is at the pulse of time and yet simplifies a very important topic too much. If you take away the movie's intentions, what do we have left? We have an average horror movie.If you aren't familiar with horror movies and want to get a smooth introduction with a psychological thriller, this film is a good choice. If you are rightfully infuriated by the current rise of stereotypes including racism, you will get some food for thought. If you are looking for a clever or innovating horror movie that justifies its hype, you won't get satisfaction. My final suggestion is to rent this movie instead of spending well-earned money on a cinema ticket.",6,6,15,28 March 2017
Insidious," Are you ready for a dark ride?
","This movie is one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen. Before I start my review, let me suggest you to watch this flick in the cinemas or at least with a modern home cinema equipment to be capable to appreciate all the noisy sounds, creepy atmospheres and the brilliant score. I might also warn you. This movie is nothing for people that easily have nightmares. You have to like the feeling of getting scared to watch this movie. I was almost crawling out of the cinema at the end of this dark ride because I had so many moments of scary fears and I my heart pumped like a rattling machine gun but I must admit that I somehow like this feeling and when I got out of the cinema this feeling got away and the film didn't haunt me or kept me from sleeping.As you might already suppose, this film is not your usual horror slasher or gore movie as it works much more with images and sounds. It's a supernatural movie about demons and ghosts but that won't stop you from getting addicted from the bottom to the top to this intense and dark movie. It starts all very slow just to get more and more profound and scary and to end with a big bang and a little twist.This is a movie full of ups and downs. The sound rises, the camera moves into a dark room and an actor opens a door or looks somewhere and you expect something scary but nothing happens at all. You get used to it, the music slows down, the actors breathes and feels relieved when suddenly a dark scheme appears and almost freaks him to death in a moment of relative tranquillity. That's what's so strong about this movie. Even if you know what happens and what the strange things mean or look like, you never know when they appear, how they appear and what happens next. This movie plays with wrong expectations, terrible fears and emotions. I have rarely seen anything that was as scary as this.My only reason to not give the top rating is that the general idea of the movie is nothing new and could have been even more original. But the rest is great from the camera works over the realistic acting to the brilliant score. In times of 'Saw 7' or 'Scary Movie 4', this flick is a true relief. It helps to vote up the reputation of a genre that has become too commercial, gore and ridiculous in the last few years and should get the status of a future classic. This movie might be the renaissance of a whole genre and is on one level with the scary classics from the seventies and eighties and unites the old and the new generation with its creepy approach. This is the first big cinematic highlight of the year 2011. Don't miss the chance to watch it.Are you ready for a dark ride?",9,3,7,13 May 2011
A Quiet Place," Enjoy the silence
","A Quiet Place is a very creative horror movie. It takes place in the near future when mysterious creatures roam the planet that have acute hearing and kill anything and anyone they hear. We follow the lives of the Abbott family, consisting of a courageous mother, a survivalist father, their deaf daughter, their scared son and their curious youngest child. Over the course of about ninety minutes, we see the family face numerous emotive challenges, fight the mysterious creatures and try to find their weakness in order to survive.The film is short and to the point, with an emotional and ominous atmosphere and story line. The fact that one doesn't know where the creatures come from makes the movie even more horrifying and mysterious. Despite the obvious lack of longer dialogues, viewers empathize with the diversified characters and their common goal to save their family by any means necessary. The acting performances are expressive since the actresses and actors rarely have the occasion to speak. The action sequences are brief and intense. The film has a few minor jump scares but otherwise focuses on its menacing atmosphere. The movie ends on a high note, perfectly balanced between emotional and intellectual elements, with one major problem resolved but many questions left unanswered that offer the audience some food for thought and make the movie unforgettable.There are only two minor elements to criticize about the movie. First of all, it's hard to believe that a mother would willingly give birth to a child under the grisly circumstances described above, hence risking the lives of the entire family. Having sexual intercourse in an environment where every sound leads to certain death seems out of character for parents who are otherwise very careful, intellectual and organized. Not aborting the fetus seems like an unlikely decision in a world where earnest survival is more important than moral values. Secondly, the movie ended on a high note and certainly doesn't need a sequel. The impact of many great films has been harmed in the past by building a franchise around them when greed took over creativity. I'm not interested in watching a sequel for such a unique film and wished the creative forces behind this movie would reconsider that option and instead focus on another fresh idea.In the end, if you like creative horror, science-fiction and survival movies, you can't get around watching A Quiet Place. It has outstanding acting performances, an ominous atmosphere and a unique concept. It's refreshing to have a movie that focuses on sounds rather than dialogues. People who have the tendency to talk all the time without saying anything at all should watch this film as well as Don't Breathe and take them as lessons that sometimes a gesture can mean more than a thousand words. Enjoy the silence!",9,0,0,6 November 2018
The Bourne Legacy," More of the same but on a quite high level
","As a big fan of the Bourne franchise, I was expecting this movie with mixed feelings. I was afraid this movie would only be a rehash of the solid trilogy and give us more of the same but on a lower level than usual. On the other side, I was looking forward to see a new chapter around the conspiracy legacy as I felt that there were still some things left to say and see after the last film.In the end, I got a mix of both positive and negative expectations. Let's start with the bad points. The story in here really is nothing new and quite predictable from the beginning to the end. There are no twists and there isn't as much sweating action and tension as in the first three movies. I would have liked to see some more innovation in this movie with a more profound script. Even though the character of Jason Bourne is mentioned throughout the flick, I would have liked to see a closer connection to this unfinished story line but maybe that's something that may happen in the future as this new film clearly is a start of a new series if there are no unexpected pitfalls. I might also add that the movie had nevertheless a couple of lengths to get kicked off in its first two thirds. Some people say that the new movie ended when it really started to get intense and that the finish happened to be rather abrupt. This is true as I would have liked to see some sort of a more developed epilogue to this film.Now, let's point out the positive elements. First of all, the acting of the two main actors is surprisingly good and you really believe these characters. They are maybe not as charismatic as a Franka Potente and a Matt Damon but it's a quite close call. Apart of that, the settings for the new movie are as stunning or even better as in the first three flicks. The chosen locations are the winter world of Alaska, several cities in the United States of America and Manila in the Philippines. I really liked the survival elements of the first third of the movie, the character development that occurred in the second part of the flick and the incredible chasing scenes through the streets and on the rooftops of the city of Manila. Even though the chase was a little bit overlong with around twenty minutes of literally called running time and even though the chase lacked of a true final highlight, I was really impressed by these diverting moments that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.To keep it short, this movie will divide the fans into two camps. Some might find this beginning of a new era useless and not unique enough to survive. Others will be pleasantly surprised to see a movie that features all the trademarks people liked so much about the franchise. This flick won't win any prices for innovation but it's quite entertaining and makes you want more after the fast paced ending. I was critical and still have some negative things to point out but in the end there were much more positive than negative elements in this movie and I'm looking forward for a possible sequel. On this level, the Bourne flicks might maybe one day get the same degree of appreciation as the James Bond franchise if Hollywood carries on to write more intriguing screenplays around this phenomenon.",7,4,9,17 August 2012
Unknown," Nothing new except the Germany factor
","This intriguing psycho thriller really offers nothing quite interesting or new to any one that has seen 'XIII', 'The Bourne Trilogy', 'Wrong identity' and similar movies. A man suffers from amnesia and is looking for his identity and it is quite quickly obvious what his secrets are if you happen to know the mentioned movies.This being said, the movie is still very entertaining and well acted even though there are many clichés. The rich professor must be helped by a poor illegal immigrant girl and the bad boys seem always to be perfectly organized and chase the haunted without pity. The usual car chases and execution scenes underline the lack of originality of the movie. The only thing that distinguishes this movie from many others is the fact that it takes place in Berlin and that many well known and promising German actors got a few roles in this movie and take their chances to convince a larger public. As I happen to be from Germany, I found it interesting to see such a polished psycho thriller take place at famous and infamous locations of the German capital and the movie gives a very little glimpse at the culture of this city by showing its beautiful and ugly sides. This movie creates a certain wanders lust to go and discover the city and makes a good publicity for the country.After all, once you accepted the weak and ripped off story, you really get well entertained and see a solid acting and nice shooting places. I wouldn't suggest to go to the cinema for this movie as it is quite overrated and I wouldn't buy a copy of it in a couple of months, but I would really suggest to rent this movie for a night if you feel for it and in that way, you won't be disappointed if you slow your expectations down as I did. If you found the main idea interesting but you didn't like the movie, go for the ones I have mentioned in the beginning that are fairly better.",6,2,4,4 March 2011
Hero," An intellectually, philosophically and visually challenging masterpiece
","'Hero' is one of the very best wu xia movies since the beginning of the new millennium. This movie isn't just recommendable for fans of Chinese period movies but for anyone who admires creative cinema.Zhang Yimou's masterpiece convinces with an unusual story line. The movie focuses on the mysterious meeting between a prefect who claims to have defeated the empire's three most dangerous assassins and the careful, clever and philosophical emperor himself. The first third of the movie explains the prefect's version of the story. The second third focuses on the emperor's analysis of the story. The last third finally reveals what really happened.If you think that the movie might be repetitive because the same story is told from three different perspectives, you are wrong. Each story builds upon the previous version and only adds new elements. This unusual structure adds a mysterious and even surreal vibe to the movie. This film comes around with a few clever twists and turns but the epic conclusion reveals everything the viewer needs to know.The mysterious and philosophical message and vibe of the movie is supported by one of the best cinematographies ever done in cinema. Zhang Yimou works a lot with different colours and their meanings such as white for innocence, red for passion, green for hope, blue for dignity or black for darkness. The different settings and landscapes also add to the movie since key scenes take place inside a bare palace that represents isolation, a blue lake that represents spirituality or a hot desert that represents loneliness. The settings and costumes are in perfect harmony with the slow and precise camera work and a calm and spiritual soundtrack. The fighting scenes blend in very well and have a surreal touch where mental strength is much more efficient than physical power. The different characters are flying through bamboo forests or over peaceful lakes and are constantly using their natural surroundings to fight their opponents. This movie symbolizes the harmony of men and nature, underlines the efficiency of mental strength and delivers a message of community and peace where the greater good for an entire empire is more significant than the fate of a single person, family, location, race or ideology. These messages are delivered in a mostly grounded and intellectual way and only the final scenes feel a little bit melodramatic and slightly pathetic.In the end, 'Hero' is much more than a simple martial arts movie. It's one of the most intellectually, philosophically and visually profound movies of the new millennium. This film has a heart, soul and different messages that are at least interesting to analyze, empathize with and understand no matter if you end up agreeing or disagreeing with them. Anybody who considers him- or herself intellectual should have watched this unique masterpiece.",9,0,0,20 July 2016
Lincoln," This failed classic feels pointless and inconsistent
","Before you get me wrong, let me set things straight. I have loads of respect for the historical character of Abraham Lincoln and his achievements. I studied human sciences for four years at university. I am interested in topics with economical, ethic, ethnic, philosophical, political, psychological and social issues. I have elaborated opinions on many topics but I am open to listen to opinions of others if they can explain and elaborate them in front of me no matter what their point of view might be. I think it's important to create movies about historical events and characters and I'm not talking about all those biased and rather similar war movies that have flooded our cinemas since 9/11. I was looking forward to watch this movie. I thought that it didn't get so many awards for nothing. I have much respect for Steven Spielberg. I adore Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Everything seemed to be prepared for a great film but I got quickly disappointed.But let's start with the positive things first. First of all, the costumes, decorations and settings are breathtaking. They really take you back in time. The artistic details are authentic, elaborated and rich. Any artist and historian will enjoy this aspect. The acting is also on the positive side. Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation of the legendary president is authentic, intellectual and very stylish. Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Thaddeus Stevens is another highlight. There is a little surprise about this character in the end of the movie that put a smile on my face. Let's though talk about the negative aspects. The most important thing is the storytelling. I'm aware of the fact that this is not a biopic and that the movie only focuses on a little aspect of Abraham Lincoln's political career. But I feel that the viewers are thrown too quickly into the story. The movie features several scenes that touch the president's past and future or the issues of the Civil War. If you keep these scenes, you also have to give a few more details about them. I know American history well and was able to follow this movie but as a blockbuster for a bigger public, this film clearly lacks details and orientation. The film should have spent more time on the issues of the Civil War. The introduction and character development of the president as well as of his friends and foes should have been done in a smoother and more detailed way. The film ends with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln that is shot in the most boring way possible. If you include this detail, you should have shown the whole story of the murder, why it eventually took place and what happened shortly afterwards. If you really want to create a movie that is some sort of statement against slavery, you should have shown the evolution that the proud black people of the United States of America have gone through since the pioneer work of Abraham Lincoln instead of only showing the assassination of that ladder one. Sometimes, I feel that even the makers of the movie weren't sure what this movie should have been like. The simplistic title 'Lincoln' clearly underlines this issue. The movie is a historical drama but of what kind? An extended biopic? Check. A social drama around the American Civil War? Check. A political statement? Check. By trying to be all of this at the same time, the movie feels confusing and pointless. The dialogues are sometimes very elaborated and intellectual but sometimes almost too simplistic. This quite strange contrast made this movie rather incoherent for me. In one scene, Abraham Lincoln has a philosophically intriguing discussion with his wife and at another moment, he has to hold a speech that is incredibly improvised, pointless and short. There are many of these two- faced moments and they really bothered me. Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones do great jobs but the supporting actors were everything but important or impressive. I would have liked to learn more about the motivations and views of the political adversaries of Abraham Lincoln. Many intriguing historical characters of the Civil War are introduced like cameo appearances. Once again, the makers didn't seem to be sure what they wanted to do. If you want to do a movie about the Thirteenth Amendment only, then you should have excluded the details about the Civil War. But if you include them, please elaborate on the historical context and let the actors some space and time to show their talent.Instead of doing so, the movie includes many useless dialogues. Some discussions and speeches are without a doubt intriguing but what you get here are almost one hundred fifty minutes of dialogues. This is definitely too much. The makers should have included some additional elements to lighten things up. This could have been a few battle scenes of the Civil War. It could have been a few flashbacks elaborating on the Abraham Lincoln's life. It could have been the difficult relation to his wife or family as well. It could have been the complicated relationship between Thaddeus Stevens and his wife. Many possibilities were there to create a more entertaining and at the same time profound movie. What we get are only dialogues of an unstable quality as in an old fashioned theatre play.The weak points are much more prominent than the stronger parts. On the positive side, we have great costumes, locations and settings and two solid main actors. One the negative side, there are too many dull dialogues, more or less convincing supporting actors and many pointless scene choices. This movie is hard to sit through, even for those who are interested in the topic. I wouldn't watch it again. I can't understand all the awards and positive critics. I come to the conclusion that 2012 wasn't a good year for Hollywood cinema.",4,2,4,15 May 2013
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Frantic pace and vivid entertainment
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse was a massive disappointment for me when I first watched it one decade and a half ago. While the first movie had a clever plot, stunning locations and mysterious atmosphere, this sequel walks off the beaten path. The story is extremely thin, the gloomy locations in a destroyed city are everything but spectacular and the atmospheric passages are replaced by countless action scenes. The latter make the movie somewhat entertaining in hindsight as I have recently been rediscovering this live action movie franchise. Ignore the plot and the lack of atmosphere, grab something to drink and to eat, invite a few friends, switch your brain off and enjoy this shallow but entertaining movie for what it is.The film starts where the previous one had ended two years earlier as lead character Alice makes it out alive of the secret laboratory called the Hive to come back to the surface of Raccoon City. The dangerous T-Virus couldn't be contained in the Hive and has spread across the city as people transform into monsters and attack everyone around them. The leaders of Umbrella Corporation decide to lock the city down which leads to violent riots. They soon realize that the virus cannot be contained and plan on using a nuclear bomb to destroy the city at dusk. Alice must find a way out of the city and save as many lives as possible during one fateful night. She cooperates with a doctor who has worked for Umbrella Corporation but is willing to turn against them to save his daughter who is caught at school.On the positive side, the film has a perfect length of ninety-four minutes. Its pace is frantic which makes the movie entertaining from start to finish. Lead character Alice develops from an amnesiac survivor into a skilled fighter who definitely turns against the corporation she had once worked for. The numerous action scenes are intense and spectacular. The threat of a nuclear bomb adds some tension and thrill to the film.However, there are also numerous negative things to mention. The story is simplistic, shallow and predictable. The new characters aren't as attaching, memorable and unique as those from the first movie. The locations are rather repetitive as the destroyed city is much less intriguing than the complex laboratory from the first film. The idea to transform the only other survivor beside the lead character from the first film into a brainless monster is lacking depth.Still, the movie transforms a franchise that started as a mysterious science-fiction thriller into an overwhelming action spectacle that walks off the beaten path. The connection and transition between the two movies is nevertheless done rather smoothly. While the movie is lacking creativity and depth, it convinces with entertainment and pace. The film has aged rather well and is actually better than I had remembered it. Still, this movie is nowhere near being a great movie and can only be recommended to fans of fast-paced science-fiction action-thrillers who are familiar with the first film.",5,0,0,18 June 2020
Mulholland Drive," Excellent Lynchian routine - the twin of 'Lost highway'
","This movie is another surreal piece of art by David Lynch, but it's not as great as the amazing and twisted 'Lost highway' or the wonderful 'Twin Peaks' series. Those movies ore episode are simply over the top. But it is still a movie that is more intense, intelligent and surprising than most of the other so called psycho thrillers and is worth a ten star vote.A little advice: You must also watch 'Lost highway', because this movie is like a twin of this unique masterpiece! Now, let us begin with the bad points, because there aren't very much. This movie is not as twisted, surreal and surprising than 'Lost highway'. That doesn't mean that you might be able to understand it when you have just watched it once, but your not that literally lost as in 'Lost highway'. I also think that this movie copies the structure of 'Lost highway' a lot and is less innovating. There is also a slow paced beginning, then a key event, the looking for the truth beyond dream and reality, the sudden change and the twisted ending connecting the end of the movie with its beginning. With the scenes of the house party in the ending, Lynch gives a lot of possible solutions and keys to the viewer and doesn't let him or her just stunning and without any clue like in his previous work. But if you think by now that this movie is easy to understand than David Lynch gives you such a strange element in the last scene of the movie that makes you desperate and that makes you think that you are back in 'Eraserhead'. But why should Lynch change his style after he had created a true masterpiece a few years ago? We should just see those points as minor critic points. It is not an ten plus extra star masterpiece but just an excellent ten star movie.Now, there is another negative point that I have to mention in a more general way: David Lynch wanted to start a new series around 'Mulholland Drive' and this would have been such a great experience as 'Twin Peaks' was or even better and David Lynch put all his creative imagination and dedicated a part of himself to the project - but Americas blockbuster-minded, easy-watching-commercialized Hollywood bosses didn't believe in a success and didn't accord the necessary amounts to one of their genius - the series might not have been popular and a good sell. That's why David Lynch was never able to finish his dream of a new series and we might have never seen parts of his filming if some French investors wouldn't have supported him and convinced him to make at least a movie out of his filming. David Lynch got financial support and an open-minded entourage and that's why he turned some new scenes, worked out a slightly new screenplay and created this new movie. A big thank you to the French supporters and thumps down towards the American film industry which let fall one of their best talents. And maybe all those complicated circumstances are the reason why Lynch made cartoons and worked as a producer in the next years and we had to wait seven years before he came back with the low-budget semi-masterpiece 'Inland Empire', it's a really sad thing.Now, let's talk about the very positive parts of the movie. It has a little bit less dark atmosphere in the beginning than 'Lost highway', but there is a key event and some action right after the introduction that make this movie easier to watch - the 'accident' on the Mulholland Drive. But after this happen some really strange scenes that create a really thrilled atmosphere and that make the viewer of that movie think, guess and analyze - the strange old couple, the guy who has strange nightmares, the killer who's doing some stupid mistakes... There are many interesting details in this movie, even more than in 'Lost highway' and the viewer becomes somehow an analyzer or detective. This movie requests multiple viewings and personally, I discover new elements after each viewing and I have seen the movie at least three or four times by now and it wasn't the last time. You really see that Lynch was supposed to do a series with this one because of all the well thought details.'Mulholland Drive' lives also from the great acting of the two feminine main actors, especially the really charming Naomi Watts who does the job of her life. Every character is unique in this movie even the smaller roles like the nightmare guy and this point is even done better and more intense than in 'Lost highway'. Only the role of the cowboy has a lot of similarities to the role of the mystery man in 'Lost highway', it is just a pity that he has not much space in this movie.And there is the same advice that I gave for 'Lost highway': expect the unexpected! That may not be as clear in the first three quarters of the movie, it is less disturbing that other works of Lynch, but in the last one, you should better be prepared for some weird stuff that was worth the wait. I agree with critics who say that this movie has a certain Lynchian routine - but his routine is far away from being boring and especially the final thirty minutes should convince you! So, if you want to see a movie that makes work your mind and feelings, a movie you must concentrate on and that may request multiple viewings to understand, you will really appreciate this one. If you're looking for an easy movie for a DVD night with some friends - go for something else, because your party people might get frightened!",10,3,4,9 August 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bang! Slay! Smash! Boom! Rape! Kill! Die! - Welcome to Tarantino's new world!
","I can't understand the brilliant and positive critics all around this movie. Has anyone seen the Asian action movies which Tarantion want to honour? Or is everybody thinking that one can't give an bad review to a film that has been directed by someone who has created so well received cult movies as 'Reservoir dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction' or who has been involved in 'From dusk 'til dawn'? Well, I think that the whole story of this film is just very superficial (simple story of vengeance), has many lacks of logic (as the main actress escapes from the hospital after having been in a coma)and is mostly focused on some gore effects and exaggerated fight scenes without any Asian elegance or philosophy (the almost endless fight scene around the fountain of blood). Sometimes, I think that an aggressive teenager who likes some gore and splatter horror movies and some fight movies in the key of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean-Claude van Damme rather that Ti Lung or David Chiang had the idea of such a movie, but not a adult who knows the whole genre and has an IQ of 160.To really evaluate this film you might have seen the original Asian movies that inspired Quentin Tarantino. This kind of filming was an art for itself, while 'Kill Bill' is just a superficial gore movie with a lot of dead people, fight scenes and wanna-be cool dialogues.Give those Asian films a chance and forget about this silly opera of violence from a director who has done a few nice movies in the past and lives from its reputation...",3,12,19,5 April 2010
Saw II," Psychological duel of vital importance
","Creating a successful movie on amateur actors, inexperienced screenwriters and low budget is quite an accomplishment in itself. Following such a film up with a strong sequel within a single year is an even greater challenge. Somehow, Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman delivered the goods and offered a movie that kept the grisly tension of the original movie and added some depth to old and new characters. Even though this sequel isn't as creative as the first installment, it comes surprisingly close and underlines the significance of this contemporary horror movie franchise.The movie revolves around four strong lead characters, including two old and two new ones. The film gives an insight how the mild-mannered John Kramer became the cold-hearted Jigsaw and elaborates upon the twisted philosophy behind his actions.Survivor Amanda Young who had a rather brief appearance in the predecessor is a very important and unpredictable character in this sequel who has to play another deadly game with a group of seven strangers who must uncover what they have in common in order to survive.Police investigation is more important in the sequel than in the predecessor. The viewers are introduced to two officers with completely different philosophies who complement each other perfectly. Allison Kerry is a factual, pragmatic and realistic investigator who always follows the rules by the book in a nearly emotionless way.Eric Matthews on the other side is a brutal, emotional and pitiless investigator who regularly breaks the rules and clashes not only with colleagues and superiors but also with the criminals he has to deal with and his own family members.This is an important detail since his estranged son is among the serial killer's eight test subjects. The investigator and the serial face off in a psycholigical duel that may decide upon life and death which leads to a showdown with unexpected twists.If you appreciated the first entry in the franchise, you are also going to like this surprisingly rewarding sequel as well as all other installments. This second entry is even less graphic than the predecessor and can genuinely be described as psychological thriller. It convinces with diversified characters, sinister locations and a twisted plot that offers an elevated number of surprises for the gripping finale. Once again, this entry in the franchise finds the perfect balance between grisly and intellectual elements that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",9,1,2,23 January 2019
Ip Man," The little brother of Jet Li's masterpiece 'Fearless'
","This is a beautiful martial arts movie with stunning fight scenes that also features some historic drama elements and a slightly philosophical touch which creates a rather addicting potpourri. It's portrait of Chinese culture, pride and rebellion during the Japanese occupation and is starring an authentic and brave main hero and a couple of interesting characters like his proud wife, a brutal bandit who wants to become a martial arts legend or a traitor and translator who works with the Japanese and has some important inner struggles.Nevertheless, this movie is slightly overrated if you have seen the very similar but more emotional and profound 'Fearless' by and with Jet Li a couple of years ago. Ip Man lacks of a profound story, aesthetic details and human passion that the other movie included. It's still an entertaining flick but has not many surprises, intense scenes or parts that may truly trouble you emotionally. You will basically watch this flick for its historic elements and its fight scenes while the acting and the story are rather mediocre after all.That's why this movie is not as brilliant as its reputation. If you're a fan of Asian martial arts movies, you shouldn't expect anything groundbreaking as there are many better classic and modern flicks of the genre. On the other side, for an occidental viewer, this is still an exotic movie that may grab your attention and that is at least worth a loan at your local shop.",6,1,2,23 January 2012
Prisoners," The best acting performances of the year
","I have seen many good movies from all around the world this year but 'Prisoners' seems to be the best North American film of the year so far. It's not so much about the story of the movie that recalls the French Canadian '7 Days' movie by Daniel Grou that was inspired by a Patrick Senécal novel. Both films tell the story of a desperate family father who seeks revenge on a strange suspect for kidnapping (or worse?) his daughter while everything around him is suddenly falling apart.The impressive things about 'Prisoners' are others. One must mention the constant dark atmosphere of the movie. This is due to the intensive story that is in fact the worst nightmare for any loving father or mother on earth. This movie is an intense mixture of the drama and thriller genres with a few decently used gore scenes and scary moments that aren't a far call from the horror genre. Each character shown in this movie is going through really hard times from the family father, his wife, his son and his best friends over the more and more isolated detective to the suspected kidnapper and a strange copycat kidnapper. In addition to this, most of the time in this movie the sky looks very grey, it's raining or actions take place in the middle of almost moonless nights. The inoffensive but dark and somewhat uneasy score underlines this depressive film noir approach.Not only the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who created the intense drama 'Incendies' in the past delivers a detailed and intense work. The most outstanding thing is the acting. Hugh Jackman plays the role of his life as a desperate family father who is slowly going insane and ready to do anything to save his daughter. It's hard to portray a character who is going through such an incredible nightmare but Hugh Jackman is always convincing. You can feel his emotions in every word he speaks, in every move he makes and in every breath he takes. This acting performance should be worthy of an Academy Award. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as great and also does his best acting performance. He portrays a visibly nervous detective if you just take a look on his almost hyperactive eye movements. We see a detective who tries to be professional and dedicated to his job but who gets more and more isolated and who starts making more and more mistakes. By the end of the movie, the kidnapping case has also become something almost personal for him as he acts beyond rationality to solve the case. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is also worthy of an Academy Award. The supporting actors are also doing a fine job. Especially Paul Dano convinces as inscrutable and unpredictable suspect. His aunt portrayed by Melissa Leo gets better and better as the movie progresses.The tension of the story gets more and more elevated towards the end. I don't want to reveal any twists but let's say that I didn't see the incredible revelations coming. During the last thirty minutes or so, the movie even got me more on the edge of my seat than it was the case before. These last thirty minutes introduce a whole new dimension to the movie. Some viewers may dislike this new approach but I thought that it added even more intensity to the film.At the end of the day, this is an atmospheric, intense and extremely well acted film noir that mixes credible drama elements with gripping and sometimes scary crime passages. If you care for any of these genres, you can't get around this movie this year. I hope it will win a couple of Academy Awards next year as I can hardly see any better Hollywood movie these days. I'm convinced this will be considered as a classic or one of the best movies of all times one day.",9,1,3,25 September 2013
Silence," Unorthodoxically artistic
","Silence is a quite ambitious project by star director Martin Scorsese and it isn't a surprise that this film has failed at the box office. It is particularly long with a running time of one hundred sixty-one minutes. The topic of Jesuits resisting persecution in feudal Japan is quite unusual. Aside of Liam Neeson, who only has about ten minutes of screen time, the movie focuses on rather unknown actors. Still, Silence is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. It's obvious that he cared about this film and wanted to make it something special, regardless of grossing numbers.On the positive side, Silence grabs your attention with a topic that hasn't been treated much and might even be unknown to most audiences. Following the struggles of two Jesuits in feudal Japan who try to spread hope to the few isolated Christian communities while trying to find their mentor who hasn't come home from a mission almost feels like watching an elaborate documentary. The movie is historically authentic, includes fitting costumes and landscapes and exposes us to Japanese and Portuguese customs.Secondly, the acting performances in this movie are absolutely stellar. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver have good chemistry and convince as initially motivated Jesuits whose faith is severely tested in their quest for survival. The supporting actors are also quite convincing from a resilient, old and clever inquisitor to a disillusioned, insisting and rational convert.Thirdly, the movie has a quite sinister atmosphere that fits the serious topics. This is supported by the rural landscapes since most of this movie either takes place on the raw coasts of Southern Japan, the wild forests of several Japanese islands and the muddy city of Nagasaki where it always seems to rain. The dark lighting techniques, the gloomy soundtrack and the use of moments of tense silence also contribute to a very artistic, detailed and epic movie.On the negative side, the film is obviously quite long. I didn't get bored at any time because I found the topic so fascinating but I have to admit that some scenes are somewhat redundant or repetitive. If you are looking for a movie with vivid action sequences, numerous different locations and long-winded dialogues, you won't get any of it. This movie is slow-paced, precise and atmospheric and tries to transmit a desperate vibe instead of quirky entertainment.The ending of the movie blends in very well with the rest of the film and I liked it but it's quite unorthodox and maybe even unexpected by Hollywood standards.To keep it short, it's great to see that renowned directors like Martin Scorsese still aspire to experiment in the autumn years of their careers. Silence is refreshingly different and unique from any other Hollywood production of recent memory. It has a unique topic, great acting performances and an intense atmosphere. If you are a viewer with an interest in historical topics who likes to think outside the box, you're probably going to appreciate Silence as much as I did.",8,1,2,20 November 2017
Hotel Mumbai," To understand the devil, you have to look into his eyes
","There are few movies that have moved me as much as Hotel Mumbai. Based upon true events, it shows how Pakistani Islamist terrorists attack numerous locations in the Indian metropolis of Mumbai. The showdown takes places in the prestigious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel where personnel and guests fight for survival.The film offers a short and concise introduction that gives us an idea how the terrorists proceed to attack as many places as possible to assassinate as many victims as they could. We are also introduced to numerous characters that will end up in the hotel from a rich family over escaping backpackers to a dedicated server from a poor neighbourhood. The events in the hotel start taking place about thirty minutes into the film and the following ninety minutes are filled with incredible tension, brutal acts of violence and an oppressive atmosphere of despair. The film only slows down in the final few minutes that offer a brief tearjerking conclusion. Once the credits roll, the audience will be shook and speechless.This movie is a statement against terror by showing how incredibly devastating such acts are. In its intensity, it reminds of Roman Polanski's The Pianist which portrays the horrors of the Holocaust best. Hotel Mumbai is so brutal, intense and thrilling that it shouldn't be watched by children or teenagers but only by adults with a very strong stomach. Despite the obvious violence, the movie is equally emotional and intellectual. The audience empathizes with the desperate victims. The conclusion leads us to think that no other species in the world does as much harm to its own kind than human beings do to one another. The only way to stop such horrible actions is through peaceful education. Ironically, this honest movie contributes to such peaceful education by exposing such sickening degrees of violence. In order to understand the devil, you have to look into his eyes.",10,80,232,10 April 2019
Midsommar," The Village meets Mandy in broad daylight
","Midsommar is a movie that unfolds long after you have actually watched it. Its rich cinematography might grip right from the start but the numerous allegories will make you think days after you have experienced this film.This movie is quite an experience indeed. It makes me think of a mixture of The Village and Mandy. It makes me think of the former because this movie is falsely advertised as a horror movie and could rather be described as a tense drama. Both films take place in secluded areas involving traditional societies and their rituals. Both movies have a slow pace and are controversially received. It makes me think of the latter because the visual aspects are quite vivid. Especially the use of colours has psychedelic elements that make viewers think of uneasy drug trips. Both movies slowly intensify and end rather grislily.The story is quickly told. Three anthropologist students are invited by their Swedish classmate to assist Midsommar festivities in his secluded hometown but what starts as a fascinating trip soon becomes a horrifying experience.The characters in the film are quite intriguing. Lead actress Florence Pugh plays an insecure young woman suffering from panic attacks who has to cope with the grisly fact that her bipolar sister killed their parents before committing suicide. Her boyfriend played by Jack Reynor has a hard time dealing with his girlfriend's negative moods but doesn't want to let her down and actually invites her to the trip to Sweden to help her change her mind. Another loud-mouthed student played by Will Poulter resents her coming with them and feels that she has a negative impact on her boyfriend and is spoiling everyone's anticipation. The third student played by William Jackson Harper keeps a lower profile and is the more intellectual type who gets into a heated conflict with the young woman's boyfriend because he wants to steal the idea for his thesis. Finally, there is the Swedish student played by Vilhelm Blomgren who seems to be very calm, compassionate and friendly but actually has a love interest in the young woman and feels that her boyfriend doesn't treat her correctly. All those underlying conflicts surface as the characters face extreme situations in Sweden.Revealing you anything more about the movie would spoil its mezmerizing enjoyment. There are a few negative elements to point out however. The movie has a very slow pace and slightly overstays its welcome which might be frustrating for less patient viewers. The plot is relatively simple and predictable even though many critics try to interpret too much into the movie to forcedly fill the void. Let's mention that the movie features some gore and nudity and shouldn't be watched by anyone who isn't eighteen years old.In the end, Midsommar is a unique experience that deserves to be watched on multiple occasions and discussed with friends in order to be fully appreciated. The unique atmosphere, intriguing characters and stylish cinematography make up for some lengths and an at times simplistic plot. As someone else has pointed out, this movie might give a blow to the Swedish tourism industry as grisly horrors unfold in bright daylight which is once again quite unique for such a grisly drama.",7,0,3,23 July 2019
Saw," Perfect combination of grisly and intellectual elements
","Despite its limited budget, the participation of numerous amateur actors and the Australian writers' first attempt at creating a script, Saw became an unexpected massive success that has sparked a total of eight entries in the franchise so far. While other popular horror franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street had their share of significant ups and downs, Saw is one of the most consistent franchises of its kind. It represents horror cinema of the new millennium like nothing else.There are numerous reasons why this first film of the franchise is nowadays considered a contemporary classic. The bleak settings get you into the film right from the start. The plot gets increasingly complex, surprising and twisted as it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The acting performances are surprisingly solid and intensify the movie's grisly emotions. The sinister special effects touch a profound survival instinct in the viewer that is repulsive yet inherent. The haunting soundtrack blends in perfectly. The camera work is calm and precise as it can be interpreted as an antithesis to the highly emotional story. A particular element of this film and the franchise in general are its concise flashbacks offering important background information adding continuous depth to the story.For those not familiar with the movie's content, the film revolves around a photographer and a doctor who get kidnapped and awake in the restroom of an abandoned building. They soon realize that they are being held prisoners but are offered clues in order to find out why they have been imprisoned and how they can find a way out. The protagonists also realize that the person behind their fate is a philosophical serial killer known as Jigsaw. Meanwhile, the wife and daughter of the doctor also get involved in this deadly game. Frustrated police officers as well as a desperate private investigator try tracking down the anonymous serial killer separately before time tuns out for the two victims.The combination of desperate survival instinct and grisly gore elements on one side and the detailed film-making and intelligent plot on the other side make Saw completely unique. Splatter film enthusiast and supporters of intellectual psychological thrillers will be equally drawn to this film and its ensuing franchise. Saw even deserves a better reputation than it has as it's often reduced to its visually shocking elements which neglects one of the best stories one could ever witness in a horror movie. No matter what kind of cinema you prefer, you should know that Saw should be considered the type of movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime. Having hesitated a long time to give this franchise a chance because of its unjustified stereotypical reputation, I have ended up discovering a modern cinematic masterpiece and the greatest horror movie franchise ever.",10,2,4,22 January 2019
Super 8," A great blockbuster for the cinematic summer of 2011
","'Super 8' is a very creative science-fiction movie that can be seen as an homage to the works of Steven Spielberg such as 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial' or 'The Goonies'. The movie is not only set in the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties but also inspired by the movies, the music and the technical discoveries of that time which gives a nostalgic charm to the movie which distinguishes it from other comparable adventure movies starring young actors and the classic inspirations mentioned above.Even though the story focuses on the adventures of a bunch of friends in a rather unknown and isolated small town in the middle of nowhere in the United States of America, this movie could also please to a lot of adults because of the classic influences, the nostalgic factors and a couple of surprisingly well done special effects and even a few rather brutal fighting scenes. I would like to underline the high budget that was perfectly used in this technically perfect movie as well as the brilliant acting of all actors and especially the young stars like the charismatic and authentic main male actor Joel Courtney and the very charming and breathtaking Elle Fanning that interact in a great way. Their relation is credible, dramatic and romantic and they are one of the best young actor couples I have ever seen in the history of cinema.The story integrates everything a good adventure blockbuster needs to be a success for this year's cinematic summer: credible and diversified personalities, philosophically touched emotional topics such as first love, friendship and loss, some mysterious events that keep the tension high until the end and reserve some light surprises, some good humour, a lot of dramatic emotions, many and well crafted but not too overwhelming action scenes, many tension filled passages and a typically Hollywood ending.The only thing that I might criticize is that the makers of the movie didn't always seem to know if they want to address to a younger or an older public and even though both public could appreciate this movie, there are a few flaws: the shooting and killing scenes in the bus are way too brutal for young children while the somewhat stereotypical ending waters the movie down and may seem ridiculous to many adults. The only other negative point is the fact that the homage automatically copies a lot from the initial movies and isn't that original and fresh anymore.But in the end this is well crafted entertainment for old and young with a multitude of influences and a stunningly great acting that is only watered down by a childish ending after many mature and intense moments. After many weak cinematic months, this is finally a very well done movie for the whole family.",8,1,4,18 June 2011
Life Is Beautiful," This film may give you a very wrong impression about history and the human cruelty of a concentration or extermination camp
","This film is a tragical comedy, a sensitive film with a few brilliant actors, an interesting atmosphere and a story which can touch everyone who sees this movie, even if there are still some more intense movies about the concentration camps and the World Wars.Why did I just give a 5 star vote and not about 8 points? I would like to explain you. I'm a person who is very interested in history, who is studying in history, I'm German and I have already visited a concentration camp and I know people who were implicated in this whole story during the Nazi regime. The life in the concentration camps was like hell or even heavier than this and anyone can imagine how life has been in there. If you walk through the walls of such a camps and take a look at the photos of the piles of skinny bodies and you turn around and realise that you stay on the same ground were the most horrible genocide ever had taken place, you just want to cry or scream or whatever. And I think that this movie doesn't show the reality, gives strangers a very wrong impression of what could have been these concentration camps. It's showing the camps as if there were just a few Jewish guys living in a very small room and doing some forced work under the guidance of some military guys. The film doesn't show that those people were extremely abused, had so much hunger and pain and such a lack of place and medical help that they were all rather dead than alive, that they were treated as you would not even treat the ugliest animal. A child would have never survived this hell and would have never had the chance to believe the positive lies of his father. The movie is a nice story, but historically wrong, not realistic, not sensitive and heavy enough to let its viewers take a look at a situation within a concentration camp. Some people may think after watching that movie that, after all, the situation wasn't that bad in such a camp and that there was still optimism, positive feelings and that a little boy would have survived in such a place. Sadly, this isn't true. And I think it is very critical to show the past circumstences to concerned people who have lived this hell or also to those who doesn't know much about it in such a way that the movie does even if this is for some artistic reasons.That's why I wasn't very happy about this whole movie, its success and its excellent reputation, but rather upset about such an interpretation of history. And though the acting is great and touching, I can't give more than a five stars rating. Believe me, visiting such a camp may touch you way more than this movie... If you'd like to see a movie about the whole situation in a more realistic way, go for 'The pianist', that's 'hard' stuff...",5,3,8,5 April 2010
Limitless," Waste of philosophic and scientific potential in this stylish action-thriller
","''Limitless'' is an entertaining science-fiction movie based upon the theory that humans are only using ten percent of their brain and the question what might happen if we were able to access more or all parts of our brain efficiently. Instead of focusing on the scientific and philosophic thoughts behind this concept, ''Limitless'' wastes a lot of potential as it limits itself to being an entertaining action- thriller with a debatable ending and moral.The story focuses on the life of Eddie Morra. In the beginning, he seems to be a naive loser who never gets anything done and gets dumped by his girlfriend. When he starts taking a drug offered to him by a shady acquaintance, his life seems to change for the better as Eddie Morra becomes a popular writer, makes a lot of money on the stock market and becomes friends with a group of careless jet- setters. Soon, his addiction to the drug starts having negative impacts on himself and people around him as he gets tracked down by other addicts, competitors and loan sharks. In addition to this, he starts having blackouts and severe pain at times. He even gets involved in a murder case where he can't remember whether he killed the victim or not because of the drug. As he tries to find out more about the nootropic NZT-48, he realizes that a lot of addicts got sick or died of it either because of overdosing it or because they tried to stop taking it.At this point, the movie could have taken a more thoughtful approach to elaborate on the horrors of drug addiction and its side effects. Instead, we get to see a lot of chasing passages, conspirative manipulations and murder scenes leading to a morally debatable ending that is explained very weakly. Overall, you get an entertaining, fast-paced and well done action-thriller but the story wastes its scientific potential midway through the movie and lacks inspiration in the second half.From that point of view, I like the very similar ''Lucy'' by Luc Besson much better because it keeps asking philosophic and scientific questions and has a thought-provoking ending. People probably preferred ''Limitless'' because it glorifies the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle and because it's easier to understand. In the end, I can recommend ''Limitless'' if you are looking for an entertaining action-thriller with solid actresses and actors and a stylish production. If you are looking for something which is both entertaining and intellectual, I would rather recommend Luc Besson's ''Lucy''.",7,0,0,24 October 2016
The Happening," A movie that takes its audience seriously and offers a lot of food for thought
","Shyamalan might be one of the most unstable contemporary directors in terms of quality. There are some of his movies which I disliked completely like ''The Village'' being wrongfully advertised as a horror movie even though it's a slow-paced drama. Other movies are quite overrated like ''The Sixth Sense'' that has its moments but isn't that compelling once you have figured out the predictable twist. Then again, Shyamalan has also directed some films that are close to perfection like the intense ''Split'' with its claustrophobic atmosphere. And then there are some of his movies that I like quite a lot but which are extremely underrated. ''The Happening'' is exactly this kind of movie.What I liked about the movie is that it didn't include a twist like most of Shyamalan's other movies and that it doesn't really answer all the questions. Some theories are spread throughout the film and the movie has a strong environmental message but it's never getting too educational or pretentious. The film indirectly criticizes the media that are jumping to conclusions about terrorist attacks and toxic gases which end up influencing some tragic events in the movie. This film offers a lot of food for thought without exaggerating things and lets the viewers think by themselves.The acting blends in perfectly. The actors are showing emotions of care and fear but we don't get the usual stereotypes of crying and yelling people like in so many other disaster movies. I liked Mark Wahlberg's performance as goofy but resilient science teacher that perfectly complemented Zooey Deschanel's character which was rather insecure and stressful. The two characters felt charming and realistic with their genuine flaws and strengths where an optimist had to deal with a realist. The side characters weren't particularly compelling but diversified enough to keep the movie entertaining from start to finish. We get introduced to aggressive survivalists, nervous soldiers and paranoid recluses among others.I liked the fact that the movie didn't have any lengths. It takes less than five minutes for the introduction and the conclusion and focuses on the body of the movie. Shyamalan takes us on an epic survival journey developing a gloomy and slightly surrealist atmosphere that gives the movie a very unique mood. It neither focuses on special effects nor on a dystopian atmosphere like so many other films of its kind and opts for a mysterious approach instead.Overall, the acting, mood and script are compelling because they are creative, entertaining and unique. Most people criticized the movie because their expectations of a spectacular disaster movie with a surprising twist weren't met or simply because they didn't fully understand the movie and tried to interpret the origins and reasons behind the happening. As the movie mentions itself, some things cannot be explained and should just be taken the way they are. If you accept this rule and don't have any specific expectations, ''The Happening'' will surprise you positively. This movie might not be a masterpiece but it clearly is one of the most distinctive disaster films of the new millennium.",8,4,7,13 March 2017
The Shape of Water," A fairy tale for adults
","Here comes the only minor spoiler of my review: Octavia Spencer doesn't talk about chicken in this movie. This is great. Now, let's move one.Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water is a modern fairy tale that takes place during the sixties. It tells the story of a mute janitor called Elisa who has good friends in gay artist and neighbor Giles and her black work colleague Zelda but she still feels lonesome because she doesn't have a man in her life. She works at a secret government laboratory and witnesses how a mysterious humanoid amphibian arrives there for scientific purposes. Inexplicably intrigued by the tormented and tortured creature, Elisa forms a close bond with the creature who turns out to be intelligent. However, Colonel Strickland, who has captured the mysterious creature in South America, starts to despise it after it fought its tormentor, biting off two of his fingers. When the government laboratory comes to the conclusion that the creature is useless, they plan to kill it. Before Colonel Strickland can triumphantly execute the order, Elisa decides to save the creature with the help of Giles and Zelda, risking their lives. Soon, three different parties, Elisa and her friends, a group of Soviet secret agents and American military personnel face one another because they all have different plans for the humanoid amphibian.The Shape of Water has several intriguing elements. The storytelling is well-paced, finding the right balance between incorporating fantastic elements and bringing back to life the Cold War in the sixties, showing the flaws and strengths of American society back then. The movie deals with homophobia and segregation, without being too moralizing. The settings are carefully chosen, contrasting shiny restaurants, poor apartments and cold bunkers. The visual special effects are stunning, especially all scenes involving water and the humanoid amphibian. The dream-like opening sequence grabs your attention right from the start and is a highlight. The characters are intriguing enough to care about them, as both the diversified cast of protagonists convinces as well as the reckless antagonists. The acting performances go hand in hand with the intriguing characters and Sally Hawkins is particularly convincing as unusual lead actress with a mysterious past. The movie makes many clever references to other films and forms of art because the main character and her neighbor are interested in film and music and living right above an old movie theater. This gives the film an intellectual touch and invites viewers to discover the culture of the fifties and sixties.Obviously, the story itself isn't particularly creative, reminding me of a mixture of Beauty and the Beast and Avatar. Many elements of the movie are quite predictable and even foreshadowed in the very first scene of the film. If you plan on watching this fairy tale with your young children, you should rather not because right after the opening sequence, we see the lead actress fully undressed, taking a bath and masturbating. Not that this is any problem since it tells us about both the purity and loneliness of the main character, but it isn't something young children should see. The Shape of Water is a fairy tale for intellectual adults with all its colorful references.The Shape of Water is a colorful, creative and entertaining fairy tale. It deserves most of the praise it gets, even though a whopping thirteen Academy Awards nominations are quite a stretch. Enjoy this beautiful film at your local movie theater.",8,34,64,31 January 2018
30 Days of Night," Intense and frosty survival horror
","This movie is a very interesting vampire movie settled in a cold town in Alaska where strange people live, a little bit like 'The barber'.The only thing that I found bad about this movie is that it was too fast obvious that vampires had infiltrated the city. It would have been more interesting to let the viewers in the doubt of what happened, as it could have also been a serial killer or a criminal organization that committed the first crimes. As you now quite fast that vampires have organized that, there is a lack of tension after the very interesting and dark beginning of the movie. I must also admit that this movie basically doesn't add something new to the genre. Those two minor factors are the reasons why I cut some points off the rating.But at least, this movie turns then quite fast into an entertaining and intense survival story where everybody desperately tries to save his soul and reflect about his life. There are many intense scenes like the old and isolated guy who gives his life to save his comrades, the guy who got bitten by a child vampire and asks the other ones to kill him or the main actor who tries desperately to save his ex-girlfriend to prove her that he still loves her and wants her back. Another good point is the dramatical and uneasy ending of the movie that is as dark as the whole film's atmosphere. There is a lot of tension in this movie and you really begin to like the desperate and morbid atmosphere in the lost village and can somehow identify with all of this.To sum it up, this movie is an intense and atmospheric vampire movie and survival horror with credible actors and some shocking scenes. This movie might please to anyone who likes the horror genre and is the best horror movie of the year 2007 in my opinion.",7,1,2,24 October 2010
Scream 2," The best part of the series convinces with more focus on the best characters and a sinister atmosphere
","After a rather superficial first part, the second movie of the Scream series has been a step forward. The scarface killer is more intelligent, more brutal and more mysterious and a couple of surprises keep you hanging on until the end of the movie. The second part also focuses more on some of the stronger characters of the first part such as the intriguing and wrongfully suspected Cotton Weary, the journalist Gale Weathers that shows some unknown emotional sides beyond her facades of a seemingly egoist personality and the police deputy Dewey Riley that turns out to be much more clever and courageous than it seemed in the first part where he got completely dumped.On a negative side, the opening scene in the cinema shows already the main fan base of the first movie and one realizes that the main concept didn't change as the movie desperately tries to parody its predecessor, to include some stereotypical citations of classic horror movies and to introduce some new stupid teenage characters. The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor. I would say that this movie is easily the best part of the series until now but it can't mess with the classics of the suspense or horror genre.",6,0,1,27 April 2011
It Chapter Two," It wasn't necessary
","It: Chapter Two tells the story of what happened to the members of The Losers' Club as they confront evil clown Pennywise to kill it for good twenty-seven years after the events of the first movie. In my humble opinion, this second movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. The first part had an intriguing atmosphere, stunning characters and diversified plot that ended on a bittersweet note. Some stories don't need a conclusion as some unanswered question might actually spark the audience's creative imagination. In order to cash in on the first film, the producers decided to opt for a sequel nonetheless.The main issue is that this sequel doesn't have the magic of the first movie. The coming-of-age vibe of the teenagers with their beliefs, bonds, fears, hopes and motivations was second to none. What we get here are seven rather depressing adults in their mid-life crises who haven't become the wonderful people they could have been.Another problem is that the movie constantly dwells on the past, has a ploddingly repetitive script and re-tells parts of the first film over and over again. There are numerous horror movies with considerable lengths that never get boring with classics like The Shining or recent masterpieces such as The Wailing. However, this film here overstays its welcome with lengthy storytelling, tiring flashbacks and endless dialogues. This movie should have been about one hour shorter than it actually is for a more dynamic, entertaining and relevant structure.Not everything is bad about this movie as you might have guessed by looking at my rather positive rating. The special effects are as great as they can get. The smalltown settings are perfectly chosen. The light techniques and camera work are precise, captivating and atmopsheric. The film includes a good balance of humorous and serious parts. The adult actresses and actors are doing a wonderful job and one has to point out a charming but melancholic Jessica Chastain in particular as well as James McAvoy who underlines his reputation as one of the most diversified, talented and unique contemporary actors as usual.The movie's saving grace however are the gripping final thirty minutes. The duel between The Loser's Club and Pennywise is fascinating to watch and feels like a reward after a stuttering start. The action scenes are intense, the characters develop depth and the special effects are spectacular. Make sure to enjoy such cinematography on the big screen while you still can.In the end, It: Chapter Two is quite a mixed bag. The film is technically well done but simply overstays its welcome. Personally, I didn't need a sequel at all but can objectively admit that this film has slightly more strengths than flaws.",6,0,2,30 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Shallow entertainment for the masses
","Los Angeles, California. The world's capital of steel, plastic and glass. Including locations and people. After drinking too much booze in a shady strip club, two representatives of Warner Brothers Pictures are talking about the company's next blockbuster after a series of less popular movies in times when cinema can't compete with the growing streaming media industry. 'Let's make another blockbuster – any ideas?''There is a monster movie revival. We could reboot the King Kong franchise.''But there are already seven different King Kong movies.''That doesn't matter. People don't like change, love living in the past and don't want to think too much. Imagine the commercial potential of such a reboot! We could let King Kong fight against Godzilla in a sequel!''Well, there is already a movie where this happens.''Great! People are nostalgic and will like it!''Do you have any ideas for a plot?''Let the movie take place in the past. This will only add to its nostalgia. We could put some old rock music in the film. And some vintage vehicles and weapons. It could take place towards the end of the Vietnam War.''Why would we chose the Vietnam War?''Even the most uneducated audience has already heard of the Vietnam War. Oh, and let's also include the Second World War in the scenario. Two wars are better than one!''Do you have any ideas for precise locations?''Geography is too complex for our audience. Let's just invent a fictional island. An island where any nonsense could happen. Let's include other monsters. Giant lizards, giant oxes and giant spiders! And dinosaurs! Let's just put plenty of big animals in the movie that make a lot of noise and look scary.''Alright, but what about an actual story?''Who needs a story? A couple of people want to discover an island and must fight monsters. King Kong turns out to be nice and helps them. That's it.''Do you have any ideas for our characters?''People like simple contrasts. Good and evil. Heroes and villains. Pacifists and warmongers. Let's also include some stereotypes to put everyone in their comfort zones. Some natives that worship King Kong. A crazy recluse who stranded on the island. Stuff like that.''We need strong antagonists and protagonists though.''Let me think... I got it. An evil military faces a good journalist. The former wants to kill all the monsters while the latter wants to save them.''The US military will hate us for this.''Awesome, we will get some promotion for free. Everybody will talk about it. And even the intellectuals will come watch our movie because they think it includes some serious pacifist message! Hahaha!''What about the actors and actresses?''Let's make sure to include people from every possible background even if it doesn't make any sense considering the historical background. Multiculturalism matters. Let's include exotic natives, a good black dude and a bad black dude, a crazy white dude and a clever white dude. Let's also put some random Asian chick in the movie that looks cute. We just give her ten lines of dialogue and that's enough. Some people just watch those movies for the action sequences and beautiful people! They are weak and can't get laid in real life, so they want to watch heroes that shoot everything and get all the hot chicks!''Shouldn't we put some more profound emotions into this film?''Profound is a word our target audience doesn't understand. People like simple and positive emotions. Let's make the good black dude fall in love with that Asian chick. Let our protagonist fall in love with the clever white dude. Let the recluse come back to his family. Let all the baddies die. That's the kind of stuff we need.''That sounds so shallow it might actually work out. But what kind of actor would participate in such a movie?''Let's hire some unknown rookies that look geeky and trendy and who still dream of a Hollywood career. They will accept to do anything to get rich and famous. Let's also put one or two more famous actors in the movie that will attract older audiences. We will have to overpay them to make sure they participate in this nonsense but it will pay off. Imagine a name like Samuel L. Jackson! People will read his name and just watch the movie because of him! Anyway, we will put the biggest part of our budget in the special effects. We need a lot of crazy monsters, loud explosions and a dream island to sell our product. The talent of the actors doesn't actually matter. They just need to look cool.''You're so superficial that it's almost creative! But how can we connect this movie to a potential sequel?''Let's include a scene after the credits. We can throw in the discovery of more monsters from other remote places! What about Godzilla? Or some other Japanese monsters. That three-headed dragon, King Ghidorah! Or the giant butterfly, Mothra! Or some dinosaur, like Rodan!''Isn't that a little bit too exaggerated?''Hell, no! We could make dozens of sequels and reboots with those connections. And more importantly, we will make a shitload of money!''Sounds good to me. One last thing. What kind of title could we use? ''King Kong returns''?''No, it needs to be something cooler to get more kids interested. Let's use the name of the island from the original movie. Skull Island! That sounds badass! There it is: 'Kong: Skull Island'.''You're a genius. How much time do you need to write the script?''Give me some more drinks and I would say I can write it in two hours. Maximum! Let's start the casting and promotion. We will be heroes! Here we go!'",5,2,5,29 May 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Atmospheric and stylish adaptation of a crime novel that has changed literature
","The new adaptation of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express impresses with lush settings, a gloomy atmosphere and great acting performances, particularly by Kenneth Branagh as clever detective, Johnny Depp as arrogant gangster and Judi Dench as arrogant aristocrat. On the negative side, the investigation on the train is a little bit rushed. The movie exposes plenty of theories for a potential murderer but doesn't go into detail. It's at times difficult to follow the numerous characters and their motives to commit a murder in the second third of the movie until the final third wraps it up coherently. Another negative element is that the introduction to the film is a little bit long and also unnecessary as it doesn't really add anything to the character development.Those who have never read Murder on the Orient Express or watched one of the numerous movie adaptations will obviously be surprised by the clever story. On the other side, if you are already familiar with the story, there aren't many new elements to discover that would justify to watch this film.Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is an entertaining, profound yet stylish adaptation of one of the greatest crime novels ever written. It's important to continue to honour this novel that has changed the world of literature. On the other side, this version is neither as detailed as the novel nor as charming as Sidney Lumet's version of the seventies. Fans of the novel and those who aren't familiar with the plot should watch this movie but everyone else can skip this version.",7,1,4,24 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes is back and stronger than ever in the twenty-first century!
","This film is one of the best ones of the year 2009! First of all, it creates a charming and interesting atmosphere in beautiful words and images flavoured with great special effects in an ancient London.Second, the main actors are doing a great job, they are really cool, charming and have their unique forces and advantages and personal mistakes or disadvantages.Third, the story presents a lot of really interesting twists, very intelligent ideas and mysterious events which are all revealed in a logical and stunning way in the end which creates a really good tension.Fourth, the movie is in the key of the legendary character on which were based many really solid books and movies, but it is much more than a copy as it is presents quite refreshing, authentic and modern characters and not an old-fashioned adaption. The movies balances between traditions, the cult established around the characters and a modern blockbuster with refreshing actors and atmosphere. That's quite courageous and may not be pleasant for the more traditional viewers and old fans of the books or movies, but it is innovating, interesting and opens this fantastic world to a younger public. Sherlock Holmes and Co. still exists in the twenty-first century and they are stronger than ever.Go and watch this movie as traditional cults and refreshing elements are mixed to a brilliant and diversified movie! And let's wait for a possible sequel!",9,0,2,2 May 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Probably the best war movie ever done and an inspiring work for the ages
","This is not only the best movie of the year but easily one of the best war movies ever done in history of cinema until today and beats most modern Hollywood productions.This movie simply incarnates everything war is about and it perfectly shows the madness of the Korean war and even its impact on modern life in Korea. The film is about being separated from family, saving someone you love at all costs, getting used and abused by political propaganda, going through changes and identity crisis, fighting for your life on a blood-red battlefield, seeking for peace and vengeance, meandering between madness and relief.The acting of this movie is absolutely outstanding from the two gripping and profound main characters over their desperate family members to the cynical politicians and soldiers. Don't even try to find one, there is no bad actor in here and every actor or actress delivers one if not the best job of his or her career on here.The movie is perfectly filmed and features impressive fighting scenes with realistic special effects, stunning landscapes and outstanding choreographies with dark or vivid colour and light effects. The scene with the slayed bodies in an abandoned North Korean village, the fighting scenes between prisoners in a bloody and inhuman game, the assassination of the so-called traitors, the arrival of the hordes of Chinese soldiers on the battlefield and the final battle of the movie are only a few breathtaking examples for the high quality filming.The story is as hectic, twisted and unbelievable as the whole madness of war and features many ups and downs, many gripping changes and a few little twists. Some people might find this aspect a little bit exaggerated but I think the opposite as it perfectly portrays the extreme feelings everybody is going through in wartime.At the end, this movie is also highly emotional. In the end of the film, I just couldn't help and was about to cry because the whole story is an emotional drama of a rare high quality. The final scenes where you see one of the characters as an old man who learns the truth about the past is one of the most touching movie scenes I have seen in quite a while.If you care about war movies, this one has to be your new bible and you should watch this at all costs as it easily beats all modern Western war movie productions that appear pathetic, repetitive and superficial next to this masterpiece. This film should get more international recognition and should be used in any school of the world to show children the true madness of war. This is a work for the ages, so don't hesitate to check this out. I might watch this movie at least once a year and will probably never get tired of it which speaks volumes for the movie's impact on me and many people seem to feel exactly the same. Trust the highly favorable ratings by critics and fans and don't miss the chance to watch this film.",10,3,5,25 October 2012
Parasite," Food for thought delivered with exciting wit
","Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets.",10,24,39,12 November 2019
Scream," No shocker and not even a leg shaker
","When a good friend of mine introduced me this flick as a 'classic' of the horror genre I thought he was actually joking. I had never watched this movie because it seemed rather bad and stereotypical to me and when my friend convinced me to give it a try and when I heard that a new fourth part has come out I opened my mind and watched the whole trilogy. The first movie was actually about as bad as I expected.I mean there are tons of great horror movies out there to get discovered like the classics 'Nosferatu', 'The mummy' and 'The Amityville Horror' to only mention a few or even more recent stuff like 'Jeepers Creepers', 'My little eye' '5150 Elm Street' or the more exotic stuff like 'Marebito', 'Infection' or 'Two sisters' without talking about legendary and eerie series like 'Twin Peaks', 'X Files' or 'Millenium'. But the Scream trilogy is amongst the worst stuff I have ever seen. Even other overrated and popular stuff like 'I know what you did last summer', 'Final destination' or 'Resident Evil' is fairly better executed. I really don't know why this fairly overrated American slasher crap and fast food cinema is actually so popular. Even the parodies of this movie in the 'Scary Movie' series are more intriguing than the original.Well, the movie is at least very entertaining and you tend to watch it until the end to know who is the murderer. I must admit that I bet on the wrong guy and that the ending quite surprised me but when I thought that I finally found a positive point, the final conclusion is so superficial and ridiculous that the surprise factor is already erased once again. This movie is simply made to entertain and switch your brain off and from that point of view, you get an average junk food flick but I really ask myself why there are already three follow ups of this mediocre movie until now.I know that the movie itself parodies some horror movie flicks and doesn't take itself too serious and I really laughed a few times but the path between humour and ridiculous dumbness is very small in this movie. The dialogues are horrible, the acting is mostly wooden and distant, the scarface killer rushes into every opened door like a retarded fool and is simply embarrassing, the killing scenes are quite predictable and as soon as an intriguing and suspenseful atmosphere is established, a stupid comedy scene scraps it all. The movie doesn't seem to know if it rather tends to be a parody, a suspense or a horror flick and tries desperately to be all of this at the same time. That creates a potpourri that seems at least interesting and fresh for the first third of the movie but the originality factor is simply used after a while and neither the characters nor the scenario nor the overall atmosphere are able to grip me and keep me hanging on for the last two thirds.This movie is simply made to be watched as a teenager with a couple of friends and some beers. It's a fast food party movie but for any horror movie or suspense flick maniac, this movie may be of a very low interest.",5,1,3,26 April 2011
Prometheus," A good average science-fiction movie that doesn't come close to the Alien films
","'Prometheus' is a prequel to the revolutionary 'Alien' movies and explains how the bleak creature created by surrealist designer, painter and sculptor H.R. Giger came to life. In addition to this, the film introduces us to the creators of mankind who were eventually planning to extinguish their own creation but failed to do so. You might want to know that the ending of this film has a cliffhanger and leads to a possible second part of this prequel where we could find out why the creators of mankind wanted to destroy their own work and where the new-born Alien creature could evolve to what it might become one day.To be honest, 'Prometheus' doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first two Alien movies and is maybe on the same level as the fourth Alien movie and slightly better than the rather disappointing third film. There are several reasons why this new movie is only a good average movie at best.First of all, all actors apart of the talented Noomi Rapace are really weak and exchangeable. This might also be due to an unimaginative script. As viewers, one doesn't really care enough about the fate of the different characters to get an emotional connection to the film and to really get into it. The original movies were much more convincing from that point of view.This leads me to the second biggest flaw. The story of the movie is predictable and has been used in a similar way many times before. I don't mean the obvious creation of the Alien but the evolution of the different characters and a very predictable twist in the last third of the film. The script really feels as if a young science-fiction fan borrowed bits and pieces from famous genre films and put them together to a new half-hearted movie.Obviously, the movie also has its strengths and you might already guess what they are. First of all, the special effects are obviously very well done. The universe, the more or less deserted planet and the strange cave system on it are very beautiful to watch. The different humanoid creatures as well as the new Alien should also please to fans of the old movies.The action sequences of this film are nothing extraordinary but very well done. Especially the last third of the movie sets a higher pace and we get to see many mysterious technical holograms, a couple of gripping fighting scenes and obviously a few earthquakes, explosions and storms here and there. After the slow and almost dull pace of the first two thirds of the film, the last part is probably worth the wait.As I told before, the movie doesn't quite catch up the original movies but it includes at least a couple of atmospheric settings and scenes. These moments especially happen in the bleak cave system on the planet and involve aggressive humanoid aliens and the Alien prototype. These scenes don't come close to the horror of the original but they build up some kind of tension at least. If the movie had included more of these horror moments, it would have been much more gripping.As it is now, 'Prometheus' is a good average science-fiction movie that convinces with a strong main actress, great special effects and a vivid last third. I recommend you to experience this movie without comparing it to the Alien movies because you will probably end up being disappointed if you do so. In addition to this, you should only watch this movie if you are ready to watch more sequels of this prequel. In my book, it was a solid movie to watch once but in comparison to the Alien series, I wouldn't necessarily watch this movie again. I must also admit that I wouldn't watch a Sequel to this film or a fifth Alien movie either. Enough is enough and one should leave this great series untouched instead of harming its reputation with more exchangeable scripts.",6,1,3,22 July 2014
The Woman in Black," Mediocre story but grippingly scary
","The Woman In Black is a visually stylish and authentic ghost story with a haunting atmosphere and a solid acting that is set in the early twentieth century in an isolated British village.Even though the story as well as the ending of the movie are rather predictable, they are so well designed and acted that this doesn't disturb the entertaining enjoyment of the movie. The movie still has still some very gripping and memorable scenes even if the story itself is not the best one that could have been chosen as a remake.This movie will definitely put you on the edges of your seats and is nothing for weak-heartened people as it is really scary at some points. It's probably the most intense horror movie since 'Insidious'. The movie works a lot with light and especially sound effects so you have to watch this in your local cinema to fully enjoy this picture.In the end, after a rather disappointing second half of the cinematic year 2011, this new year starts in a very satisfying manner with movie highlights such as 'The Grey' or 'The Woman In Black' that make me look forward to discover a bunch of other movies within the next few weeks.",8,1,3,15 February 2012
Identity," You won't see it coming...
","Identity is a very well done American psycho thriller that convinces with a very solid acting, a couple of interesting characters and a very dark atmosphere as the whole movie plays during a dark and rainy night.The locations and the general story offer nothing new and play with some stereotypes but have a certain cheesy charm.The movie will though grip you after a few moments and not let you go until the end as it has a very fluid pace. The film is full of surprising events and many red herrings that keep you guessing until the end who is the one behind the brutal murders among ten very diversified persons that have randomly met in a cheap motel as it seems.The very twisted ending will divide the viewers into two groups. Those who like original psycho thrillers with weird conclusions that request some reflections and are not that easy to understand will definitely like the final which is rather hard to predict. In fact, the ending leads to two conclusions and one of it was very easy to predict for a genre connoisseur as I am but the second and more important part is quite impossible to find out.Those who like more traditional crime movies with police investigations and many clues that finally lead to the murderer in the end might find the ending too complicated, too difficult to understand and overall too weird.Personally, I liked the ending as it left me one some reflections and thoughts. It's simply different from what you're used to and I like this experimental courage of the script writers. This doesn't mean that the ending is complete nonsense or as surreal as David Lynch movie, it's still all rather logic to explain.If you are a fan of dark psycho thrillers and the famous 'Ten Little Indians' concept and if you're not afraid of movies where you need to do some additional intellectual efforts to understand everything, you will definitely adore this flick that has no truly visible weak points apart of it short length and a couple of stereotypes that are introduced in the beginning.",8,1,2,31 May 2012
Lucy," Three gifted main actors, an incredible director and stunning visual effects lead us through a thought-provoking story where science and fiction collide in equal parts
","Lucy could easily be the best film of the year and should attract a lot more cinephiles to the movie theatres than it already does. The movie has many different strengths, differs from similar films and feels fresh and entertaining despite a more philosophical and scientific approach.First of all, the movie has a running time of ninety minutes only. The viewer is immediately thrown into a story filled with pace and tension. This films simply doesn't include any unnecessary lengths.The acting performances in this film are completely incredibly. Scarlett Johansson starts as a naive and shy lady that slowly becomes a clever heroine in a credible manner. Her character doesn't include the usual weaknesses of so-called superheroes. She doesn't talk too much, she only uses her powers when she has to and is still quite impressive and there is no cheesy love story or a demon from her past to distract us from the main plot. Morgan Freeman only has a smaller role in this movie but he simply convinces for being there because he is credible in his role as a clever scientist and has a lot of charisma. The ruthless main villain is portrayed by the incredible Choi Min-Sik who is one of my favourite actors ever and it's great to finally see him in a Western movie where his incredible talents get some more attention. This may not be his greatest performance but this man has a talent and history for playing dark characters.The story of the movie is another strong point. It's not your usual tale of crime and vengeance. The film has a rather profound philosophical and scientific side and takes its time to explain what is actually going on without boring the audience. Many viewers felt let down by the ending of the movie but in relation to the entire film, it completely makes sense. The movie doesn't only convince with gifted actors and addicting action sequences but also offers some real food for thought.The visual effects of the movie exploit all contemporary technologies extremely well. I was stunned by many impressive images from animal and nature sequences over animated pictures of the human body up to modern images with different rays and colours. These effects make the movie even more enjoyable in a cinema.The rest of the movie is very well executed as well. There are no annoying shaky camera passages, the soundtrack is very fitting and the whole movie has an intriguing multicultural touch as it takes place in Taiwan and France and involves actors and characters from many different countries. The fact that the Korean actors only speak Korean might be annoying for some viewers but it makes the experience even more realistic. Just as Scarlett Johansson's character in the beginning, the viewer doesn't always understand what is going on when the Korean characters are talking and this adds even more tension to the plot and is a great element that is more and more employed in commercial movies as well.Lucy may not reinvent a whole genre but this science-fiction movie focuses on the best elements of science and a really gripping fiction. If you only like slow-paced dramas or comedy movies for the whole family, this movie isn't for you but anyone else should absolutely watch this film as soon as possible. There are still some interesting movies to come out this year but so far, this film is a more than solid candidate for the greatest movie of the year and you really don't want to miss it.",9,24,51,13 August 2014
RED," An entertaining mixture of genres with a bunch of great actors
","The big names of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and the highly memorable and convincing John Malkovich unite in this quite diversified movie that has a strong humorous and human touch but soon turns out to be also a tension loaded conspiracy thriller with good special effects and action scenes. This mixture strangely fits very well together and gives this movie a more unique touch as it is neither a simple conspiracy action thriller nor a dumb parody. The main characters have all something crazy and unique about them and I especially adored John Malkovich in this flick that easily beats the concurrence.The story is rapidly told. Bruce Willis plays an ex-agent for the CIA that has become old and dreams of a life in tranquillity with a beautiful woman by his side that he seems to have met at the telephone. But as life is life, his past is still haunting him and for an unknown reason the organization he worked for is chasing him and his old partners now and he has to live on the run to save his future love of his life and find out the reasons beyond this conspiracy as he reactivates his old partners in crime for a new mission.Even though the story is in the end quite predictable and not very original at all and even though the main actors have all done a lot more interesting movies in the past, this flick is highly entertaining from the beginning to the end and worth to be watched once even if I would not consider a purchase of the movie.",7,0,0,12 March 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Assimilated to Hollywood standards
","If you like overambitious special effect based event cinema with 3D animations and a lot of epic sounds, you will surely adore this movie and think that it is a perfect ending to the series and final highlight for the whole family. Anybody that tends to look a little bit beyond commercial Hollywood cinema and prefers something more profound and intellectual might get a rather negative surprise after so many overrated positive reviews from the fan boys on this site.This movie has so many negative points that I don't know where to begin. First of all, I might chose the characters and the acting. I remember reading the last three hundred pages of the final novel was an emotional and touching thing and I wasn't able to put the book aside. I had tears in my eyes when some of the characters were struggling in their battles, losing all hope and ultimately even dying in some cases. In the movie, this all seems so secondary that it's a dishonour to the actors and a decade of more or less touching attempts to recreate the magic of the novels. Many tragic fates, last breaths and deadly conclusions are just side notes to fill a whole in between two overwhelming battle scenes with many artificially flavoured special effects. That's what I call a shame and a lack of subtlety from the production team and especially the director. Everything is concentrated on Harry Potter that there is almost no place for the other actors to shine. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger play no important role and even the main character's girlfriend Ginny Weasley has only a few insignificant passages. It seems as if this was a movie about the one and only Harry Potter and the other characters only had cameo appearances for the memories of old glory and older movies with much more equilibrium, depth and magic. The only characters that were able to shine next to Harry Potter were Neville Longbottom and Severus Snape. Even Lord Voldemort had a ridiculous and childish megalomaniac attitude while Albus Dumbledore seemed surprisingly arrogant to me.Another annoying aspect were the reoccurring cheap attempts on childish puns. Each time there was a dramatic or dark scene, any of the characters said something stupid or ridiculous. Well, many people laughed in the cinemas but it was more a hesitating chain reaction and nothing funny or appropriated to the situation. We don't need any simplistic jokes in the darkest and most gripping parts of the Harry Potter universe just to satisfy the youngest generations and avoid harsher critics from angry parents who may complain that their seven year old daughters had nightmares after watching this movie. The Harry Potter novels had evolved alongside the age of its characters and they had become more mature, dark and serious. This last movie breaks this progression down and tries to return to some light entertainment for the whole family.Many things in the movie were truly predictable and not because I had read the novel. The speech of Neville Longbottom for example was filled with so much kitsch that I rather had to laugh out and shake my head than to feel touched by it. The comments by Albus Dumbledore were predictable and as unclear and imprecise as always but this time with a quite arrogant and bored touch in it. The annoying paranoid curses of Lord Voldemort against his enemies and especially Harry Potter were repeated to much and limited the character to a rather one-dimensional, clueless and predictable personality. The characterizations of the different personalities were underlined and stretched in a stereotypical way but not lifted on a higher level as the novel did.Another important point was the lack of depth in the movie. Only the scenes around Severus Snape were great but still far away from the novel's quality. We don't get to know more about the main villain and his horcruxes. What about the background story of Albus Dumbledore? What about the details surrounding Teddy Lupin? What happened with Percy Weasley and his decisions? What about the deeper and matured romantic relationships between Harry and Ginny or Ron and Hermione? What about the new connection between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy? If you decide to cut the last novel into two movies, please do it properly at least.Don't get me wrong, the whole thing is entertaining and a funny popcorn cinema ride but it lacks of depth and something truly outstanding. The movie doesn't have this little glimpse of magic and subtle emotion that the novel had. Where Peter Jackson almost equalled the original 'Lord of the Rings' novels, David Yates is far away from only getting near to it. The biggest surprise of the movie was that at the end of this superficial commercial entertainment, there wasn't written 'directed by James Cameron' in the credits. This movie is comparable to his last works like 'Sanctum' or 'Avatar'. The last 'Transformers' and 'Narnia' movies are also horribly close to this last Harry Potter movie. I am honestly shocked that a British novel has been transformed into a copy of Hollywood's actual standards. The movie doesn't have the British soul of the novels. I honestly preferred the earliest movies of the series. The whole thing got stretched and over-hyped too much. One should have made one single final movie about three hours, cut out the boring lack of events in the first part and the overwhelming special effects and childish jokes of the second one to fusion the whole thing into a more equilibrated and human mixture with a few additional background scenes. That would have made less money and got less popularity but would have been closer to the novel in order to honour a legendary piece of art in a significant way. The unsatisfying final result may not be the actors' or fans' fault but the studio's and director's mistake.",6,3,5,19 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A repetitive transition between the first instalment and the closing chapter in two parts
","Here it is: '1984' feature 'Battle Royale' Part II - the follow-up nobody really needed.On a more serious note, I must though admit that I enjoyed the first movie. It wasn't original but the settings were great, the camera and light work flawless, the costumes and effects stunning and the different characters during the battle competition were somewhat intriguing and had some depth as well.This time, the movie bores us with an overlong introduction. Instead of developing the main characters, we just get exposed to things we had already known or seen before in the first movie. This is basically just a waste of precious time as neither the characters nor the story gets any new elements.The reason why the radical autocracy sets off a special edition of the Hunger Games is completely ridiculous but I'm aware of the fact that this part is based on the books, so the movie makers are not to blame. Let's just say that the stories of the first and the second movie are too similar to make the second part stand out anyhow.It's simply not impressive anymore to see the colourful characters, clothes and make-up because we have been there before. The new characters that are taking part in the new Hunger Games aren't as interesting as in the first part and once some characters finally start to act in suspicious way, the whole movie is already over and any development suddenly aborted. Some characters seemed to be interesting such as the brutal young woman with the strange teeth but they almost have no screening time at all. Once again, I call this a waste of time and potential.Why does this movie still get a passable rating? The acting is of a good average quality. The decorations, effects and settings are similar to the first movie but still on a high quality. Some adrenaline driven scenes during the Hunger Games will get you on the edge of your seats. The open ending is interesting enough to make you want to see more and watch the next two instalments of the series (of course, they needed to make two more movies out of it to make more money just as the last two Harry Potter movies). So, there still are a lot of positive elements and the great images and sounds make it worth to watch it in your local cinema.On the other side, this film is not much more than '1984' meets 'Battle Royale' for the 'Twilight' generation. I must admit that I'm a big fan of dystopian movies and novels and that's why I'm also enjoying the 'Hunger Games'. If you're not just following a trend, a little bit more mature and honestly enjoying this franchise, you should definitely watch classics such as 'Fahrenheit 451', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Soylent Green', 'Rollerball', 'Equilibrium', 'Renaissance' and so on and compare them to the 'Hunger Games'. If you think any of these movies is weaker than this new output, let's say you have a very curious opinion.",6,16,39,26 November 2013
Godzilla," A solid comeback for my childhood hero
","I have grown up with the classic Japanese Godzilla movies that I first discovered when I was around eight or nine years old. I liked so many things about these movies: the looks of the monsters, the epic battle scenes, the different technical gimmicks, the detailed and handmade special effects, the emotional soundtracks, the diversified side stories and many references to Japanese culture. When I saw the first American 'Godzilla' adaption as a child, I was rather disappointed and thought of it as a missed attempt at putting a 'Jurassic Park' monster in a metropolis. As a child, I was then asking my parents to find the first original Godzilla movie that I had heard and read about and when my father finally came home with a videotape of it, I preferred this dark, diversified, philosophical movie that explored at least four genres at the same time (being a detailed action movie, a philosophical drama, a bleak horror movie and an innovating science-fiction film) to any movie I had ever seen before. Until today, the original movie from 1954 is one of my all-time favourite films and a classic any cineaste must see.Until today, I have watched almost all Godzilla movies and while I adore most of them (my favourites being 'Godzilla' (1954), 'Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster' (1964), 'Invasion of Astro-Monster' (1965), 'Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla' (1974), 'The Return Of Godzilla' (1984), 'Godzilla versus King Ghidorah' (1991) and 'Godzilla versus Destoroyah' (1995) among others), I thought it was a good idea to end the series with the fiftieth anniversary and a last epic movie called 'Godzilla: Final Wars' back in 2004 because the franchise started to run out of ideas. Ten years later, the world's most famous Kaiju is back. As a longtime fan I was excited that my childhood hero was back on screen but on the other side I felt that everything had been said about Godzilla and that the first American movie was of a low average quality at best.While the new movie is nothing revolutionary and not a far call from many classic Japanese movies without reaching the perfection of the unbeatable original, the new film is much better than the first American Godzilla movie. I liked the slow start of the movie including a scientific story that is slightly inspired by the original but also by current events as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The strongest acting parts of the movie can be seen in the first thirty minutes or so and immediately get you into the story. The idea of two new monsters that would compete with Godzilla took me a little bit by surprise and really goes back to the Japanese classics which is a positive fact for a longtime fan. The final battle scenes in San Francisco are entertaining and visually stunning. Most importantly, the looks of Godzilla are great and feature all trademarks fans like about him from his atomic breath to his unique roars. The king of monsters looks a little bit bigger and heavier than the original but I think it looks extremely beautiful. Maybe Godzilla almost looks too sympathetic which is reminding me of the movies of the sixties and seventies rather than the original film or the last Japanese films. In comparison to the last few movies of the franchise, Godzilla is actually playing a the role of a hero and not a villain again which was another positive surprise to me.Obviously, there are also a few minor negative elements in here. Apart of the great and touching first thirty minutes or so, the acting in this movie is a little bit wooden and stereotypical. I'm sorry to say this but child actor Carson Bolde is one of the worst of its kind. His character almost doesn't speak, has only one facial expression and looks like he had a severe Down syndrome. While watching the first thirty minutes, I thought it was going to be an extraordinary movie but a few lengths and the lack of high quality acting made the final result a very good film but not an absolute highlight. Another really negative element is that Godzilla almost only plays a secondary role in this movie apart of the last thirty minutes. The king of monsters doesn't have much screening time but once it is there, it really shines. The movie rather focuses on the two other monsters. I don't want to spoil anything but the two new monsters look somewhat artificial and have no unique charisma. The story around these two monsters had some potential but they are mostly unimpressive in the end and among the most boring opponents Godzilla ever had. On a side note, let's add that the soundtrack of this movie is unimpressive and never comes close to the emotional and epic Japanese soundtracks.In the end, the first thirty minutes of the movie are creative and intense while the final battle scenes in the last thirty minutes are entertaining and epic at some points. In between, the weak acting, the lack of screen time for Godzilla and the unimpressive new monsters slow the pace of the movie a little bit down. Fans of the franchise might analyze this film as a good and solid comeback but no extraordinary one. Enjoy and watch it without further hesitation if you are still undecided. After all, the new looks of Godzilla and its unique charisma (yes, a monster can have charisma and it's probably the best 'actor' in this movie) left me wanting more by the end of the movie. This is a well done tribute to the classics with convincing settings from the Phillipines over Japan to Hawaii and San Francisco. The special effects are as stunning as you can expect. I would call this movie a solid success after all. I'm in love with my childhood hero again and really hope Godzilla will be back.",7,3,7,21 May 2014
Looper," A consistent grower with an aborted ending
","'Looper' is a movie that convinces from several points of view.It has a rather intriguing science-fiction story line that is quite well used in here and not over-employed. This means that the film is still down to earth and doesn't include too many technical details or other stuff. If you want this kind of film, you should watch Star Trek.The film includes a lot of moral questioning and provokes many philosophical thoughts of what is right and wrong.The story itself is not too complicated but filled with tension to keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.The acting is very solid in this film and especially Bruce Willis plays one of his best roles in the last years and not only the superficial die hard guy with sick humour that he usually incarnates.The film is filled with a few great action scenes and a couple of stunning special effects but they are very decently used as the main focus remains on the acting and the story.The movie has also a few shocking moments you wouldn't expect that give especially the character incarnated by Bruce Willis a lot of depth.Overall, there is not much wrong with this movie but there are still a couple of things I've disliked about it.As this movie is mostly free from the usual stereotypes, it is sad that one stereotype had to be included in this which is a love story towards the second half of the film that adds nothing at all to the main plot and seems only to be included to follow the norms and please a larger crowd.Another critical point is the ending that is quite controversial. Some people adored it, others literally hated it. I disliked the ending but not that much because of its content but because it comes very abrupt. The tension raises continuously in the film and when you fell ready for a stunning showdown, the whole thing gets suddenly aborted which left me a little bit frustrated after all. I'm somewhat hoping for a director's cut or additional scenes when this will be released on DVD and BluRay but I'm not sure if this may ever happen.In the end, the positive points are though way more numerous than the negative aspects of this film. The movie is not a masterpiece but clearly one of the best cinema flicks of the year. This one here is definitely worth a watch for anyone who likes Hollywood cinema.By the way, it's a quite refreshing idea to see Bruce Willis' character retiring from his dangerous job to get into the big city life of Shanghai where he ends up with a tough Chinese lady that somewhat transmits an irresistible charm. These few scenes made me laugh a lot and had a very sympathetic touch in my humble opinion.",8,0,3,4 November 2012
Life," Predictable story line but great execution
","Even though ''Life'' really follows classic science-fiction standards by the numbers, it's a really engaging movie. Yes, the first twenty minutes take the time to introduce the settings and the characters. Obviously, the rest of the movie focuses on the monster that is going to kill the crew members one by one. It's as predictable as it gets when I'm telling you that the atmosphere inside the vessel will be intense, that there will be a few breathtaking scenes taken in space and that some characters will be ready to sacrifice themselves in order to save others. Of course, the famous lead character is the one to survive until the end. And yes, there is going to be an inevitable twist at the very end. On the other side, I must admit that the movie didn't follow all the wrong stereotypes. There are no unnecessary side stories such as emotional conflicts between the characters that act in a rather mature way and we are not exposed to a cheesy love story either which makes the characters more believable.Despite some flaws in the predictable story department, this movie in the vein of the classic Alien flicks still deserves to be watched on the big screen. The visual elements in the vessel and in space never fail to impress me but also have a realistic touch to them. Special effects such as body horror elements and explosions in the space station are added in small and efficient doses. The fact that ninety-eight percent of the film take place in space give this movie a refreshingly streamlined approach and since ninety-five percent of it are taking place inside the vessel, the film develops a claustrophobic vibe. This atmosphere is enhanced by a subtle yet gripping soundtrack. The characters feel down to earth and are portrayed accurately by the actors and actresses. They might not deliver the best performances of their careers but manage to give the movie a realistic touch. In the beginning, I was skeptical that the plot seemed to rely on a cast that absolutely needed to be multicultural which feels unnaturally forced in many films but it makes sense in the context of an international space mission.The most interesting element about this film is obviously its antagonist. Instead of introducing us to a big and strong monster in the key of Alien or Predator, this extraterrestrial life form constantly evolves its behavior and shape which adds to the rising tension in the movie. The fact that the monster acts unpredictably yet intelligently and learns very quickly about its survival instincts and tactics makes it a genuinely scary opponent. The monster's capacity to adapt to any threat makes it so respectable while its physical appearance is so unspectacular that it feels quite realistic.In the end, apart of the predictable story line and the first twenty minutes which are necessary to introduce the setting but somehow lack intensity, Life is an atmospheric, intelligent and realistic science-fiction-horror movie that will please those who love classic material like the Alien and Predator franchises.",7,1,7,26 March 2017
Ran," Failure at the highest level
","This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all, the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot, we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action, no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant, philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool, the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brother-in-law would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sister-in-law would have been executed, too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies, read from several books, known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet, many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects, let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden, it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example, the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation, this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors, excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story, even though the whole thing is predictable, some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie, we have around forty-five minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end, there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers, the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you, Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.",4,20,40,17 July 2012
Cube," Claustrophobic cult film from Canada
","Cube is a mysterious science-fiction horror movie made with a meager budget of three hundred fifty thousand dollars that would turn out grossing nine million dollars and lead to two less interesting sequels. The claustrophobic movie revolves around six completely different strangers who wake up in a gigantic cube without knowing how or why they got there. Since they have no access to food or water or any way to communicate with the outside world, they need to find their way through the numerous chambers of the gigantic cube in order to find a way out. The different chambers are however rigged with deadly traps and tension, stress and fear soon arise between the six strangers.There are numerous elements that made this low-budget movie a beloved cult film. First of all, the mysterious setting and its origins are truly intriguing. It's unclear who created the gigantic cube and to what purpose which invites viewers to look for clues and come to their own conclusions. Secondly, the story is filled with twists and turns and it remains unpredictable who is going to survive and how until the very last Scene that also leaves room for interpretation. Thirdly, the traps in the cube are deadly, diversified and unpredictable but the greatest dangers are the individuals themselves. This leads to the fourth and strongest element which are the seven characters introduced in the movie. We only briefly meet a nameless old man but the clever prison escapist, the paranoid free clinic doctor, the mathematics student with a difficult past, the socially awkward office worker, the seemingly autistic young man who has trouble communicating but incredible mathematical skills and the divorced police officer with anger management issues are the six characters bound by fate. The relationships between the different characters are fascinating to watch and evolve until the very end.In the end, Cube works very well despite a low budget thanks to a creative story with numerous stunning ideas and intriguing characters. The sequels don't reproduce this level of quality because the stories are more predictable and the characters more exchangeable. Even though this movie mixes thriller, mystery and horror elements, it can also been as a stunningly realistic social science study.",8,2,3,30 July 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Hitman on steroids
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is both one of the few action movies that actually has a reason to exist and that can compete with its predecessor. The former is confirmed since the titular main character has killed so many criminals in the predecessor that he has become public enemy number one which is the central plot element of this film. The latter is underlined by this film's similarly straight pace, pitiless action sequences and cool acting performances which make the transition between the two films very smooth. I would actually recommend watching the entire trilogy back to back since the films take place over a few days in the life of professional assassin John Wick.Just like its predecessor, this movie obviously doesn't feature an intriguing plot. However, it expands the universe of John Wick as well as his associates and competitors. It gives us more details about the lead character's impressive reputation and explores his life before his initial retirement. The film adds a few new characters such as a shady crime lord played by Riccardo Scamarcio and an enigmatic underground cult figure who controls a large network of homeless gangsters incarnated by Laurence Fishburne. The film also introduces new spectacular locations such as a stealthy infiltration sequence to assassinate a powerful woman at the heart of Rome.To keep it short, this sequel is as good as its predecessor and offers a whopping two hours of passionate action with spectacular locations, cool characters and some interesting background stories. This approach makes me think of a fast-paced video game like Hitman on steroids. The John Wick franchise doesn't reinvent its genre but offers unpretentious fun for fans of gritty action films for adults.",7,1,1,28 February 2019
Annihilation," Jumping on the bandwagon of contemporary intellectual science-fiction cinema
","Annihilation is a calm, intellectual and surreal science-fiction film in the key of recent successes such as Arrival, Ex Machina or even Blade Runner 2049 to a certain degree. Based upon a recent novel by Jeff VanderMeer, it tells the story of a mysterious and expanding extraterrestrial entity known as The Shimmer that seems to transform, mutate and copy its natural environment. Several groups have gone inside The Shimmer to investigate the phenomenon but none of them have come back as all of them were apparently killed, killed one another or went crazy and got lost. One year after his disappearance, a soldier named Kane suddenly comes back home to his wife Lena. Kane doesn't seem to be himself however. He is emotionally distant, seems to suffer from dementia and suddenly starts to feel very sick. On his way to the hospital, a government security force intercepts the ambulance and brings Kane and Lena to a secret area near The Shimmer. The security force wishes to interrogate Kane but he is in a coma. The security force then decides to send one last group into The Shimmer, consisting of a worried Lena who is a biologist and has been working for the military for seven years, an obsessed and strict psychologist named Doctor Ventress, a physicist with borderline personality disorder named Josie, an alcoholic paramedic called Anya who has anger management issues and surveyor and geologist Cass who mourns the death of her daughter who died of leukemia. The five women set out on a suicide mission as they soon lose track of time and realize how the mysterious entity not only transforms their environment but also themselves mentally and physically. In a last ditch effort, the group attempts to find out the secret of the entity and annihilate it before it annihilates them.There are several elements that make Annihilation a worthwhile experience. First of all, the film has a constant gloomy and mysterious atmosphere from start to finish. Secondly, the movie has an intellectual plot that makes the viewers speculate until the very end and beyond. Thirdly, the five female lead characters are very interesting in their own ways and their inner demons only add to the menacing tone of the movie. Fourthly, the overall calm film is occasionally shook up by a few sudden battles and gory scenes that never feel forced because they tell us more about the strange entity and the fate of the lost groups. Fifthly and maybe most importantly, the film is visually stunning. The animations, colors and light techniques make the extraterrestrial entity very spectacular and especially the film's climax is an unforgettable dream-like experience. Finally, the film's ending is quite controversial as some people might praise it while others could despise it. It's definitely something worth discussing. You should watch this film if you have an open mind for an intellectual experience. If you are just seeking passive entertainment, this movie is definitely not for you.Annihilation also has a few negative elements of course. In my opinion, it's much too close to movies such as Arrival and seems to jump on the bandwagon. This might also be the reason why I happened to find the movie's twist quite predictable which lowered its intensity quite a bit. Even though I'm aware that this is fiction, I disliked the fact that five characters that would never be chosen for this type of mission in real life got teamed up together. Some of them, like the extremely selfish psychologist that would clearly need a psychologist herself or the overtly aggressive paramedic who is a danger to herself and anyone around her, feel sketchily exaggerated, even given the circumstances that the extraterrestrial entity has an impact on the characters' psyches. Some more subtleness regarding the characters would have suited the movie's tone better.In the end, you might appreciate Annihilation even more if you haven't watched movies such as Arrival and Ex Machina before because it would be your first impressive contact with this type of intellectual science-fiction movie. If you have watched those two movies and others of its kind before, you will probably realize that Annihilation is inferior to those films and simply a good intellectual science-fiction movie. The visual components and the intellectual story are still good enough to watch this movie at your local cinema but the film's impact isn't as big as I would have expected beforehand.",7,5,14,7 March 2018
Jackie Brown," Authentic and well acted but it drags on for far too long
","Quentin Tarantino is a man between genius and madness who has created some of the best movies ever but also a few true Fails in my opinion. 'Jackie Brown' is just between both extremes for me and is maybe his most unspectacular film to date.On the positive side, this movie is Tarantino's most organic one until now. The characters are more credible than usual, the dialogues aren't all too over the top and the story line is quite easy to follow. The movie includes no special effects, shock moments or unexpected twists and feels surprisingly down to earth for a Quentin Tarantino movie. From that point of view, it's a quite unique movie from him. The acting is authentic and very well done. Pam Grier plays an attractive and intelligent lady in her forties who starts the movie as a victim just to become the one who plays with each other character around her. Samuel L. Jackson does a convincing role as superficial but not dumb gangster. Robert Forster plays a bondsman and smart gentleman with a lot of charisma as well. He's the actor I somehow like the most in this movie. In addition to the movie's authentic mood and the great acting, the soundtrack is as always quite convincing as well and introduces us to many great Afroamerican musicians. I must though admit that I preferred by far the soundtracks of other Tarantino movies such as 'Kill Bill' or 'Django Unchained' for example.On the other side, the movie definitely has its lengths as many Tarantino movies. There are some more or less important endless dialogues that should have been shortened in my opinion. This movie would have just been fine with a running time between ninety and one-hundred-five minutes in my opinion. Apart of that, the story is not only down to earth but also quite unspectacular and there isn't that much going on in two hours and a half. The movie feels a little bit too simple at some points. Apart of the acting, the movie lacks of a true highlight. The killing scenes are really unspectacular and you don't see very much. It's the same thing for one single and quite boring sex scene. The movie is supposed to have a few humorous moments but they really aren't all that memorable. The showdown in the mall also lacks tension. It shows us the same scene from three different views which gets quite redundant. The only truly gripping moments in this movie are the first E encounter between Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson in her apartment and the scene when Robert Forster and Samuel L. Jackson go to the Office of the bondsman. In the end, this film could have been a standout movie in Tranatino's career because it's quite different from what he usually does. The film though fails from that point of view and drags on far too long and turns out to be quite unspectacular or even boring at some points. It all feels more like a theatre play where convincing dialogues by solid actors matter but not much more. I have seen far worse but also far better movies and I would only recommend this flick to die hard fans of Quentin Tarantino's works.",6,6,8,24 July 2013
Sin City," The most innovating Hollywood movie of the last years
","Sin City is a visually stunning and even revolutionary movie that convinces with many different and often intriguing side stories that all lead to a fascinating whole complex structure and a bunch of very famous actors that also give their very best in this film.This neo-noir is based on Frank Miller's amazing graphic novel series and both the novels and the movie prove that Hollywood cinema must not hide behind the Asian wave of the manga boom and can still offer something innovating on their own instead of focusing on desperately copying the unbeatable masterpieces from other countries.The movie contains a very Gothic atmosphere, many cool and unique characters, a shot of very dark humour, some brutal and surprisingly gore killing scenes, a few breathtaking action passages and nevertheless some almost soft and emotional moments that add some depth to some of the characters. This high degree of diversity makes you want to discover more and more precious details in this film and watch it over and over again year after year. I still can't wait for the second movie that will come out next year.",10,3,5,23 May 2012
Spectre," Odd mixture of classic and contemporary elements
","''Spectre'' is an entirely entertaining above average action- thriller but only an average part of the famous James Bond franchise that I know by heart. While I enjoyed watching this movie at the cinema, I still felt somewhat disappointed and won't revisit this film anytime soon.The main problem of the movie is that it tries to arrange an odd mixture of the more recent films characterized by a more fragile main character, more personal plots and a sinister atmosphere on one side and the reintroduction of antiquated gadgets, classic characters from the seventies and the waffling of the usual trademark sentences on the other side. Instead of being an intriguing mixture of both styles, ''Spectre'' feels directionless, odd and surprisingly predictable.This has to do with an extremely weak story line. While the first hour of the movie is promising and builds up a mysterious tension around the main villain, the last ninety minutes fall flat from any point of view. The movie rehashes all the old stereotypes that aren't credible anymore in a contemporary setting. The love story between James Bond and Madeleine Swann isn't credible and feels forced. The main villain makes the most stupid mistakes such as torturing his victim instead of killing it at several moments. Even exploding watches and flame-spitting cars are back and add some unintentional slapstick humour to a film that starts in a serious manner. The problems don't stop there. Many parts of the movie are directly copied from several previous films of the franchise. The fighting scene on the train is a cheap copy of ''From Russia with Love'' for example. The character of Mr. Hinx is a cheap copy of Jaws from ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' and ''Moonraker''. These elements lack so much originality that they can't just be excused as simple tributes to the past.The acting of the movie is also rather underwhelming. It's Daniel Craig's least emotional performance of James Bond as he feels somewhat shallow and like a hollow shell of his former self. I was severely disappointed by the underused talent of the outstanding Christoph Waltz who is one of the best contemporary actors around the world but limited to a predictable character and a very short screen time. Monica Belluci's role is even completely unnecessary since she only has about five minutes of screen time, ten lines of dialogue and her role seems just to be a weak pretext for showing off some skin.Obviously, there are still several positive elements. Léa Seydoux is a confident, smart and tough incarnation of a Bond girl that contrasts the more traditional characters in the movie. Ralph Fiennes as M is convincing as a cold, loyal and serious boss. The geeky reinterpretation of Q portrayed by Ben Whishaw reaches a new high quality peak as well.The action sequences of the movie might not be original but they are definitely stunning. The chase scene in Austria is bombastic, breathtaking and well-edited. The costumes and settings of the movie are diversified but always appropriate. The soundtrack is on the same elegant level as the previous ''Skyfall''.Some elements of the plot are truly promising, especially in the first hour of the movie. The longer the movie gets, the more ridiculous the story becomes and especially the closing scene is really weak in my opinion.In the end, ''Spectre'' is a slightly below average James Bond movie. Die-hard fans of the franchise should go to the cinema while anyone else can simply wait for a release on DVD/Blu-ray. You will probably be entertained while you're watching this movie but in the long run, it's a rather exchangeable film that you will soon forget.",6,2,7,12 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Shallow action without any aesthetics, charm or depth
","On an objective level, both critics and fans don't seem to know what a good movie is anymore. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' may be filled with nearly two hours of breathtaking non-stop action sequences and a couple of great special effects, settings or locations and some solid camera and light techniques in the few calmer moments. The problem is that there is literally nothing more than this in this reboot of another legendary series. There are no real intrigues going on and creativity is literally non- existent. There are almost no dialogues and the few that are there are quite weak. There are no surprising elements or twists and therefor no tension whatsoever in the whole flick. The plot is so shallow that even the increasingly bad 'Fast and Furious' feel like intellectual masterpieces if compared to this laughable excuse of a story. One gets introduced to an epic number of characters but none of them has any real depth. The biggest problem is the uncharismatic main actor Tom Hardy and his shallow character that doesn't create any antipathy or sympathy among viewers. I rarely cared less about a leading character in any movie than here. Another problem are the numerous villains that aren't fleshed out either. It feels as if the characters of the bad guys were randomly borrowed from some of the trashiest action flicks of the seventies and eighties. Sometimes, they appear pretty much out of nowhere and die as randomly a few minutes later. The only actress who did a decent job and managed to add some depth to its character is Academy Award winner Charlize Theron. I feel sad for her to be acting in such a disastrous movie.Even two hours of non-stop action end up feeling boring and stretched if there are no truly stunning scenes or any degree of virtuosity in the high amount of exaggerated explosions and endless gunfights. Even as a homage to the original series or a worthless movie to switch your brains off and have some fun, this movie has nearly no merits. Apart of the few objective positive elements which are basically due to the impertinent budget and some obvious inspirations from the original cult movies and which barely justify my extremely generous rating, this film is extremely overrated and not recommendable for anyone.",4,18,39,12 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," The greatest anti-war movie of the last five years
","''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a superbly crafted anti-war movie and easily the best movie of its kind since the release of the South Korean war epic ''My Way'' five years earlier. This movie is based upon true events and tells the story of Seventh-day Adventist Desmond Thomas Doss who enlists in the Army to take part in the Second World War to defend his country but refuses to carry a gun due to his religious beliefs and negative experiences with his violent father who is a war veteran. In the beginning, Doss is bullied, criticized and rejected because of his convictions but he ends up gaining the respect of his brothers in arms during the crucial Battle of Okinawa where he saves the lives of seventy-five soldiers as a medic.The movie can basically be divided into three parts. The first part introduces Desmond Thomas Doss' life in Lynchburg, Virginia. It shows us how he almost killed his brother as a child because his fighting was encouraged by his broken, brutal and depressive father who is a war veteran of the First World War. It also shows us how his father abused of his wife and almost shot her. Desmond Thomas Doss had to fight his father to protect his mother and swore to never touch a gun again. It also shows us how he fell in love with a local nurse called Dorothy Schutte that he would later on marry. This part of the movie shows us a caring, peaceful and smart young man with clear and strong convictions.The second part of the film shows us how Desmond Thomas Doss enlists in the army. Initially, he convinces with good results during his training and gets along with most of his brothers in arms. It's only when he openly refuses to carry a gun that he gets rejected by his brothers in arms who are encouraged not to trust him or follow his actions by their superiors. Desmond Thomas Doss gets bullied both mentally and physically by his brothers in arms and has to face some time in prison as well as a trial for disobeying the orders of his superiors. In the end, the charges against him are dropped when a former commanding officer and brother in arms of his father states that Doss' refusal to carry a firearm is protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. This part of the movie shows us an authentic, honest and persevering individual that holds onto his beliefs despite all the hardship he endures.The third part of the movie takes places during the Battle of Okinawa at a place nicknamed Hacksaw Ridge. Doss' and his brothers in arms must take down the strategically placed Japanese forces atop a cliff. The battle turns out to be pitiless, long and brutal as losses are heavy on both sides. At night, Doss is the only non-injured American who remains on the battlefield to save as many injured soldiers as he can all by himself despite Japanese soldiers occupying the territory. This part of the movie shows us a brave, selfless and strong medic who risks his own life to save as many brothers in arms as possible.Aside of the inspiring story of a selfless medic, this movie convinces on many levels. The acting is authentic and emotional. Especially the main character portrayed by Andrew Garfield has a lot of sympathetic charisma. His father and war veteran portrayed by Hugo Weaving shows us a torn character who is brutal and depressive on one side but also honest and determined to help his son during his trial no matter what. Another great character is the main character's wife Dorothy Schutte played by Teresa Palmer who convinces as a selfless, faithful and elegant young woman who loves her husband for all the right reasons. Aside the extraordinary acting, one must point out the movie's epic cinematography. The costumes and settings are authentic and unpolished. The last third of the movie shows us quite brutal, graphic and gripping battle scenes that truly show us the horrors of war. These scenes are not gratuitous, melodramatic or overwhelming, they are just as close to reality as it gets. These intense scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. Another element I liked is the balance between wide shots to capture the horrors on the battlefield and the close-up to capture the emotions on the faces of the injured soldiers in the last forty-five minutes or so of the movie.To keep it short, ''Hacksaw Ridge'' is a memorable anti-war movie that convinces with an unusual, epic and detailed story line, outstanding acting performances and gorgeous cinematography. It's one of the best war movies in recent memory and also an outstanding drama at the same time. The only reason why this movie didn't get the highest rating is the fact that it focuses a little bit too much on the religious views of the main character. I'm aware of the fact that these beliefs are incredibly important to the main character but the movie felt a little bit repetitive, overwhelming and melodramatic concerning these elements that almost felt like religious propaganda at certain points.",9,4,9,10 November 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Cliché and disillusion of the American Dream for a poor black guy
","Social critic showing the melancholic misery of a poor young black entrepreneur and his sweet son - well, this cliché is nothing new as we take a look at the number of brilliant novels or movies that have been made around and about this topic.Will Smith tries to wash away his vocation of a funny comedian or hero in some silly action movies or rap video clips and wants absolutely to do a serious, intellectual movie. Well, he should have stayed in the genre where he is brilliant and where he has made so many fans. This movie is worth a discussion about society and maybe interesting for some politicians or populists who dislike some things of the so-called American Dream. If you want to be entertained, you will be disappointed, because the movie has a very slow development, a very depressive and sad atmosphere, a story full of clichés without any surprises and everything is focused on the acting of Will Smith, while all other actors stay superficial. Will Smith is doing an unexpected, but very well job, but the problem is that the movie is too focused on the bad things about life, too straight in one direction, too closed-minded, too old-fashioned, too slow and boring and without any surprises.If you like this kind of depressive atmosphere and want to get inspired for the creation of a better world, this one could be interesting for you. If you want to share a movie with your friends, get entertained or amused, forget about it.If you like this one, go also for the Quebecker movie 'L'âge des ténèbres'. If you don't like it, but you're interested in a similar story, go for the classic 'A raisin in the sun'.",3,0,1,5 April 2010
The Great Gatsby," The great boredom
","'The Great Gatsby' is a movie that convinces with well done visual effects even though they weren't worth a 3D adaption at all. The soundtrack of the movie was also decent as well as costumes, light work and locations. Leonardo DiCaprio did another convincing job but he has also done far better before as well.These are the only positive things I could tell you about this boring movie based on a horribly overrated novel. There are so many bad points that I honestly don't really know where to start. The story is extremely lame and predictable. The main love story never managed to touch me even though I'm a rather emotional and romantic person. Even the disgusting and evil characters didn't evoke any kind of emotion in me. The only moments where something finally happens in the movie are maybe the last thirty minutes and it's not all too breathtaking neither. The first two hours are almost event-less and there isn't any character development neither. The acting is superficial and simply forgettable. It has been a while since I have seen a movie with such a bad and exchangeable acting. Especially the narrator and main character didn't give me anything at all and remained absolutely faceless. The movie tried to criticize the mindless life of the roaring twenties but its attempt remained dull and vague.In the end, I was close to leave my local movie theatre several times and the film was really hard to sit through after all. This drama has a lot of lengths, includes mostly faceless actors and focuses on an ordinary story line that could be told in three lines and that doesn't carry a movie with an overrated length of two hours and a half. The costumes and effects are okay but not worth your money for an expensive 3D screening.In the end, as a fan of many movies centred around the roaring twenties and the depressive thirties in the United States of America (from 'The Godfather' over 'Once Upon A Time In America' up to 'Gangster Squad') and also as a fan of Leonardon DiCaprio in many of his movies ('Titanic', 'Inception', 'Shutter Island') I was really disappointed by this flick. I wouldn't watch it again and would recommend you to avoid this content-less piece of glam and glitter at all costs.",3,3,8,17 May 2013
Evil Dead II," A horrible lack of ideas and originality
","One friend of mine, who was normally likes movies that I like, absolutely wanted to show me this movie and said that it would be a funny and very gore horror movie that wouldn't not take itself serious at all. My friend had presented me 'Shaun of the dead' and I liked the mixture of horror and comedy in this movie. I also like 'Scary movie' and 'Final destination', horror movies that go into a funny and ridiculous direction. I even saw movies from the legendary Ed Wood such as 'Bride of the monster' or 'Plan 9 from outer space' and I thought that they were trashy, but very charming and atmospheric somehow. I think that I can consider myself as an open-minded person that finds this genre of horror comedy at least interesting.I am really sorry to say this, but this movie is just complete rubbish. I know that this movie wants to joke about serious horror movies but after the first two or three sketches and the first ten minutes of surprising absurdity of this film, the whole thing is just not funny any more and you are waiting that there is some development, something original, something crazy to come, but that isn't the case. The childish jokes are repeated within the eighty minutes of the movie and become really annoying. The acting is particularly bad, the substance of ideas is running low, the dialogs are more than awful, there is nothing shocking or surprising, there are many mistakes in the movie and I could continue this list eternally. I know that those were the intentions of the director, but it is too much of everything and just not funny or entertaining anymore after ten minutes. All the movies that I have mentioned in my introduction are more original and funnier than this piece of garbage. I really tried to laugh, to put myself on a very low and childish level and took some beers during the film in the hope that it would help, but it didn't. It just helped me to almost fall asleep during this so-called cult movie but as I wanted to watch this completely and until the very end, I continued to torture myself. The only other horror movie that I know that is as awful as this one is Rob Zombie's 'House of thousand corpses'.Even if some people find this 'cult' movie funny and entertaining with its charming trash, I think that this stuff doesn't deserve such a high rating at all, when the other films that I mentioned are mostly rated about at least two points below this movie.",1,9,22,24 October 2010
