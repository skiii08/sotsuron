Antz," It's Woody's show.
","Pictures for the kiddies and sound for the adults, as we enter the world of an ant colony with a Woody Allen type character who rebels against the system, creating chaos as only Woody can do. Predictable with a few good one liners that you expect from Mr. Allen himself. The computer animation is something to behold.",7,1,1,6 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just wake me when it's over!
","Politics in the Galaxy turns ugly with ruthless planet take-overs. The same as the original STAR WARS but with improved special effects. The so-called chariot race is the highlight. And as for the annoying Jar Jar Binks, it worked for the children who laughed along with its silly antics. There's always an idiot in every adventure while the one emotional expressions of the Jedi heroes, (played by Liam and Ewan), supplied the serious side to the story. One definitely for the children and the children at heart. I know my children loved this one and will be cuing for the next instalment.",5,2,4,6 January 2002
Chinatown," The short man with the blade has something about noses.
","I decided to give this movie a second viewing and thoroughly enjoyed it this time round. Private eye Jake, (Jack Nicholson at his peak), finds himself tangled in a game of ruthless politics and deceit. He goes on the hunt to prove himself worthy of integrity. Instead he becomes a pawn in a game played by the filthy rich Cross family. One of Towne's finest scripts helped by Polanski's direction. The ending itself is a brave one and something you will not see in today's Hollywood gloss.",8,2,6,12 February 2003
The Big Lebowski," Lets go bowling with the Coens.
",Coen brothers make something out of nothing in this crazy black comedy about a down and out loser who gets used and abused for being the nice guy who really doesn't give a hoot about the things that make life that little bit complicated and just wants to go bowling like everybody else in this forsaken world!!!,8,0,1,7 February 2003
Shakespeare in Love," I'm a bit like Queen Elizabeth, (Judi Dench), who hates romantic plays. But...
","I'm a bit like Queen Elizabeth, (Judi Dench), who hates romantic plays. But this film coned me in as I fell head over heals with Gwyneth as Viola and the ruggedly handsome Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare. Amongst the turmoil of two duelling theatres fighting for Shakespeare's works, a love blossoms, helping Shakespeare out of a writer's block. High on love, Shakespeare begins on a quest of writing Romeo & Juliet, interweaving his passion with Viola into the play. A bit like Amadeus but without the madness of a genius. This time its the smultzy-waltzy, lovey-dovey romance that takes you away for a pleasant two hours and a bit. And what you heard about Mr. Geoffrey Rush is true. The man has talent and proves it in such a small but funny role.",8,5,9,3 January 2002
Alien: Resurrection," Kill it and move on!
","Ripley is back to do battle with the monster and this time she is a mean mother! This one absolutely falls flat on its face as it goes through the same old formula & routines.

12 Angry Men," Is this the perfect low budget cinema for students to learn from?
","Yes, this is a Hollywood masterpiece. It was the start of an incredible journey by the director, Sidney Lumet. It's a shame the writer Reginald Rose did not have as an illustrious career as Lumet, but he did write one other classic, MAN OF THE WEST (1958). The nod goes to the performances by an amazing cast who hold it together in the confine spaces of the one setting. You would expect a film that mostly takes place in the one room to be theatrical, but Lumet manages to create the intensity with his tight direction and the brilliant use of deep focus and wide angle lenses. This is one film that all students should watch to observe the craft of how to create a very low budget movie with a perfect cast, the right director and a top notch writer.",9,3,5,7 February 2008
The Fifth Element," Willis, the comic book hero.
","You've got to laugh at this over-the-top, save-the-world art trash from Besson who manages to succeed in bringing a comic book style farce to the screen. Willis is perfect and now type cast as a comic book action hero that he plays so well",7,1,2,16 February 2003

Juno," Perfect characterizations.
","At the end of the film I noticed that I was not feeling any emotional burden of anger or outrage that is normally associated with movies full of nasty characters giving our heroes a hard time. There was just a feeling of humbleness and tranquility. I wondered why and then realized that there was not one nasty character in the whole movie, (yes, the ultrasound technician came across with a streak of nastiness only because of her ignorance). I mean, ever character had flaws, like all of us who just stumble through life in hope of getting to the other end of it all, where ever it is! The success of this movie came down to the brilliant written characters and their portrayal by a superb cast. The writer respected each and every character and gave them a life of their own. This could not have been achieved by the perfect choice of casting.",8,3,8,24 February 2008
American Beauty," Welcome to to the Burnham Family.
","We fly over Suburbia LA as the dead Lester Burnham narrates his wisdom on modern life, that commences with a morning masturbation session in the shower, followed by the rest of the day that goes down hill from there. This SUNSET BOULEVARD  approach of the dead man narrating works a treat here as we now know what happens to him, but it's the why and who that intrigues us. The first image of the movie shows his daughter, Jane, on video, wishing his sleazy father was dead. But surely they couldn't give us that much information all in the opening minutes. So we sit there and wait in wonder.To distract us from who is going to do the killing of Lester, we enter via another door with the plaque, 'Mid-Life Crises'. That's the excuse they use when someone in his early forties goes through a radical change in life. A poor title for a poor excuse. What Lester shows us through the pen of script writer, Alan Ball, is that the so-called mid-life crises is the realisation that there is more to life than the game you are playing. This comes through Lester's deteriorating relationship with his wife, Carolyn and daughter Jane. His job is an absolute bore and it seems he won't be able to hold it down any longer. What turns the tables is the meeting of two teenage kids. One is Jane's friend, Angela, the blonde beauty who supplies the rose pedals in Lester's dreams, giving him that extra push to live so he could conquer her. The other is the dope, supplied by the video freak neighbour, Ricky, which relaxes him and allows him to relive those teenage years where loud Seventies music accompanies the cruising of your vehicle.Lets not forget the rest of the Burnham family. We have wife Carolyn, struggling to make something of herself as a Real Estate Agent. She lives in a picture perfect world with a perfect house, a perfect rose garden, perfect car and perfect body with looks to match. But the insides of the mind are rotting away as her failure turns to other options to save her, mainly that of an affair. Daughter Jane is still young and could be spared of this life. She tends to hang back and watch her parents go round the bend. But they soon spill into her territory, where she really doesn't want them. It's the relationship with the neighbour Ricky and his video camera that awakens her.There we have the supposedly dysfunctional middle class American family. Next is the neighbours. What is Suburbia without them? If you are facing the Burnham house, you would find that to their left lives a gay couple and to their right lives the Nazi Colonel, Frank Fitts and family. In the centre is the Burnham family, who would rather stay that way with their political ideology because it's always safe to just sit on the fence.Writer, Alan Ball, has drawn the perfect symbolic structure of life, not only in America but everywhere. This film will be viewed as the RAZOR'S EDGE of the Twenty First century, where humans don't have to travel in search of the meaning to their existence, but only have to look into their own back yard to find it. Lester Burnham does just that and maybe finds it all that little bit too late.First time director, Sam Mendes, makes a proper job out of Ball's script with the help of Conrad L. Hall's photography. But one cannot help and think of the early films of Atom Egoyan when viewing the style and approach, (FAMILY VIEWING, SPEAKING PARTS, CALENDER) . Maybe its because of the relationship between Ricky and the video imagery. Atom's films dealt with the video medium as the main thrust in shaping human lives. There is also the photographic style in the wide shots, that if you freeze them, they become the perfect family portrait. It's only when the images move do we see the ugly side. For a British theatre director to cross over into a Hollywood film,  Mendes did an astounding job in showing us the American psyche.
To cap it all off is the performances. Kevin Spacey has a ball as Lester. Annette Bening as Carolyn almost hams it up but never crosses that line of absurdity. Thora Birch as Jane is the only one that keeps the top on her performance, giving her that air of mystery. Mena Suvari as Angela is the perfect wet dream who seems to have come out of one of those bad teenage school campus flics of the Eighties. Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, the sleazy Real Estate agent, is very effective in a small role. The mad Colonel Frank Fitts as played by Chris Cooper adds that extra edge, something for the audience to boo at. And last but not least is the brilliant Wes Bentley as the video freak, Ricky Fitts. One cannot help but notice the similarity of looks between him and director Sam Mendes!",9,0,0,13 April 2000

Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg at war.
","As we all know, the opening 30 minutes will go down in cinema history along side the Odessa steps scene in Eisenstein's POTEMKIN (1925 - Russia) as pure classic. The rest of the film is a journey taken through the madness of war by Captain Miller, (Tom Hanks), and his men. The production values are of the highest order, achieving realism and emotional impact. I admit to be in fits of shakes during the opening and then crying on my way home. But do we have to see what we already know and that is War is barbaric in death and destructive to those who survive it. Maybe yes, because you value life just that little bit more after seeing this. Only complaint. The ending battle. I'm not quiet sure if that was a sign of patriotism or stupidity but it almost had the flavour of the Dirty Dozen kicking Nazi butt but not quiet so. By this stage it was enough war carnage.",9,0,0,14 April 2000
Across the Universe," Beatles were the Sixties.
","A brilliant piece of cinema that traces the evolution of The Beatle's music through the story of a group of youths who are trying to make sense of their world in turmoil. It begins with the sweet innocent pop tunes through the carefree life of our youthful heroes and when the wind blows in the political changes, the music matures and becomes one of social awareness Â– and some weirdness. Director Julie Taymor has a heighten sense of visual story telling that she experimented with in her earlier movies (Titus and Frida), but in this one, she just released the reins and went wild, and how could you not with the best music in the world to give you a hand?",8,0,2,3 August 2008
The Game," Hard to swallow.
","Now how do I swallow this? As a pill or should we crunch it down into a liquid form? Whatever you do, it's a hard film to swallow. Far fetch may be the solution but you have to admire these filmmakers' desperate attempt to force feed us with this plot about a rich person's morality game. Michael Douglas tries in vain to convince us that he is a cold ruthless financial head, rolling in money and ego, (WALL STREET all over again?). But his little brother, Conrad, (Sean Penn in another manic performance), sets him up for a gift he'll never forget. Director, Fincer, uses his technical craft to enhance the thrills but if you're quick, you'll work out the ending fifteen minutes into the film.",5,2,4,17 February 2003

To help Flic and his fellow ants out, a group of mixed-up screwball insects from a flea circus are mistaken as fighting warriors who will save them.

The Insider," The real drug pushers.
","After his last masterpiece, HEAT, Michael Mann had enough integrity and credibility to attack the powers that be. So with this film he crosses the hot coals - lit by the drug pushing tobacco companies, multi-billion dollar corporations and the TV media - to tell the true story of Jeffrey Wigand who blows the whistle on his ex-employees about the drug induced nicotine they mass produce. 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman gets a whiff of the story and is quick on the trail. He is a man of his word that gets straight to the point and doesn't like to mess about. He may seem to be too patriotic, waving the sleazy media flag but he is not. You can label him as the last of the true media reporting heroes, a rare thing in this day and age. The other bonus Bergman has is that Pacino does a wonderful job in portraying him. You almost wonder why all the accolades are going to Crowe as the poor stressed-out Wigand. Not taking anything away from Crowe, the man is absolutely astonishing. As a viewer you do get swept into his deep ocean of paranoia and frustration. With these two performances up front there is no letting you down. What really picks up the film is the second half when all guns are out to do battle with the revelations of what goes on behind closed doors in the Corporate sector. The great thing is that there are no shoot-outs or dead bodies for dramatic effect. Reality can sometimes be fascinating! Mann's previous films were stylised, but with The Insider he knew that the script was good enough to stand on its own. So he went for the realist look where the photography of Dante Spinotti is just there to tell the story without any fancy lighting. Another technic Mann uses is the sense of paranoia. We get into Wigand's fear as the image lingers on at the end of a scene with the extras in the background becoming the focus of attention. Is one of them the tobacco thugs, spy or whatever? Or is it just me that's paranoid? This build up works perfectly for Pacino's character later in the piece when he realises what Wigand is going through. Nice to see a film not afraid to tell who the real criminals are, because these days we all just tend to shut up, bend over and take that Corporate $ firmly between the cheeks!",9,0,1,25 February 2003
Super 8," It had all the elements, but...
","It began as an entertaining movie with lovable and heartwarming characters, but it got sillier as it attempted to search for an ending. There were plenty of ways for the storyline to thread through, but the wrong path was chosen and after all that wonderful and playful built up, it fell flat on its face.The most enjoyable aspect of the movie was the kids making the super 8 zombie film (I did it back in the late seventies). While all the madness was occurring around them, they persisted in trying to complete this film, utilizing the chaos. It was fun to see the shenanigans the kids got up to make such a film and what goes on behind the scenes of movie making is just like the grown-up world of filmmaking. The teenage love interest on the set was also a pure delight.The other interesting aspect of the film was the distrust of the military, who mislead & jeopardized a peaceful town for their own interest. The same as today, but with the media taking on the role.Production values where of the highest order, enhancing the visual story telling. It's just a shame that not too much thought went into the last act of the screenplay. But overall it was fun and worth munching on popcorn while watching it.",6,0,0,23 December 2011
Life Is Beautiful," A classic fable on history.
","A hilarious first half has us enjoying the comical antics of Guido as he romances the local school teacher, Dora. From that blossoms a child, Joshua, the soul to the story. Unfortunately, this all takes place during the reign of the Nazis who imprison these lovable characters. To hide the ugly reality from little Joshua, his father Guido makes the Jewish prison camp out to be a game, thus saving the kid from future therapy costs. For all its flaws in the story department of believability, this film still manages to suck you in, after all it is a fable. I'm sure Fedrico Fellini would have been proud of this movie.",9,2,4,18 January 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Welcome to upper-middle class angst with Bill and Alice.
","That clever cheeky bugger Mr. Kubrick knew what he was doing when casting top line stars Tom and Nicole in his final masterpiece. He was aiming for a wide audience, specifically hetero couples and that he achieved. With the presence of the stars this movie will reach its audience in suburbia. That's were I saw it and the cinema was full of couples. At the end of the movie you could hear a pin drop as we all filed out with our heads hanging down in either astonishment or outrage paranoia. I viewed this movie with my wife and never have we discussed a movie so deeply afterwards. But the discussion went beyond the movie as we dwelled into our own relationship. Were do you draw the line between sexual fantasy and realism? Do men go beyond the point of sexual fulfilment? Or are men just a natural hunter in search of a prey that normally is its own self? Dr. Bill, (Tom), goes on a primitive hunt to satisfy his urge of curiosity after his wife Alice tells him of a sexual fantasy she had about a sailor. While hers was a fantasy, (or was it?), his will be reality, (or is it?), for revenge purposes. Instead Dr. Bill is lead on a crusade that takes him on a journey beyond his outer-comfort-limits. He enters a sexual world that only man can wish for and only receive in dreams. Kubrick succeeds in challenging the Hetero world with questions that need to be looked into deeply. As with all Kubrick films the images range from straight narrative to the surreal when it is necessary. This is mostly Dr. Bill's perspective that left him with eyes wide shut during the orgy sequence. Tom's performance as Dr. Bill was one of his finest. At first he seems out of his depth but you soon realise that his performance is based on the social appearance of pretence that is soon replaced by the personal and strong performance when he discovers Alice's fantasy and is swept away in the journey. Nicole is brilliant in a small but important role. In the end I had to laugh at Kubrick's brilliance. Maybe I misread it but the movie was left open for any interpretation. As far as I'm concern, a movie is the patient and the audience the Therapist.",9,1,2,16 August 1999
War of the Worlds," If you are currently looking for a movie that has plenty to say about the current state of political affairs - then this is it!
","On the surface this is your standard Spielberg manipulative movie, told brilliantly, pulling the right emotional cords and full of spectacular actions scenes. But if you look deep down into the bowels, there is an ugly side, most of it dug up from the USA's backyard.Representing the USA is Ray Ferrier, a blue collar worker with a failed marriage and children he cannot seem to connect with. Sounds like another single parent in a screwed-up dysfunctional world.From underneath him the Earth opens up and out come the menacing alien giant tripods, ready to destroy the world. These machines have been right under civilization's noses for millions of years, and I'm sure it was the crazed Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) who pointed it out. That's when the penny dropped for me.The enemy is right under our noses! But who are our enemies? The terrorists? No, Ray crossed them off the list. How about the politicians? They create fear within us, planting the seed of paranoia, which then flowers into panic and then mayhem within our own minds. That's what happens to our protagonist, Ray Ferrier, as he attempts to get away from this mysteries alien invasion. He can't make sense of it, but his first instinct is to get his children away from it. And on this journey of survival, he packs a hand gun, like all good citizens should do when being invaded.Ray and his children manage to get away in the only mobile vehicle. Along the way they come across a convoy of army vehicles that are headed towards the disaster. Ray's teenage angst ridden son wants to join them and fight the unbeatable war. But Ray won't have none of that because he knows what the consequences will be - the same consequences as sending our young naïve troops to Iraq.Somewhere amongst all this carnage there is a scene of an airplane scattered over a suburban street. Ray finds a TV cameraman and a journalist scavenging through this disaster, pulling out food and filling up there bags with the supplies. (The same way Journalists find stories) But the journalist does show Ray something of interest that they have captured on camera, and that is the lightning that hit the Earth before the tripods came alive. Hidden in the rods of lightning are these creatures that penetrate the Earth to get to the tripods underground. Is this how a few politicians with hidden agendas are penetrating our society? And then raising the evil empire to conquer all? Maybe I'm going right off track but I'm enjoying this a little too much to stop right now. Anyway, back to the story where the journalist's aim is to get the hell out of there since they can't get a good story out of Ray. It says a lot about today's journalism. (I couldn't help myself again.) Now, while the politicians are  sorry, I meant to say Aliens - are sending our citizens into a mad frenzy, Ray and his children drive right into one. A fight ensures over the vehicle but Ray has his trusty gun that takes control over proceedings. But someone else comes out one better and points a gun at Ray's head. He's not ready to die for a silly cause as he realises that his intention is to save the family. The man with the gun manages to take control of the vehicle and only drives a few metres before being shot down. Ray and children can only watch the madness as everyone fights for the car. (A nice little piece for the anti-gun lobby movement.) Ray and family seem to be getting into more deep s**t. This time the army comes to the rescue and Ray's teenage boy wants to fight the good cause. Ray tries to talk him out of it but the foolish young boy has an urge to take on evil. Ray knows he has to let his son go sooner or later, as other parents did when they sent their children off to Iraq, fearing for the worse.The only safe place for Ray and his daughter is in the basement of a crazed man, Ogilvy. This man must surely represent the mid-west American. All this man wants to do is to take on the aliens with a shotgun and an axe. It's what a lot of American's wanted to do after 9/11, find an enemy and seek vengeance. Maybe too haste a move was made and Ray feels the same. He knows that is not a wise move since it will only stir up trouble and jeopardise his daughter's life (who I might add represents the innocence of a nation). The only way Ray can convince this nut Ogilvy is by eliminating him in a very fine cinematic moment.An interesting piece occurs when Ray and daughter are now captives in the tripod's cage. The alien tripod randomly picks out a human and sprays their blood over the land. (Obviously a reference to the blood of soldiers being sprayed over foreign soil) Ray is up next and it's only the reaction of a soldier who knows the evil intentions of the alien tripod and the parting of father and daughter. How about we link this to soldiers who are losing faith in their government's decision making and have to now take their own action? And it pays off as they manage to escape.The ending is very simple as the alien tripods die. Not because of the intelligent weapons created by Humans, but because of bacteria that only humans are immune to. Now, what does this say about our politicians? Are they immune to our votes? Now, maybe I'm right off track but it was fun to watch this movie in that perspective. But then again, this movie could be about the unfair treatment of divorced fathers and the raw deal they get. But that's another thesis in itself.",7,1,7,2 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Lewis the legend.
","I watched this film with a friend who wondered what all the fuss was about, as well as what the hell this movie was trying to say. I couldn't help him because I was a little overwhelmed by what I just sat through and it took me a few days to put it all together and work out why. When a movie has that affect on you, then you know it achieved it's goal.A movie with the main character as a greedy, power hungry human is pure box office poison. The protagonist has to have some empathy for the audience to share the journey with. But the character, Daniel Plainview (love the name), had none of those elements that were so obvious. For this film you had to look deep for those qualities in the protagonist, and when you did come across them in certain scenes, you wondered why you even bother caring for such a character. Then it dawned on me, I fell into the same trap when I watched Raging Bull. No matter how repulsive or brutal the main character was, they were fascinating, and this is all because of the performances. Daniel Day Lewis saved this film from a certain death.What also saved it is the direction of Paul Thomas Anderson. I admired all his movies and still do after watching this. He was brave enough to contain his scenes within minimal shots and cuts. Some scenes played within the one shot. This enabled the viewer to concentrate on the amazing performances and not to be distracted by the editing process which can sometimes hide the flaws within a screenplay.There was also plenty of references to today's political climate. I'm sure there is one there about the oil companies and religion working together to benefit each other. Maybe Daniel represents the oil companies who use religion to get what he wants and visa-versa, There is also the relationship with his son, someone he has brought up and educated about the workings of his business. Is this the same relationship as the USA had with Iraq until the powerful nation thought that the little guy got a bit too big for his boots so they booted him out. And how about when Daniel's so-called-brother shows up. Who does this long lost brother represent? Is it Afghanistan? The same ones that the USA had helped to fight the Russians? Maybe I'm getting a little carried away here, but I'm sure there are plenty of little connections and references we can make between today's current political turmoil and what the movie has to offer us.Most of all, see this movie for it's breathtaking cinematography, the haunting music, the perfect production design, the brave direction and most of all, the performances of a lifetime from the modern acting master Â– Mr. Lewis.",9,3,7,7 February 2008

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," More than a superhero action flic...
","I know it's only a Comic Book Superhero Action movie, but I'm going to have some critique fun with it. And why not? After forcing me to sit through 151 minutes of Comic Book Superhero Action of the dark kind, I'm entitled to draw my own conclusions to what the hell lies under the capes of this superhero spectacle. It was the only way I could entertain myself while watching this with a two-year-old child beside me who was more interested in his popcorn and dirtying his nappy! (Not my child, belonged to some inconsiderate parents.) On the surface it's all about Good verses Evil, and the perception of what is good and what is evil. That is the comic book analysis in a nutshell. Now, in my little demented world of analysis, this deliciously dark film is about the current state of our crazy political world in total chaos. As I see it, Batman and Superman are symbols of political and religious factions. So here it goes--- Batman is politically to the Right. A rich boy who is subconsciously out to revenge his parents death through his battle with crime. He is angry, as the Right tend to be because of all this political correctness gone mad and other social issues that has given rise to dangerous deluded leaders of the wrong kind. (Hang in there, this rant is going somewhere!) Superman is a Lefty. Raised on a farm, but he is not from this planet (a refugee?), who is a do-gooder, mostly saving people of all race and persuasion. Batman does not like Superman, because Superman cannot be trusted after what he did in his last bloody battle (taking out thousands of innocent civilians in friendly fire). And Superman is not from this world, therefore this refugee cannot be trusted by the Right.Between them is Lex Luther, a ruthless wealthy megalomaniac, out to get rid of the superheroes so as to control the world. So how does he do it? Get them to turn on each other. He wants to be more powerful than they are, and it irks him that these superheroes are seen as Gods (a very valid point made by my son). Like Lex said, 'If man won't kill God, the Devil will do it!' Lex is the Devil, ready to take out the Godly superheroes. The wealth and control of his evil corporation gives him the power to achieve that by manipulating the superheroes. But who does Lex Luther represent (besides the Devil)? At first I thought he was a symbol of the Government. But democratic governments are not wealthy enough to achieve anything alone (not unless you are a very ruthless corrupt government that suppresses its own people). Then I saw him as the Media Empire, who manipulate both political factions for their own financial gain. And then it eventually dawned on me that Lex Luther is, Rupert Murdoch! (Have I lost you yet?)Now how the hell did I come to this conclusion? The opening titles display the corporate logo from Warner Brothers. Now Rupert wanted to buy some of Warner's shares, but the board knew of his craziness and cried, 'NO WAY, JOSE'!' And Warner Brothers allows their filmmakers to express their own opinion, and maybe are happy for them to take a swipe at the old Grinch. Another crazy notion I have is that Lex worked overtime to create a distraction for the superheroes to combat each other, just like Rupert has distracted the population with political keyboard warfare. So while the fools (the Left and the Right) are battling each other, Rupert is at work making billions. And at some lavish library fund raising function, Lex makes a speech about philanthropists and the like, adding that, 'Books are knowledge and knowledge is power. The bittersweet pain among men is having knowledge with no power!' And there lies the problem when wanna-be politicians with plenty of money behind them spring up with crazy notions to make the World a better place with dangerous ideas, and fools jump in to give a helping hand. These fools don't have the knowledge, but those that do then don't have the power, and can only standby the muddy ocean banks watching the sinking ships. (The attack on the newspapers publishing fluffy pieces and leaving out the real juicy stories that matter was also a nice little sly attack.) Thrown into the elements of political pandemonium is the Feminist touch in the guise of Wonder Woman. She was a late entry, but added that extra political punch, ready for the next installment in this series. She helped the male ego driven superheroes take on the ever so powerful Super monster created by Lex. The more you blasted this Monster, the powerful it got, thriving on every explosion thrown its way. Just like Rupert continues to feed misinformation to the monsters, trolls and every other angry mob who want to lap it up to justify their ideology. Lex's supreme evil power and his monster could only be destroyed when the superheroes joined forces. Same case scenario in the world of reality, if both the main political ideologies joined forces they could rid of the powers-that-be who manipulate and destroy society to benefit itself. Then only can a decent conversation be held without misinformation and shouting matches.I can go on, but I'm sure I've already lost most of my readers after the first few paragraphs (maybe the first sentence). But my actual take on the movie? It's comic book action fluff, and it didn't need to be overlong. But loved the darkness of it, enjoyed the pain the superheroes carried around, and the battle sequences where enthralling enough.Okay, silly rant over, now back to reality",7,2,7,5 April 2016
Blade Runner," Sci-Fi art.
","Highly intelligent futuristic thriller that had the critics baffled on its initial release. The plot has your mind working overtime, (not like todays brainless studio movies), and the senses are dazzled by the spectacular photography, the stunning sets, the dreamlike effects and spellbinding music. It all comes together to make the greatest futuristic thriller. An experience on the big screen.",10,0,1,7 February 2003
The Truman Show," Under the careful direction of Weir, the annoying Jim Carey has delivered his best performance too date!!!
","Truman's life becomes the most watched TV show around the world. The only moral dilemma is that Truman does not know about it. He has been sold to the 'Corporation' from birth, where he has been used and abused as a tool for 'Product Placement'! Frightening as it may seem, this is occurring today under the disguise of Television entertainment run by million dollar corporations. What the Truman Show tells us is nothing new but reminding us not to become brainwashed victims.",8,0,1,21 January 2002
Heat," The great French director Robert Bresson would have surely given this the thumbs up!
","A cat and mouse game between the determine cop, Vincent, (Al 'GOD' Pacino) and the super mastermind criminal, Neil, (your Highness Robert De Niro). This little gem of a masterpiece lays down all the facts and figures before you, enabling the viewer to get an insight of the character's reasons and motivations. It takes its time, showing small but significant scenes to flesh out the characters into real humans.",10,0,0,22 February 2003
Jackie Brown," That Tarantino magic!
",A tale of double crossing and romancing of a different kind! Tarantino has a knack of being able to tell tall tales about unimportant people that you'll find fascinating through the strong performances by all. Pam Grier steals the show as the cool and sexy Jackie Brown.,8,0,1,6 August 1999
Hacksaw Ridge," Back on the battlefield with Mel...
","I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the clichÃ© violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded.",8,182,271,9 October 2016
