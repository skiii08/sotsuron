Hereditary," Hereditary Is Possibly The Most Terrifying Film Since The Exorcist??? WTH
","SO this is my first movie review ever and I had to write a review on this so called 'most terryifying movie since the exorcist' what a load of nonsense! Are these movie critics on crack or something? The movie is so long and dragged on for no utter reason, no actualy supernatural events takes place, nor is it scary. I would class this movie more as a psychological movie.When i heard about this film, i was very excited, thinking 'finally a movie worth to watch' however, i was left versy disappointed by the end of the movie. If only i could get back the time wasted watching the dreadful movie, if only! Note to movie critics - stop smoking crack!",1,2,8,23 August 2018
