Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Fourteen year old boys will find this amusing
","Poop and penis jokes abound. Being cruel to your fellow man is what it takes to be funny? Borat makes fun of people who may deserve it, some who richly deserve it, but it's done in the most mean-spirited way, I actually had sympathy for the poor buggers he was 'outing'! He way outdid them in the mean department.To gain a person's trust, then take advantage of it as a means to humiliate them is unconscionable. Would Ghandi, John Kennedy, Jesus, El Se√±or, any of the Dalai Lamas have endured this movie to the end? I'm sorry I didn't walk out the first time it occurred to me, but I kept thinking surely there is a message developing. But no. There wasn't.I am dismayed this movie gets such high marks. If you have an ounce of compassion for your fellow man, if you believe the whole random acts of kindness thing, don't waste your money. You will be embarrassed for your country, that this is what it takes to makes us laugh.",1,7,13,14 February 2007
