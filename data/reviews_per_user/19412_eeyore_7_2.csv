Casablanca," The Greatest Film of All Time!
",This Movie is arguably the greatest film of all time.  The events in the movie could take place as easily today as in 1942.  The love gone wrong that leads one person to be bitter for years and the realization that when things are seen through different eyes..its not always what it seems.I own the collectors version and the DVD....get the DVD.,10,0,0,16 October 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The best independant film ever?
","This movie is with out a doubt one of the best movies of the year and perhaps the best independant film ever. Despite the subtitles (which will keep some people from seeing it, like my wife) the movie was a masterpiece and the cinemotography was wonderful!  It was almost like watching a beautiful painting come to life right before your eyes.  The real test to understanding the movie, from the people I have talked to, is 'Can you figure out who is the Crouching Tiger and who is the Hidden Dragon'?This movie is a Must See for all who consider themselves movie lovers!",10,0,0,18 January 2001
