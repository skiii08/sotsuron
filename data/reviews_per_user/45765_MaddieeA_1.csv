The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Very disappointing adaptation
","Having just finished reading the book I thought I would buy the film as I absolutely loved it. I didn't realise I'd already caught the last 20 minutes about 6 weeks ago on TV. It's that different!!I know when you're reading you make your own assumptions about what characters look and sound like, but the actors were nothing like how I pictured them in my head, even their speech. I imagined Charlie to be a heck of a lot more awkward than he really was. Emma Watson was definitely not my 'Sam' and Patrick was so different, I really do agree with the people stating on here that he was too flamboyant in comparison to the book. I didn't find him (Patrick) as likable or approachable as a character as he was in the books, and I simply don't believe that Charlie would have felt as comfortable befriending him at the game in the book if he were the same way as in the film. The whole film felt rushed and I thought certain pivotal scenes from the book were handled terribly, or missed altogether - EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIS SISTER AND HER BOYFRIENDS?! The arguing in the car? Dad giving Charlie the sex talk? These would have made great viewing had it been done properly, if at all, and it's such a shame that these scenes weren't depicted in the film. Stephen Chbosky said he turned down multiple offers for a film because he 'owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book.', but this certainly does not do it justice. It's not even the case that the film was set in the 90's and none of the characters are relatable because they're not walking around with headphones on and a phone taped to their hands (as with many teenagers the same age in this generation). It's small things, like the fact that they chose to have 'Heroes' as the 'tunnel song' instead of 'Landslide' (which didn't work so wonderfully it was worth changing it in the first place).Personally, I don't know how I'd feel about this film had I seen it first and then read the book, but I do know I can't be the only person thoroughly disappointed with how the film has turned out. I have given it a 3 because I love Paul Rudd as Mr Anderson.",3,6,13,14 August 2016
