Child 44," Masterpiece
",As I can see the stars this movie is strongly under scored. I've seen it in the last days and there were some moments when I wished for some free minutes to relax because this whole movie is loaded with fear and hidden emotions. Professional acting and atmosphere! When you are seeing this movie you realize it was Europe. It had been happened. The time when this kind of things has happened was in the recently past!!! I recommend all of the people who would like to see a piece of real history. What humankind can do with life and what is the fear that could happen when war is realized. I hope this won't be actual in the immediate future.,9,18,47,1 May 2015
