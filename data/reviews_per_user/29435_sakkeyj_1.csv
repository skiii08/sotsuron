Howl's Moving Castle," Craptastic!
","Man, this film blows! After the awesome Spirited Away and spectacular Princess Mononoke, I watched this piece of junk and lost my faith in Miyazaki. I hope the old fart goes to retirement and lets his son carry on the legacy (or what's left of it). This might be a good movie to introduce yourself to Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli movies, but after seeing some other films, you will understand how bad this really is... (I heard that it is better the second time you see it... Maybe in a couple of months, I'll have another look..) That's about all I have to say about this film, but there seems to be a 10 line minimum of text to be written, so the rest of my review is just useless babble and complete waste of time... So... I would like to end this review by sticking a finger up my nose.",2,11,24,12 July 2006
