Marie Antoinette," A Two Hour Beautiful Bore
","This film starts off well enough with the great Marianne Faithful (in a wonderfully off-beat role, to be sure) as the Empress Maria Teresa of Austria sending her 14 year-old daughter, Marie Antoinette, off to France to marry the 15 year-old dauphin, Louis Auguste.But from there it's unfortunately downhill as far as this movie goes. The film quickly dissolves into a thick mush-like bog of beautiful nothingness, the likes of which I've never seen. Exquisitely beautiful Kirsten Dunst (who absolutely looks the part) stands around for most of the two hours of the film dressed up in the most gorgeous period clothes looking more like she's at a Vanity Fair shoot rather than acting in a major motion picture. I can't help but wonder if, with the right direction, Dunst might have pulled it off. But, evidently, Sofia Coppola is not the director to give Dunst the right direction. Coppola inexplicably fills the soundtrack with 1980's post-modern music updating (or juxtaposing, one is never sure) the 18th Century French court at Versailles. This has the undesired effect of further exacerbating the film's deficiencies and flaws.I thought it was cool how Coppola was able to obtain permission to shoot at Versailles and the Petit Trianon--both places where the real Marie Antoinette spent much of her life as Queen of France. But, unfortunately, these two structures have the odd effect of dwarfing Dunst down to the size of a miniature porcelain doll. A beautiful one, yes, but one that bears very little resemblance to anyone living or dead.And then comes the end of the film.WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS! The film just stops dead at the onset of the French Revolution. My mouth dropped open as the credits came up! Just about all the major dramatic (i.e., interesting) events in Marie Antoinette's life happen AFTER the period where the film ended! I just couldn't believe it! And still don't. What in the world could Coppola been thinking? Ah, well, at least my friends and I got to see the film at half price during the matinée.",Null,2,3,9 November 2006
Mystic River," Disappointingly tedious
","I really wanted to like this film, but the truth is I found it tedious and overwrought. Both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins grated on my nerves as they played their scenes in uber-soap opera style, alternately mugging, glowering and preening before the camera. I think both performances lack the subtlety of some of their previous works. For instance, Penn in 'Dead Man Walking' (directed by Robbins) and Robbins in 'Shawshank Redemption.' I found Kevin Bacon to be marginally better than his co-stars and I thought Marcia Gay Harden's performance was uniformly excellent and faultless. Eastwood's directorial style I found to be drab and the story itself highly unoriginal.I left the theatre feeling very disappointed and somewhat depressed, as the characters in this film are the type of people I'd want to avoid at all costs in real life and the sordid, ugly story nothing I'd ever want to experience.",Null,0,1,29 September 2004
Amélie," Exquisitely beautiful film
","Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet somehow brilliantly manages to make just about every shot in this hauntingly gorgeous film a work of art. Lead actors, Audrey Tatou and Mathieu Kassovitz are seemingly perfect in their respective roles. The cinematography, music and story blend all together in glorious synergy rarely seen in film. The music by Yann Tiersen matches the brilliance and beauty of the film. The fifth time I saw this film was just as exhilarating as the first. The film captures the viewer from almost the very first frame and sweeps you up into Amelie's alternately funny and bittersweet story with expert panache and style. It is a film not to be missed, in my opinion. Definitely in my top 10 favorite films of all time.",Null,2,6,29 September 2004
