Airlift," Good movie but overrated
","I was waiting to watch this after seeing ratings like 9. But after seeing I felt like why that much rating for a movie like this.. Even films like 3 idiots have a rating of 8.4 Nevertheless the rescue mission is really admirable. Acting was good particularly akshay delivers one of his best performance. Still it didn't reach my expectations. In the middle it looses it's grip... This real heroic mission is unmatchable, but it doesn't mean that this movie is excellent.. Acting-9 Direction-7 Story -8 but the execution far less in the movie.. Must watch for sure...but don't get misled by these high ratings.. 7 is more than enough for this",7,0,0,15 April 2016
Southpaw," Emotional rollacoaster...very well executed
","I knew whats coming my way when I was going to watch southpaw , that's the great thing about sports movies and boxing movies , you can predict and still you love watching it. I can term that as magic and nothing else.Story starts of with Jake playing as billy hope continues his reign as the champion and Rachel playing his wife happy with everything thats happening in there life , but one sudden night things falls of , and jake is left with nothing.The rest of the story is all about how he gets back with a bang.Jake is just awesome , i have always found him different but he definitely bags the best role in his career.Rachel mcadams does justice to her role too , and oona laurence as well as Forest whitaker does wonderful acting.All in all i would give 9/10 taking away one point because i knew whats happening , but other than that this is a winner.",10,0,0,15 April 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope and courage
","I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – 'hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies'!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!",9,0,0,15 April 2016
Happy New Year," Even srk couldn't save this..!
","The movie which is starring SRK is surely to be watchable. But this movie is too much boring from starting to the end.Everything is so predictable that u can tell it by seeing the previous scene.Usually Farah khan movie is good to watch because of its comedy timing and no humor is there.But sometime comedy means not only the physical comedy it also means the comedy diolauge which is truly lacking in this movie. The movie is good with its whole graphics thing,it looks too good,too colorful.But the story line is mixed up of 'Ocean 11/12' and it can't copy that exactly. I recommended that not watch this movie because its a total time waste of 3 hours but if u are a true fan of SRK then go watch it once for ShahRukh Khan.",4,1,1,15 April 2016
