The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped!
","With all the hype this movie is getting, you'd think this film would be the scariest movie ever created!  Yes, it was suspensful in many parts and I appreciate that.  Its a very rare quality among horror films these days. However, the ending was so dissapointing that I considered asking for my money back.  As a general rule, suspense should eventualy resolve into something substantial, otherwise you just p**s people like me off.  All I kept thinking was, 'I paid $6.50 for that ending... that sucks'  Do yourself a favor, wait till this one comes out on Video.  I imagine it won't take long before it ends up in the dollar discount rental section.  In the mean time, rent Evil Dead part 1 instead.  It's better in my opinion.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Minority Report," Nearly Perfect.
","My wife and I saw this film twice. We live in rural Appalachia and unfortunately, a lot of the people in the audience just didn't `get' this movie. I saw three couples get up and leave about half way through. One man mumbled `What a rip-off, this is boring' on the way out. Another couple plotted to break into Scooby Doo. That's more of a comment on the poor taste of rural Appalachians than of the quality of the movie. This film required thought to watch and some people just don't like to think.
MILD SPOILERS (not too many details, like a movie trailer)My wife and I both found the move totally thrilling. It is definitely not a mindless a `Triple X' or `Mission Impossible 2' type action flick. In fact, Spielberg's film is only part action. It also contains equal measures of sci-fi, and murder mystery. Much to our delight, the film succeeded on all three fronts. So many Sci-fi pictures fail because they don't paint a believable image of the future. Spielberg creates a very plausible future universe that is *ALMOST* devoid of annoying plot holes. The holes are so minor, that I didn't even notice them until the next day. His vision of the future is one segregated by classes, where the rich live in new, completely automated luxury apartments and cruise on elevated highways far above the old city. The middle class are still living in vinyl sided or brick faced two story houses in bland suburban neighborhoods. The poor are huddled into government build apartment complexes. Advertising has run rampant. Everyone has their eyes scanned whenever they walk by a talking billboard, shop at the GAP, and even when they get on the Subway. I take it the subway sends them a bill based on their retinal scan. Personal privacy in Spielberg's future world has been compromised to a believable degree. And that in itself is kind of scary.As far as action, there are plenty of cliff hanging, high speed chases. But the highlight was a fight on the conveyor belt or a 100% automated LEXUS plant where Cruise's character escapes by driving off in a car that ends up being built around him. That's clever! Most people were caught off guard by the resolution of the mystery, but they didn't complain. The mystery plot, like the rest of the film, was not all that far fetched, and a delight when finally revealed.Some of the scenes are quite beautiful. Drenched in brilliant white light or grey industrial skies, every scene from start to end is pure eye candy.  The female `precog', Agatha, is freaky to behold while lying in her `soup' bath (you'll understand) and even weirder when on the lamb.
There are so many GOOD things about this movie, so much attention to detail, that I can't possibly list everything that this film managed to do well. But there is one consistent fault Spielberg that he can't seem to shake--his incessant and predictable use of the `Hollywood ending.' In my opinion, it is the only thing holding Spielberg back from being a timeless director. In my opinion, the ending could have been way better. The film would have made more of an impact if it stopped twenty minutes earlier in the prison. The ending as it stands almost seems tacked on. I can't help but think that Spielberg did end the film where I thought it should end, but it didn't `test well' in group, so he re-wrote it. Perhaps a redneck or two at the screening test got up and walked out because it wasn't to their liking. Ah, well. All I can say is if the ending had been a little less predictable, I would have liked this film even more than I did. It gets a nearly perfect 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,23 June 2002
Underworld," Dialog Optional
","Beautiful sets, great atmosphere, nice uniforms, pretty people, but then that is what you would expect from this film's director, who was the art director for the movie Stargate.  Never during the entire film were we encouraged to really care for any of the main characters. Whenever Selene or her beau would get into danger, my immediate response was 'Oooo... pretty, but who cares?'  The film is comprised of visuals and action, a plot that could have used some more attention, and characters as shallow as a piece of cardboard. Whoever played the villain, Kraven, acted like he was on a Mexican soap rather than in a movie. I never once believed this guy would be in charge of a the vampire valet parking lot let alone a whole coven. What a whiney bad guy! Ick.  Kate Beckinsale did a fine job acting, but then again, the script didn't have her act very much. She broods well, but the lack of substantial character development outside of flashbacks meant that I couldn't really feel for her character at all. If you mute the sound, you'd get just as much out of watching this flick. Hence, this movie would be excellent projected on the wall of a noisy Goth club or behind a Goth band during a show.  You could easily turn it into a drinking game. Chug every time someone kicks in a door!  See the movie and you'll understand the joke. Better yet, wait for it on cable. Better yet, wait for it on TBS.  It will be on after or before the next Witchblade marathon.",5,0,0,23 September 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Good, but not great.
","I saw the original film years ago and admired it for it for the suspense and for the social commentary it made. It was much more than just a gore film. I only wished that it could have been better acted and have a bigger budget. This remake is much slicker than the original could ever be thanks to CGI and just-plain-better actors. However most of the social commentary and satire found in the original has been replaced by video-game style gore. The original contained many jabs at America's consumer-driven society. This film misses that boat entirely and is much shallower than the original. In my opinion, 28 Days is much scarier and more suspenseful BECAUSE of the social commentary it makes. You end up caring much more for the characters in 28 Days. In this remake of Dawn, you do end up caring very much about some of the characters, but there are too many people to keep track of and for that reason, some of the gore scenes miss out on the added emotional punch that existed in the original flick. This remake of Dawn of the Dead is not a stinker by any means. It's entertaining, I just think it could have been a lot more than what it was.  I wish someone would remake this again, only better.",Null,0,0,27 March 2004
Chicken Run," Animation eye-candy with a real plot everyone can enjoy.
","One of the best full length animation films I've ever seen.  Not only is the animation fluid, impressive, and pretty to look at, but there is a compelling plot behind it.  It's thrilling, yet suitable for kids, and not cheesy like most Disney films.  The writers of Titan AE should take a lesson on script writing from these guys. Chicken run gets a 10.",10,0,0,9 July 2000
Insomnia," Great Acting - Average Plot.
","Evidently this film is a Remake. I didn't know it. And I'm betting that the director of this film, Christopher Nolan (Memento), is banking that most Americans are like me; oblivious to the history of the film.Memento was a very original film which won over the critics, but unfortunately didn't fair well with mainstream America at the box office. Memento found its audience on pay per view and as a video and DVD. It is now a cult classic with educated movie fans and film students. There are a lot of folks who now WISH they would have seen the flick on the big screen. Hind sight you know.I mention all this because Christopher Nolan is a smart man, who probably wants a long movie career. Very few directors experience the level of critical success on what was only their second major movie ever. So here is Nolan, on the crossroads. He's won the minds of Americans (the critics, cultural elite, etc) now he has to win over the hearts of Americans. How, by making a relatively safe film that is accessible to most Americans.What's more 'American' than Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and serial killers? Not much.Insomnia is a good film. But it's a safe and predictable film. It's also a very commercial film, unlike Nolan's previous 2 creations. He's proven to the studios that he can make art, now he has proved that he can make money.It's your standard cops and robbers flick, but what makes the film stand out are the actors. Who would have thought that Robin Williams would succeed in his role as a very convincing killer?  He did a very good job which is almost worth the ticket price alone. And Al Pacino... man, they made him look 20 pounds too heavy and 30 years older--on purpose. He's supposed to be ragged looking and they do a great job. You can sum up the film as great actors, do great jobs in an average script. They did so well, that it saves the film. Anyone else, and this film would have fallen flat on its face because only the acting, and not the directing, kept it afloat.It's a slow film, not an action flick. But it is suspenseful. It gets a 8 out of 10 from me.",8,0,0,14 July 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I liked it. (Don't shoot me for doing so)
","Wow, I read a lot of the comments and was surprised by the amount of people who thought this movie sucked. I for one liked it.  Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) was amazing again. He's such a dynamic and captivating actor. All of the Matrix films have showcased his talent as an engaging villain. If anything, I think he's wasted on Lord of the Rings. I was riveted to my seat during the battle sequences. I felt for the characters fighting an impossible fight and the visual affects only enhanced those feelings. I didn't mind the philosophical dialog in any of the films, including this one.  People who showed up for the action seem to be particularly irritated by all the chatter.  True, the W Brothers are no Shakespeare or Cohen Brothers for that matter. The dialog *could* have been better, but I've seen a lot worse in many other films. I'd say that this Matrix is better than the second Matrix but I have to agree with most that this film can't hold a candle to the first Matrix.I think the thing that hurt the W Bros was their reliance on their video game and the Animatrix for providing a lot of back-story missing from the second and third film. I can see why some people who didn't rent the anime and the game would get confused about what happened to the Oracle, why that kid keeps following Neo around, etc. They took a gamble and judging from all the people stating they were confused, I don't think it paid off the way they were expecting.I've bought the second Matrix on DVD and watched it a few times now and as a result, I've caught a lot of things that I've missed. This Matrix, I have no doubt, will have a similar affect on me when I buy it on DVD. The W Bros should take this as a sign that they need to learn a better way to explain their epic stories to an American viewing audience that needs it handed to them on a platter with a note and lit sparklers sticking out of it. The movie is surprisingly deep, full of amazing visuals, and nearly wraps up all the lose ends but not all of them. Why not? Judging from the past, the W Brothers may continue the Matrix story in other mediums like comic books, games, or even more anime. I don't think they're done yet, and perhaps that is why some people didn't like this movie. It's not a completely open and shut book.  It's an ending with question marks that only some people can see, depending on how aware of the matrix they have become :-)Overall, I give the film a B+",8,2,4,9 November 2003
Knowing," Sci-Faith Flick That I Liked
","SPOILERS First off, the director of this movie also did a little flick called Dark City in 1998. That movie never hit it big in the box office but became a huge cult classic in rental stores among sci-fi fans, and rightly so. In that movie, director Alex Proyas presents the audience with a gripping, intriguing yet pretty standard hitchcockian thriller for the first part of the movie. Then, blam! Aliens! The entire city is located in space! The hero has psychic powers? And the prophecies, oh the prophecies! Knowing has a lot of similarities to Dark City. First off, the sun plays an important part in both flicks. Knowing, like Dark City, starts off as a gripping and thoroughly spooky thriller. The first time I saw the 'whispering people', I got chills. The mystery of the numbers had me glued to the screen. Then the disasters started--and I have to say, they use some of the most realistic special effects I've ever seen on film. They were horrifying, and simultaneously beautiful to watch--and they had a purpose. Without them, the main character would not have the motivation he needed to complete his character arc.Then the aliens are revealed. Strange, disconcerting, out of left field--all this is true, but then again, that's the point! All of this was also true of Dark City and the sci-fans all liked that twist. Here, people think its jumping the shark? The only thing I can think of is that the special effects are so good in Knowing, that sci-fi fans blame the studio or re-writes or big budget bloating for the alien ending. Meanwhile the same twists in Dark City were pulled off on a smaller budget, and everyone thought it was genius.Unlike Dark City, this movie deals with faith, predetermination, and religion. This may of turned off a lot of people in on both sides of the religion fence. Science minded people may have resented the role of religion in the film, and religious people may have resented the inference that the four horsemen of the apocalypse were aliens, and that the aliens looked like they had halos and angel wings. I didn't mind the blending of science and religion, which is why I feel I could better appreciate the film.The inevitable final disaster was absolutely flooring, and again, the cinematography and special effects were stunning. It conjured up references to Superman and the end of Krypton--or of the 1950's classic, When Worlds Collide.I thought this movie was simply fantastic. It plot wasn't standard by any sense of the word, and that may have upset some folks. It's a journey, that's for sure. But I, personally, enjoyed the journey. 9/10 (better than 90% of sci-fi out there: better than Indiana Jones IV's alien ending, better than Star Wars Episode I, way better than the directors other flick--I Robot, better than day V for Vendetta, Better than Cloverfield)",9,1,3,12 July 2009
Spirited Away," Brilliant, but I can understand why some people get 'confused'
","This is some of the best hand-drawn animation you'll ever see--period. Unfortunately, the plot seems to befuddle a lot of Americans and I don't know why. Why can't American audiences grasp that this entire film is simply a parody of Alice in Wonderland translated for eastern audiences.  If you liked Alice in Wonderland, with all of it's bizarre characters and nonsensical plot diversions, then this movie should be somewhat familiar to you. Also, in the east, cartoons are not just for kids. That's slowly becoming true in the USA as well, thanks to Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. The only cultural hint some Americans might need to completely understand the film is this: There is a Chinese legend in which some dragons decided help out human farmers by bringing them rain clouds and for this, the dragons were punished by the Jade Emperor. The dragons escaped, and decided to become rivers so they could help human farmers forever, safe from the Jade Emperor. --there, that hint should make the ending of the film a bazillion times more logical for you Americans who don't know anything about eastern cultures.  The rest of the film is straight forward fantasy.",Null,1,3,24 May 2004
Vanilla Sky," Be Prepared to Think.
","I like this film because it makes you think. It is in no way a standard feel good film or action flick in the traditional sense. The trailers for the film are rather misleading because none of them mention anything besides the fact that Cruz, Cruise, and Diaz are in it.A lot of critics hated this film because of the plot. Perhaps that's why the studios didn't advertise it. However, judging from the reviews of other people on this site, this film has found an appreciative audience.Vanilla Sky challenges the viewer to figure out what is real and what is not. Its plot is a close cousin of films like Jacobs Ladder, The Others, Mullholand Drive, Fight Club, Lost Highway, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense. All of these films play off the concept of alternate realities. If you like films that make you wonder if you're living a dream, then check out this film.My only personal qualm with the film is that, if you take it literally, you have no reason to fear death and therefore can do horrible things to others, and to yourself, and somehow be a better person because of it. That is... IF you have enough money. I don't think this something the director or writer was purposefully trying to portray, but that's what I got out of the film, among other, less selfish things. All this means that the director didn't have a concise vision for the film. Vanilla sky is a spooky, eerie, thought provoking film. But because of a jumbled vision, the film will not be a classic. It COULD have been better but it's not bad at all. I give it 80% out of 100%. Better than average but not A material.",8,0,0,14 July 2002
Donnie Darko," Like DUH, it WAS in the 80's
","This comment is in response to some of the people who thought the movie failed or was in some way lacking because it had an 80's vibe. All I have to say is, the movie WAS SUPPOSED to look 80's, use 80's music, and have an 80's vibe because it takes place in the 80's. If any of you paid attention, you would have picked up on this during the various references to Dukakis running for president! But hey, hardly any of us ever pay attention to presidential politics anyway, right. I mean, one of the smallest percentages of the population in election history managed to get off their butts and vote in the last election so I should expect such oversights.  Geeze, more people need to vote.Anyhow.History lessons aside, I heard a lot of good things about this movie. So I rented it on DVD and was happy to say that it lived up to its reputation. Its more of a sci-fi thriller with non-linear story telling than a horror flick. Although, it is definitely spooky enough to make you want to sleep with the night light on.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark films that make you think.",9,0,0,13 March 2003
