Skyfall," not bad, watchable
","Hi guys, I am not a Bond fan. But I wanted to see this movie last Saturday because some scenes were shot in Istanbul which I came across during my visit in April 2012. Generally, it is a nice action movie that maintains the level of excitement about all the time. However, there are some instants in the movie that really can drive you crazy. Here are some that I can remember: 1. M. really did screw, everybody is against her, the enemy gets inside the MI6 and she stills keeps saying 'don't worry I'll fix this' and nobody is authorized to dismiss her. This is stupid. Bond also hates her, because he could have died after the shooting on the train. However, he offers his obedience to that stupid unsuccessful MI6 leader like a child. 2. There are some instants that both Silva and Bond get the chance to kill each other several times but they prefer to postpone their chances till the end of the movie. For example, in the underground Bond chases him climbing the ladders but he prefers chatting with him 'bla bla bla' instead of killing him. However in the end of the movie he throws a knife at the back instead of chatting him. Maybe he is a coward. 3. Silva the baddie keeps killing people relentlessly until the last scene where he shows remorse against both the old hunter and M.. Come on guys! What was that? He misses the hunter, unbelievable! He should have put at least two bullets in their heads and Bond should have died in a couple of seconds after he fell into the frozen lake. That would be more realistic.If you ignore those silly mistakes the movie is great:))",7,2,7,5 November 2012
Darkest Hour," Don't exaggerate
","A biography movie about the days following Winston Churchill's assignment as the prime minister of Britain. I think the movie is a bit exaggerated. It merely consists of close-up scenes to Churchill who is played by Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman is indeed very successful in impersonating Churchill, especially the way he smokes cigars, drinks whiskey together with his sluggish movements are fascinating. But come on guys, that's all about it. I even got a little bored towards the end of movie. I think some people take it too seriously. Maybe they are craving for a national hero. If they ask me that is not Churchill but those left alone in Calais. 7 points overall for Gary Oldman's performance.",7,0,3,4 February 2018
The Hateful Eight," An expert in non-annoying exaggeration
","I think this movie is one of the best movies of Tarantino. By time he has become an expert in non-annoying exaggeration. Maybe he has corrected himself after my Django review in which I had warned him. Here are some reasons why I like this movie a lot. I've already watched it twice and I think I'll watch it more. The opening score is excellent thanks to Ennio Morricone. The close-up to the crucified Jesus is also very nice. The characters are all unique and they are given almost equal importance with respect to one another. This is achieved not only by the script but also by the outstanding performance of actors.As well as Tarantino touch is concerned, I can't pass without mentioning some of them since I have already checked the spoiler alert. The craving of John Ruth before asking for permission to see the Lincoln letter; the Lincoln letter itself; the close-up to the two horses white and black in front in slow motion with a great snowy view in the background; the broken door of haberdashery and nailing it each time again and again; Minnie's struggle to speak French; the great diversity of the slang terms and accents used all throughout the movie; the Mexican himself; the laughters of Samuel L. Jackson; the way Chris Mannix eats the stew; the long final scene; the fabulous ending; the two snowshoes behind Lady Domergue when she is being hung.As I mentioned these Tarantino touches wouldn't be so impressive without these actors, namely, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. I would like to congratulate them all.",9,2,8,24 January 2016
The Revenant," Leonardo di Wasted
","What the hell? Are you kidding me? This is just a miserable survivor movie. The misty atmosphere is cool but it is not enough to make a movie. LDC is really wasted here. Anyone can play his role, there is no particular acting when compared to LDC's any other movie. He is just crawling on the ground and murmuring. Wow what a performance! I am really astonished! In terms of technical details there are a lot of goofs. The fight with the bear is overly exaggerated. No one can survive such an attack in those conditions. In one scene he is dragging his left leg and in another scene the right one. There are many similar issues regarding his survival. Through the end of the movie, Fitzgerald easily loots the captain's safe which is ridiculous. And finally in the ending, Glass sacrifices everything to kill Fitzgerald but what a coincidence that there are readily available cutthroats just 10 meters downstream and he wants the leave this pleasure to them. Haha it really did make me laugh! Ohh was I supposed to cry, sorry guys but I laughed my a** off!!",5,2,4,2 February 2016
Hugo," Could not like it, sorry.
","Hi, I saw this movie yesterday in a good cinema, I got a maxi popcorn and a coke. Everything was great at the beginning but something hindered me to get inside the movie. I tried a lot but one second I was inside and the other not. When I first saw the poster of the movie, I thought it was going to be like 'Polar Express' ,that is, a boy having fantastic adventures. I think it is because there were more than one leading actor in the film. An instant it is about an orphan boy, but later it turns to be the story of the shopkeeper who has very annoying attitudes. The station guard was cool, but all these stories were short and interrupted. As one of them is developing, it is cut in the middle and the other begins. In addition to these, those long scenes about Melies'es old movies are a little boring. After I got home, I searched about Melies and found that he really existed:) Now I am definitely sure that the movie was just a homage to Melies and nothing more.Another thing is that the movie was in English that came to me a bit strange because I lived in France for 2 years and never saw local people speaking English with each other. Introducing Paris in English definitely does not work. 'Midnight in Paris' was better in that. Sorry but I gave 6/10.",6,4,12,11 December 2011
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Hobbit or Smurf?
","I think this is the worst movie of LOTR+Hobbit series. I found it very annoying and boring. The talents and the luck of hobbits are greatly exaggerated as if in a smurf or Tom&Jerry cartoon. Well, at the beginning of the movie, there was no flashback of the previous episode so I began to think that this was an independent adventure. As one year passed over the previous Hobbit movie and unless you are a keen JRR fan, there is no way to remember where the last episode ended. There are many ridiculous things in the plot. Why did Gandalf disappear when he was needed most at the entrance of that scary forest? Why did he met with the other nutty sorcerer inside the cave of a mountain? And why did Gandalf told him not to follow him after a short while? How did all those hobbits survived the giant spiders without a scratch? It was an insult to Frodo's legendary fight against the spider in LOTR. What was the fight against that dragon? Come ooooon!!! It was 100 times larger than Balrog and those super witty hobbits succeed to dip it inside a huge 5000 Celsius gold bath again without getting a scratch. And this was an insult to Gandalf's legendary fight against Balrog. During all this time, the scenes were interrupted, the fight against the dragon was interrupted at least 10 times because of the stupid chase in the lake city. I don't even want to mention the fight between the orcs and hobbits along the river and the one between the elf and big orc chief in the lake city in which the orc chief should have cracked all his bones. They all deteriorated the charm of the LOTR trilogy. The director should very well read these comments and pull himself together. He may be a great director but he should remember that he is not making independent movies. He is making episodes that are connected to each other and he should not be fooled by the number of spectators.",5,11,17,22 December 2013
Django Unchained," It should have ended much earlier!!!!
","Hi guys! I am a mediocre Tarantino fan and I wanted to see this movie because of the name DiCaprio. Everything started very well as expected from Tarantino. The way DiCaprio introduced was excellent. Samuel L. Jackson was also very good. To be honest, I was in favor of DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In my opinion, the best scene was when DiCaprio cornered Dr.King and Django on the dinner table. Oh my god! That was awesome. That is where the tension in the movie raised to the peak and in my opinion that is the place where the movie should have ended. He should have kicked all their asses, hammered the girl and Django. However, after that point, Tarantino insistingly extends the scenes and succeeds to turn the tension he just created into boredom. Sorry guys but I got so bored and disappointed afterwards. How can he let DiCaprio get killed? That is ridiculous. What is all that handshaking stupidity? Would you look at that? Someone like DiCaprio forgot to search them for additional pistols. Sorry guys but I got so mad at Tarantino for taking us for a fool. Afterwards the movie continued as a superhero movie. And that part was for children under 13. It was like a torture to me. Tarantino messed it all up. I gave all 7 points for Leonardo DiCaprio and not for Tarantino. I hope he knows that.",7,0,2,4 February 2013
Get Out," Mind blowing !
",I decided to see this thriller movie when I saw it got 8.1 on IMDb.com. It is about a black man being chased into a strange family living in a spooky house in countryside. What makes the film interesting is that the suspense is maintained till the end. The plot is very well written and realistic. The film is regular paced without any boring scenes and it follows a logical sequence. All the conversations are related to the subject. The Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor. I did not know him before. But I can tell he is very promising and we should definitely see him again in other great movies. It goes without saying that Jordan Peele is very successful both as a writer and as a director. Overall performance of the cast is very good. Congratulations to them all. This is how a movie is shot!!!,9,10,19,28 April 2017
Prisoners," Remarkable production
","I rarely write reviews about movies I have seen on TV and this is one of them. It was screened on a Turkish channel twice consecutively for early and late sleepers. At the first time, I could see the last ten minutes of the movie and it was pretty tense. Although I had seen the ending, I started to watch the second one from the beginning. Shortly, the performance of all the actors and actresses, including the children, are perfect. There are absolutely no plot holes. The pace of the movie is kept constant all the time such that it is not altered to maintain the suspense as in cheap movies. Instead the suspense is maintained by the plot itself and the performance of the cast which is why this movie is so good. Congratulations to makers of this movie.",9,0,0,14 February 2019
Everest," Exciting despite defects
","Films about adventures in extreme conditions like space, underwater, desert are already evoking expectations as we are ready to buy whatever we are served. This is definitely one of them. The scenery is great, I wonder how much of it belongs to real Everest. The pace of the film is regular and gets into the subject without boring romantic stories. Some shortcomings, however, do exist concerning technical issues. For example, in most of the movie the mountaineers were wearing ordinary sunglasses or nothing at all to protect their eyes. I was expecting that they wore goggles and balaclava at all times. They might have been purposefully removed so that we could distinguish the characters. Whatever, it is easy to criticize this way. Other than this, in my opinion the ordeal of surviving in extreme conditions could have been augmented even further. Despite all these, it is rewatchable and deserves an 8/10.",8,0,0,13 January 2020
Joker," Way Overrated!
","Here we have yet a freaky story of a delusional crackpot. I don't understand why it is so exaggerated. Maybe people feel a great deal of empathy with that lunatic. However, it should be remembered that playing an over the edge character such as this lunatic is much easier than playing a true character. Any above-the-average actor can do that. I don't want to criticize whether it was inspired by Martin Scorsese films or not. Today, most films are inspired by others. There are thousands of films, and it is almost impossible not to find a common point with an older film of the same genre. The only specialty about this one is that it forays into airs of American musicals from 50s and 60s. Considering the lame ending which is readily predictable from the trailer, there is nothing much left to me a few days later. It is definitely not rewatchable and does not worth more than 7.0/10.",7,2,7,24 October 2019
Cloud Atlas," a bit too long
","Hi guys, I watched the movie yesterday with the only knowledge that it was produced by Waschowski brothers and nothing else so I was not so much prejudiced.The film, in my opinion, was a bit too long to describe the main topic of what the whole thing is about. It takes some time to realize that the lives of different persons living in different times and places (or planets) are connected somehow. After you realize this, you keep looking for something new. But nothing else happens. And in the end it terminates with the classical conflict between status quo and rebellions.In addition to this, the music was very similar to the one in 'Polar Express' which I watched more than 5 times.Sorry guys but I gave 6/10. I could have given more if it was shorter and had an impressive ending. I hope they did not waste so much money in it.",6,1,6,5 November 2012
The Martian," Partially Interesting
","I saw this film yesterday. The poster of the film is highly related to what is all about. An astronaut, Matt Damon, is trying to survive on Mars after his crew has left without taking him. The scenery of Mars came to me very interesting as we have never seen it before. It was very bright even brighter than many places on earth. As well as getting attracted by the charm of a science fiction movie, I also found some technical issues that clung to my mind. I want to list them here because this film is supposed to be more realistic than Star Wars or Alien.First, astronauts are walking on Mars as they walk on earth. Is there no difference in gravity? Are they exactly the same? I thought they would bounce like on Moon. Second issue is about the pressure and air inside where they live. They have a huge place and plenty of air that fills it. Outside there supposed to be a strong vacuum due to very low space pressure and this pressure difference is not well reflected in the film. When Mark blows up the Hab he uses a tarp(!) to seal the entrance instead of a huge metal door. That was unbelievable. Further, he inflates the hab again with plenty of air and adjusts the pressure to that of earth's so that he can take off his helmet. After all these, there is only a little swelling on the tarp door. Other than these, the thunder on Mars came to me a bit exaggerated. There shouldn't be such strong atmospheric conditions.As far as actors' performances are considered. Matt Damon is as good as he can be. Jessica Chastain is charming. Jeff Daniels plays a dull and carefree administrator of NASA. He is good if that is what he is supposed to play. Donald Glover plays an arrogant researcher named Rich and he teaches the head of NASA that spacecrafts can do gravitational slingshot as they turn around planets which everyone knows from documentaries. I reduced some points due to these silly mistakes. I gave 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,24 October 2015
