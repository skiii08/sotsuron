The King's Speech," Splendid film intelligently made
","Let me put it this way... I went to the preview and at the end the entire audience stood up and clapped. Clapping a film!!!!!!! Funny, enthralling, well directed and edited and a great cast. Loved Beethoven's 5th on the soundtrack. A bit dark in places and I suspect the queen mum-to-be was a lot more acerbic and nouveau Rich. Great fun to guess who was who, Timothy Spall a great Churchill, a moving portrayal by Michael Gambon as George V. The beautiful misty photography was so appreciated. I wish they had taught history in this way when I was at school. Geoffrey Rush was magnificent as the ham Australian actor/therapist and you become so involved with the story line. I love this film and my hat is ready to be eaten if it doesn't win an Oscar.",10,0,1,4 January 2011
