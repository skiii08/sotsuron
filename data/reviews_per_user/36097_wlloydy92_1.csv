The Rock," in my top 10!
","This movie is a fine piece of work. It has a great cast accompanied by a very satisfactory storyline. This movie is very much underrated with critics focusing on the very few bad points on this film, and not focusing on the many excellent points of the film which defiantly outweigh the bad. The acting is superb! Cage is very convincing as the character Stanley Goodspeed, and makes you care about the characters ending. Sean Connery is great as he always is, making little if not no faults in this movie. The soundtrack to this film was also remarkable, which was putting the icing on the cake for me. overall i rate it 9/10 based on the plot, acting and soundtrack a must see movie!",9,2,3,26 September 2008
