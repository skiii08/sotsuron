Ford v Ferrari," My sympathies for this movie..
","I see a lot of cliche.. drama which slows the movie & didn't connect me with any of the characters.. the end was super duper stupid..
Why is there a good or evil? Everyone's in a race..
And movie made me to think - why people spend billions of dollars for a race just for fun robbing oil from other countries? Lol!",1,6,17,11 February 2020
First Man," Felt like I would threw up in the hall! Sick movie!
","Nothing in this documentary for viewers. Lack luster premises, dull acting with one expression face, no good dialogues, horrible zoomed in shots with shaky camera, no enthusiasm, no physics or maths, very less related to the training or preparation of going to moon, unnecessary family scenes, relationships with zero connection and stretched out concepts.
It gives a message that Neil Armstrong didn't have any enthusiasm, he carried on his going as a boring office job! They're never seen discussing anything related to planning the travel. Seriously, I plan and discuss with friends more while travelling within my country. Also, why is everyone zoomed in while talking? It's freakingly irritating. Thanks to the movie, I can't forget their faces ever in my life.
Why is the entire documentary so sad?
Another important message is humans are really disgusting! After piling up in earth, they set first foot in moon to throw away a plastic bracelet there! (What the heck! Like seriously why?)
Is it a rule to bind every astronaut with someone's loss?
This documentary is worst than the worst movie's list I had. When you make bad movies with an awesome concept, you're the worst director!",1,5,12,20 October 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Woah! What a movie!!!
","Terrific! Amazing movie! What a story, performances, sequences! Terrific!!
Loved it!!!!",10,0,1,25 February 2019
It," Disappointed, wasted time.
","Desperate effort to make bunch of kids look cool without any particular story, dialogue or acting. Entire movie with missing kids where the adults aren't anywhere, & kids act like super adults.
One of the most non sense movies. The clown is the worst. It's not scary or funny but irrational many times which irritates a lot.",1,2,2,28 December 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," Cliche Cliche Cliche!!
","Cliche & boring!! She would be an outcast, she will get a job, she'll do good, she'll go to Paris & then leave it. I knew all of it beforehand. Meryln is as usual amazing but she's not a hell boss, that's an alien coz her demands were almost impossible everytime. I wish I could get my 1.5 hours back.",3,3,4,4 July 2019
The Lion King," Nostalgia + CGI
","Visuals are just the best! They're as real as you can think till today. Story is also same, so it's good.
Only cons I feel is the voice overs, which are not as connecting & with emotions as they should have been.
What I enjoyed the childhood emotions coming back in all scenes.
I loved the animated version since childhood times & have watched it dozens of times. I'm going to watch it again this weekend. Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€° This is also good.",7,1,5,23 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Terrific! Scary! Awesome movie!!!
","Pin drop silence in the entire theatre all time of the movie! What a movie, direction, acting especially Emily... I'm an Emily fan now!
I'm getting chills even while thinking about it. 
I don't know what to write just - What a movie!!!",10,2,6,12 April 2018
Coco," No words.. loved it!!
","This movie is based on beautiful Mexican tradition regarding life after death & family values. It will make you laugh, cry & amaze all at the same time. High points are the animation, story, dialogues, screenplay, songs.. I think it's one of the best animated movies since long. Very good for kids so that they understand the importance of family.. 
Gracias Pixar :)",10,0,1,25 January 2018
Hotel Mumbai," Heart wrenching movie..
","Yes, we've seen this all in live news while Taj was burning down. Movie is really good. It explained what all happened & how it did. Terrorism is a big issue now globally & Firing an innocent crowd just coz one has gun, doesn't make him a man.
Felt really bad for everyone who suffered. Wish this world becomes peaceful.",10,1,15,2 November 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Direction, acting & the Laden's shot
","Superb! The climax is just too good. Actors have acted well, direction also superb.",8,0,0,17 May 2020
Joker," Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix!
","Mind-blowing masterpiece! What a performance... Pure art in movie theatre. I'm speachless!!! I'll definitely go and watch again. Brilliantly performed!
We all have been alone at some point of time in life, think about those who've been nobody forever.
Brilliant - one word.
MASTERPIECE ðŸ¤¡",10,2,3,11 October 2019
Parasite," Too unreal
","When your daughter is stabbed or your son is unconscious, you won't focus on other's expressions or a man's smell. If you do, either you're a fake parent or mentally unstable.
This movie has very unreal scenes.
If you are nice, why are you eating other's jobs? If you are not nice, why are you letting old household inside?
This movie shows lower class people as dirty parasites, scheming & looting others. I don't think everyone is like this.Poor people can stab others but rich people can't even talk about a body smell?? That too with their wife, in private??? You listening to their private conversation in intimate moments, reading personal diaries, lying about yourself is alright because you are poor?You can't stand anybody peeing in front of your house but feel bad when your boss doesn't feel right about your smell.Carrying a rock alone in that basement was really stupid.
This movie made no sense at all after second half. I'm torn that joker didn't get Oscar.",1,16,43,17 February 2020
Black Panther," Boring, no acting, no actions & no story! Don't watch, you'll be frustrated!
","First of all, I'm confused, who were the lead pairs? Because 99% of the cast delivered their dumbest acting ever! And the so called king & queen were most disappointing.
Second, the story! Phew! WTF was it - any of the scenes DO NOT lead to any conclusion at all. They are in Waganda, they go out to South Korea & they're back to Waganda. Instead of saving the world, the dumb people just fight with each other - to become king. 
Third - Who the hell is Black Panther? Any guy who can have the purple drink? What are his powers? Why is he called Panther, why not tiger or Cat or Girraffe? How come everyone in world is kind of Ok with BP?
Fourth - Why is everyone so dull? No energy except the negative characters and Okoye! Why aren't dialogues impactful instead of lengthy & boring?
Fifth - Why is technology overhyped? Making remarks like another broken white guy always showing that they're waaaaaayyy ahead from entire world. Why? It's neither used in Waganda nor outside. It's nowhere shown technology being used for their people.
Seventh - Connection? Where is it? Why are they crying talking about his dad but no conmexconn shown between them?Eigth - Why the fuck is this movie over hyped? How come 7.9/10. Thor was 8/10. 'Thor!' No comparison!! Are you fucking kidding me? People are giving bad reviews but 6/10 & 7/10. Why? 
Marvel has first time dissapointed so badly! I never thought after Thor3 that it could ever happen.",1,12,19,1 March 2018
