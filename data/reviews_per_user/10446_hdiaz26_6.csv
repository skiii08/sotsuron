The Ring," A new fresh air for American horror movies
","This movie for me is not the scariest movie i have ever seen, i think there's just no such a movie that really scares you a lot (it depends on what can make you scare, people always is different so its obvious it doesn't scares everyone).The power of the film is not on the scares, is a horror movie with a complex plot that everything means something, and you have to understand it, the mystery is very interesting to follow, something i highly like is the way they treat the horror.The acting is good, especially Naomi Watts, she can handle a horror film very well, we also see how her character evolves (something not seen in horror movies today).The story here is about the tape, the mystery and the puzzle we have to figure out, the character development is not so great, because the story demands it, of course we see some, but getting to know a lot of the characters just wouldn't fit with the story.The direction and photography are very well done, some visuals are very impressive and intriguing.I'll recommend this movie to horror fans, this movie doesn't compare with Hollywood's recently 'horror' movies, some people will like it, some people don't.Its a great effort of actually do something new with horror movies, i know is a remake, but this is to prove that Japan Cinema is more interesting that the one from Hollywood.Some people just don't like this movies, because they're so unbelievable to them, but the supernatural and the no real things is what interests most of the people.Enjoy the experience of seeing 'The Ring'.9 out of 10",9,0,0,6 December 2002
Spider-Man 2," A good movie, but I was expecting more
","I really can't tell that I didn't like this movie, but I also can't say that I like it a lot, I have mixed feelings about it.The effects of the film are better than the first one, although they still have some problems.The acting its pretty much the same as the first one, Tobey Maguire is ok, I've seen Kirsten Dunst acting better than this, James Franco is somewhat annoying this time, Alfred Molina is very good at the beginning but gets somewhat underused after that, Rosemary Harris is once again one of the best aspects of the film and J.K. Simmons is very funny in this one.The script is very aimed to kids and teenagers, is full of unbelievable dialogue (similar to Smallville and Dawson's Creek lines), especially that 'Go get 'em, tiger' line, the movie lacks any menace from the villain and it doesn't take the characters to the next level, basically the first hour tells us how bad Peter's life is, that was set in the first one so I don't see the need of using one hour to tell us the same, again the villain is not very well set (like the Goblin), they're just there because it is needed to continue the story.The directing was a little better, but very similar to the first one, I was hoping a little more action, menace, and suspense moments, but we don't get that.I also have problems with the ending, which is somewhat overdone and unbelievable, very 'happy' ending to me.At the end the movie is entertaining, and when the action comes is memorable, but I was expecting more, I still think the first one was a little better.7/10",8,0,0,4 July 2004
Spider-Man," With Great Power comes Great responsibility
","I saw the movie last week, and it was good, funny, entertaining, but of course it had a lot of plot holes and it was predictable.However it has all the elements that a movie needs to be a success.The script is sometimes bad, the writer David Koepp wrote it 9 times, because San Raimi wasn't sure of it.This isn't a masterpiece, but overall is just good, the acting was so so, Kirsten Dunst has do a lot of better work than this. Tobey Maguire is good as Spider-Man, i truly believe his nerd character, i suspect he was like this when he was younger i don't know i feel it.The first part for me is the best, that is the part that gives my 8 rating, the second part wasn't very entertaining and was very predictable.Rating: 7 of 10",8,0,0,24 May 2002
War of the Worlds," And underrated movie
","War Of The Worlds (2005) is very hated, simply by the fact it doesn't follow the established rules in sci-fi and alien invasion movies and because its directed by Steven Spielberg.The movie takes a different approach focusing only in one family and the unbelievable events that they experience, yes, they're unbelievable because that's simply the point, this is a reference to the 9/11 attacks, that event was truly unbelievable, who could ever believe those devastating events would happen.Spielberg brings us a film about devastation, not a blockbuster summer film, a film which shows how far a human being can go to save his life, a depressing film that does not focus in a worldwide event, but in a intimacy that represents us, we see what they see, we are with them.The invaders just are here to show how weakened the human race is, the ending of this invaders is the same as the book, not your typical America or another country saves the world.The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions, you can make theories if you want, the confusion and mis-information will be around of us if this events actually happened.It does have a few flaws at the end, I think that with a polished script and a better ending, would make this a classic.For now its a very good movie, if you're not expecting your typical summer film.9/10",8,0,2,15 July 2005
Inception," INCEPTION is an incredible labyrinth that lures us into the world of the subconscious, and ends up being a dream not to be missed.
","INCEPTION Is an original, cerebral, smart film, only Nolan could create something like this, the level of detail and creation of the world of the dream, the rules, the problems that they face, the level changes, everything left me simply impressed.It may be a little confusing but it kept me at the edge of my seat amazed at what was happening on the screen, all the actors where excellent (Ellen Page was a little off), the music, direction, cinematography and visual effects are all first rate.When the movie ends you're still thinking about it, the ending is a little ambiguous and heavy on debates, similar to those of Blade Runner.Maybe the only thing that I didn't like was that DiCaprio's character was the only one developed, and I would've liked to know more about each person of the team.INCEPTION is an incredible labyrinth that lures us into the world of the subconscious, and ends up being a dream not to be missed.9/10",9,2,5,21 July 2010
Fantastic Four," Fantastically Bad
","Fantastic Four I went to F4 expecting a bad movie, but what I got was even worse, the film is an inept attempt in the comic book genre.Tim Story for who knows what reason direct this highly anticipated movie, the result is a lack of focus and bland direction, focusing more on the jokes than anything else.The acting was nothing memorable, obviously almost everyone is miscast- ed here, are we really supposed to believe that this people are scientists?, because I didn't believe it at all, the only one that showed some strong acting was Michael Chiklis, his role is also the only one that its kind of developed.The script is full of one-liners and 'funny' moments that really add nothing to the film, the development of the characters is non-existent and the plot just flows because of the editing.The villain is underdeveloped, just there for the purpose of filling the 2 hours.The movie is way aimed to kids and teenagers, reminds me of the Power Rangers movie which is also of FOX.This doesn't compare with X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman Begins, its a shame to even be compare with that, it's actually worse that Daredevil and Hulk.I recommend you to watch the cartoons or read the comic book, they're better than this.4/10",4,13,28,9 July 2005
