Casablanca," Still in love with this film
","What can I say as it has all been said before? I must have watched this film 40 times - bless you TCM!! I never tire of it & usually notice some extra little nuance each time I watch it. You simply must see it, it is streets ahead of just about every other film despite having no colour, special effects etc., etc. Apparently the script was written as the movie was shot & made on a tiny budget yet it is an all time great. This illustrates just how important writing, acting & plot are to a film. Effects or stars alone cannot make a good film but this is where Casablanca excels, despite the cardboard airplane model the brilliance shows! The plot has everything in it & the acting & dialogue are superb. Every emotion is there somewhere & you can't fail to be stirred or the hairs on the back of your neck raised! See it - believe me you'll love it. You may even shed a tear or two.",Null,0,0,30 April 2001
