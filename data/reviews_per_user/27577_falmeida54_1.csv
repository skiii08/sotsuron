Blade Runner 2049," Boring with 'dead' characters
","It seems unbelievable that the first (very good) Blade Runner has 8.2 rating and this one (boring and with 'dead' characters) is 8.4 ... there is something wrong with this system.
I hope that Mr. Denis Villeneuve will not do another sequel to other great sci-fi films and leave it in the hands of people like Bryan Singer, Neill Blomkamp, Terry Gilliam, James Cameron, Joss Whedon, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan, the brothers (transgender) Wachowski and so many other masters of the genre.",2,1,3,2 January 2018
