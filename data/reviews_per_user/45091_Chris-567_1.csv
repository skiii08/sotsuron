The Blair Witch Project," I've seen it twice already
","**** Warning: SPOILERS!!!!!****
This movie gave me a good scare!! I actually felt like I was sitting in the tent with the actors huddled up and shaking. I was really emotionally drained after the scene where we here the torturing of Josh and the ending had me awake all night! I just couldn't go to sleep. All I could think about were the stick figures, crackling noises and the piles of odd rocks. The overall scariest part for me was when Mike was in the witches cellar calling out, 'Josh? Josh is that you?' Berrrrrrr!!! I got goose bumps.
I got really ticked when I started reading everybody's comments on this movie. First, you all should have known from the start that TBWP was filmed as if it were a home movie! If that sort of thing bothers you, you should have been smart enough not to go see it. Another thing, you guys were complaining about the amount of f-words in the film. Well, I'm pretty sure if you guys were in the position that the three filmmakers were in, even you goodie two-shoes would be breaking down into a massive storm of profanity. In the past I have tried not to be desensitized by language and violence but this movies dialogue was so realistic, it didn't bother me one bit.Go see this movie for a good scare and alot of fun. It is sure to be the #1 party movie as of October when it is released on video. I will have a copy the day it comes out, trust me. I might even throw a blair witch party!!! I give this new classic masterpiece a 10/10",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
