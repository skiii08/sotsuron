Alien 3," Alien 3 misunderstood
","Alien 3 lacks the overall appeal of Aliens, but that doesn't mean that it's a poor movie. Alien 3 is a drama - not an action movie, not a horror movie - it's about Ripley and what dealing with the alien has done to her...it has some of the best dramatic lines of the series, and sets up the only redeeming aspect of Alien Resurrection - namely, the continuing progression of Ripley's descent into inhumanity...watch the movie, enjoy it for what it is, and don't expect another Aliens, and you'll be much happier - as for the elimination of leftovers from Aliens...get over it...it's an ugly universe, and people die for no good reason the cast is excellent, the story and pacing are still better than most modern movies, and it's still better than Alien Resurrection...or any of the AVP movies",8,4,67,18 August 2008
