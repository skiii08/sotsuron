Sucker Punch," Written with PG-13 in mind
","I went into the movie knowing that there was a fantastical element to the storyline, and that it was an action movie. It definitely contained both of these elements.However, in the desperation to maintain a PG-13 rating while showing as much barely-legal flesh as possible, the movie makes the action sequences repetitive and dull. To enable a high body-count but maintain a low 'death count' and gore level, enemies are either undead, fantastical or mechanical. (And the dialog to establish these facts is diabolical.) The CGI is impressive at times, though the majority of images appears to have been lifted either out of previous movies or out of recent computer games. Action sequences work most of the time, but the repetitive and constant nature makes inconsistencies such as stunt doubles and CGI'ed representations much more noticeable.The acting is reasonable when required, but as would be expected from an action movie, there are large expanses of the movie where these skills are not. Wardrobe choices are chosen purely for the titillation factor, with the majority of the movie being a poor excuse to move the storyline into a setting where more flesh can be shown.The 'moral' of the story is delivered at the end with the finesse of a sledgehammer, and the relevance and flavour of a stale after-dinner mint.All-in-all, the movie is an obvious vehicle for the actresses involved to try and shed their good-girl images without shedding their clothes completely, but fails so show anything more of them other than what they're hiding.",3,2,8,6 April 2011
