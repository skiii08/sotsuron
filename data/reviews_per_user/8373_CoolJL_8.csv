First Man," We feel you Neil.
","The movie isn't really about accurate biographical portrail of Neil Armstrong during the Appollo program. But rather, it gives you some sense of what it must have been like for Neil Armstrong and others to prepare for what was essentially a suicide mission. As an audience we get to feel the emotional turnmoil that was brewing inside Neil Armstrong during this period of his life, knowing full well that you could die at any moment (even during the training) yet having the courage go on.Most of the criticisms I have read of the movie are, really, symptomatic of the society we live in at the moment, where people wants to be spoon fed positivity, spoon fed happiness, spoon fed fun and not wanting to ever face up to the struggles that are present in life.Despite it's slow pace it's gripping from the start to the finish. It's a wonderful movie for those who doesn't mind getting involved emotionally and doesn't mind that there aren't jokes or action sequences at every other minute.",9,0,2,18 January 2019
Inside Out," A wonderful movie for all, including children.
","Pixar is on form again with Inside Out. Reading the reviews here, there seem to be a lot of complains, particularly from parents, that this isn't a children's movie, but if they know anything about Pixar they should know that they never make just 'children's movie'.The movie makes a very poignant point about how being happy is such a focus in people's life today that we aren't allowed to be sad anymore, to be sad is to become a something of a social outcast. We are bombarded with imagery of being happy, idea of happiness, and everyone seem to be so busy being happy that they don't have time for people who aren't. I think the very idea that it's OK to be sad has struck a discord with many of the parents, complaining that the movie is depressing and not suitable for children. Perhaps the main issue isn't really whether or not the movie is for children, but the discord lies with the fact that the movie goes against the 'Happy idealism' they hold.The film works on many levels. I watched it with my two sons, the younger one, who is 5, viewed it mostly as a fabulous adventures of Joy and Sadness getting back to the head quarters to fix all the mess they have created, where as the older one who is 7 did understand some of the issues Riley was having.This is a wonderful movie, which deals with a lot of deep issues, yet its funny, very touching at times, wonderfully creative, and being a Pixar movie, it can be enjoyed by all, including children.",9,5,28,29 August 2015
Transformers," Forget those pompous naysayers who are rapped up in hollywood feminist agenda, who seem to hate the movie just for being a Michael Bay movie. This is a super fun movie.
","Michael Bay has become something of a love to hate guy among certain section of critics, namely those who wants to promote politically correct feminist agenda who think they are better than others and want to inflict their ideals on others.Forget those idiots, just watch the movie for what it is, which is a super fun action pack movie which just about anyone can enjoy. Shia Labeouf is fabulous in this movie and the chemistry between him and Megan fox is great. And lets not forget the Transformers themslves which, even after 10 years, the visuals on these robots are still some of the best you'll ever see.",9,3,3,21 February 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," 'We are Groot'
","This movie was so much fun, I went in the theatre knowing nothing about it, and came out with a beaming smile on my face. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything else, it is what it is, a fun Superhero movie for everyone! It has lots of action, lots of effects, many silly jokes, great music and it is to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, yet it was executed to perfection.Of course it isn't perfect, no movie is, but because you are having such a great time with it you quickly forget about any short comings. What the movie does extremely well is that, it provides us with characters we quickly get attached to and end up caring about. And because of it not only does the movie take us on an epic adventure filled with action and laughter but also an emotional one.The movie has so many great moments, who could forget the epic dance off at the end? How about the thesaurus joke? But it wasn't just about being funny, how did you feel when Groot decided to sacrifice himself to save our heroes? What about when Groot lit up the inside of Dark Esther? Which was one the most beautiful cinematic moments, only to be quickly ruined, quite deliberately, by Drax's epic speech! If only every superhero movie was this good and this much fun!",10,1,6,2 January 2016
Prometheus," Watch it for what it is not what you want it to be.
","Since the movie was hyped up so much, it seems a lot of people went to the movie with a lot of expectations and preconceptions, only to be disappointed.However, if you consider the movie on its on merit then, its a very good sci-fi movie. Don't expect massive amount of character development nor thrilling dialogs, none of the first 2 alien movies had these nor many of great Sci-fi movies. However this is a thought provoking, visually stunning, and ultimately enjoyable movie.I do agree though with some here saying that the movie should have been a lot longer. It does feel as though it was rushed at times, but that's the industry of today, 2hr in the theatres and 2.5hr for blu-ray...",7,1,3,4 June 2012
Blade Runner," A true master piece of cinema.
","This is one of 2 dozen or so true landmark movie in cinema history. It isn't just a Sci-fi master piece, its a master piece of Cinema. It's so sad that some people watch this movie, especially younger generation, knowing that it's a Sci-fi movie and hence with an expectation of preconceived ideas of what Sci-fi movies should be like, and end up being disappointed. All I can say is that don't expect how it should be, rather be open what will be presented to you.I think this movie is a case of where, all the right people coming together in just the right moment in time and ended up making a little piece of history. Most movies you watch, you always get the feeling afterwards that things could have been better here or there, but that's not the case here, this is as perfect as a movie will ever be.",10,0,2,20 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Good Star Wars Movie but...
","I like this movie, on its own without the original movie, I'd say it was excellent, but unfortunately they didn't do too much with the story, you could have easily called this Star Wars episode IV mark 2. It became pretty clear about half way through, that the story is almost exactly the same as New Hope, interchange the characters, interchange the Death Star with Starkiller and you have almost the same movie. At times the unoriginality of this made me appreciate the story arc in prequels, although I'll never be able to get over the poor execution of those movies. Unfortunately, though, too many critics are getting carried away with the euphoria of having a movie that wasn't as poor as the prequels, most of them seem to just completely loose all their objectivity and professionalism and are making this out to be the greatest Star Wars movie, which this really isn't.All in all its an enjoyable Star Wars Movie, well executed and well presented, which will undoubtedly immerse you into the Star Wars universe make you excited again, but I just can't help wishing they hadn't simply rehashed the original story. Was JJ Abrhams trying to make a point that the history has tendency to repeat itself? Or were they deliberately trying to make die hard fans so drunk with nostalgia that they lose all ability to complain about the deliberate rehashing of the old story. Either way, although it was enjoyable, when I left the theatre it just seem to leave a bad taste in your mouth and I couldn't help feeling being let down. This could have been so much more, instead of adding something new and expanding the Star Wars Universe, instead, they just played ultra safe and made it claustrophobic. We can only hope that in next installment we have something that departs from the original story line, because no amount of nostalgia infestation will get them off the hook the second time around.",6,1,7,17 December 2015
Fantastic Four," Errrm, what just happened?
","The reviews of the movie were nothing but terrible, but I thought to watch it anyway. And I was very surprised to find that I was enjoying the movie and thought why was this getting such terrible reviews? Then the superhero thing happens, and as soon as the main characters obtain their superpowers, the movie takes a hairpin turn and manages to self destruct. I had never seen a movie that take such a turn in quality so suddenly, and when the end comes it feels like someone had just poured a bucket of cold water on you.Such a shame, it seemed like it was leading up to something great but it just decided to give up. I can't help thinking there is a good movie in there somewhere.",5,2,6,9 December 2015
