"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," The performance is halfway decent.
","Ever since The Pallbearer, David Schwimmer has nestled quietly in a limbo of Friends vs. Friends. In Run, Fat Boy, Run, you can feel the same Schwimmeresque hopelessness that carries throughout this light yet dark comedy. And unfortunately, Simon Pegg is not at his game without the direction of his longtime companion and virtual director, Edgar Wright.In essence, Schwimmer totally understands the nuance of British Life, but fails to intertwine the magic that both Shaun and Fuzz permeate throughout the film. The vignette of Simon Pegg's plight is notable and worthy of the American try, but the simple nuance of things like Ricky Gervais' performance in The Office brings the stark reality between an American imitating BritCom, and Brits doing their thing.So directly, when you watch R, FB, R, be sure to accept that we Americans truly appreciate the vein of nonsensical British humor, but still, as the expanse of the Atlantic, really just don't get it just yet.David, you are the King, I wish you'd do more.",7,2,5,29 November 2007
