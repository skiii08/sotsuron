Mission: Impossible III," Mission Understandable
","Lets all just take a few seconds to thank the lord that director John Woo was no where near this film... Mission Impossible I was a very well put together movie. The plot was strong, and there were enough twist and turns to satisfy. However, the plot was also very confusing leaving the main stream everyday man out of the loop.The second installment of the series was an action packed summer blockbuster.... but thats all it was. The story was weak and the plot was almost dumb.That brings us to the third,almost hybrid version, MI III. I found this movie very easy to follow, yet it still had me guessing. Tom cruise was excellent as an Ethan Hunt with something to lose. The action was good the story was good, and they even threw a love story in for the woman companion in your life. thats all i will say. I highly suggest this movie to viewers of all ages and sexes. there's something in it for everyone",7,0,2,6 May 2006
