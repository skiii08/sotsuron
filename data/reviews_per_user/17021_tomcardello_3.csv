3:10 to Yuma," Exceptional Western film
","Who says the Western is done as a genre? This is a terrific film. There's always some things in any film that make me roll my eyeballs and say 'yeah, right', and this film was no exception. Like Peter Fonda's character taking a bullet in the belly then having it removed without anesthesia by a veterinarian without letting out hardly a grunt. Then he climbs back on his horse and rides all day. Nobody is *that* tough.Nevertheless, the rest of this film is awesome. It's tough, gritty, and has no silly romantic sub-plots that would've served only to bore the audience. The dynamic between Ben Wade (RCrowe, bad guy) & Dan Evans (CBale, good guy) is terrific. The acting by the entire cast is tremendous. Particularly good is Ben Foster playing one of Ben Wade's henchmen. He's a psychopathic butcher and is very believable in his role as Charlie Prince. Best remake of an old film i've ever seen (I saw the original 1957 film with Glenn Ford & Van Heflin as a kid in the '60's). This version improves on the original by a quantum leap.Don't miss this film.",10,4,9,7 September 2007
United 93," Not a 'popcorn' film
","Nobody involved in the making of this exceptional film can ever be accused of exploiting the original tragedy. Why not? Well, i remember attending this film in the theatre. There was no advertisements of any kind. The lights went out and the film started- clearly, the producers were making a statement- no commercial enterprises will profit from the making of this film or the tragedy portrayed therein.No high profile or 'A list' Hollywood actors were used.Although a theatrical film it has more the look & feel of a documentary, mainly due to its straightforward treatment of the subject matter.I highly recommend this film.It's a film that every American should see.",9,2,4,29 December 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Attaboy Will
","Rarely do i give films a TEN, but this one deserves it. Simply put, any film that depicts fathers, particularly single fathers in such a poignantly terrific way deserves such a high ranking.It was wonderful to see for once single fathers portrayed as hard working devoted parents instead of amoral, boozing, doping, womanizing, lazy, selfish louts. Will Smith's dead-on portrayal should hit a hight note with all single Dads. He also took pains not to overact.I can see why Mr.Smith is on Hollywood's A-list.Shame on Hollywood, however, for continuing to portray single Dads in the aforementioned fashion.I highly recommend not renting but purchasing this film.",10,3,6,27 December 2007
