","Plain and simple, Requiem for a Dream is about Addiction. All of the main characters are addicts in some way, whether it be for drugs, money, or beauty.Requiem for a Dream is about the lives of four people who are connected whether be by blood, business relationship, or significant other. This film chronicles the events which occur in the main characters' lives when put in extreme situations, with life-altering consequences.Requiem for a Dream was shot beautifully, from the amazing editing, and the realism of being 'high.' The characters of Requiem give highly believable performances which add to the authenticity of the film. This film takes you for a ride through the eyes of people with out-of the-ordinary lifestyles which we seem to overlook in everyday life, and frightens the viewer by taking reality to your front door. Occurring in middle America to seemingly ordinary people with regular problems, such as self-consciousness, or making ends meet. These are problems which occur to real people in the everyday world, and allow the viewers to relate to the characters.Requiem left me disturbed, breathless, and in tears far after the credits rolled. From the amazing soundtrack, to the extraordinary acting, to the unique plot, there are no words I can use to describe what I felt during this film. I can tell you with confidence, this the most moving film I have ever seen, by far. Aronofsky truly outdoes himself. 10/10.",10,2,4,23 October 2007
