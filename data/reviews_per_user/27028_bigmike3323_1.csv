First Man," Not great but average.
",I feel this movie was rushed. This movie makes Neil Armstrong feel cold and disconnected. I felt it hard to relate to him. I wish they had done more with showing his achievements in aviation and space exploration. The sound and special effects were amazing. I wish I had watched it in a Dolby Atmos equipped theatre. I didn't care for the score. It didn't grab me like James Horner's score for Apollo 13. I felt no excitement for the characters. I felt bored most of the movie. The acting was bland and I felt not emotion for Neil. I just thought it could be better. They should have shown the planting of the flag.,5,12,26,12 October 2018
