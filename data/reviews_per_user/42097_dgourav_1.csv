Airlift," Overall a masterpiece.
","Excellent idea , excellent acting , excellent direction make this movie the highest IMDb rating movie of Bollywood till date. First to last an awesome thriller. Akshay Kumar again proved his ability.Nimrat Kaur also acted well on her character alongside with Akshay. The songs were perfectly used and were nice to listen. Inaamulhaq also acted well as Major Khalap. After Holiday , Baby , Gabbar is back Akshay again proved that he has born for this kind of films. Mindblowing idea by Raja Krishna Menon for making such kind of film . Few emotional scenes also felt us emotional. KK's Bandemataram as background song when the Indian flag was being hoisted in Jordon Airport touched the heart of every Indian. The cinema can easily claim as a Hollywood film. Overall a masterpiece.",10,0,0,31 January 2016
