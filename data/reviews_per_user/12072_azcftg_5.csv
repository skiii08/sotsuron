The Lion King," One Word: boring
","This was such a boring film. It created zero empathy, sympathy or emotional response from me. I almost dosed off. What is more weird is that I am an animal lover and theoretically should have found this very moving or sweet.The songs were also performed badly. I am not sure who the artists were, but they were so flat. The singers have no range.Bad film.",3,5,7,14 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Proof that if you watch anymore Star Wars You Are An Idiot
","Who has been had.I cannot believe I watched this after reading all the bad reviews and being bored and disgusted with its prequel The Force Awakens. All it did is remind me that I shall not bother watching the crappy Episode 9 whatever it is called.It reminded me how Disney is stupid and dangerous and I ave more self respect.
Keep dropping bombs in space and being thrown in jail in casinos Disney.",1,6,10,14 December 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," The Only Mystery Here Is Why They Remade This Story
",There is no reason for this film. It was quite dull with a strange blue tint throughout. Could it be the result of a digital shot?I lied. There is another mystery. Who thinks financing these boring stories with silly actors and worse actresses is a good idea?There is another version of this movie out there. I remember watching it as a child. I am sure that is a better bet.,3,110,138,14 December 2019
