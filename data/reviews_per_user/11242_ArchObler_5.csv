The Ring," Naomi Watts is still awesome
","If you cut 30 minutes out of this, you might have a tight, scary B movie, but it spends so much time on investigating a back story that, when you come down to it, doesn't really matter much. When they're not wasting time on the back story, they're padding out the action with long scenes of Naomi Watts driving somewhere or looking at things and of random shots of a tree on a hill, which is also not as important as it seems. It is also shot in that ugly, slightly blueish greenish tint that for some reason seems to be so popular now in movies like Panic Room and Amelie. What the film does have is some occasional frightening imagery, including the videotape itself, which is a masterpiece of nightmarish surrealism, like Carl Dreyer's Vampyr. Why couldn't the rest of the film have shown that kind of economical terror? ** out of ****",Null,0,0,26 October 2002
Blade II," This guy's face just splits open
","There are countless movies with a lot of lackluster gore. It's not that I'm desensitized, it's just that, well, where's the passion for blood and guts in today's film world? This is the movie that finally delivers. This is a good movie with a passable action story, with some good action scenes, but what's really great about it is that it's disgusting in new creative ways that I hadn't seen before. And Kris Kristofferson's in it. *** out of ****",Null,0,0,9 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Looks and feels better than it actually plays
","This is a beautiful movie, with thrilling action scenes, using amazing visual effects that actually enhances the action. The look of the movie really sets you up for the mood of a great fantasy. But it is also rather dull dramatically, with long drawn out, overly earnest scenes. Very few of the characters seem to deserve the loyalty they give to each other, we just have to watch boring actors like Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler solemnly declare things while other actors like Cate Blanchett are just wasted. But I was genuinely taken aback by the freakiness of Ian Holm as the obsessed Bilbo Baggins and there's never been a more rousing scene than when Gandolf stands up to that dragon. *** out of ****",7,0,0,9 October 2002
The Shining," Don't Overlook this horror film
","One of my favorites as a kid, and still great to see today. It's not entirely satisfying though. The problems with the film mainly come from the second half. The use of Scatman Crother's character when he makes his way back to the Overlook is clever and must have seemed great on paper, but it takes a lot of time and may cause a lot of impatience to some viewers. Also when the spooks of the hotel finally make themselves visible to Shelley Duvall, it's a bit of a letdown, since they're just a few random shots of things that have been seen in a lot of ghost films before. The moods of hauntings, possessions, and isolation have never been handled better though. This is one of scariest films ever made, it gives me the creeps, and Jack Nicholson's rant to Duvall about bothering him while he's working is a classic. The final chase through the maze is ingeniously handled, it has a real sense of danger. ***1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,27 October 2002
Am√©lie," Shove this romance down your throat
","Every single moment of this movie is calculated to be lovable. With a wink. I hate these movies that attack you with whimsy, and this is one of the most violent I've seen. Not only is it achingly cute but it's also 'naughty' with wild offscreen sex and endearing porn shop employees. I don't understand why in these romantic comedies I'm supposed to care about whether two people who don't even know each other get together or not. I'd rather see Amelie as a movie where this couple gets together and then he gets to find out what a nutjob she is. Can you imagine living with this woman and her wacky schemes? There are a lot of clever little details, like the identity of the photo booth guy and the traveling gnome, but these don't take away the pain, they just dull it. ** out of ****",3,12,25,10 October 2002
