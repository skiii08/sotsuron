Source Code," Good movie
","This movie speaks about the ability to obtain informations from the past. As said in the movie, 'it is not time travel', it is something else. This 'something else' is well engaged since the beginning. I was in the entire time, and it is not easy for me in that kind of movies because I analyzed everything. It is not too hard-science (like Primer for instance) nor too stupid (like Transcendance). It is more like Edge of Tomorrow where the weight of action/science/love/thriller is well balanced.I recommend to see the movie if you like 'little' mind-f***. I liked the end, even if I don't think it can be realistic, but it is unexpected and appropriated in a sense...So go watch it.",8,2,4,19 January 2015
Watchmen," Good movie
","I spent a good time seeing this movie. I didn't know the comic, so I enjoyed knowing philosophies of characters (complex and well- developed contrary to Marvel movies). The strength of this movie comes from the complexity of human brain, ranging from bad actions for good reasons or good actions for bad reasons. Thus, the Watchmen team represent all human behaviors. I particularly appreciated Dr Manhattan and may read the comic books to know more about him. I also like the uchronic story, even if 3 hours seems a little bit too long. Some actions in the movie seems strange and badly related to the entire story.Nevertheless, I recommend to see this movie, except if you are a very moral person or if you don't like to see some blood.",9,0,2,6 January 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Between a movie and a video game
","Little SpoilerVery good and efficient movie. I loved the first part. The discover of power, the use of them, the ability to improve himself. Tom cruise, good actor here, play the role of a video game character where you could save just before attacking a big boss. I recommend it a lot. It is the only film I know which mix the temporal loop and war. I still don't know how very good villains (which look like Matrix creatures) are able not to strengthen the protection of the most important thing they have ! (like Death Star in Star Wars). Just for this It put 9/10. But It is close to a 10.Don't hesitate !",9,2,5,8 January 2015
