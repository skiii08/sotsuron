The Avengers," Passable time and brain cell killer.
","Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more.",4,20,41,9 June 2012
Vertigo," Dizzy plot
","Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, Vertigo is overrated and not really one of Hitchcock's best films. Great, even good films, get better with repeated viewings, but not Vertigo. Despite Bernard Hermann's seductive score, excellent cinematography by Robert Burks, an interesting set up, and a story replete with Hitchcok's ironies and themes subsequent viewings make Gavin Elster's convoluted plot to murder his wife with Stewart's Scottie as an unwitting witness seems utterly preposterous, and impossible to pull off and stage. Surely, there are easier ways to get away with murder! And so much time is spent setting Scottie up for the fall that in retrospect much of it seems gratuitous. The overcomplicated murder plot recalls Hitchcok's stiff and stagy, Dial M for Murder(54). The plotting rather than the execution makes Vertigo inferior Hitchcock even though in many respects it's his most personal and audacious film. Much of the dialog between Stewart and Novak's Madelaine is awkward and tedious, and unnecessarily drawn out; one of the film's best sequences employs virtually no dialog. Both Saul Bass' animated dream sequence and Barbara Bel Geddes' Madge feel unnecessary as well. Nonetheless, Vertigo is an interesting film with the parts being better than the whole, and the less you know about it the better. Novak's wispy persona was never better suited to a film role, and Stewart's pale blue eyes are downright vertiginous. Recommended.",7,2,4,21 July 2010
Hereditary," One of the worst films that...
","I ever sat through in a theater. Borrowing elements from The Witch, The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to name just a few, Hereditary is excruciatingly slow, and obvious from the start. The film is largely limited to 2 settings: a modern rustic home where no one ever bothers to turn on a light, and a classroom complete with a teacher droning in the background and disinterested teenagers. There are no supporting characters, save for one, of any note or consequence. The acting is one-note and grating, and Gabriel Byrne's character is annoyingly and unbelievably feckless. What it all means is never explained, and the ending comes as a relief. Judy Collins singing Both Sides Now during the credits provokes snarky laughter; the feeling the whole film is just a big joke.",1,128,263,22 June 2018
Chinatown," It's Jake, Chinatown.
","A beautifully crafted film noir that's earned the right to be called a classic. Masterfuly directed by Roman Polanski who makes cunning use of the widescreen, gets all the details unerringly right and creates a disturbing atmosphere of widespread corruption. John Alonzo's cinematography, Jerry Goldsmith's score, Sam O'Steen's editing, and the set and costume design are all flawless. Robert Towne's Oscar winning screenplay is a beauty though the ominous references to Chinatown become a bit obvious and heavy-handed, and the ending, apparently wanted by Polanski, makes the characters seem more the victims of contrivance than fate. Polanski gets effective performances from Dunaway, Huston, Diane Ladd, and Belinda Palmer. And Nicholson, who's in every scene, shows why he's a star even if I find him more effective in the wise guy aspects of the role than in the scenes where he's supposed to show vulnerability. Though I don't rank it as highly as Polanski's The Pianist, Knife in the Water, or Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown is highly recommended.",8,1,4,5 January 2008
A Star Is Born," So So Star!
","A reasonably entertaining, underwhelming and under-imaginative 4th version of the material with 2 decent, if one-note, lead performances, but little else to recommend. The film lacks atmosphere, supporting characters of consequence, and characters who you really care for. The songs are a mixed bag and we get no real sense of either stars relationship to the outside world and/or their audience; we don't really see what makes them a star. His inevitable decline and her meteoric rise are expected, but her acceptance of a 'cute' marriage proposal just after she gave him an ultimatum is unpersuasive. The conflict is tiresome and repetitive and the end is not in the least bit moving. Though not repellent like the 1976 version with Barbra Strident, it's just as unmemorable. Cooper's direction is competent and a few scenes click, but it's overlong and over rated and the second half really drags.",5,4,8,26 October 2018
Ted," Grin and bear it
","If you know what to expect, I expect you'll be entertained. I could have done without the distracting and unfunny cameos, but MacFarland's voicing of the title character steals the show and garners enough laughs to make it bearable. Ted is a bromance with a difference; a story of arrested development that brings out the kid in you. The bear really does come alive thanks to MacFarland and persuasive animation. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are appealing and give committed performances while Giovanni Ribisi gives a creepy and campy performance that would fit right into The Silence of the Lambs. If there's going to be a sequel, how about Ted Meets Chucky?",6,1,4,1 August 2012
Gone Baby Gone," See it before it's gone, baby, gone!
","Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!",7,105,143,12 November 2007
The Exorcist," Not half as good as the ratings would lead you to believe.
","A hokey, synthetic, horror film that never really disturbed or frightened me. Despite the sensational details of the film, it's laborious, and the characterizations and details in the first half of the film are not particularly necessary. The script seems truncated and leaves many things unexplained and Lee J. Cobb's detective serves no real purpose. For me, the most disturbing scenes were those involving the rigorous and invasive medical tests that the doctors put Regan through, and the film's single most impressive effect is the make up job on Max Von Sydow, a most convincing job of aging. Ellen Burstyn, a powerful performer, is effectively shrill and over the top, and Linda Blair's performance as Regan is a triumph of make up, dubbing and special effects. Unlike Hitchcock, Polanski or DePalma, Freidken takes his horror seriously; the film is heavy-going; humorless and shallow, and you don't feel for Regan or her mother, so the movie basically operates on the level of a carnival freak show.",6,2,7,6 January 2008
Mamma Mia!," Stupefyingly bad
","A flat-footed movie musical that is in the same league as Darling Lili, The Wiz, Xanadu and Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band; being so bad that it's just plain bad. OK, maybe it's less annoying than Godspell(73), but that's about the best to be said for it. What appears to be home movie vacation footage has been directed without rhythm or purpose by one Phyllida Lloyd. Mamma Mia is a pointless reworking of the plot of Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell(68) which merely serves as an excuse for the cast to break into ABBA songs and cavort about sans proper lighting, direction, and vocal endowments, making unappealing and amateurish asses of themselves. Pierce Brosnon especially should leave this one off of his resume; his singing is painful. The sense of larkish fun in the film seems forced, and the characters are too old for their antics to be charming; they seem to be suffering from arrested development. Though the cast may be having a good time, the audience isn't. Can't Stop the Music, The Apple, and The Cool Ones are at least campy fun.",1,6,10,30 January 2010
Get Out," Skin Deep
","Jordan Peele has made a smoothly entertaining and smart thriller out of material familiar from The Stepford Wives, Seconds, Night of the Living Dead and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. The film doesn't have an original bone in its body, but it's lively, funny and discomfiting nonetheless and it provides a few pleasurable jolts while nimble direction and an able cast compensate for the plot's predictability. In Get Out the buildup is ultimately more satisfying and memorable than the payoff and the revelations feel rushed and somewhat murky. And though the finale is done with admirable restraint in the gore department, Get Out cries out for a better, more original and thought-provoking conclusion. A good, but somewhat disappointing film considering all the hype and though it's superior to Don't Breathe and Split, it isn't original or distinctive enough to be a classic, but just good enough to warrant a viewing.",6,24,54,4 April 2017
I Am Legend," I am instantly forgettable.
","Disappointing third film version of Richard Matheson's novel is more annoying than exciting, and the 'Darkseekers', rabid mutants, make dull adversaries because they are one note like Cujo; they lack distinctive qualities, and their agility and strength seem incredible even in the context of science fiction. These CGI created s-creatures combined with Will Smith's glum protagonist make for an ultimately lackluster conflict whose outcome doesn't seem to really matter. The script lacks imagination and elaboration to say nothing of originality, and the result feels like an over-extended Twilight Zone episode. For a film set in a near empty Manhattan, the film is loud. The director amps up the sound throughout to keep the audience from falling asleep. Will Smith isn't convincing, commanding, or compelling; he's particularly bad in the chaotic and confusing flashbacks, and he and the rest of the cast are less interesting than the mannequins. Not a film to be watched again because the details are unconvincing, unvaried, and unimaginative. Besides being underwhelming, the ending is forced, and much is left frustratingly unexplained or underdeveloped. Another remake that makes you wonder why they bothered, and why the audience should care?",3,4,6,18 January 2008
The Graduate," Must see for classic performance
","If you want to see a classic performance, look no further than Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, whose name became a synonym for a seductive older woman. The film's reputation stems largely from the scenes between Hoffman's Benjamim and Bancroft's older woman. These scenes are classic; pointed, funny and superbly acted, but the rest of the film is diffuse,and proceeds by fits and starts. And ultimately, Hoffman's Benjamin begins to seem more like a stalker with a case of arrested development than a college grad in love. Both Ben and Elaine act like high school kids and are so chaste, pure and mono-dimensional that one sorely misses Mrs. Robinson. Arresting cinematography, clever editing and Mike Nichols' direction help camouflage the sketchiness of the screenplay, though the trite musical soundtrack and the accompanying montages become tedious; the film seems to be marking time. The Graduate may not be the classic it's said to be, though Bancroft's performance is. It alone justifies this film, and Bancroft surely deserved the Oscar that went to Katherine Hephurn for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.",7,1,2,24 April 2010
Mystic River," Play Mystic for Me
","Clint Eastwood's dreary and convoluted adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel is a vastly over-rated film. The framing device doesn't really explain the characters; it's used for an ominous effect. The cinematographer, costume designer and set decorator never heard of red or yellow; everyone and everything is blue or gray. Sean Penn, terrific in Carlito's Way, Dead Man Walking, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and The Falcon and the Snowman, won the Oscar for his performance, but it feels perfunctory. The ultimate revelation regarding who killed Penn's daughter and why is out of left field, unconvincing and anti climactic and why doesn't Tim Robbins' character confess to his boyhood chum (Penn) that he didn't kill his daughter, but rather the pederast who was assaulting a boy in a car on the same night Penn's daughter was planning to run away with her boyfriend who it turns out was fathered by Penn. Got that? The Boston accents vary, and Marcia Gay Harden carries on like a junkie looking for a fix. Mystic River, over 2 hours long, makes me wish for simple, unpretentious trash like Clint's directorial debut, Play Misty for Me with a truly classic over the top performance by Jessica Walter.",3,2,4,6 April 2013
Rosemary's Baby," Masterpiece of supernatural suspense.
","Polanski's first American film is one of the most enduring films of the 60's. Well-received when released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby is that rare film that grows more impressive with repeated viewings. It's a near perfect, multi-layered classic that mixes psychological horror with supernatural suspense while being funny, scary, and ironic. No remake could ever come close and the spate of films it inspired, most notably the The Exorcist and The Omen, pale by comparison. Expertly directed by Polanski, the film is perfectly cast and splendidly acted by all. Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for supporting actress, but Farrow, who is in every scene, wasn't even nominated for her iconic portrayal. The entire film is told from Rosemary's point of view. The growing sense of menace and paranoia is beautifully handled, and the audience is with Farrow and her unborn child every step of the way. On one level Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate tribute to motherhood. A winner any way you look at it. Consider it essential viewing. Among others, French film director Francois Truffaut expressed great admiration for the film, and Rosemary's Baby deserved a place on the AFI's top 100.",9,4,6,31 October 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Less than meets the eye
","Essentially trite whimsy. Ferrel is appropriate enough, the rest of the cast is appealing and the film is amusing and quirky: It's all those words reviewers love to use... but, after the first hour I began to wonder where it's all going. The premise is interesting, if unoriginal, and the set design etc... all cleverly done (the bakery shop's window is designed like a watch) but, the film ultimately doesn't deliver and unravels at the point it should come together. A build up to something that doesn't come off and a descent into a feel good bit of whimsy:the film equivalent of cookies and milk. 'It's a Wonderful Life' for a new generation.Stranger Than Fiction is one of those movies people say has to be seen twice to fully understand and/or appreciate, unfortunately, I don't think the film is worth a second look. However, if you're a fan of the actors involved and/or films like PROVIDENCE,THE TRUMAN SHOW, ADAPTATION,...it's worth a look. Individual scenes work nicely but, ultimately, the film disappoints, and evaporates in the memory. As a puzzle it has too many pieces and it's not worth putting together.",5,16,27,23 November 2006
The Blind Side," Norma Rae, Erin Brockovich, Leigh Anne Touhy
","Appalling Best Picture nominee is a combination After School Special and Hallmark Presentation. The Blind Side is based on a tried and true Hollywood formula and is not remotely convincing. Bullock's Leigh Anne, like Norma and Erin, is a feisty Southerner who succeeds with spunk and one-liners, and like Sally Field and Julia Roberts, Bullock won an Oscar;undeserved IMHO, she's perfunctory, the role is a series of quips, and Leigh Anne is less interesting and detailed than either Norma Rae or Erin Brockovich. It's a feel good film, and of course it's satisfying to watch the indomitable Leigh Anne go toe-to-toe with bureaucrats, dubious friends, coaches and homeboys from the projects. Her weapon:zingers. The film is painless at first but it soon lags becomes ridiculous and finally a series smirks from the annoying SJ. Typically, the car accident involving SJ and Big Mike like much of the film is seen coming and like all situations in the film it turns out miraculously well. Bullock's Golden Globe win was in the drama category, but her performance is largely comedic.",2,11,20,19 January 2010
Flight," Flight gets derailed.
","At its core, this large scale Robert Zemeckis film has a provocative idea and a potentially fascinating character, but unfortunately the filmmakers have come up with an unnecessary and awkwardly introduced sub plot involving Nicole, a junkie who shoots up to the strains of Sweet Jane, and her sleazy landlord who along with John Goodman's flamboyant dealer belong in a different film. These three characters are total clichés, and they undermine the film's seriousness and focus. Flight would be considerably shorter and significantly better without them. Excellent support from Melissa Leo, Don Cheadle, Brian Gerahty(co-pilot) and Tamara Tunie(Margaret)help keep it real, and Denzel Washington is superb whether you like his character or not. Alas, there is also an over reliance on a jukebox soundtrack, and the film's spiritual/religious undertones are heavy-handed. The film is not a complete waste;despite excess baggage,it occasionally takes flight.",5,1,2,10 February 2013
Da 5 Bloods," What Da ....is going on!?
","Middle class, armchair revolutionary Spike Lee has made a didactic, bombastic and ultimately uninvolving film that may be worse than Summer of Sam, Bamboozled and Chi-Raq. Do the Right Thing had a strong directorial vision, She's Gotta Have It was an enjoyable, accomplished, independent feature film and after a cliched start, Malcolm X took hold but, many of his subsequent films suggest that he's a one-trick pony and his talent falls short of his ambition. Da... is scattered, and discursive and seems less directed than thrown together. It's main characters, constantly in conflict with one other, become tiresome making the 2.5 hour running time feel punishing. Chaotic and unfocused, this film resembles the current BLM movement.",1,5,9,17 June 2020
All the President's Men," All the assembled talent
","Unquestionably Alan J. Pakula's best film, All the President's Men is as good as any American film of the 70s and one of the few significant political films that Hollywood has ever produced. Though the film is based on well-known events, it compels as a low key thriller and thrills as study of journalism in the dogged pursuit of the truth. Hoffman, Redford, Jason Robards and Jane Alexander perform with admirable modesty and total believability. The film is soundly paced and intelligently written, and Pakula creates a persuasive atmosphere of uncertainty while maintaining a documentary-like realism. Like Scorceses's Goodfellas and Polanski's The Pianist, All the President's Men was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture.",9,3,4,5 July 2013
The Godfather," Showy and shallow
","Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the 'Gone with the Wind' of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.",6,5,13,26 November 2009
