The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Not enough words to explain how awesome it was :)
","This is my very first review on a movie on IMDb. I don't ever put a review on any movie no matter how good it is but believe me I couldn't stop myself after I watched this one. This is one awesome movie I have seen in a long time. If you feel it like it's your own life it just gets even better. The feelings, emotions, fun, music story line and everything was so over the top. One of the best I've seen in a long time. I'll say just this, I don't usually like something but when I do it's one of a kind and 'I don't have enough words to explain how amazingly this movie touched to my heart.' I have this one habit of watching such movies. I put myself as the main character of the movie and then watch it with true feel. Believe me, if you do this you're just gonna love the movie. Well it's like everyone liked Emma Watson since Harry Potter series but I really didn't expect her to do this awesome work in the movie. She did great and overall as you've seen that I gave the movie a 10. So I don't think I need to explain more about how I liked the movie.",10,1,2,22 February 2013
