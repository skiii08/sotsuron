Mission: Impossible III," What do people use to rate pictures these days?
","OK, now lets start from the beginning. I watched this movie at its opening last night, and got a little less than what i initially bargained for. I knew that the picture had many conflicts on the set (especially with actor/director Tom Cruise), but I never thought that it would have been what i saw last night.First let me say that the movie in itself wasn't a bad flick, it's just that the title alone being 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' has certain connotations that MI3 was unable to represent or even remotely capture...meaning that there weren't any action packed and breathtaking climaxes that would make you sit and wonder in uttermost amazement how the hell this man was able to accomplish such a feat. After MI2 there were certain scenes that were virtually unforgettable (such as Tom Cruise hanging from the ice in the beginning and the motorcycle fight near the end etc) however in this movie after watching it i have now recollection of any outstanding scenes that would be worthy of making a note to self or to use as the bar for future motion flicks.The movie left you during the course of its duration trying desperately to fit together pieces of a puzzle...for example, what the hell was the rabbit foot? (note that the whole picture was virtually revolving around this so called 'rabbit foot'. Only near the end was it clear what it was, and even then it really isn't that clear as i still have no idea to the magnitude of destruction this 'rabbit foot' was capable of. When Tom Cruise went for the rabbit foot he went into a 'high security building', and just came out through a window...his team spent more time getting him to the building than helping him acquire this 'rabbit foot'. From looking at the flick it seems as though he just walked in, found it in a bag by the window and jumped out the nearest window.The fighting scenes were definitely below par, and the camera's angles weren't as articulate as one would expect for a flick of this sensationalized magnitude. The sound sucked in terms of the hype on certain scenes, but then again maybe that was due to the fact of there hardly being any notable scenes to begin with. Mission impossible is also known for the theme sound being played during the movie in times where something which is seemingly impossible or brilliant is about to occur. In this flick we heard the music to scenes tantamount to a man running away, sigh very disappointing indeed.The overall plot was OK but very predictable and trite. If you're one who can analyse a movie instead of pandering to the hype and the actor, you will realise that there is much work that was left unresolved in the case of MI3.Tom acted well and so did the cast although time wasn't really spent developing the characters seen throughout the movie...i could go on for ever, but to make a long story short i say this...if i had to choose between watching MI3 or watching 3 MI3 TV EPISODES I'D GLADLY CHOOSE THE LATTER.i rate this movie a 6",6,4,12,6 May 2006
Hostel," What the hell was this?????????????
","Well personally in my humble opinion, this film could have been produced on your local farm and the animals used as the acting cast.However i do see how certain viewers who just like bad acting, a few scenes of gore and mild pornography could like this picture...actually wait...no,i really can't see how anyone who has ever watched a decent film, or possesses any form of imagination would rate this movie anything more than a 3.The dialogue is too clich√©, the acting poor and honestly the so called 'sceens of gore' have been found wanting in many areas. If you are a fan of the film 'Beyond The Limits', then you may be able to bear this amalgamation of visual sleeping pills coupled with some of the poorest acting you've ever seen. These low budget films if they are to stand out needs a good plot, which this particular film lacks entirely.My advice is to watch this flick in order to protect yourself from overhiped films like this in the future. However if you have to choose between watching this film and doing the dishes to please someone in your family...trust me...THIS FLICK CAN WAIT!!!",3,1,2,19 March 2006
Silent Hill," Yawn
","I'm honestly in a rush right now, but i see it as my patriotic duty to warn you all innocent tax paying citizens about this movie. Firstly, it's based off a video game, which means that from inception it was going to be difficult unless there was some genius behind the plot ( we're still awaiting the arrival of the genius). The eerie silent hill atmosphere surrounding the actual game was excellent as it really depicted that element from the game, however everything else was in pure shambles. The acting sucked to an extreme I never expected...how in God's earth can a woman who lost a child in a ghost town act so calmly when arrested after being chased by seemingly alien life forms??? A woman that calm wouldn't have wanted to go to Silent Hill in the first place. The cgi was 'ok' i guess, although it can't be compared to great works such as The Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and Lord of the Rings.The ending also leaves only the perception of the imagination, as there's really nothing in the movie that explains what actually happened in the end. Overall i think i lost a few IQ points from this movie, and I would suggest for you to rent it on tape, borrow the DVD or just don't watch it at all.Overall rating 4/10",4,1,3,21 August 2006
Wanted," I usually reserve my comments but ...READ THIS
","I don't want to get to much in depth about the flick, so I'll just keep it as short and precise as possible. If you are into the action/thriller genre then this is a flick you must watch. The reasoning behind the way the assassins are developed is original and the camera effects are sublime. I must give accolades to the director responsible for the taking of those fantastic action scenes.I read some of the comments above where people trashed this movie. I can't possible imagine how this movie can be trashed by anyone who appreciated flicks such as the matrix, equilibrium etc. The tag line at the end was definitely a catchy one which made us rewind the explanation at the end of the movie some 3-4 times. The plot was also pretty decent, but bear in mind that it is in the action/thriller genre with more emphasis based on the action.Overall it was a great flick and I'd actually watch it again. Watch it and be your own judge.8/10",8,1,5,2 July 2008
Casino Royale," Wow...wow...wowwwwwwwwwwwww
","I just finished watching Daniel Craig playing as James Bond and I must say that it was the most intense Bond I've ever seen on the big screen.He brings a rougher element to the usual all suave James Bond, but this new Bond is a man who does what it takes to get the job done while getting the same perks as his previous predecessors. The picture was fast paced action and a battle of wit from the incipient phases of the flick to the very end. The stunts performed by the new Bond really showed the intensity within the actor and made his presence come to life on the screen which impacted the overall picture in a very positive way. Overall I am very impressed with the production and I can't wait to see Daniel Craig in another James Bond sequel.My rating for this flick is 9/10...definitely a must watch",9,1,3,15 November 2006
