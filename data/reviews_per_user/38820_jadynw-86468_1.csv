robotic acting
gruesome/disturbing scenes
pointless storylines
slow, dragged out scenes where there's minutes of complete silencethis movie wasn't scary, it was definitely dark at first but by 40 minutes in I knew the film wasn't going to get any better. it was more unsettling/disturbingwarning for those who cant handle gruesome scenes in this movie there are scenes wherea birds head is being cut off with scissors, a dead human head with magots all over it's face, ants and other bugs in certain scenes (some people probably aren't bothered by that, but for me i can't i get so squirmish and i cringe so bad) so theres your warning.Save urself the time and don't watch this unless u happen to like any of the above that i mentioned.",1,1,2,23 January 2020
