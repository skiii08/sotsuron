Despicable Me 2," It was good in what it did.
","I recently watched this film with my brother, his girlfriend and my sister and myself, I couldn't wipe the grin from my face for hours. The plot is nowhere close to strong, there are major plot holes and the characters were kinda meh, but for once that wasn't the goal of DM2. The goal was random, immature (hehe, bottom) and absurd humor and it did that with brilliance, even the bumper from Illumination was hilarious. Conclusion: If you're going to this movie as a fan critic you might not have the evening of your life, but if you're going expecting a good amount of humor for any age then this is a movie you cannot miss.",8,1,1,19 July 2013
