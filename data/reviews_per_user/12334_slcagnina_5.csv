Lucky Number Slevin," Fatally flawed
","This is one of those 'screenwriter' movies: It is written from a formula of introducing characters and situations which will be doubled back on in the last reel revealing the twist. It's all about plot, colorful characters (as opposed to characterization) and something violent/or plot driven happening once or twice in each reel. Mood and subtlety it is not about.Lucky Number Slevin is OK by the above standards. It has too many clichés from Pulp Fiction (main characters discussing movie-references as defining character traits, etc) but it keeps interest as passable entertainment. However, it falls apart when it is revealed to be a revenge drama and the Macguffin of Nick Fisher is shown to be a real person that Slevin's partner (Willis) knocks off because Slevin needs his identity. Apparently Fischer is a gambling loser that no one would miss. But the revenge is based on Slevin's own father being a gambling loser who gets killed by those who believe no one will miss him. Bad irony, huh?So, we watch a revenge movie that goes to pains to reveal that everyone killed deserved it (except I didn't buy that the Rabbi's gay kid deserved it, but I digress) -- except it never establishes the plot-driver Nick Fisher deserved it. Why not just have him kidnapped? Or have him be a phantom? Killing him makes this a movie full of people who don't deserve revenge. For a movie that cries out look at my screenplay! it should have noticed that some of this doesn't make any sense in a revenge drama. Unless it wasn't meant as a pure revenge drama. But then, what is it?",5,10,21,1 December 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Inept
","This film is a disaster. The audience I saw it with barely laughed, and I felt a collective sense that they didn't want to admit how bad they had gotten burned by buying (literally) into the hype.I got in free -- and I left after an hour; it wasn't worth free. I've been to enough movies to know when one is not working -- and to ask me to sit for another hour-plus to view good special effects which only remind me how there is nothing else good on the screen, is asking too much of any moviegoer. What is amazing is, with so much money spent -- simple competent editing is amiss; the movie is not only way too long, but it also feels strangely disjointed in many scenes; basic POV shots, reaction shots, timing are not there. Like I stated, I didn't stick around to see the whole thing. It was that bad.",1,94,184,9 July 2006
Batman Returns," A Wonderful Mess
","First off, this film has no story. It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.That said, the film is kinda brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing -- and I mean amazing, as Catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. Walken is Walken -- but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. Keaton is underrated as Batman. And the music and style are pure cinema thrill. True, the 3rd act doesn't work. But the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans.",8,2,4,30 October 2008
Knowing," Clichéd and more clichéd
","Knowing is a film that starts out well, and then in the middle when it begins to head downhill, its prior clichés get highlighted and you think: oh no, it's gonna get worse because I can't excuse all its clichés hereon out. Nicholas Cage plays a physicist whose son goes to an elementary school about to celebrate its 50th anniversary. This means they're about to open a time capsule stored when the school opened, which contains a very weird note written by a little girl containing seemingly random numbers which Cage finds out predict disasters. I'm gonna leave out the rest, because it never amounts to much. Cage's character lost his wife and you know the script will have him wrestling with ideas of determinism versus chaos, given this plot; he's not a character who has lost a loved one -- he's a name on a script with a convenient back story.But the real problems with this film are rooted in the script. The setup is good, but as it unfolded, some of the acting got weak because of the bad writing, and the situations got too stuffed with special effects because of bad writing. Often bad special effects, too. And in the end, I was left wondering: How did these aliens predict the future? I must have missed the answer somehow, but I know I didn't miss the preposterous-ness that aliens would send a message to a kid, which gets put into a time capsule, but also, because the kid wigs out, gets finished on a door -- she carves in the numbers, and that door is never replaced in the ensuing 50 years, and conveniently found by Nicolas Cage and buffed down to find the a-ha clue, so Cage's kid could be at his rendezvous point for the aliens. But wait: after all this, the kid still gets a choice to go or not -- free will is alive! I was thinking: Why didn't they just take the kid -- Cage would have voted yes and the kid ain't old enough to vote? Or bring a backup if he opted out? And why would alien beings bother with all this nonsense -- how bout helping us with some technology to avoid being burned alive? And why -- why write it this way? The movie was interesting for its first 3 reels, it didn't need Armageddon and aliens to keep it interesting. And Proyas' style here is really average; he's not a hack, but the movie is edited and shot in a standard Hollywood fashion, right down to that clichéd score. It was annoying -- orchestral bombast during emotional scenes or tense-note when something was supposed to be scary -- the same pulsing da da - da! you hear in every thriller. Sad. Also, one last note: Cage's actions in the final scene with his son are very screwy. He finds his son and we understand he's concerned for him; but he never asks where the little girl with him is. This is strange and oft putting. And when she appears, he doesn't embrace her. And when he thinks he's gonna get on the spaceship with the kids, he takes his son's hand, but not the little girl Abby's. In fact, he seems like he's ignoring this poor child about to be whisked away from all that she knows. He seems oblivious to this child, who the script decided, btw, should not be freaked out even though she's about to get on a spaceship without her mother, who is dead, or as the aliens tell her, OK now. These aliens don't win points for helping out humanity or for honesty -- and why couldn't Cage get on the spaceship, anyway? Wait: Script calls for poignant ending. That explains it.",4,5,11,25 July 2009
Quantum of Solace," Overall, still part of an interesting direction for Bond
","OK...I just saw the midnight show preview and I am conflicted.I'll start with the good:Craig is awesome as Bond. He wasn't allowed too much humor in this film -- one gets the feeling the makers are self conscious about slipping into the camp style humor that marred late Connery, late Pierce, and all of Roger. But Bond should be witty and sexually sly. Letting Bond have some fun wouldn't necessarily have to be camp. Note to the writers: You don't have to lighten up the story lines, just parts of the story. As the film progressed, it became clear that the franchise is resurrecting a SPECTRE type of organization -- something for Bond to fight. I don't know if this will continue, but it's working and it gives the villains an added dimension -- you know there's always more to the schemes.Some critics have lambasted the villain here for not being diabolical enough. Casino Royale established that Bond would not be facing bad guys who want to go into outer space and create a master race. Criticizing the villain for not being camp-bad enough is like criticizing Christopher Nolan for not making Batman lighter and more fun. The series is being truer to Fleming's ideas of Bond. And it's nice to have Felix playing important roles in Bond's missions. Wright is one of the best Felix's yet, and I hope they continue to use him. Also, the film's plot becomes more involving as it goes along. That was a good thing because: The bad -- I was afraid it wasn't going to have a plot during the first reel. The criticism of the action scenes is justified; Forster is a talented director, and he may well direct a terrific action picture one day -- but it's obvious he currently is not an action director. Some of the stylistic edits and inter-cutting during the picture are well done. But the big action set pieces are filmed like the Bourne films -- and I hate that style. Time and space and character must be present to make the action suspenseful. Casino Royale did that in spades. Here, the action is discombobulated and that makes the characters involved non-existent. It also makes CGI more noticeable. Casino Royale incorporated CGI in an understated manner, using it to fine tune rather than be center-stage. Bond will never be a CGI action hero -- there will always be a touch of wonderful analog to him, and the producers would do well to remember that action scenes subtly enhanced by CGI are more involving and interesting than ones created mostly or totally from computers; the former serves a story, the latter serves a game console. The Bourne style of action scenes reminds me of a singer who uses her voice for high notes at every stage during a song; no nuance, no variety, and the impact of her high notes is diminished by the fact there is no contrast. Variety of styles, cuts, shots, and human reaction are all important for action scenes. Just because something is cut in half second shot times doesn't make it exciting. The Bond girls in the film are not bad -- they don't deserve the advanced negativity I've read. But they aren't great, either. Middle of the pack. They didn't get out of Eva Green's shadow, and this was probably why they got killed in so many reviews. But they're not bad like this: Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones. That's perspective. I love Craig's Bond's coldness and I like the narrative that's building. This is a good film. It recovers from a shaky start and sets up Bond nicely for another outing. I think bringing Campbell back as director would be a positive. And I hope they don't give in and start making the villains campy nut-cases. Also, I hope they keep Wright as Felix and expand his role next time. But for now, QoS will do. A solid if flawed outing, whose positives usually include the new direction taken for Craig's Bond, and that's a good sign for the future.",8,1,4,14 November 2008
