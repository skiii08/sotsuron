The Blair Witch Project," Oooooh, scary sticks and things that go bump in the night!
","This movie used some interesting camera techniques and some extremely effective marketing, but otherwise was one of the stupidest things committed to film next to Wing Commander. Could I empathize with the character's plight and respect their 'intelligence' as supposedly bright college students who knew what they were doing? From the sarcasm of my question you can most likely intuit the answer to be resounding 'NO'. The best use for this piece of crap? Play it to annoy someone who has overstayed their welcome. After the first few minutes of whining from the characters, your lingering guests will make tracks out the door.",2,1,3,8 January 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Annoying character inconsistency vs. KB vol.1
","Without going into any plot-spoiler details for those who have not seen it, I found Kill Bill Vol.2 to be at points overly pretentious (like Vol.1), disgusting, and amusing. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it overall. But what struck me most is some serious inconsistency in 'The Bride' character vs. what was portrayed in Vol.1. For that reason alone, I couldn't enjoy this movie with the same level of surprise and amazement as its predecessor. Among my friends who piled heaping praise on Kill Bill Vol.2 (somewhat more so even than Kill Bill Vol.1), I have to wonder about the extent to which they have gotten caught up the hype and 'cool factor' surrounding Tarantino movies, vs. really acknowledging the shortcomings and inconsistencies of Tarantino's plot development and characterization. Both these movies will probably leave you 'agreeing to disagree' if you're a Tarantino-phile.",6,0,1,5 December 2004
