The Ring," wow !!spoiler!!
","ok, ill admit, im not a big fan of 'scary' movies, but this one was good. i saw the previews of it a long time ago and thought it was gonna be just another stupid thriller.......boy was i wrong.  this movie really scared me....i left the movies with a REALLY REALLY creepy feeling.....the images are just plain disturbing, the scene with her coming out of the well was done so well that that in itself made it worth it.  by far one of the best scary movies in a long time",9,0,0,27 October 2002
