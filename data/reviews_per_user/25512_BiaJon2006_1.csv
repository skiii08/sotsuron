The Ring," I dont know what it did to you but it scared the living Hell out of me.
",This is one of the best horror films ive seen since i was a  kid the plot was good even the characters were i recommend Naomi Watts for her role and the little girl who played Samara( that girled really scared the hell out of me when she came out of that t.v) and then ending was EXCELLENT.I give this move 10/10 forget those who dont like what i said. You just mad cause i have taste in scary movies than you do.,Null,1,1,2 July 2003
