The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A coming-of-age story!
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower truly is a coming-of-age story. It shows how harsh life can be, but also how beautiful it can be if you have a little hope. By giving the viewers a look into a young outsider's life, the movie introduces us to a few serious world problems that often take action in everyday reality, such as bullying, depression, homophobia, suicide and others. It also reminds us that we should find happiness in little things and that a good friend can light up the darkest tunnel. I recommend you watch this movie as soon as you get the chance because it will completely change the way you look at life thanks to the amazing characters that are telling the story and you will be able to learn a lot from their thoughts and actions. Now, go get yourself some popcorn and enjoy the memorable quotes and good music while watching one of the greatest bestseller adaptations!",10,0,2,6 November 2015
