Blade Runner 2049," an Under cooked rough cut
","I'm a fan of the original, and I was looking forward to seeing this squeal. The look of the film was stunning, but at times felt over the top and contrived. The main character, I never got on side with. He was so blank, plain and uninvolving that I was not drawn in at all. This is a new breed of replicant, one that is fully compliant. He lacks any real drive or passion. He just fades into the background. Even hes' holo girlfriend does not make him attractive to watch. His expressions are like a Ken doll. They never waver or give a glimpse of any kind of inner workings.Sometimes there was great silence, then the music would take over and was over baring. The editing really felt stilted. Like it was just a rough cut. Some scenes meandered, and the gaps between lines felt uncomfortable. Perhaps the director lacks an understanding of English speech and cadence. The plot was slow, and seemed to be all over the place. I thought the main idea was a bit simple. No great philosophical questions about human existence here. I didn't understand the baddie of the film. The new replicant creator, Wallace. He was just 2d evil.The Deckard character comes into the script much too late. The already struggling plot just gets drawn out more. Focus is lost from the main character.Other times it felt like it was giving the audience a big wink to the original movie. The look of some characters, lines from the original. All of this just worked more to distance me from the movie. It also came across as cheesy and naff. Overall I was very disappointed. The script really let it down.Since seeing this film, i have watched the three shorts that fill in the gaps of plot between the original film and this 2049 one. So much more happens in these shorts than the entire whole film 2049. It would have been better if this film covered all of that span, rather than giving us this thin plot that is over stretched.",3,22,47,6 October 2017
