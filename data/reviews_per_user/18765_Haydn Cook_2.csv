The Ring," The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen
","I saw THE RING late last night at an Advance Screening, and I must say that I have never been so terrified.  That's hard to admit - coming from an 18 year old male.  I was shaking for the entire 107 minutes of film time, then all through the credits.  I found my breathing patterns had slowed down, returned to normal, when I woke up this morning.I am quite a fan of the thriller/horror genre.  SCREAM is one of my favourite movies.  But I must say, no movie has ever really frightened me, and I was proud to admit that.  I mean, JEEPERS CREEPERS was slightly creepy for a selected few moments, but the feeling passes quickly - and it was hardly there, anyway.I'm not going to give you a plot summary, an indepth analysis of the story. Those who are interested will go and see the movie.  But I will say, the direction was fantastic.  Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) did a fantastic job. Australian, Naomi Watts was nothing short of flawless. And that little creepy kid, Aidan, was very good, too.I have rated more than 300 movies on this website, but this is only the second time I have left a comment - I was THAT impressed with it.If you don't like horror films, you should still find this as a well-made piece of cinema. THE RING is still more than a 'dumb old horror flick'. It's clever, sharp, and just downright scary.Thankyou for your time.THE RING (2002)  10/10",10,0,0,8 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor is a great film. It mixes sweeping romance with the tragedies of war. All war films should aspire to this level.
","Pearl Harbor is the best film I have ever seen.  Michael Bay's direction is flawless, an almost guaranteed Best Director at the Academy Awards.  Hans Zimmer's music scores are so beautiful and sad, making the battle scenes more intense, and the mournful scenes, sadder.  Randall Wallace has written a screenplay better that his 1995 effort, BRAVEHEART. I've seen this film 8 times at the cinema so far, and it still makes me angry when people flat out say - 'it was crap'.  No one in their right mind could say this movie sucked.  Not liking a movie because of its running time really isn't a very valid reason.  A longer movie means it can fit more in it. I would say that Pearl Harbor is a combination between ARMAGEDDON and TITANIC.  This film is so watchable and entertaining, the love story really couldn't have been much better.  It was the most entertaining way to start the first 80 mintutes of the film. Ben Affleck has outdone himself, giving an even better and more mature performance as Rafe McCawley. Josh Hartnett is going to be such a huge star after this film, as well as Kate Beckinsale.  She put in a flawless performance.  How beautiful is she? Don't listen to insane people who put this film down, if you haven't seen Pearl Harbor, please hurry and do so.  If you have seen it, watch it again.",10,5,10,9 June 2001
