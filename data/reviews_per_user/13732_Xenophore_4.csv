Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An excellent beginning
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but there are a couple of things that nag at me.1. Did the Force have to be explained in biological terms?2. Could Jar-Jar Binks be any more annoying?I read someplace that George Lucas' adopted son was 6 years old when he started making this movie and that George made it for him. Maybe he should wait until his son is about 12 before he makes the next one.",6,0,1,7 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Love the series, hate the movie
","If you're expecting a two-hour episode of the series, that's not what you're going to see. Although the movie title includes the word 'uncut,' the word is that some things had to be cut to get the 'R' rating instead of 'NC-17.' If this is the tame version, I'd hate to see what was removed. At the theater where we saw the movie, an usher was posted outside the door handing out movie passes as people left during various parts of the movie when they exceeded their individual offensiveness tolerances.If Stone and Parker had made a two-hour movie with the offensiveness level of a normal episode, it would have been a popular movie, but perhaps moviegoers might have left the theater thinking they hadn't seen anything new. If they had made a two-hour movie with the offensiveness level of 'The Spirit of Christmas,' I think we would have been reminded of what we saw in that original short that made us want to see a TV series. However, by releasing the movie they did, I think they may have killed the proverbial golden goose; I'm not sure I can watch the series anymore as it might remind me of the (for lack of a better term) assault to which we were subjected tonight.",2,0,8,3 July 1999
Pitch Black," Just when they're about to lose you...
","I went to see this movie with two friends of mine and was not sure what to expect. I got the feeling during the whole movie that, just when I thought, 'This could get cheesy really quick at this point,' I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't. This could have been a really bad movie with very little effort, but, instead, it turned out to be a good, solid piece of work that kept me interested in what happened to the characters the whole time. Granted, there were a couple of characters that I hoped wouldn't die but did, but there were also a couple of characters I ended up hoping would get horribly eviscerated and, thankfully, they were. I'm confused as to how this movie gets called 'scary' by some. Full of nasty, dangerous situations at practically every moment in the movie, yes, but scary? Anyway, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.",8,0,0,19 February 2000
The Matrix," What a rush!
","This is the best movie I'll see this year, except, maybe, 'Star Wars.' At the end, my friends and I had headaches due to oxygen deprivation from forgetting to breathe for two hours; it was that much of a thrill ride. My only questions now are, 'When does it come out on DVD?' and 'Can I pre-order it?'",9,0,0,3 April 1999
