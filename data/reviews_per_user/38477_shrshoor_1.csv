First Man," First man, BORING!
","I thought this was gonna be a great movie but it was too slow. The camera was upclose and after the first 30 mins my eyes were hurting already! The movie was also too boring! The events and everything was going by so slowly. Especially when he finally,after 2 hours, got to the moon, it took No less than 5 mins to put his mighty foot on the moon's groundðŸ˜  and also in the last seen were he meets his wife again freakin 5 mins to show any emotion whyyyyy?!!
I wish it went a bit faster I feel like the events needed around 1hr 30 mins max but instead they kept expanding everything!",1,9,15,21 October 2018
