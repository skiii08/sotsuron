The Benchwarmers," Insult to ones intelligence
","Just when I think it can't get any worse. The running time of this movie says it all it is the attention span of anyone watching this film. When will Hollywood stop making such garbage? The shock and awe of potty humor is over it just isn't funny. When will actors stop signing up for just a paycheck? When will people stop paying money for such substandard film making? When is enough enough?I love humor it is stupidity I just can't take any longer.Don't bother wasting your time unless you are internally brain dead.To the actors, surely you can do better! At least I hope. If your careers are that washed up then just move on and call it a day.",1,6,11,13 August 2006
The Incredibles," Pure Delight
",How can Pixar get any better?This is animation at its best. The characters in this installment are pure joy and completely original.This is one of the best written film features this year and is purely original. Disney/Pixar has done it again.This is a movie you can easily sit through for multiple viewings. A real cleaver film. The voices of the cast are simple brilliant and as for a super hero type theme it is one of the very best. I hope it is considered at Oscar time for original screenplay as I feel it is well deserved.,8,0,1,6 November 2004
