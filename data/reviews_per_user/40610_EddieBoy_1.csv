Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaah, Baby!!
","I was at an advantage as, although having seen most of the trailers and hype, most of my friends that had seen TPM said it was crap- genuinely. So I think they suffered from being over-hyped by the Lucas-machine. Consequently when I went to see it I wasn't expecting anything special.My impression was that it was slightly messy for the first hour and a half-ish, that there were some slightly irratating bits, and that the script wasn't great.However, the special effects were brilliant (but actors could have been used more than the digital enhancement in some places), and the story came together well in the last half hour-ish.You can judge movies on many criteria, acting standard, script, cinematography etc. etc. For me though, some films lack the crucial ingredient that gets you emotionally involved, you know that feeling you get but can't describe when you come out of a film that has moved you. You almost can't walk. Star Wars TPM had that in buckets, especially the brilliant lightsabre fight at the end!!Despite the first 3/4rs, which was due to having to start somewhere and give a quick but detailed account of characters so I can forgive that, it was a great film. I felt I had watched a part of the story that is the Star Wars saga, and that was the most important thing.And Austin Powers TSWSM, is out now, what a great summer!",Null,0,0,27 July 1999
