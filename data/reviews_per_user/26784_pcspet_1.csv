The Finest Hours," Great Movie!
","Just saw it. I think many will enjoy this movie definitely worth the price. I will buy it on DVD as well. I usually don't write reviews, but had to as this was a nice story. How can you not enjoy what our men and women's sacrifice for our country trying to help mankind. Some movie critics must be nuts! Loved the story and the adventure scenes. I actually served in the USCG and was in something similar. Brought back a lot of memories. Anyone who doesn't like this film must be unpatriotic and not into saving lives. You will enjoy this movie as the Coast Guard is always helping our people everyday. I was surprised this was a Disney film, but they did a great job. The acting was good as the actors were not top stars, but did a good job reenacting the story.",10,3,12,30 January 2016
