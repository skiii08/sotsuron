The Avengers," Best Written Film of this Genre Ever?
","It is appropriate that this film was better than the sum of the films that preceded it. It is very close to be the best written film of it's genre and it ought to be in the Oscar running for best screenplay. Just a few redundancies from other films kept this film from becoming great and those redundancies may have been mandatory as this type of film has to be slaved to a legacy of comic history. It was the first film of it's type, at least to my knowledge, that generated appropriate spontaneous uproarious laughter/cheers from the audience from brilliantly surprising scenes. And you won't see them coming, they will just happen. The acting is uniformly excellent throughout. A highly recommended film.",8,3,8,8 May 2012
The Dirty Dozen," Entertaining but an awful war movie
","As war movies go, it's pretty pitiful. However, the casting was excellent and as a result the movie makes good entertainment but don't expect to be educated in any fashion about WWII. It's a classic example of a poorly produced and written movie literally being carried by good acting. This movie is more of a farce than a serious film. But then again the audience that loves this movie doesn't have high expectations or intelligence and of course it is always good to the see the particular cast. But if it turns up on TV I won't turn it off as it is so much fun to watch the excellent combination of A and B list actors. Lemon Tree o so pretty, lemon flower smells so sweet, but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat--Trini Lopez's hit song pretty much sums up this movie. Even Trini, non-actor, was good in this flick.",4,5,8,21 June 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Ca-Ching, this one appears to be done solely for the money
","Although I enjoyed the Lord of the Ring trilogy, I found this film to be very poor in terms of visualizations, costuming, plot, and character development. The film can't make up it's mind if it wants to be serious or slapstick. As a result it's a muddle of fantastically silly contrived action scenes, poorly made up Dwarfs (apparently proper make up was not important to the budget), and lifeless script that didn't even try to make the adventure interesting. What is really disappointing is that this film had an opportunity to excel, but Jackson did not attempt it. I get the impression that this part of the story was not interesting to him so he just tried to get past it in the hopes that the second film will make up for this close to crummy effort. This is not a film I would want to see again. I can't say the film was a complete stinker, but it was not what I expected in terms of professionalism. The good thing about this film it will surely make the second film appear better.",4,6,18,17 December 2012
Avatar," Won't be a classic
","State of the art graphics (which will be surpassed in time) , but everything else is just average or even bad. The helicopter sounds were awful, Cameron doesn't know squat about torque and rpm. The characters were not likable, not ONE likable character, even among the computer generated characters--same problem with Titanic, think Cameron has a personal problem, doesn't want to be upstaged? Steven Lang's character had probably the most promise, but Cameron apparently held him back, would not let him be anything but a one dimensional character. Cameron is not apparently concerned with making this film a classic, just raking in the dough. I don't hate the film, but one time is enough, kind of a kiddie movie. This film is not a disaster but Cameron has no respect for his craft.",6,1,6,26 April 2010
Prometheus," Poor casting/character development ruins Prometheus
","With the exception of Fassbender and Theron, the casting was very poor. These actors had zero charisma. It was a mistake to not cast more well known actors that don't need a lot of character development. Fassbender's character development was the only attempt (Theron didn't need it) and it worked. Guy Pearce would have been great if cast in a real role. The young actor made up as an old guy NEVER works. Pearce, so strong in the trailer was totally wasted in this film. Maybe a prequel might be in store for him, that would be an excuse. The plot also got a bit too coy, it was thought provoking but went overboard trying not to be transparent and not explain ANYTHING (characters while being developed in a film often discover things with the audience...not in this film). Rapace was just awful, no way to compare her to the strength that Weaver had in her many Alien appearances. Overall a disappointment when there was such a good potential story with which to work. Not a film I would want to see a second time.",5,13,22,22 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Trudges On Interminably
","Interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, did I say interminable yet? What a waste of acting talent, the only bright spot was the good casting /production values which made the film tolerable to sit through but I never want to see it again although I did enjoy the first two films and have watched them several times. The directing was poor, the writing was poor, character development was poor, and the actors were not allowed to act to their potential. Scenes were drawn out, some were dead ends (long and drawn out dead ends, perhaps this was an even longer film and too much was cut out to shorten it? The film was as a dirge. Perhaps it should have been named the 'The Dark Knight Trudges On'. Only ONE moment of comedic relief and it was not original but the film was so droll the joke, any joke, was appreciated. This movie could have been standard length and been much better or much longer (with fewer dead ends) and perhaps better. Another film which was clearly done to just rake in the residual dough.",4,14,28,23 July 2012
Flight," Flight is a 'Flight of Fancy'
","Not sure if a spoiler in here but out of an abundace of caution decided to add the warning. I very much disliked this film although Denzel Washington was very good in it. It is a cautionary tale, but it goes way over the top in terms of taking a real issue and turning it into a Flight of Fancy. Nothing in the film is real, everyone is a enabler, everyone things pilots are 'special', which just isn't so, and drug abusers are nice and clean. The world of Flight is a journey to Oz where the brick road is paved with whiskey bottles and cocaine but the characters are flat. The real nastiness of alcoholism and drug addiction is ignored, the only beautiful women are those who abuse drugs and alcohol and alcohol only produces a hangover that can be cured by more abuse. Religion is recognized in this film but it hovers only in the background like a watchful but uninvolved presence, like the Fairy People of Oz who have no strength, no real character. The film itself has no courage, no heart,no intelligence, not even a Toto (unless you count John Goodman's character), as it stumbles along. It gives no revelation, it stands for nothing.",4,3,5,24 February 2013
