It," if you like production value with no a confused narrative and contraditory lore this is for you
","THIS MOVIE HAD A FEW cool looking scenes, but the overall story and narrative were silly and poorly plotted. The acting is NOT as good as everyone says, that little kid from stranger things is possibly the most annoying one of the bunch. One example of where they went wrong, in the original miniseries (which also was garbage to my eyes and ears) the sink scene had a balloon come out and pop blood which was one of the okay scenes but in THIS REMAKE it does a full on evil dead two geyser out of the sink, which addss nothing and actually takes away. ALSO then all the kids proceed to mop it up together to some wham! song or some b.s. like how is cleaning up demonic blood no adult can see a good time? Also at the end, to defeat an eldritch, lovecraftian entity/monster who one second ago can send a kid flying twenty feet with a swipe suddenly gets beaten by 7 little kids hitting it with sticks, WHEN I ENCOUNTER ANCIENT MONSTER GOD THINGS a few hits with a bat and wha lah problem solved. Go watch The Void instead",1,1,2,2 July 2018

American Hustle," A giant mess
","This movies a giant mess that will hold your attention and make you hate every single character since there is no logic to the plot and the director himself said he hates plot only likes character, so you know any action the character makes makes no sense what so ever as long as it was over the top and emotional. Then on top of that mess you have jennifer lawerance just absolutely drop garbage all over every scene she is in, she's terrible and so annoying as well as playing the most annoying hateable character ever written, man she really ruined an already mediocre movie",1,2,4,26 March 2020
