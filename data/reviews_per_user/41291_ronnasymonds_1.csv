Hereditary," What the heck did I just watch????
",I went in with an open mind that I was going to watch the scariest movie of all time...... what???? There were a couple of parts that gave me the jitters but scary not at all. I spent most of the movie with my hand over my mouth to muffle my laughter over the stupidity. The acting was phenomenal but the stories plot was slow and dragged out. By the third act I was ready to ask for my money back cause this had to be a joke and I was being punked..... nope! It continued to an ending that has to win an award for the worst endings of any movie ever.... EVER!It is 2.5 hrs I will never get back and I am still shaking my head over the total waste of time. If your looking for a scary/horror then this is not the movie for you. And for anyone to compare this to classics like The shining and the exorcist needs their critic brain checked. Not even the same ball park my friend.,1,6,15,22 June 2018
