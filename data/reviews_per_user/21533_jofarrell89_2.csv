E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This film really is out of this world!
","E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial Directed by Steven Spielberg in 1982, E.T is one of the definitive films of film history. The film includes every emotion that can be achieved and tugs at every heart string. It also has some of the best special effects ever seen before in a film. It has lovable characters and you can't help falling in love with this film.E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial follows the story of an alien who is accidentally abandoned on earth who befriends an earth boy. It shows their relationship over a short period of time and how close they become after various, heart-warming events.The whole cast is outstanding, especially Henry Thomas (Elliot) and Drew Barrymore (Gurtie) and E.T is brilliant.The film is wonderful for people of every generation and is guaranteed to make every person who watches it reach for the tissues. It is a timeless classic with the only indication it is over 20 years old is one of the characters headphones for his Walkman.I love this film and I would give it 10/10.",10,1,2,28 December 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Excellent, savvy?
","This film is so good, it has all the spark of the original film, while still retaining its originality.Whilst in the cinema, my friends and I were lead to believe that Curse of The Black Pearl was a prologue to this film, because although all the characters are the same and The Black Pearl is in the film, this plot has a bit more definition to it.There are lots of humorous parts of the film, great action scenes, (including a three-way sword fight on a giant hamster wheel) and there are some scary moments, at one point, I jumped around six inches off my chair.I don't want to give anything away, but oh my God, the ending; if you watch this film you will definitely have to watch the next one. I almost started screaming at the screen as the credits came up. That is why I only gave it 9/10 as opposed to 10! It is a great film and I think that the whole Pirates of The Caribbean collection will become classics and Disney's best non-animated work.",9,1,3,6 July 2006
