Ford v Ferrari," Stunning!
","This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, 'If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost', but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!",9,2,2,8 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Did I like it? I loved it!
","Bladerunner 2049 should be seen in a cinema on the biggest screen you can find. I don't often go to the cinema though, which is why I review films long after their release. With a decent TV and surround sound (seriously, this will rattle your bass bins) this still packs a punch though. As I've said before, I'm not one for science fiction, but I do enjoy a good bleak depiction of a dystopian future and Bladerunner is nothing if not that. There are problems here, I don't rate Gosling, but then he's playing a soulless replicant here, so perhaps he's perfect. Same for Ridley Scott, self indulgent and self aggrandising, but Bladerunner is what he does best and seeing as he's handed the controls over to Villeneuve here he seems to get away with it. So despite this not matching the originality of the... original, it is a worthy piece of carefully crafted cinema. Deakins' cinematography is gorgeous. Equal parts cyberpunk sensory overload and sleek desolation and lets face it, a big part of this is all about style. Couple that with Zimmers Vangelis inspired score and you've got a real feast for the senses. Despite Reynolds inadequacies, he's the hero, the focus, present in nearly every scene and thus even I find myself warm to him as he melts in with the bleak industrial nightmare of the future and his world begins to unravel from what he thought he knew wasn't real. Sadly some of the plot points are somewhat telegraphed, but the narrative still ticks along very nicely and for all the stark future-tech, there is jeopardy, a real connection with the characters. When Ford appears though, I couldn't help feel that that kind of presence is what it had been missing for the previous 2 hours. I don't know whether he had it written into his contract that he'd get the best lines, but to be frank, he delivers them all with style, a style that despite his best efforts, Gosling can't touch, not least due to his apparent inability to convey any kind of feeling in that vacant look permanently etched on his face. Is it indulgent? Of course it is. Did I like it? I loved it!",8,1,7,18 May 2018
First Man," Space is cool...
","...there's just no way in getting around it. By rights no film about space expiration should ever be anything other than spectacular. This begins with a stellar opening scene and the story arc flows pretty well from there. True it's a bit by the numbers, with a solid dose of Hollywood tropes, but it's gripping and fun. Much more Apollo 13, than 2001, it's a biopic with the drama ramped up and stylised for a mass audience. Ryan Gosling does what he does best, zero emotion and to the film's credit, it's dirtier, more raw than the aforementioned Tom Hanks yeehaw America is great advert. It's not super in depth, but the loss of life in the space program is front and centre and this does give it a more realistic edge. The best thing though is the sound design. Not to take anything away from the lovingly recreated grim reality of 60s space travel, but there's a subtlety in the sound work that lifts this just that bit higher.",7,1,3,12 June 2019
Requiem for a Dream," I have a bit of a hot and cold thing with Aronofsky
","Pi remains one of my favourite films if not my favourite of all time, but then he's made plenty of rubbish too (The Fountain, Noah). Despite the acclaim that Requiem for a Dream gets, I always put it on the cold list, it quite literally left me cold. I thought it was time I gave it another chance though, maybe I'd just caught it at a bad time, perhaps I'd been unfair to it all these years. Mansell's score right away is something to enjoy, it's rich, immersive, ever present and it's superb. Picking right up from where he left Pi. The style that Pi had though is lost a little, but it does have something about it. Simple neatly composed shots, it flows like it's been storyboarded meticulously. The camera kept tight, often abstract. All that. I like. The jump cuts and split screens, spinning overhead shots get tiresome though, it's relentless. BUT that I think is the point, it's a war of attrition, beating the viewer down as the world of all the characters falls apart. There are several shared actors with Pi, in fact I think the entire cast is present, but here the characters portrayed, I simply didn't care about. It's heartless and distressing, packed with (now dated) 90s visual effects, fisheye lenses, speed ramping, audio distortions. If Lynch were in charge it may have worked, but where Lynch carefully crafts this stuff, Aronsofsky goes for the full kitchen sink. Ultimately it's just bleak without the artistry. A damning portrayal. Of drugs. Of society. Of America. Of celebrity. Of television. Of addiction to what people think they need in life. Slaves looking for the high, looking to be accepted. It is utterly depressing and for all its positives, that's the reason I don't like it. That all said I don't think I hate it as much as I once did.",6,1,1,27 October 2018
Your Name.," Gorgeous!
","It may be a fantasy, it may be animated, but this is both beautiful and brilliantly entertaining. Mitsuha lives in a small idyllic Japanese town, but dreams of something bigger. Being a teenager, being the mayors daughter, she wants out. Taki lives in Tokyo, goes to school, works in a restaurant. When they go to sleep and dream, they switch places. They don't know why, but as they begin to understand what's happening they leave messages for one another to try to navigate each other through lives. Mitsuha seems to enjoy the excitement of Taki's life in the big city. Taki though finds her a meddling influence in what should be his life. There's a suggested spirituality to all this, with Mitsuha's grandmother explaining the concepts of connections, strings through time, through worlds. Despite this, it does occasionally have the tone of an American teen comedy, but it's far too gorgeous to be so one dimensional. On numerous occasions my breath away is taken away by the level of detail, not just in the animation, but the cutting and the plot. It's lovingly crafted with a staggering amount of patience. It doesn't really create a fantasy world in the way that so many Studio Ghibli films do, it's seems more interested in inserting a fantasy element into an otherwise normal everyday world. Then, just as it begins to feel normal, the switches stop and Taki sets out to find Mitsuha. The comet shower that appears to have been linked to the connection, turns out to have destroyed Mitsuha's village 3 years before she ever met Taki. Are they dreaming through time, is she a ghost? It does get a bit complicated, especially when reading subs and it's very sentimental, but I really enjoyed it. Mitsuha and Taki are connected through space and time, a bond that cannot be broken and delivers a fantastic finale that had me gripped! Comets, out of body experiences, an engaging love story and it really does look gorgeous too.",7,0,0,11 April 2020
Hereditary," It was all going so well...
","The tone is set here within the opening camera track, a slow pan across an attic room with elaborate plans pinned to the wall and an epic diorama style model house. As the camera closes in and locks into one rooms of the house, there's a knock at the door an Gabriel Byrne walks in. This is gonna be good. Add Toni Collette and a clearly offbeat family attending a funeral and things are set to get pretty strange. I'm gonna cut to the chase, I loved this... sort of. Creepy characters, completely relatable moving through scenes of their lives that make your blood run cold and hold your hands to your head in moments of unfathomable discomfort. The supernatural occurrences would in other less considered films annoy me, but here their little subtle interventions work beautifully (to begin with), heightening the tensions and the pain of tragic loss. Byrne is the anchor, the normal in the descending chaos. His togetherness though allows Collette free reign to let loose, she's ferociously brilliant. Yes there are a few tropes and you could say it follows some familiar thriller territory, but for much of the film it's fun. Sadly the final act, perhaps predictably just crosses the line and it goes from interesting supernatural thriller to surreal twoddle. Bloody shame really as it was doing so well. Still, there's some entertaining stuff here and if you can see your way to forgiving the last half hour, it really is quite a good watch.",6,1,3,27 December 2019
Lifeboat," Packed with drama, tension and a story deeper than the ocean they find themselves alone on.
","This is a bit of a rarity, a Hitchcock film I've not seen before. I discovered Hitch in my teens and became obsessed, watching and loving everything I could get my hands on. How this slipped the net I'm not sure, but I'm mighty pleased I've caught up. Nearly 75 years old, this is still faultless with a wonderful cast of characters, stuck in a lifeboat after a U-Boat takes out their WW2 ship. The dialogue is masterful and the delivery more so. Tallulah Bankhead is particularly mesmerising. The camerawork simple, before the trickery and techniques of later films, but still amazingly effective. Packed with drama, tension and a story deeper than the ocean they find themselves alone on.",9,1,1,18 May 2018
Gravity," Enjoyed it... again.
","It's been a while since I watched this, but it's a nice brief (by today's standards) 90 minutes that fit well into the afternoon. I first watched this in a cinema in 3D with one of those chairs that shakes you around. I'm not a fan of gimmicks, or 3D which is largely a gimmick, but I have to admit it worked wonderfully for this film. It is after all a film about floating around in space with several occasions to shake the hell out of you. That's not all there is to it though. Yes it's sentimental at its core and follows are fairly predictable story arc, but it's still looks fantastic, rattles along at an engaging pace, sounds incredible and sets your teeth on edge. There's some nice shots and tricks, making full use of the fact that very little is real in camera, pulling in through the helmet glass in the opening act. It's also nice to see a strong female lead, I'm not a big Bullock fan, but she seems to fit this role perfectly. Clooney does his roguish clown thing well, adding that counter humour to the ramping tension. Yes it has an air of 'Really, what the hell is gonna go wrong next', but it's a disaster movie, plain, simple and I really enjoyed it... again.",10,3,3,22 September 2019
The Death of Stalin," Utterly Fantastic!
","A dark comedic depiction of the terror inflicted by Stalin and those around him. As utterly bizarre and bad taste as that sounds, this is utterly fantastic. The cast as incredible as you'll see in any film, Buscemi and Beale especially, but really, everyone is flawless. The dialogue is hysterically delivered without even the hint of a Russian accent and the whole thing has an air of farce, but one surrounded with firing squads, power struggles and gulags. Only Simon Russel Beale as Beria really terrifies, with back stabbing, double crossing and a plot as twisted as the deceptions on screen, but really it's Jason Issacs that steals the show, his entrance and performance is nothing short of majestic! Hello!!8/10",8,11,15,29 September 2018
Train to Busan," Zombies on a train.
","Zombie film. Surely there's too many of these. This one though I've heard is rather good. Not snakes on a plane, but zombies on a train. Bear with me... We're in Seoul, Seok-woo and his young daughter Soo-an are heading to see his ex-wife, who lives in Busan. Even as we leave Seoul, something isn't right. A sky-rise on fire, partial reports of a leak at a plant. We know zombies are imminent having seen a deer reanimate in the opening scene... looks really cool actually. The train pulls away, but not before one of these now human zombies that we've half spotted in the periphery gets on board. Seok-woo isn't the most attentive father and falls asleep as their journey begins, leaving his inquisitive daughter to roam the train, just as things are getting weird. Now let's get to the point... are the zombies any good? Well yes, yes they are! They're quick, coming to life in bone cracking yoga poses, all snarly, rapidly covered in convincing looking blood and the camera cuts are choppy at breakneck speeds. Add lots of flesh ripping and screaming and we're on the right track, so to speak. It quickly becomes clear that life outside the train is a bit buggered. Zombies everywhere, standard apocalypse. Thanks to YouTube clips viewed on phones and a government news broadcast on the trains TV, urging people to stay home to remain safe (that sounds familiar), the passengers realise the scale of the situation and panic accordingly. So we've a microcosm of society on board, half the train infected, half okay. Separated by a barricade of luggage, a door and the zombie stupidity at not attacking because they can't see their prey. If that were it I'd say this film was in trouble, but an ill-advised stop does manage to rid the train of a few zombies, provide respite for the now few survivors and add some meat to the back story bone. It's here too that the film takes on a disaster movie tone. There's a plan now. Back on the train, there are people trapped in random cars and toilets, including Soo-an now separated from her frankly quite useless father. It gets a bit more inventive and this is accompanied by some of the characters stories getting fleshed out a little more... but only a little. It does look cool, there's some great sequences and the characters although a bit one dimensional are good enough to carry it. There are clear favourites you want to root for and those you can't wait to be zombie fodder. I think though that I was expecting more and expectations are always dangerous. If you like zombie films, you will love this, but if you're after something a bit meatier, this I think comes up short. Su-an Kim, as the young Soo-an really is the stand out. Some of the other performances are good, but she brings her A-game and really is the glue that holds it together. A good zombie film is always worth a watch and this is, but it's only that, a good zombie film, nothing more... and that zombie deer in the opening scene really does look cool.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
Darkest Hour," A story of the stuffiness of politics and the strategy of.
","I always find accounts like this interesting. A window into past events that otherwise we wouldn't see. That said, although this is wonderfully acted, masterfully visualised, is it a touch over stylised, much in the way that the BBC would handle any period drama. There are undeniable moments of cinematic power, but I'm sure it over simplifies things. Much has been made of the train scene for one and yes it's a bit sappy, needless and completely out of step with the rest of the film. There's a great deal of humour and even whimsy, a story of the stuffiness of politics and the strategy of, rather than the war itself and overall it's style is it's own undoing. Although Oldman predictably is the centrepiece, it's Kristen Scott Thomas that excels for me, she's fantastic and even Stephen Dillane as the villain of the piece Halifax is exceptional (he's great in The Tunnel TV series too), but it does all feel like a 90 plus minute build up to that speech and although it is rousing when it arrives, it's too little too late... for the film, thankfully not for actual events.",6,2,2,2 December 2018
The Babadook," Tense Aussie thriller
","Tension is fun isn't it. Right from the outside this has it in spades. Sparse swathes of near silence punctuated with loud noises, innocent at first, but constantly building. Our two main characters are damaged, the mother wears it on the outside, the child more internal, but between them the issues slide deeper and darker. A family failing to recover from tragic loss of a husband and father. The simple car crash device could seem hackneyed and their house, minimal grey and drab, well, what I'm saying is the tropes are all there. The spooky kid, a conduit for the unseen terror that lurks and the consuming madness it brings. What's real, what's fiction, as the mother's sanity unravels. It's fun to get mixed up in the fantasy, but there's something much more interesting in looking at what's driving this, the mother's depression, delusion, anxiety, sleep deprivation, parental inability, it's all fuel for a sometimes formulaic thriller, but one that still works really well. I'm never keen on the supernatural, but when it has some anchor in reality I'm on board and this walks the tightrope just right. It helps that both Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman work so well, especially as the screen is largely theirs and theirs alone and it's nice to see a film that knows how to play to its strengths. Ba ba dook dook DOOK!",7,2,3,28 July 2019
Us," Disappointing
","Expectations. They're a bugger aren't they. Horror has never interested me, but a good thriller, that's another thing. This is a good thriller... but not a great one. I had expected more, perhaps due to things I'd heard, perhaps due to loving Peele's previous outing 'Get Out'. It is fun though, funny even and whilst that is enjoyable, I think that's my issue with it, it's silly, a little too playful. The premise is simple and therefore predicable, with the classic tropes coming thick and fast. That's not to say there isn't enough to unpick in what's being suggested, good/evil, nature/nurture, the existence of a soul, but the delivery felt a bit clunky, largely in part to the second act that felt a bit lazy, bloated and packed with annoying exposition. I'm being harsh though and only because of those damn expectations.",7,0,0,9 July 2019
Knives Out," Who doesn't love a whodunnit?...
","....Especially a really good one. Knives Out has all the hallmarks right from the outset. Police interviewing individuals in the huge country house, where a suspicious death took place. Said individuals all clearly needling one another and all with motives, plus one seemingly innocent bystander. This breaks with tradition pretty fast though, divulging the killer, the circumstance, the whole damn thing... or does it? It certainly leaves you thinking, where exactly is this going? Daniel Craig feels like the lynchpin, playing the gentlemanly PD with the southern accent (American, not British), but this ensemble cast really does pull its weight and it's this cast that helps with the slightly unconventional twists and turns that follow. Suspects thought innocent, repulsive heirs in shady manipulations, red herrings and theories played out onscreen, not quite to Tim Curry levels of genius, but still a lot of fun.",7,1,5,26 January 2020
The Irishman," The weight of expectation.
","The Irishman. Well obviously it's too long, three and half hours is nuts, but with a cast like this, where the hell do you cut? Pacino chews the scenery, DeNiro's the slick backbone, Pesci... I don't know how old he is, but he's still terrifying. Age, much has been said about the de-ageing technique used here and how distracting it is. Personally I found it a bit weird to start but it didn't bother me that much. Plot wise there's nothing new, a vast cast of gangster characters (Stephen Graham is also fantastic) who's stories thread together in predictably violent ways. It looks great, slick with no expense spared and it's nice to see DeNiro in something with some real weight again. The pace is slow, familiar, comforting, with characters that feel like old friends... albeit scary ones. Despite all its methodical twists and turns though, it feels a little thin. Everyone is portrayed with surface detail, I wish there was just a little more under the hood and even with its contemplative tone giving it a bit more depth than the more standard Scorsese mob affair, it really didn't excite me and I was quite relieved when the credits rolled. The rating may seem a little harsh, but expectation killed this for me, but it's worth a watch and may even grow on me.",6,3,7,11 December 2019
Ready Player One," Were do I start with this!!?
","It's over 2 hours a retina searing frenetic action and colour. It's cheesy from the get go, dialogue, plot, but despite the explosions and mind boggling camera acrobatics, there's never any danger. It's fun, schmaltzy and probably the geekiest thing I've ever seen. I'm sure that a good chunk of the in-jokes went over my head, but despite its many flaws, I quite enjoyed the switch your brain off and just smile journey. The whole Shining sequence was rather delightful though.",7,1,4,23 November 2018
"I, Tonya"," Remarkable.
","Bloody hell if there wasn't an undercurrent of dark farcical humour to this, you'd cut your wrists inside 20 minutes. I can't say I knew much about Tonya Harding and I'm gonna take all this with a pinch of salt. What we have here is what I suspect is the general gist of events, but with the drama dialled up... and there's a lot of drama. Harding is not a quiet character and Margot Robbie plays her with the volume turned all the way up. Poverty, casual domestic violence and an expletive count that scores 10 across the board, it's pretty gritty or perhaps as Harding suggests during videotape style pieces-to-camera, it's real. It's all punctuated with some really lovely stuff on the ice with the camerawork being almost as spectacular as the skating. This film though isn't about finesse, it's about the lack of and works as a perfect accompaniment to Harding herself. It's a raw struggle of pretty stupid people, living in a stupid class system, in a country that appears, at least in part obsessed with competition and hatred. A quite remarkable story, told remarkably.",8,2,3,2 January 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," I've always had a bizarre soft spot for desolate America.
","I've always had a bizarre soft spot for desolate America. It's cinematic landscapes, it's seemingly endless time and simplicity, it's atmosphere of the forgotten. Ebbing Missouri has all this. It also has Frances McDormund in all her powerhouse, scene chewing majesty. She's not alone though, the cast here is fantastic! Absolutely, razor sharp, gut punchingly brilliant. This is a serious story though, about rape, murder, injustice, power, corrupt institutions and family values, it's not light hearted whimsy. But make no mistake, if you get into trouble, you want McDormund in your corner. Look up badass in the dictionary and you'll be greeted with a picture of 'Mildred Hayes' staring back at you, ready to deliver a line that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up so far, you'll give the nearest deranged hedgehog a run for its money. All this makes this imminently watchable, with a slew of complex characters living in that aforementioned simple world, every scene delivers beautifully with not a single wrong turn. The script is dynamite, one amazing line after another, 'You do not allow a member of the public to call you fuckhead in this station house' or 'This time, the chick ain't losin'. Whether it's the unusual verbal dexterity of Rockwell or the facial inferences from Harrelson, despite the seriousness of the crimes surrounding this story, the black humour delivers epic vistas of light and it's absolutely glorious!",9,1,4,18 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Style over content
","I'm not a big Queen fan admittedly, but granted they do have some fantastic songs and that's probably the best thing about this, with at least a few genuine hairs on the back of the neck moments. It's enjoyable, but the very definition of style over content. Malek is good, possibly great, with plenty of attention to detail (Dental Prosthetics by Fang FX Ltd.), but the rest of the band/cast are bloody awful and it slips into caricatured nonsense far too many times. This could've and should've been so much better, but it's been ground down so much it feels like a sanitised TV drama. To be fair though, Queen are nothing if not theatrical and this is every bit the 'Keep the masses happy Performance with the capital P'. A greatest hits... but the subtlety is missing.",7,0,0,13 June 2019
The Killing Fields," Humanity at its very worst.
","I didn't know much detail about the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia, the war through the 70-90s and to be honest there's not that much detail here. It's a dramatisation of true accounts and it's much more graphic than I was expecting. It's a film about a war though, it was never going to be pleasant. It's one of those films that always crops up on best of lists though and although those lists are often a bit crap, this certainly isn't. It's exceptionally tense, threat forever imminent in every scene and for all it's brutality, it's astonishingly good... but make no mistake, referring to anything like this as good, feels very alien. The events depicted show humanity at its very worst.",8,0,0,18 May 2018
Baby Driver," This is slick. Maybe too slick.
","This is slick. Maybe too slick, but from the opening car chase and the carefully choreographed sequence that follows, everything hits the beat. It's as much about music as it's characters and the heists they're involved with. It's fun. A bit dumb and full of... well predictability really... but mostly it's fun!!",6,4,7,18 May 2018
American Psycho," Magnificent.
","If I'm honest, I'm only here for Huey Lewis. Just kidding... although I do love Huey Lewis. I do love this film too though. It's a rare occasion where I like the film as much as it's source, maybe even more than. Easton Ellis' book is a masterpiece, even more gruesome than what's committed to screen here, but what it doesn't have is Christian Bale. He's on fire here, my favourite performance (he's also great in The Machinist and Le Mans 66). Here though, as Patrick Bateman, the meticulous psychopathic yuppie, he's magnificent. Bateman is cinematic gold, good looking, successful, intelligent and articulate. He's also a stone cold, calculating killer. For an 80s yuppie, that most loathsome of sets, he's oddly captivating, every bit the anti-hero. Narrating as he goes, Bale's voice sounding unnervingly like Easton Ellis... or maybe Easton Ellis sounds like Bale?... or Bateman! Anyway, perhaps it's the world in which he operates and it's depiction that makes this work so well. Hyper-stylised restaurants with pretentious names, minimal apartment layouts, the obsessing over business cards and Bateman's desire to fit in, but his competitiveness not allowing him to do so. This all provides a sleek clean surface for Bateman to cover in blood with devastating effect. He's annoyingly likeable... until he kills a homeless man and his dog. However on the flip side, minutes later, it's Huey time! Gleaming Axe, transparent raincoat and the idiot Jared Leto lured back to Bateman's apartment. Paul Allen (Leto) you see has upset Bateman. He has a better haircut, can get reservations at in vogue restaurant Dorsia, even has a better business card and mistakes him for someone else, as do several others. He's in trouble and it's not long until he's hacked to pieces as 'Hip to be Square' blasts out. This though might be his undoing as private detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is drafted in to find Allen and harass Bateman. He knows something's up, that unmistakable smile meeting Bateman's pouting frown, but their exchanges are more awkward than anything else. It's an odd film, no one is likeable to any degree, sexist Wall Street morons, drugged up socialites. Everyone is vile. There's very little thread to it either, aside Bateman's insecurities. Even the persistent detective feels like a nuisance sub plot to the killing spree. Ultimately it's Bateman's slip into more and more extreme and sadistic behaviour that drives this, with the sight of him running naked and blood splattered through the hallway with a chainsaw and him sweating profusely in designer suits as the minutes pass by being the more notable events. Bateman knows he's coming apart, but his lack of emotions confuse him. As he slides further it's difficult to get a grip if events are real or part of his deepening psychosis. It's chilling in it's pointlessness, but fantastic and makes me want to pick up the book again, but first... I have to return some videotapes.",9,2,2,31 May 2020
North by Northwest," Hitch at his best
","The Bernard Herrmann music, the Saul Bass titles and as those names hit the screen, Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, of course Hitchcock himself, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, as we begin the next instalment of our Lockdown Hitch Retrospective. I adore the energy of this film. Yes it's packed with classic suspense, but it's also a thrilling ride at quite blistering pace. We start in the hustle and bustle of the city as Ad man Roger Thornhill (Grant), gets caught in a case of mistaken identity as the wanted spy George Caplin, wanted by Phillip Vandamm (Mason), he of most wonderful voice. In fact all the voices here are rather special. Right from the get go we're thrust into the murky world of Cold War espionage. Thornhill gets chased by goons, turns out to be an excellent drunk driver and in his attempts to figure out what's going on, only digs himself deeper, with one suspenseful scene after another.
The scenes, oh boy! That aforementioned cliff side night time car chase, the murder at the United Nations building. Literal back stabbing and all before we get to the Prairie stop. The crop duster scene is a stone cold classic, a beautiful contrast of starkness against the otherwise majestic backdrops. Like the cafe at Mount Rushmore, Vandamm's gorgeous home and Rushmore itself. I suppose the chase scene finale over Mount Rushmore is considered the centrepiece, but truthfully any number of locations here would be fitting of such praise. That they're all packed into one film and so cohesively is astonishing. It does feel like it relies a lot on the stunning locations, but the plot really is fantastic. Add to that some classic 50s dialogue and genuine stars delivering it, it's clear to see why this works so well. You forget how funny and charming it is too, Grant delivers some wonderful lines and his chemistry with Saint is pure Hollywood romance. Martin Landau as the sinister and rather bird-like Leonard, personifies the dangerous world this slick production inhabits and in any other film would steal the show. I can't find a single flaw and nor would I want to. North By Northwest makes you want to love it... and I do.",10,1,1,19 April 2020
Dunkirk," This is very stylish.
","This is very stylish. The colour in the opening sequence would not look out of place in a 1950s Hollywood Musical. Nolan loves cinema and this is the definition of cinematic. This though does detract somewhat from the events on screen, harrowing as they are. It's beautifully made though and Nolan puts you right in the heart of the ever increasing tension. Now I don't know how accurate this is, but I'll assume they did their homework and it's close enough to actual events and with that in mind, as with all depictions of war, I'm reminded how utterly hopeless it all seems. I find it impossible to watch things like this and not wonder how I'd cope. It's not a pleasant thought and therefore a good reason to thank Nolan for that degree of separation. The acting is good, the characters work well, but it's all about the spectacle. The dog fights, with cameras twisting in mind boggling contortions, the perilous nature of the lumbering ships, the soldiers, not as individuals, but the mass of people. I'd be lying if I said the hair didn't stand up on the back of my neck when someone shouts hopefully 'Spitfire' as the plane majestically sweeps the screen, but much of the film is build up for the third act, up until then it's all primer, as the time jumps that have kept the film just about ticking converge into the predictable rousing climax. The events that took place at Dunkirk will bring a tear to your eye, as will this film. This isn't so much a war film as a survival film and despite its shortcomings, it's overarching bleakness delivers the point.",7,1,3,18 May 2018
Jackie," There's no light, no let up in the hopelessness.
","I remember watching Oliver Stone's JFK in the cinema in 1991 and being mesmerised by the magic bullet theory. I'm not sure that an in depth knowledge of JFKs assassination is essential here, but it probably wouldn't hurt, as this is looking very much at the aftermath and as the title suggests, this is Jackie Onassis' story, with Natalie Portman representing her very well. She's hurt, aggressive, defiant, all at odds with the character shown before the events in Dallas and certainly how she's depicted to the public. Mica Levi's score is sombre and powerful, it's thick and haunting almost dragging some scenes along in its wake. These two elements make this a very heavy 90 minutes. Not much needs to be said of the motorcade, but needless to say that the way it's dealt with here is visceral. She's bitter and rightly so, there are some heart wrenching scenes that punch through all the formality, but I'm left with admiration for how she coped and to Pablo LarraÃ­n for this retelling. It's honest, addressing her husbands flaws, her fears, but always with an air of feeling wronged and a building tension to want to pick a fight. There's nothing of conspiracy theories or anything to make sense of events. There's no light, no let up in the hopelessness. Still despite all this, it's compelling viewing.",7,0,0,18 May 2018
Yesterday," A bit random, but stick with it.
","I don't know if this is a great film or if it's just the great songs, but it's very good. Yes it's pretty silly, in a cheesy romcom fashion, but it's fantasy, pure indulgent fantasy and boy is it fun. Jack gets hit by a bus during a 12 second worldwide blackout. It's not explained why, that's not the point, let's not get technical, it's fantasy remember. When he comes around in hospital, no one remembers The Beatles, no one except our struggling musician hero. It's a bit random, but stick with it. Himesh Patel it has to be said does play and sing beautifully and for all the charm of this film, the highlights are clearly the musical interludes. That's not to say there's little else here, the cast is pretty impeccable and as instantly lovable as the songs. We get a few little jokes about Oasis and Coca-Cola not existing either and bit part Joel Fry threatens to steal the show on several occasions. Ed Sheeran's fairly lengthy and reoccurring cameo is... well it's cringey really, but still quite amusing. If only for the fact it highlights just how whimsically crap his music is. Alright putting him up against The Beatles is a touch unfair and he's clearly having fun with it himself, having 'Shape of You' as his ringtone when Jack calls him. Of course the elephant in the room is that Jack's rich seam of songwriting is all built on a lie. It all starts with a rollercoaster of excitement as Jack realises that fame and fortune are his, as long as he can remember all the words and figure out the chords. But as things begin to snowball and he's schmoozed by intentionally repulsive American record executives, Jack moves further away from himself, his home and most notably Ellie, his friend, original manager and painfully obvious love interest. It's all very sweet, quite generic and predicable with its happy ending, but it is entertaining and damn those songs are good!",7,1,2,13 November 2019
Independence Day," America! F&@k yeah!!
","Independence Day, a big fat 'Yeehaw America' kinda film... but as stupid as it is, it's bloody good fun. Sure there's nothing complicated about it, it's cut to the chase stuff, spaceships appear within 2 minutes, def cons are mentioned shortly after. Cue lots of booming sound effects to match the flash cuts as we whip around the globe setting up the alien invasion, whilst maintaining the focus on the US Military. Mr President Bill Pullman doing his breathy, I'm really important act, I'm surprised the TV doesn't explode with testosterone. In fact women are pretty much left out of the story altogether. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the US population watched this and thought 'Hell yeah, we'd show those aliens!', truth is though that's not the way to enjoy this film. It's a tongue firmly in cheek sort of ride. 'The LA Police Department asks people not to fire their weapons at the spaceship, you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war'. I mean it's got Will Smith in it, not to mention Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum. It's a sci-fi, disaster movie farce with a massive budget. A budget largely spent on explosions. Landmarks blown up, relentless fireballs, flying cars, all in slow motion of course and the audio balance is bloody ridiculous, speaker killing pyrotechnics coupled with rousing score, followed by cheesy exposition heavy dialogue at half the volume. Ah... the dialogue, seriously who wrote this script, that speech, it's so cringe inducing it made my face hurt, as the characters bumble through a solution to their impending doom. I guess if hostile aliens do ever attack us, sticking the gun toting nutjob country in the line of fire isn't a bad idea, as long as we can handle the endless fist pumping gloating that might follow. It's not aged badly though, it is what it is, daft over the top fun, but I guess I'm a bit more cynical these days and I seriously doubt anyone would green light anything like this now... although they did make Independence Day: Resurgence a few years ago, now THAT was a disaster!",6,0,1,10 August 2019
Toy Story 4," Kaboom!
","My very first thought when this was announced was, do we need a 4th instalment? I've expressed in the past my distaste of sequels and decent trilogies are almost unheard of. Were Pixar willing to risk that for what is surely just a cash in? No probably not, but Disney are! Thankfully though, this is wonderful! Cartoons don't age, but the passing of time is the point here and it's treated deftly. Great characters, great voices, great stories, it's truly magical to escape with Woody & Co. once more on a tense, funny and heartwarming journey, that see's them tackling much deeper subjects than before and themselves becoming much more than mere toys. When the first Toy Story was released it was all about the CGI, as an audience we've moved on so far in the intervening years. Now the mechanics are inconsequential, I completely forgot I was watching an animation. The witty script and rollercoaster plot deliver a 2 hour thrill ride as toys jump out of windows into the unknown, tackle freaky antique dolls and make new fairground friends. Everything is dialled up, carefully orchestrated to make you smile, laugh, shed a tear and white knuckle the remote control. Did we need a 4th instalment? No, we didn't, but I'm sure glad we got one.",8,1,1,16 November 2019
The Princess Bride," To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this...
","Confession. I don't usually like fantasy films. I didn't mind them as a kid and I think I quite liked this, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I'd put it in the same category as Labyrinth. To be fair, they're both films that have garnered cult status. I've not watched Labyrinth in 30 years (nor do I feel the need to), but I'm guessing that this has aged better. I'd forgetten all about the story-telling narration aspect, Peter Falk reading 'The Princess Bride' to Fred Savage in his all- American bedroom, what a bizarre premise that seems, but it's ridiculously charming and effective. The opening scenes are pure schmaltzy over blown medieval romance and would be pretty unbearable without Fred's voice over, rolling its eyes. It's silly, but never really farcical, deftly balancing it's comedic wit with what feels like a genuine love for its characters. Ah the characters, if you're not smiling within 10 minutes, check your pulse, they're all wonderful! I'm hooked... and so is Fred. Let's not beat around the bush. It takes me no time at all to fall in love, it's 100 times better than I recall. Do you like perfectly choreographed swashbuckling sword fights? This has you covered, with added academic commentary from the combatants. Too flashy? How about 'You put down your rock, I'll put down my sword, we'll try kill each other like civilised people'. I'd also forgotten how quotable this is. 'Life is pain (heiress), anyone who says differently is selling something' and of course 'Hello my name is Inigo Montoya, prepare to die.' The dialogue really is bloody flawless, littered with fun quips and even the haughty grandising from Prince Humperdink is fun. He is the weak link here though if there is one. Cary Elwes is absolutely marvellous, his lovely exposition explaining his becoming the Dread Pirate Roberts whilst dodging death in the fire swamp is so simple and effective, it's quite disarming and if you didn't already root for our hero, you do now. Then bang, bloody quicksand! (aka Lightning Sand) and 'Rodents of Unusual Size' cementing it's 80s calibre. If someone made this now (please say the rumours aren't true) they'd ruin it with CGI. You really can't beat a bloke in a giant rat suit. You also can't beat Mel Smith in dodgy make-up or Billy Crystal layered in tons of it. It's around this time too that I realise that Prince Humperdink's right hand man is no other than Nigel 'This one goes to up to 11' Tufnel!! and he's still obsessed with numbers as he cranks up The Machine in The Pit of Dispair. It's all quite simple, the lower class good guys verses the villainous royalty, both chasing the prize that is Princess Buttercup. As we get toward the finale, the threatened wedding of Humperdink & Buttercup, I nearly fall off my chair as Peter Cook announces 'Mawwage is what bwings us together today'. It limps a little as the final minutes draw in, but Andre the Giant keeps the tone light as Buttercup is inevitably rescued, Inigo avenges his father and the as the fairytale ends, I'm left with a warm smile. To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this, 'Inconceivable!'",9,1,1,8 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Vivid and spectacular!
","You know what you're getting with a Tarantino film. Retro love letters, slickly produced, with vivid colours and sharp needle drops. This is no different, long drawn out scenes, beautifully shot in the Hollywood hills. It all starts happily, pool parties, driving cars in the sunshine, but this is Tarantino, it's not going to remain pleasant. There's a tangible tension and threat of violence, largely due to the thread of Charles Manson's infamous Tate murders running through the story. That's only part of what's on offer here though, the DiCaprio/Pitt double act for a large portion of the film drives the narrative, before finally connecting, in a fictional melting pot. Now there's often an issue when depicting true events with the sort of sheen that Tarantino employs and that's most evident in some of the casting here. Most of the main players are fine, Pitt in particular, but then his role is essentially fictional. DiCaprio is fine too, but doesn't really fit the TV cowboy he's meant to be. Damian Lewis playing bit part Steve McQueen is way off though and there's some inexplicably narrated exposition. It's things like this that spoil Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Much has been made of the Bruce Lee depiction too, but as pretty awful as Lee is, Pitt again steals the scene. He does that a lot, take him out of this and you've got a much worse off film. This is Pitts thing though, cool Americana, embracing it's ridiculousness. The whole thing is dusty and bathed in sunshine, whether the streets of 1969 LA or the mock western film set that DiCaprio works on as he tries to rekindle his failing acting career and curtail his drinking. This slow brooding atmosphere works well, as seeds are sown for impending violence, which is largely bottled until the final act. I have to say though, when it lands, boy does it. Knowing what we know about the true events on Cielo Dr, this telling is nothing short of spectacular. It's not his best film by a long way, but it is better than recent outings. Not everyone likes Tarantino, but I loved this.",8,1,2,31 January 2020
Beasts of No Nation," Heartbreaking and terrifying.
","A film about political and civil unrest in Africa (the specific country is never named) and as heartbreaking and terrifying as you'd imagine. Wonderfully made, the camera work puts you right in the centre alongside these people having their already tough worlds torn apart. It's not easy to watch, the depiction of callous disregard for life, especially seen through the eyes of a child is often too much to bare. As if that's not harrowing enough, what follows is beyond horrific. Incessant killing, exploitation of children, power hungry people with complete disregard for life and any moral standard. In all the confusion it's not always obvious who the real monsters are. As the film goes on though, is seems everyone is and as things escalate, it's hard to except that despite this being dramatised, it's no doubt based on a sad harsh reality. Elba is frighteningly good, so much so, you wonder if you were able to reach into that world, would you kill him and become a monster too. Abraham Attah, who plays Agu, the child who leads us through this brutal world is amazing. This is his first outing and it's quite incredible, I've no doubt he'll go on to even greater things (although he's signed up for a Spider-Man film). The music is the only true positive element of the film itself, be it the traditional stuff or the ethereal score, it's outstanding, but never masks the turmoil of the characters and their existence.",7,2,2,18 May 2018
A Quiet Place," This is my kinda film!
","Right from the opening shots I was sold. Tense. Near silent. Unknown danger. A strange normality settling into a world that is clearly anything but. I don't know why, I've always loved post-apocalyptic stories, but so often they're done badly, this... is... not. This is carefully constructed, meticulously detailed, achingly patient, with its pacing, with its characters. Brimming with an underbelly of violence, the surface still teams with a soft compassion and desire. Now that all sounds rather fluffy I know, that's because watching this I couldn't help but feel enveloped by the love and ingenuity of the on screen family, as they strive and attempt to control what's happening to them, but make no mistake, there's gut wrenching elements here. It's the play between the serene and the peril that makes this enthralling cinema. Edge of the seat stuff, on several occasions making me audibly gasp. The strength here though, as with all good films, is the characters, their defiance, their humanity, without caring for them you've got nothing, but I did care and willed them on through every marvellously terrifying twist. Right I'm off to check the stairs for loose nails.",8,4,6,9 July 2018
Hidden Figures," We better sort this crap out before we think about going into space.
","It's difficult to watch this and not feel some anger, but it's still a great film and a great story. A true story brought very nicely to the screen with typical American sheen. It's all a little sanitised though, maybe through fear of making it too real, showing too much, to the point that I can't help wondering if this would've had even more punch without the slick cuts, well timed musical interludes and 1960s button down cleanliness. That same sheen and humour does bring some fantastic 'Fuck yeah! You show em!' moments though, one of which is cringeworthy, but will make you tingle. Make no mistake, it's powerful stuff and be warned you may not get through this without shedding a tear. It's enjoyable to watch the lead characters battle on regardless, headstrong, proud and more than capable than most around them. At the same time it's frustrating to see them have to work 10 times harder to get a fraction as far and even more so that over 50 years later, discrimination on race and gender is still around today. We better sort this shit out before we think about going into space.",8,0,2,18 May 2018
1917," Stunning
","Much has been made about the technical achievements with this film, the editing creating the illusion of the single take and the long, carefully choreographed shots needed to achieve that. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in this, I stopped counting at five shots though, because of course that's not it's core strength. Granted it does anchor you in the action, you're right there, something not to be sniffed at, but it's the story and those involved that pulls you in. 1917 is as visceral and terrifying as you'd expect. It'll have your jaw quivering on the floor. The story of two young soldiers attempting to get a message, in a race against time, to save hundreds of their like from near certain death, as the Germans plan a surprise attack. Cramped trenches, open countryside, shell beaten towns, people drifting in and out of the narrative. It could've been complicated, but it's the simplicity that shines here and allows the cinematic hopelessness to weigh on you. If there's one thing that films like this share, it's the common portrayal of the pointlessness of war. Lives lost, friends lost, clinging on to hope and humanaity. To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle to put this into words, but it's brutal, amazing, with a brilliant cast all at the top of their game. Stunning.",9,12,19,5 February 2020
Sing Street," It's like an updated Commitments.
","Love this!! It's like an updated Commitments. Slightly less grimy, but still with enough miserable reality to tick that box. It's a lot more hopeful though and sweet. Actually it's not really like The Commitments at all. The Commitments is not sweet. While that film smacks of hope, what's on screen is brutal, dirty and real. Sing Street is a different beast. It's romantic and full of youthful abandon, great music and three fantastic characters in Ferdio Walsh-Peelo (awesome name), Lucy Boynton and the scene stealing Jack Reynor. I defy anyone with a heart to watch this and not gasp, smile and want to punch the air. Fantastic stuff.",8,1,1,18 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Funny creatures, lots of smashy explosions and some terrible acting.
","Finally got around to watching this and blimey, it just keeps going doesn't it. Funny creatures, lots of smashy explosions and some terrible acting. About what I expected really... utter drivel. It really is time to call it a day. I know some people love this stuff and perhaps drivel is a bit harsh. There's a couple of decent lines, the CG is excellent and not all the acting is awful, but the few characters that aren't wooden and predicable are the exception. I really wish they'd stop flogging this long worn out narrative, but it seems that's not on the cards. I'm gonna stop putting myself through it though.",4,8,12,23 December 2018
Midsommar," Creepy folk-tinged dramatic horror, check.
","I was expecting The Wicker Man. Creepy goings on in broad daylight. Although this starts much darker and doesn't have that diy aesthetic, it's hewn from the same tree. A bunch of mostly naive Americans follow their Swedish friend to his commune back home for a summer adventure. Of course they're in for much more than they bargained for as the Swedish friend is more recruiter than the friend they anticipated. It's nuanced though and they put the strangeness that surrounds them as mere cultural difference, which is admirable. Although by enlarge they're simply enamoured by the idyllic utopia they find themselves in and they are portrayed as being pretty stupid to be honest, despite their undergraduate status. Especially Will Poulter who plays the arrogant student with aplomb. He's very good at annoying, at least I always find him annoying. I don't know what it is, maybe it's that he reminds me of Sid, the sadistic kid in Toy Story.
Anyway, back to Midsommer... The ritualistic stuff is front and centre, with everything done for ceremony. It makes for wondrous cinema. Even the more brutal events that happen early on are almost swept aside with acceptance, what goes on in Sweden stays in Sweden. Of course, there's mortal danger and the luscious green fields are a disarming disguise as the comically named Father Odd and his community welcome the newcomers to their 9 day festival of Hargas. It's not long before the unease that we feel reaches the souls onscreen, as totemic signs are left, people are lost and rituals are slowly understood. It's not perfect, but it looks fantastic, builds really well, however it's quite predictable. I try not to put too many of any spoilers in these things, but one look at the poster for this, tells you things aren't going to end well. Despite its slow pace, it rattles along rather well as things get quite horrific for the visitors, but this for me fits into the journey being more enjoyable than the destination category, in that I didn't find the finale that satisfactory. I don't mind the hard cut finish, it can often work really well, but the end sequence was telegraphed a mile off and I was hoping for much much more. All in all though if you like creepy folk-tinged dramatic thrillers, this has you covered.",7,1,4,21 January 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," Still the best!
","It's over 25 years since I've seen this film and I'd forgotten how funny it is. If I'm honest it's not a laugh out loud romp, but more of an constant face splitting smile-fest. Not only is it one of the most quotable films ever made, but probably one of the more original too. I certainly can't think of many if any mockumentaries that proceed it. Dry cutting humour, ridiculous and lovable characters and as much a love letter to rock as it is a piss-take. What's most enjoyable about watching this, now over 35 years old, is how timeless it feels. Sure you'd assume bands aren't like this anymore, but then assume things at your peril. The reason this is funny though is because there's so much honesty. There's a little truth in every joke they say and this walks then line between hilarity and insightful wonderfully. Still the best film about music, bands and the bonkers industry that surrounds it.",9,0,0,26 December 2019
Groundhog Day," 'I'm A God'
","Groundhog Day has taken on a life way beyond its 90s comedy status. The day itself before, was known only in America as being synonymous with the weather. That completely changed when the late Harold Ramis wrote this Bill Murray vehicle. Now it's a worldwide pop-reference for repetition. So simple, utterly fantastic, absolutely hilarious and much more than just an endless loop. Has Bill Murray ever starred in a bad film? Probably, but I don't think I've seen it. Murray you always feel is playing his characters with a good dash of himself included. Bill doesn't give does he and neither does is character here, whether it's nasty Bill at the start or the reborn nice Bill at the end, Bill still has his edge. He feels so natural, it's easy to believe it's all improvised. He's brilliant. Andie MacDowell is the opposite, she's bloody annoying, as sickly sweet as the small American town in which it's set. There's an odd message to this film though, it seems to be about redemption, a bad soul making amends, but there's an undercurrent of manipulation that's quite sinister and points out some of the worst elements of some human nature. True, Phil does eventually find redemption after a lot of soul searching, comedy japes, worthwhile life experiences and deep suicidal depression... hey even that's given a light hearted twist. But it's troubling to see how long it takes him... an estimated 34 years! I love rewatching these kind of films, it's amusing to spot little things you may have missed before, be it little details or even actors, who were unknown at the time, like Michael Shannon playing the newly-wed Wrestlemania enthusiast. Yes it's schmaltzy romcom territory, complete with an end sequence that doesn't quite add up in the interests of happiness, but despite a few formulaic tropes, Groundhog Day is masterful. The premise, the arc, the characters (annoying or not), the intentionally choppy timeline, all of it barrels along beautifully... and at its centre, Bill Murray. 'I'm A God, I'm not The God'. Bill, I couldn't agree more.",9,2,3,7 August 2019
Psycho," Timeless.
","Last night we did The Birds, tonight it's Psycho. I always think of these two being connected, it must be because I discovered them close to one another as they've nothing in common. Psycho has that edge that The Birds doesn't really bother with, largely I suspect because of the shower scene and the abundance of stabby stuff. It's a much smaller cast and simpler in its aesthetic, also black and white. I adore the black and white though, I can't imagine it in colour, one of the many reasons the remake was unwatchable. It starts of course with Saul Bass' cool tiles, maybe only rivalled by North by Northwest in Hitchcock films. Saul Bass is a genius. I'll admit I'd forgotten quite a lot of the early scenes, the scary policeman, the voice over exposition as Marion Crane leaves the city in her car, on the run with her ill gotten gains. It's all about the motel and the house though isn't it, but as we get there that fateful stormy night and as much as I love the shower scene, it's Arbogast's interrogation of Norman that always felt more of a pivotal scene, as Norman gets caught in his lie and his (or his mother's) crime begins to unravel. The tension built with the noir P.I. and his death scene on the stairs I always thought was cooler than the shower... although credit to the shower, Tomasini's cutting is superb. I'd forgotten also quite how much happens away from the Bates Motel with Marion's sister and boyfriend trying to find her and the money she stole, but again this all just helps to make the pacing work as well as it does. Psycho always feels dumbed down to Janet Leigh's famous demise and Bernard Herrmann's groundbreaking score, but there's so much more going on and I love Anthony Perkins' performance. Hitchcock characters can often feel a bit flat, all surface, the lights are on, but Perkins as Norman is genuinely creepy and nails pretty much every scene... apart from maybe that last one as he bursts into the basement with his mum's frock on. Psycho is far from Hitch at his best, but it's still a gripping watch. It had my first time viewing partner switching from 'It's not that scary' in the shower, to 'Oh my God, don't go in the basement!!' for Mother's big corpse reveal. Not shocking by today's standards sadly, but every bit the timeless classic.",9,1,1,13 April 2020
Joker," It's no joke.
","My distain for 'comic-book-superhero-franchise' movies is well documented. This though I'm pleased to say is an altogether different beast and okay it's an origin story for one of the best known villains in comic history, but if you take away the famous make-up, this film really doesn't change that much. It is dark. Exceptionally so. A celebration of the misunderstood outcast, played masterfully by Joaquin Phoenix. He's often great (Her, Inherent Vice), sometimes less so, but here, here he is magnificent. There's no sheen, little colour, rarely any positivity. Everything is worn, damaged, failing. From Arthur's scrawled handwriting to the string instruments gently shredding the score. A balletic bathroom scene is beautifully pivotal, a simple marker turning point for the soft voiced tragic lead, but it doesn't signal a change in tone for the film, just confidence as Arthur begins to negotiate a society that doesn't care for people who don't fit in. It's a two hour bludgeoning with chaos unfurling for both antihero Arthur and the world around him as society rapidly breaks down. That's what this is, simple social commentary.",9,3,6,19 January 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," A good modern update.
","I usually find Branagh annoying, but I have to confess I found this quite delightful (in places). It's not quite as clever as it thinks it is and the expectation of its cast weighs it down, but you'd be hard pressed to fail to deliver with content of this quality and it doesn't. Lots of nice playful camera work, tons of epic vistas and extravagant scenery, characters played flamboyantly over the top. I quite enjoyed it and was thankful for Depp's early departure, when did he last deliver a decent performance? It is missing something though and I suspect it's that it's merely a remake and the question has to be asked, why? I don't think this film answers that well enough, but I still think it's better than the reviews it received. A good modern update to a classic tale and a classic era of cinema.6/10",6,0,1,27 December 2018
Parasite," Perfection.
","There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year.",10,32,54,14 January 2020
Wonder Woman," Now I'm not known for my love of superhero films...
","Now I'm not known for my love of superhero films, but this got a lot of praise on release... So would it be the film to change my mind about this genre? It is good. It's refreshing to see strong female characters, all the female characters in fact and Gadot is worthy of most of the praise she received. The action sequences are fun, Matrix inspired slamfests and there's few good jokes thrown in that did make me chuckle. It's far too long though, with a storyline that (I know its a superhero fantasy plot) is weak, plodding, often boring, unimaginative and generally crap. The cast is pretty underwhelming, with even the usually relieable Thewlis leaving me with a feeling of disappointing lacklustre. It made a killing at the box office, so of course they're making another one, but I won't be bothering. Superhero films are, for me, still a waste of time, in this case over 2 hours of it!",5,2,4,18 May 2018
Marriage Story," Life is messy.
","I've always found both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver kinda cold and there are parts of Marriage Story that feel like that. Two people working successfully in the theatre. A couple, the lead and the director, a team, but one that's lost it's way. A complicated relationship, that she's wants out of, he doesn't and neither does her mother, sister, theatre company, because they don't see what she sees. 8 year old Henry is caught in the middle, except he's not really. Despite going through a divorce they still like each other, respect each other, want to make it amicable, but their lives around them are what causes the complications, namely lawyers. What is it with Americans and lawyers? Anyway, neither Johansson or Driver are cold here, the world around them is, caricatured even, infectious negativity, but they are the warm, sincere, beating heart of this really sad film. It's heartbreaking and painful to watch as they try to navigate their way through this difficult time and frustrating that they don't help themselves, despite seeming more than capable.

Mother!," Despite looking forward to this, I went in expecting the worst.
","Despite looking forward to this, I went in expecting the worst. For every great Aronofsky film, there's a crap one, maybe even two. That said, whenever asked about favourite films, Pi is always first to my mind. So... Mother! First things first, this is an unusual film, with unusual people, living unusual lives, in an unusual house. A Seemingly calm world unravels with Lawrence at the centre of the storm, sensing there are more characters than the ones walking around her house, destroying the peace she craves. This is the kind of film you want to climb inside to stop the intruding madness. It borders on infuriation, with Bardem as the ringleader, inviting destruction into their world. There's several metaphorical layers to unpick and it's difficult to do so on one viewing, themes of fame, family, commitment, control and creativity. The house being the melting pot of life at the heart of it all, designed to get you second guessing. Time and perception become irrelevant as any humanity is forgotten in a war of attrition of godlike proportions. It's a diabolical mess. It's quite excellent... but it's not Pi.",7,0,2,18 May 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Odd mix...
","So this has had some mixed reviews and I can see why. Anyone who's watched the trailer and isn't caught a little off guard by the sight of a jovial Hitler... well surely those people don't exist anymore. Anyway it's clearly meant as offbeat satire, something that director Taika Waititi is known for and known to be fantastic at (What We Do in the Shadows). It is funny 'Get together kids, it's time to burn some books'... but really not nearly as funny as it needs to be to get away with this kind of humour. Mel Brooks' Hitler in The Producers was funny, an out an out piss-take, but here the comedy doesn't seem quite farcical enough. For every 'We have a job for you walking the clones', there's people hanging in the town square and Jews hiding for their lives. It's a really odd balancing act. I'm not going to slate it, I think it tries really hard to poke fun, but it's just a really difficult subject to have fun with, especially when the story is told through the eyes of a member of the nazi youth clinging on wilfully to his indoctrination. It's an odd mix between the Diary of Anne a frank and Moonrise Kingdom, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, laugh a little and find it interesting. Sam Rockwell is pretty great, Scarlett Johansson is good as the closest thing to an anchor and voice of reason against nazi propaganda, Rebel Wilson though is a bit annoying. There are some genuinely great lines 'There are no weak Jews, I'm descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants, we were chosen by god, you were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full moustache', but I'm really not sure what to make of it and might need to watch it again. The scenes between the two young leads are intriguing and offer the most depth as the nazi gets an education he doesn't realise he needs. A visit from the Gestapo is a shocking leveller though amongst the frivolity and again makes the humour feel oddly misplaced. Some will love this and quite understandably so, others will feel uncomfortable, but regardless I think it's a must see film... probably more than once, if only just to see Hitler kicked through a window.",7,6,16,3 January 2020
Rear Window," Perfection.
","My joint favourite Hitchcock film (the other being North By Northwest). This is just perfection. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and a cast of top class support flex their muscles through 2 hours of dramatic, mysterious, speculative bliss. If the apartment bound Jimmy Stewart isn't enough as the action hungry photographer in search of adventure from his wheelchair, you have his girlfriend Grace Kelly, bringing pure class with some socialite sophistication. J.B. (Stewart) really is punching way above his weight. On top of that you've got Thelma Ritter as nurse Stella with the razor sharp wit threatening to steal every scene she graces. J.B. is seeking danger, missing his assignments having acquired a broken leg in the last one two months ago. He thinks he's found it too, through his telephoto lens looking out of his rear window at a myriad of stories in every one of his neighbours apartments. He has an over active imagination, his paranoia growing at what he witnesses, much to the annoyance of Lisa (Kelly) who wants him to settle down and join her in respectable social circles. He draws you in though and Lisa too, who senses excitement as they find some much needed common ground and the conspiracy grows with each new snippet of information. It's a breath of fresh air, as the dialogue drops and we watch the windows, picking up fragments of sound and snap shots of actions. Almost like silent film in places. This is Hitchcock at the top of his game, ramping up the tension as we near the flawless finale with the danger dialled up and a killer on the loose! Surely everyone has seen this film? But on the off chance you've not, stop what you're doing and watch it right now.",10,1,1,16 April 2020
The Truman Show," Was nothing real?
","Jim Carrey is an odd one isn't he. Much loved for his slapstick stylings, I've never really warmed to that side of him. The Truman Show is different. Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. 'We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented', but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. 'Was nothing real?'... well who knows!",8,1,1,31 July 2019
Life," Endless trope-fest
","Revolving weightless camera down spaceship corridor, check. Gratuitous use of lens flares, check. Talking to Earth via video link, check. This thing is packed with sci-fi space film tropes... and that's before the science stuff inevitably goes haywire and the experiment escapes. Cue losing contact with Earth, check. The need for a dangerous space walk, check. Creepy fast growing alien, check. Heroic only one of us can make it, I'll go, no I'll go, check. It really is ridiculous unoriginal twaddle. My TV threatened to go into stand-by mode, with about half a hour to go and I seriously considered letting it. $58 million they spent on this crap, someone should be blasted into space as punishment!",3,6,12,17 February 2019
Green Book," Prejudices take many forms.
","I'm not intentionally watching films that show America in a bad light I promise. Sure it starts all fun and games, with gangsters, punch-ups and nightclubs, give it a few minutes though and we cut to the chase, racism. There's much more going on here than just black and white. Throw in cultural differences, class clashes, homophobia, it's a melting pot of issues. Sometimes played for laughs with the racism matter of fact, sometimes not, with blood drawn. Prejudices take many forms. The balm that eases tensions, teaches respect... music. As Viggo Mortensen's character says 'It's a complicated world', but watching him and Mahershala Ali, learn from each other as they travel the deep south really is pretty wonderful. As the (true) story progresses, you could be forgiven for thinking it's getting a little softer, twee, less edgy, but really it's just hopeful. In a country that still has race issues, it needs all the hope it can get.",7,2,3,2 January 2020
Annihilation," We're in firm sci-fi thriller territory, but it lacks an edge.
","A straight to Netflix film, there's now calls to get this a theatrical release. So is it worthy? We're in firm sci-fi thriller territory, but it lacks an edge. The darkness not quite dark enough. Portman and Jason-Leigh are good albeit a bit empty... perhaps purposely so, but there's a lot riding on Portman, with not enough made of the other characters and ultimately it suffers for it. Slow stark dialogue, long lingering shots, low rumbling drone sound effects, all seem a bit laboured, as does the shimmer effect (a character of sorts in itself) looks a bit like fairy liquid in the sink. I'm being harsh though, the premise is good, a mysterious growing haze taking over an American forest area (always America) with a lighthouse at its centre. Once inside 'The Shimmer' things improve, but it shows it's hand too soon and although there are still engaging events through to the end, the arc is clear. It's a bit like Predator meets The Land That Time Forgot and in the third act it all gets a bit prophetic and jumbled as it tries to help make sense of its increasingly weighty and abstract themes. There's some good ambitious ideas here and credit to Alex Garland for attempting something so grand, but it struggles in bringing them together. Apparently this has divided audiences and I can understand why, it fell short for me. The end titles though are beautiful.",5,1,2,18 May 2018
Incredibles 2," Maybe not quite as good as the original, but still a lot of fun...
","Maybe not quite as good as the original, but still a lot of fun and just as well as they appear to be setting up a franchise (another one). It looks great of course, it's well written, lots of snappy action. The comedy is quite quirky though, aimed as much if not more so at the adults than the kids. Disney are clearly putting their moral stamp on things, equally opportunities, digital dependence, accepting all cultures, but hey that's all very good and it's delivered well. Certainly our kids got the message and were happy to explain it to me as the credits rolled. They also laughed uncontrollably at Jack-Jacks antics, we all did! Not quite Pixar at its very best, but very very close!",7,1,2,19 August 2018
The Breakfast Club," TakeTwo Reviews
","More 80s nostalgia tonight, but the authentic kind. The Breakfast Club might not be classic cinema, high art or even important. It never pretended to be... even with the Bowie quote from 'Changes' in the opening. It's pure pop culture. Typical coming of age stuff, typical perhaps if you're American. Growing up in England, watching this in the 80s, these 5 characters were relatable for their (supposed) youth, but exotic and exciting. School in England is not like Shermer High. These kids had cool haircuts (well Judd Nelson), denim jackets (Nelson again), they didn't even have to wear a uniform!... and Ally Sheedy was cute! I loved The Breakfast Club. Loved. Watching 30+ years on, well it's not the same. Bender (Nelson) is a prick, Claire (Molly Ringwald) is still annoying. Andrew (Emilio Estavez) is a bit flat. Only Allison (Sheedy) and Brian (Anthony Micheal Hall) have anything interesting about them. I'm complicating it though, it's not supposed to be complicated. It's 5 kids serving detention on a Saturday, a gang of mismatched misfits against the teacher. The teacher, Mr Vernon is ridiculous though, like Rooney from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but without the comedy. It's really not aged all that well, but despite all the cartoon antics, it still has heart. Yes it's full of 80s tropes, especially the obligatory nonsensical dance scene, but it's strength is still the outpouring of emotions from each of them. So forgive some now very questionable dialogue.... Bender really is a prick, sit back and enjoy John Hughes in his directorial prime. I'm going to tie a bandana around my boots and rip the sleeves off a flannel shirt.",9,0,0,1 June 2020
The Birds," Caw Caw
","It's been a while since I've been to Bodega Bay, but Hitchcock has been a favourite since I first watched a VHS of this some 30 years ago. Today I'm introducing my daughter to Alfred's avian nightmare. Now if I'm really really honest, The Birds is pretty cheesy. Hammy acting, the lovebirds swaying in the car footwell, not to mention the retro 60s charm of matte effects, but I love The Birds. Even knowing everything that happens before it graces the screen, the tension is gripping and my young companion gasps accordingly. In 60 years on The Birds hasn't lost its magic. Melanie Daniels proving that the rich have a lot of time on their hands, to go flirting with Mitch Brenner in the outskirts of San Francisco. The old fashioned bayside town is really the star for me, even more than the birds themselves and the cast of backwater characters and their simple lives acts as the perfect canvas for something so unexpected as human hunting airborne marauders. We get a 'whoa' as the children sing in the school house as the birds amass and I'm taken back to my teenage self watching in awe as each scene painstakingly builds. Yes it's schlocky, yes Tippi Hedren is a bit wooden and yes it's essentially a single premise slowly drawn out over two hours, but this is one of my favourite Hitch outings and I can't wait to relive more.",10,0,0,12 April 2020
Beetlejuice," Revisiting can be a bit disappointing.
","Is this another musical? Ha no not really, but there are a couple of songs and a lot more grotesque stuff than I recall. The music is courtesy of Danny Elfman of course, as with most of Tim Burtons films, they must really like each other. Burton has an odd view of the world, creating his own with a weird mix of cookie-cutter America, small towns, with dark under-bellies. Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davies) are a young couple living... for a short while in a typically quirky Burtonesque house. Within 5 minutes they're dead, having taken their car for a swim off a nearby bridge and wind up living an afterlife in their house, now covered with dust sheets. Not for long though, the house has new owners, the mum from Home Alone, Ed Rooney from Ferris Bueller and their daughter Winona Ryder, the only one who can see Adam and Barbara, who are trapped in the house, failing in their ghostly attempts to scare off the new occupants ruining their home. So far, it's okay, but things really are a bit slow, despite a couple of quirky scenes involving sand worms and the waiting room from hell. Until the arrival of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, who they call upon as a Bio-exorcist to get back their home. They're warned not to enlist his help, from a chain-smoking lady with a cut throat, who tells them they ought to learn to haunt the house themselves. Which they do, but it turns out The Deets like being haunted, having poltergeists is cool, an asset, especially after possessing their dinner guests in the hilarious 'Day O' scene. Once they've unleashed Beetlejuice through, there's no going back and from here on in, it's an utterly bonkers, off the wall, surreal trip... at least in its design at least, plot-wise it's pretty mundane. Beetlejuice is loud, ugly, filthy in several senses of the word, loud, angry, unhinged, creepy, loud, annoying, perverted, loathsome, lecherous and loud. Totally at odds with Adam and Barbara's preferred way of haunting, y'know, nicely. He's the villain and as the story unfolds, it turns out he's quite pointless too. It's a mix of silly and inappropriate. It might've worked in 1988, but I'm afraid it's dated really badly. The story is simplistic, the characters universally a bit irritating, the special effects, well they're of their day and there's something to be said for that at least. It's heavy on in camera effects and trickery. The make-up department must've had a lot of fun, but I found myself having very little. I know it's much loved and it's not without it's charms. One of Burton's first outings, it's ambitious, creative and stamps his mark, there's a lot to be said for that. It now feels very much the cult film, those who remember and loved it in the 80s, will probably still enjoy it for it's stand out nature, but otherwise revisiting it can be a bit disappointing.",6,0,0,6 June 2020
Alien: Covenant," The plot is predictable, but it's a damn sight better than Prometheus.
","If the question is should this addition to the Alien catalog have been made, I'd say no, not really, but then I'd have axed a lot of the other films, not being a fan of sequels. However despite covering familiar ground here, it's very watchable. Most notably Fassbender as the non-human. If I wanted to be hypercritical, I'd say the CGI space scenes struggle with unconvincing lighting and the sound design is a little to 'Transformersesque' and clunky. What does make this interesting though is the mystery planet, the daylight, vegetation, everything that gives this a more post apocalyptic feel and I'm all for that. It's standard fare well presented, but kept me reasonably gripped for its lengthy 2 hours. The plot is predictable, but it's a damn sight better than Prometheus.",6,1,3,18 May 2018
