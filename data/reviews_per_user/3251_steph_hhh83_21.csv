The Benchwarmers," Wow , what was the point
","Wow, what was the point of this movie? I started watching it 2 nights ago. I was sooooo bored that I turned on my computer while I was watching it. For a while I even forgot I had it on. It was like noise playing in the background. I can't even remember mostly what it was about. The guy from Napoleon Dy....Rob and David Spade. I should of known it wasn't going to be any good. Usually the only kind of movies that I like Rob in is when they are with Adam Sandler. I don't think David Spade can act. And the Jon Heder aka Napoleon dude, who knows how he can really act because we've only seen him in this and Napoloeon. Anyways I thought this movie was boring and had no point, good luck watching it. What a waste of 4dollars to rent. Glad I didn't spend more going to the movies and watching it.",4,0,0,27 August 2006
The Ring," Pretty Good
","This movie was pretty good. Some parts of it were disturbing. You didn't want to look at it. But you did just because. It wasn't scary at all. Some parts got kinda boring. How it connected was weird. You really had to watch it to get it, but it was pretty easy to get. Naomi Watts did a really good job playing the mother. The little boy whoever his name was did a pretty good job too. I thought at first he was a culkin brother, but turns out he is not. He looks like he could be one of them. This movie isn't as boring as the second one. Samara was the ugliest thing ever and the creepiest thing to look at. She looked so ghostly white all the time. When she was normal and dysfunctional looking.",5,0,1,9 May 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," sad and good
","The movie E.T was an excellent movie. Excellent,sad and funny. E.T was my favorite character. Also Drew Barrymore did a good job and Gertie. And that is one of my favorite movies that Drew Barrymore has been in, she was so young, cute and innocent. I would give E.T a 10/10. Good movie see it.",Null,0,0,9 August 2001
Fight Club," Trippy
","This movie was weird. It tripped me out, at first watching it i thought oh two characters opening a fight club. Then when i realized it was Edward Norton who was the narrator was being the Tyler guy two. It was weired but i got it. I was very good. Edward Norton is far by the best New Actor these days. I give this movie ten out of ten. I also recommend seeing American History X with Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.",Null,0,1,9 October 2001
Scary Movie 2," Pretty Bad
","This movie was pretty bad. The only good part about this movie was in the beganning when they were making fun of The Extorgist. That was it. Other than that, the movie sucked. I rented it, I thought it was a waste so i did not go see it at the movies. I give this movie 1/10. The first one was better than the second, and that isn't even saying much.",Null,0,1,11 February 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," BEST DISNEY MOVIE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
","Best disney movie in a couple of years. I loved this movie and took my niece and nephew to see it. I think that my mom loved it the most though. I give this movie 10/10. It was good. And John Goodman played a good character and so did Billy Crystal. the little girl Boo, was a cute little girl. When this movie hits video i am gonna buy it.",Null,0,1,18 November 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," wonderful
","It was a good movie, not just another chick flick like the usual movies. I give it 10/10, even my mom liked it, and usually adults are not into teen movies, also seeing that my mom is much older and then most parents today. Julia stiles and Heath Ledger are a good couple. It was weired seeing larissa in there, i remember when she used to play on that show where she was Alex Mack.",Null,1,1,9 August 2001
American Pie," FUNNY
","This was a very funny Movie. The best of all three. I would say 10/10. It had me laughing the whole time. I went to the movie theater and saw it when it came out then bought it. My favorites in this movie are Jim, Kevin and Finch and Vikki",Null,0,1,17 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Loved it
","This was a really great movie. I watched the movie before reading the books. I never wanted to see this movie. I never watch any kind of movies towards this kind of thing. But i really ended up loving it. A++++++++++ I loved all the characters! Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Legelous were my true favorites in this movie. It never got boring was always interesting and kept my thought. 10/10. It was a good idea to make these books into film. Good job for Peter Jackson. This movie will be a classic forever. I loved the shire the best out of all the places. Elijah Wood did a very good job playing Frodo Baggins as well did Sean Astin play at Samwise, his best friend throughout the trilogy.",Null,0,1,4 June 2004
Grease," The Best Movie of All time
","I love this movie, i can watch it a hundred thousand times and never get tired of it. I was not even born when it came out. But i started watching it when i was three yrs old. I love it. My favorite was Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Rizo (Stockard Channing). I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it everytime it comes on T.V. But sometimes T.V ruins the movie by leaving things out because they are not allowed to have it on t,v or it's too long. GREASE IS THE BEST AND IS MY FAVORITE ALWAYS HAS ALWAYS WILL BE.",Null,0,1,20 July 2001
American History X," a really really goood goood movie
","This was an excellent movie. It was sad and sometimes mad. If you put past the racisim you will like it. Anyone can watch this movie, although it might not be appropritate for younger ones under 13, it is a good movie. The ending kind of sucked it was sad. Edward Norton did a good job playing Derik Vinyard. Edward Norton is a good actor. I give this movie a 10/10. A sequel would ruin the movie, so I hope they do not make a sequel.",Null,0,1,20 July 2001
Dirty Dancing," best there was best there is
","This is one out of my seven favorite movies. A Classic. I give it 10/10. Even though some of the characters where lame, i would still leave Jennifer Gray, because its like ones of those actresse that do a really good job on the movie when they do horrible in the rest of their movies. And seeing how she looks today (2001) she looks nothing like she did. So people still stay a little bit the same so u still reconize who they are but not Jennifer Gray. Patrick Swayze did a great job. The most best looking guy in the movie. This is a movie i can watch over and over again and again no matter how many times it comes on T.V or anything.",Null,0,0,9 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not as good as the first
","I didn't like this movie as much as the first. It was a good movie still and kept me watching it. But there were too many battle seens in this movie. I really though that the guy who did Gollum's voice did a really good job. They really matched his face good with Gollum too. The precius thing was funny and cute at the same time. Gollum was sure ugly, my friend thought he was the cutest thing ever. I give this movie a A-. Everyone did a very good job just like they did in the fellowship of the ring. I am just really into these movies now. I couldn't wait for the 3rd one to come out and when it did i went to the theater as soon as i could. Overall this was a pretty good movie to see.",Null,0,0,4 June 2004
Pretty Woman," Wonderful
","Wonderful movie when it came out and still is to this day. I like this movie very much, but not as much as my mother who watches it every single time it comes on TV. I do say it is better than Runaway Bride. That movie was not one of my favorites or likeable ones. I give this movie 10/10.",Null,0,0,3 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It was ok, better than what i expected
","This movie was ok. I went to see it with my niece who liked it and has read all the books that have come out so far. When i got there, i thought ok, lets get the show on the road and hurry up. I wanted it to go by real fast, because i thought i would not like the movie. But acually it turned out ok. It was no perfect movie. But it was pretty enjoyable. It will make lots of money due to the books and everything else. It will be a childrens classic and just a classic let alone like the star wars thing. I give it 5/10!",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Scream 2," Not good at all
","This movie was not good at all. I did not like it. Horrible. The first was the best. This one dragged on. I seen it twice, the first time in the theater and the second time on video. I did not like it either time. I thought maybe that i was too tired in the movie theater to watch it but i was wrong. The plot was boring. The killer in this movie was a joke. It was Billy-sidneys ex b-friends mother. Who also played Jackie on Rosanne years ago. Could not stand her in this movie. Her voice is annoying. I give this movie 1/10. Not good at all.",Null,0,0,26 November 2001
Scream," Great
",I liked this movie. Its my favorite scream out of all three. I give this movie 10/10. My mom and i agreed that I could pick out one movie to watch together and i choose this. I choose this because she hates these kind of movies. She hated it and hated all the blood. But i loved it. The scream costum is great. Now every year you can see how many kids are going to be in that costum for Halloween. I am glad to see Drew Barrymore in it. To bad she had a small part though. She is my favorite actress. I cant really stand Neve Campbell- Party of Five was bad enough. But the killer-Sidneys b-friend was hot. Everyone thought so. The second one sucked major. The third was much better. But nothing is better than the original.,Null,0,0,26 November 2001
Carrie," Loved it
","I love this movie. I can watch it all the time. Sure its kinda spooky. Well the only part in the movie that is, is when she is at Prom and her eyes get all weird. The second carrie, is disapointing. Nothing like the first one. Well its not suppose to be but still is bad. I give Carrie 10/10. I loved Sissy as Carrie! I also liked Amy as Sue.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of the 3
","This movie the LOTR TROTK is the best movie out of all three. It was exciting to see what happens. I did not see what was coming at the end. I totally didn't even think what happened at the end of the movie could happen. *Spoilers* When Frodo got on the boat and left the Shire. It was very sad for poor Sam. I really didn't like the ending, i didn't want Frodo to leave the shire, just like sam. But what happens happened for a good reason. Aragorn looked very handsome as the king in the end of the movie when he was crowned king. A+++ This movie was the best movie i have seen in a long time. The best 3 and half hours. The best movie of the year for me. I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd/vhs. I kept counting down the months and days.",Null,0,1,4 June 2004
A Walk to Remember," Good
","This movie was better than the book, thats just my opinion. I read the book, and got kinda bored reading it. But i just made myself. I watched the movie today on PPV. I acually liked the movie. I am not a fan of Mandy Moore, but I think she did a great job in this movie and so did Shane West. Overall i give the movie 9/10. I liked the movie enough to own it.",Null,0,0,3 September 2002
The Breakfast Club," one of my favorites
",This is one of my favorites. Yes it is somewhat 80's cheesy. But it's good. My favorite character is Judd Nelson. He is the best one in the whole movie next to my second favorite Ally Sheedy. I give this movie 10/10. I watch it a lot when it is on T.V plus i have the movie too.,Null,0,1,28 August 2001
