Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Serious upgrade from the original
","The 2nd chapter in Robert Downey's turn as the classic detective, A Game of Shadows came out during the 2011's packed holiday movie season. For me personally, this one got pushed behind releases like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and the U.S. version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. While I have plenty of faith in RBJ's ability to carry a movie, I just had a feeling this one would fall short of the original. Turns out it made me forget about it altogether.Game of Shadows starts off with Sherlock's ever faithful companion, Dr. Watson, leaving his adventure days behind to get married. It turns out that the timing could have been better, since Holmes suspects the well-respected Prof. James Moriarty of having a sinister plan underway that could plunge all of Europe into war. Will the duo be able to take on their most challenging adversary yet?This film provides just more examples on how Robert Downey Jr. improves a film. His acting and natural humor help create a great character in Sherlock Holmes. Even more, he allows the other actors to play off his talents and then be better themselves. The addition of Noomi Rapace, ever popular after her turn as Lisbeth Salander, adds even more depth. Outside of the acting, Guy Ritchie yet again crafts a unique atmosphere through the setting and soundtrack. While the sets may be drab and dark, scenes are filled with excitement and adventure. Lastly, while the twists and turns along the way are more than enough, the best is saved for the end. This is particularly enjoyable when so many movies are predictable these days.Overall, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a thrilling mystery, filled with a good amount of action and humor. It's a smart movie that will keep you guessing until the very end. Enjoy 8/10",8,1,4,14 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Forget the previous movies
","A reboot after only 5 years? Well with how bad Spider-Man 3 was, why not! This wasn't the only reason I was intrigued by The Amazing Spider-Man though - in watching each trailer that came out, it just seemed like they had gotten this one right. I had nothing against the first two Spider-Man's with Tobey Maguire, after all they they were fun and basically kicked off the comic book movie assembly line. Even so, this time around you had the feeling they had discovered how much potential the character had, and that was reason enough to go see it.Plot-wise, not a ton of surprises if you saw the original Spider-Man/the cartoon as a kid. Peter Parker is a reserved genius living with his Aunt and Uncle. He is mostly bullied and ignored at school, but that starts to change we he uncovers his father's research into cross- species genetics. This leads him to visiting his dad's old company, Oscorp, where his curiosity will change his life foreverOverall, this movie has everything we loved about the original, as well as doing all the small stuff better. For starters, Andrew Garfield is just a better Spider-Man. He has the awkward while being charming thing down. It was also a lot more gratifying to see the science (even though it's made up) being incorporated, while in the original it was literally just 'bitten by a spider = super powers.' All the high-flying action associated with Spider-Man is still there, it's just done with a sense of confidence and creativity that makes it fresh. Emma Stone was the perfect choice for Gwen Stacey. While it was different than the 'girl next door' story with Mary Jane/Kirsten Dunst in the old one, having Parker go for a brainy girl whose Dad is a police captain was more interesting. Choosing Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard as the antagonist was also a great choice. While I know very little about the comics, I remember him as the conflicted character from the show. That conflict of good and evil felt much more genuine that Norman Osbourne/The Green Goblin.In the end, this might be the best comic book movie there is. Now Christopher Nolan's Batman movies are my favorite, and the best movies in my mind, but in what I think a comic book movie should befun, engaging, inspirational, a touch of hokey, genuinely satisfying this is up there. Do yourself a favor and go check it out!9/10",9,2,5,25 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Surprisingly awesome
","This is about as conflicted as it gets for me. The LOTR trilogy comprise some of the greatest movies ever made by my account, so why wouldn't I want Peter Jackson to bring us back to Tolkien's magical world? Things change, though. The Dark Knight Rises felt almost nothing like The Dark Knight, so would Jackson be able to re-engineer the magic from his previous movies? Once I found out the Hobbit was being split into 3 movies, I was pretty skeptical. After all, the source material is often referred to as a children's book, somewhat different than the epic trilogy that follows it. In the end, though, I should never have had any doubt. Jackson sculpts another excellent 3+ hour movie.If you've seen any of Jackson's original trilogy, than you have a good idea what you're going to get: amazing cinematography set against a New Zealand backdrop, a thunderous score by Howard Shore and impeccable acting, all of which help bring to life an amazing fantasy world. While The Hobbit does have a familiar feel, it also has some new touches of flair. For starters, you are getting a completely new cast except for Ian McKellen. Martin Freeman does a great job as a young Bilbo, and all of the dwarfs are perfectly cast, especially Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield, the group leader). There is also a different and more frequent use of humor in this movie compared to the trilogy, probably because the book itself was written in a lighter tone. More serious fans might find this annoying, but it fits the story and ends up being a nice change of pace in my opinion. Another thing to mention is that this film is long. Most would expect that since it is Peter Jackson, but since it's only 1/3 of the story there are slower parts. That being said, they also pour a ton of action into the first chapter. I went in expecting to basically just see a setup film, but a ton happened and I can't wait to see it continue next December.Overall, the first installment of the Hobbit is very different than the LOTR but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. The tone and feel are both different, but you're still watching a Peter Jackson movie, which means it's almost unrivaled in terms of scale and production quality. If you can handle the length, I'd say this is a must see this holiday season.9/10",9,3,10,1 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Controversial? Sure. Entertaining? Oh yeah
","A chronicle of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden from the perspective of the CIA culminating with the raid by Navy SEALS? Yes, please. While this year's Act of Valor had the action and authenticity, Zero Dark Thirty brings the writing, pacing, and true story to the big screen, and it's one hell of a ride.Relative unknown Jessica Chastain takes the lead as Maya, an abrasive and driven CIA agent that joins the search for those that are responsible for 9/11. Over the course of a decade, her grit and determination bring the ultimate goal within reach: finding enemy #1, Osama Bin Laden.This movie is evidence that Kathryn Bigelow can continue to meet the high standard she set with 2008's The Hurt Locker. Even though the search takes place over a decade and there are many more setbacks than successes, Zero Dark Thirty keeps your attention throughout and has you on the edge of your seat for the gripping conclusion. The acting is superb; Chastain knocks it out of the park and the performances by Jason Clark and Kyle Chandler add a lot of depth (both of them should get more prominent roles in my opinion, especially Chandler). In the end, though, it's all about the story. With the book No Easy Day coming out last year, this story is already known to some, but it's always different to see it on the big screen. The fact is that Americans grew tired of wars that seemed to be producing no results, so it's a pretty big deal when our original target is finally eliminated. Whatever your political stance is, you have to respect how important this event was. The script was actually originally written before Bin Laden was killed (and was subsequently changed afterwards), so believe me when I say that this film isn't the waving of a victory flag. Instead, Zero Dark Thirty is a testament to how long and difficult the mission was.The only real issues I had with this film are also something to be appreciated - the true story wasn't overly cinematic. I don't want to give anything away, but the end sequence just didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the movie. Go check it out and judge for yourself, though!8/10",8,17,59,2 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic conclusion
","The Legend Ends. The first 2/3 of Christopher Nolan's trilogy single-handedly changed what a comic-book movie could be. Instead of a campy-fantasy flick, Nolan painted a darker, and more importantly, realistic, view of Gotham. It's crazy to think there have been four modern live-action portrayals of the caped crusader, and Nolan's first crack at it alone blew all of them right out of the water. He was the first to show us the origins of Batman, and proceeded to craft one of the most gripping movies I've ever seen in The Dark Knight. After all of these accomplishments, how could any more be expected of Nolan? Well, expectations only ever increase in the movie industry, and in this case, we are lucky for that. After seeing this last chapter twice, I still believe The Dark Knight is the best of the three (and best comic-book inspired movie of all time), but The Dark Knight Rises shocks and awes in an epic ending to the story.It's been 8 years since Batman defeated the Joker and took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes. Since then, Gotham has thrived, and Bruce Wayne has fallen into seclusion. Both of these things come to a swift end when a ruthless terrorist named Bane makes his way to America's greatest city. Gotham might still call him an enemy, but the Dark Knight must return and face his most dangerous adversary yet.Enough can't be said of Nolan's approach to the Batman story. While The Dark Knight Rises has a different feel than both of the other films, it still contains an unequaled dedication to character and theme. The Dark Knight Rises team had to go into this one with Bane as the villain (following one of the best villain performances of all time by the late and great Heath Ledger), as well as Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman (no one has ever made this character credible as far as I know - and I love Michelle Pfeiffer). Yet somehow, Nolan and company's careful crafting of the story brought us a worthy villain for this epic conclusion and a Catwoman subplot that actually added to the film. The theme is also as interesting as ever - according to IMDb trivia, Nolan's aim thematically was fear for Batman Begins, chaos for The Dark Knight, and pain for The Dark Knight Rises. While it's definitely a dark trio, it's expertly executed and is a major reason we actually care about this Batman.A review of a Nolan film wouldn't be complete without mentioning the cast, as he always seems to stack the deck in his favor. Christian Bale of course 'finishes' his stint as Batman perfectly - and moreover has to be more dynamic than in the other films, as his body has broken down in the 8 years since he last donned the bat-suit. The surprise in this one is Michael Caine's third performance as Alfred. Obviously Michael Caine giving a great performance isn't a surprise, but he is given much more to work with as he's Bruce Wayne's only remaining family, and makes the most of it. Lastly, the inclusion of Nolan's Inception team in Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt paid off in spades. JGL was especially fun to watch as a 'hot-headed' cop that believed in the Batman.The film isn't perfect, but in all honestly, I think that's only because it has to be measured against The Dark Knight. Nolan created a thrilling and thought-provoking ending, and it has truly been a pleasure to watch it unfold. Thank you for making Batman respectable, Mr. Nolan. 10/10",10,5,12,25 July 2012
