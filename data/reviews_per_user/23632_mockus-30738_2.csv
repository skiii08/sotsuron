The King's Speech," An impeccable roller-coaster of emotions
","An incredible movie to say the least. Describing this movie as a doctor helping a king with his stuttering would be misleading. This is so much more. The framing is something out of the ordinary. Very often will you see a scene where the person on one side of the frame while the other half is a plain wall. Same goes with music. It perfectly and very subtly dictates what emotions we shall feel. It ties perfectly with the scenes where the king is under pressure. The build up and escalation is presented incredibly. One would think it's unrepeatable yet it's done so many times in this movie I can't be ever bothered to count.TL;DR: Every emotion you can think of you will, directly or indirectly, feel. Friendship, sadness, love, contempt, anger, jealousy, regret, impatience, hopelessness and the list goes on. Best movie I've ever seen.",10,0,0,7 April 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Different
","The very large majority of the film was bland. The screenplay was great, the dialogue was pretty good and the music perfect for such a film but it was the same thing over and over. A problem, Riggan realizing he's irrelevant, his inner self saying he can be if he tries. That's what I got from it myself at least. That is until the very end *SPOILER ALERT* he pulls out the gun. Most movies build up tension very gradually. Movies like King's Speech and Doubt do it very well. King's Speech does it countless times and bursts the bubble in a very satisfying manner. Doubt does it by building it up very slowly. The scene where Sister Aloysius Beauvier and Father Brendan Flynn are fighting lasts 12 whole minutes. This is where Birdman comes in place. Tension is rarely ever built until one of the last scenes. And not in a gradual and nice way but very suddenly and unexpected. I haven't seen a film that made my heart beat so fast in a long while. The tension was surreal. The way they played it off is a bit ridiculous but not disappointing. Definitely worth a watch.",8,0,2,9 April 2017
