The Blair Witch Project," NOT WORTH THE MONEY
","I was sooooo disappointed with this movie.  Why you ask?  Because it wasn't scary.  There were no special effects, not like I'm really big on them but a few would have been nice; you don't see blood, guts, anything of that. There were no special twists, nothing to make you go 'ahhhhh so thats why they . . .'  Plain and simple, it was terrible.Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
