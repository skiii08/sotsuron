Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sacha Baron Cohen Is Hysterically Funny and Yet Moving
","This rude and raucous faux documentary is hysterically funny, scarily penetrating in its look at American culture, and oddly moving.First off Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fabulous. He's got to be the bravest actor who ever lived. He goes basically 'under cover' as Borat and braves some of the ugliest Americans I've ever seen. All the time he is in character, he probes and cajoles and insults a wide spectrum of Americans who I am afraid mostly come off (in turn) as a batch of crude, smug morons. The view we get of ourselves as a culture is quite, quite chilling.This is a film that could be deconstructed and analyzed for ages and always come up with something new. The nicest characters Borat meets on his journey across America are the black prostitute and the black street boys. The others are a pack of bigots, humorless drones, and people terrified of him. Borat uncovers an underbelly of mainstream America that is every bit as ugly and filthy and ignorant as the third-world village he so proudly shows us at the beginning of the film. And this is exactly the type of humor that many American viewers didn't get. The humor is always what is seems to be.For all the anti-Jewish ranting in the film, the fact is that Cohen is a devout Jew. The British comic turns everything upside down but the condescending dolts he meets along his journey only see him as he presents himself. They can't get past the accent, the rumpled suit, the bad hair, the stereotype, etc.The film is not politically correct and is filled with hilarious bits, sight gags, slapstick, word play, etc. and Baron Cohen is very, very funny. He constantly catches the audience off guard. Just the sight of Borat and his sidekick (Ken Davitian) zooming across America in a 1950s ice cream truck is funny. That they also have a bear as a passenger adds a level of absurdity that goes beyond inspiration in the same way the Marx Brothers did in the 1930s.Sacha Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe and certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his incredible portrayal. But I'm afraid this inspired comedy, even though a box-office hit, went over the heads of the establishment.The ending of the film is surprisingly sweet after the ride Borat has taken us on. Not to be missed!d",10,18,43,6 March 2007
A Star Is Born," A Scar Is Born
","Shrieking, loud, interminable re-telling of a familiar story that didn't need to be re-told. This is nothing but a vanity project for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper with terrible music.There's no need to recap the story since everyone knows it. Aside from the killing pace that drags this one on to 135 minutes, it's also notable that there's not a likable character in the film. That includes the stars, the grasping manager, the dim father, and the bizarre character played by Sam Elliott. What point was trying to be made my casting 74-year-old Elliott as 44-year-old Cooper's brother? It defies logic.The story was better told in WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD? (1932) starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman, A STAR IS BORN (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, A STAR IS BORN (1954) starring Judy Garland and James Mason, and A STAR IS BORN (1976) starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, as well as several others with the same plot.This one has inane plot points like the tribute to Roy Orbison and a one-word cameo by Alec Baldwin. And what's the point to the drag club? This was lifted from Bette Midler's THE ROSE (1979).This version is about as entertaining as an open wound scarring over. Indeed, a scar is born.",1,46,83,31 January 2019
The Birth of a Nation," THE American Masterpiece
","Amazing 1915 film by genius filmmaker D.W. Griffith. The controversy swirling around this film since its debut has unfortunately overshadowed the significance of America's first feature-length film. Even though one of the title cards specifically says the racial attitudes taken in the film are NOT meant to reflect on current current-day audiences because the attitudes reflect historical facts from the 1860s. That said, current audiences should concentrate on the amazing achievement of this film.Griffith was a master story teller, and Birth of a Nation is a great story, following two families (one Southern and one Northern) as they lurch through the Civil War and the following Reconstruction period. Griffith's other great strength as a filmmaker is that he knows how to use the screen as a canvas. Griffith's scenes are rarely stagnant, a problem with many silent films. It is truly amazing to watch his outdoor scenes because there is so much going on. The main action is in the foreground but there are always other things happening in the background. Griiffith and camera man Billy Bitzer virtually invented modern cinematography with these shots that provided clear focus foregrounds and backgrounds. They also invented the closeup, which other filmmakers of the days assured Griffith would confuse audiences who were used to seeing actors with bodies! Griffith's mania for historical accuracy continues to amaze in this film's battle sequences, set designs, costumes, and most famously in his depiction of Lincoln's assassination. Just amazing. His depiction of the Ku Klux Klan is also historically accurate no matter what our attitudes are today about this group. Films must be judged in their own context and not filtered through our modern sensibilities.Griffith's stock cast works well here. Lillian Gish at 22 is a beautiful heroine and is wonderful as Elsie. Her forced marriage to Lynch (George Siegmann) provides her with some great dramatic moments. Mae Marsh is a wonder as Flora. As in Intolerance (1916), Marsh proves to be one of the most expressive actors of the silent period. Marsh was 20. It is amazing that they knew HOW to act for the camera when films was still so new. Henry B. Walthall has his one great role as the 'Lillte Colonel' and is quite good. Miriam Cooper (also in Intolerance) has a good role as Margaret. Donald Crisp plays U.S. Grant. Future superstar Wallace Reid plays the heroic blacksmith, while the screen's first Tarzan, Elmo Lincoln, plays his assistant. Bessie Love has a few scenes as a besieged Piedmont girl.Robert Harron and Elmer Clifton (both stars of Intolerance) play southern brothers. Josephine Crowell is the southern mother. Mary Alden is very good as the mulatto mistress. Walter Long is the nasty ex-slave, Gus. Joseph Henabery plays Lincoln. Eugene Palette plays a union soldier, and William Freeman has a great scene as the sentry who so longingly looks at Gish. Violet Wilkey plays Mae Marsh as a child. Future star directors, John Ford and Raoul Walsh (as John Wilkes Booth), also appear.The Birth of a Nation is a stirring film filled with memorable scenes. Modern audiences have trouble watching the KKK as heroes but it's important to realize the historical accuracy of this film. And as in Intolerance, Griffith makes sure the audience sees his films as warnings against the evils of war. When Birth of a Nation and Intolerance were released, the US was not yet involved in World War I. Griffith's major point in these great films is to show the ugliness and futility of war and to plead for common sense, compassion, and tolerance.Griffith and The Birth of a Nation basically created the American film industry. This film is still the biggest box office hit of all time when adjusted to modern ticket costs. in her autobiography, 'Griffith, the Movies, and Me,' Lillian Gish states that this film made so much money it was apparent that filmgoers, even in small towns, went to see it two or three times. The Birth of a Nation is an astounding accomplishment on all levels.That this film and its director continue to be vilified by critics who can't understand the concept of 'historical context' is too bad. The Director's Guild of America removed Griffith's name from its lifetime achievement award in the late 90s. What hypocrisy. When this film is announced on a TV schedule, letters pour in condemning its racism. These idiots have likely never see this film.History is history and we can't change it by editing out the parts that now embarrass us. Even today we live in a political world that future generations will judge harshly. The same greed and inhumanity that we see in The Birth of a Nation is alive and well in our world or petropolitics and American imperialism.Bravo to D.W. Griffith: the genius of the American cinema.",10,20,44,23 October 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Boring and Endless Drivel
","Interminable twaddle from the overrated CS Lewis book has 4 snotty kids finding another world full of talking beavers at the back end of a wardrobe. YAWN. All the same old crap over and over again with beasties fighting in an endless computer-generated battle scene. Nothing new. Same old thing we've seen in dozens of other movies. Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent are trapped in this puke.The kids are obnoxious as they act out the proper little British children fantasies until you scream at the screen for them to DIE, especially the ugly girl with the big lips.A total pukefest from the very start to the end, seemingly 5 hours later. A complete waste of time, money, and effort.",1,24,51,14 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Love Doesn't Always Save Us
","Ang Lee has fashioned a wonderful American fugue from a story by Annie Proulx. Set against the landscape of the stark American West, Brokeback Mountain peers into the hearts of hardscrabble folks caught up in a seething gay love over a 20 year period. Their lives are as stark as the windblown town streets.Two young cowboys come together by chance for a summer job in the mountains watching over sheep. It's boring work, uncomfortable, silent, and in the intense loneliness of their separate lives they one freezing night come together in a tent. The act shocks them both as they struggle with their feelings and what to do.Ennis (Heath Ledger) is the plier-jawed loner who can never connect with anything. He's more surprised by what has happened. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems more ready to accept what he has probably known about himself. But neither man knows what to do. They continue their 'love' through the summer until the flinty boss (Randy Quaid) catches a glimpse of their shirtless romp. As summer closes, they go their separate ways not knowing anything else to do.Years go by. Ennis marries a dumpy little woman (Michelle Williams) and has has kids. He clings to his nomadic lifestyle. Jack drifts into rodeo and eventually marries also. But the course of their lives is set when Jack sends a postcard and says he's coming through town. Ennis can hardly contain the excitement he has for so long squashed within himself.Their 'fishing trip' sets the tone for the next 15 years or so as the two men come together when they can because they cannot deny their love for each other. Jack talks about getting a ranch together, but Ennis knows the hard facts of an openly gay life.Ennis seems able to live in this small life with wife and kids and seeing Jack now and then, but Jack seems to wander into occasional gay trysts, more unsatisfied with his normal life. The women never really seem to notice much.The years go by. The men fight and love; they can't give each other up but they can't face the alternative of living together. Fate finally ends their relationship when Ennis gets a postcard returned with 'deceased' stamped on it by the post office.Ledger is amazing as the uptight Ennis, a man with a huge capacity for love but a man who just can't ever admit his homosexual leanings. Gyllenhaal is a wonder as the softer Jack who tries so hard to do what he thinks the world expects. Both men are so driven by their Western codes of what others will think that they sacrifice their 'true' loves and live shallow lives on the edges of reality.The film strikes the perfect balance between showing too much and leaving much for the viewer to imagine. So we're left with the image of Ennis cringing as he asks if other people can tell. He wonders if when someone looks at him oddly if they know. His guilt for his man love renders him even more reticent than his usual nature. Jack moves into dangerous territory as he seeks out what Ennis won't give him.Anne Hathaway is good as Jack's wife. Roberta Maxwell is striking in her small role as Jack's mother. Quaid and Williams are also good.But Gyllenhaal and Ledger are front and center here and amazingly avoid all gay stereotypes. Their characters don't change after they realize their gay tendencies. They are who they are. This is a sad and very beautiful film.",10,20,48,8 April 2006
Duck Soup," Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Margaret Dumont !
","One of the funniest films ever made, Duck Soup is total insanity and a fast pace by the Marx Brothers. Is this merely a string of gags or is this pungent political satire? Does it matter? Priceless gags include the famous 'mirror' act, the lemonade stand, and some of the funniest plays on words ever heard. Groucho play Rufus T. Firely, who comes to the aide of struggling Freedonia, seemingly run by a wealthy society dame, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). Chico and Harpo play spies in the employ of the rule of Sylvania (Louis Calhern). Nothing makes sense but then this IS about politics. Fast pace zips this film along (directed by the great Leo McCarey) so that the gags and jokes are dizzying. The three brothers are all wonderful as is Dumont. Also thrown into the mix is the exotic Raquel Torres, funnyman Edgar Kennedy, and the lackluster Zeppo Marx. Best gags include the mirror act with Grouch and Harpo (redone on one of Lucille Ball's TV series with Harpo 20 years later); the lemonade sequence with Chico, Harpo, and Kennedy, and of course the bizarre war finale with the brothers and Dumont, who was one of the best comedy foils in film history.The usual Marx Brothers blend of skimpy plot, musical numbers and non-stop gags makes this the best of their films. Film history tells us Duck Soup was originally a flop, that it was the last of their films for Paramount, and the final film appearance for Zeppo (no loss there). The Marx Brothers were saved by Irving Thalberg at MGM, and the 3 brothers went on to a few big successes at that studio. One of the funniest films ever made.",10,1,1,4 August 2005
Jackie," Music is So Bad, My Dog Fled the Room
","OK, yes, Natalie Portman gives a good performance as Jackie Kennedy. But everything else in this long, boring film is badly done. The worst two examples are the actors playing JFK and RFK. The actor playing JFK is way too short for the role, has his voice dubbed by actual JFK audio footage, and prances around like a gay munchkin. Peter Sarsgaard is a good actor, but make no effort at all to look or sound like RFK. It's as if you're watching a version of history with pod people taking over the roles of these famous men.From the first awful note, the music of Mica Levi is intrusive, jarring, and totally wrong for this type of film. It even drowns out dialog it's so loud. Aside from the clip of Richard Burton singing 'Camelot,' the film seems to exist in a time warp, with zero cultural references allowed to intrude other than old news footage.We are told Jackie is being interviewed in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, but the house and surrounding grounds look nothing like the famous Kennedy compound or Cape Cod. Even footage filmed in Washington, DC looks oddly phony since the city has changed so much since 1963.The scenes where Jackie spars intellectually with the journalist (Sarsgaard as Theodore H. White, but they never use his name) and the priest (John Hurt) are so foolish they almost seem like comedy skits. There's also a long and needless scene with Richard E. Grant as a designer working with Jackie as she obsesses over interior decoration for the White House.During the long screen time devoted to recreating Jackie's famous televised tour of the White House in 1961, she talks about the stage that was built in the music room when Pablo Casals played there, but the following scene shows him seated and playing not on a stage.Other historical characters from the Johnsons to Jack Valenti are glimpsed as being generally unfriendly and outrightly evil, but nothing is developed. It's as if all this history is just a vague backdrop for Jackie to emote in front of. Perhaps it's an accurate comment about a woman who is so self-obsessed, her hours after the assassination are spent worrying about what will become of her and where she will live.And that's the main issue here. We're shown a Jackie who is constantly self-obsessed rather than self-assured. She's a heroine for the selfie generation rather than a real and accurate product of her time.",1,8,15,15 April 2017
Dirty Dancing," Ridiculous Female Fantasy
","This nostalgic look at a time that never was has mousy Jewish girl (Jennifer Grey) about to go off to college but going off with her family to vacation at a Catskills resort and finding love with a sleazy and vapid dancer (Patrick Swayze).Nothing rings true in this story. The mix of vintage music with new music doesn't work. The resort staff that does 'dirty dancing' in their private quarters is moronic. The acting is horrid.The narrator waxes nostalgic in the opening, telling of that time before the Kennedy murder and before the Beatles. We then get shown people who also would not have been employed by a Jewish resort. People didn't talk this way in 1963 and they didn't act this way in 1963.Grey plays 'Baby' Houseman, a nice Jewish girl without a Jewish name. She's taken with Johnny ... they're always named Johnny ... a street kid who can dance as well as he can mince. Swayze has the sex appeal of cold mashed potatoes.His preening and posturing is supposed to pass for machismo but he's less butch than Grey is. The dancing that wows the fans would get the boot on any local talent show.Caught up in this mush are Jack Weston as the resort owner, Jerry Orbach as the Jewish daddy, Kelly Bishop as the vacant mother, Jane Brucker as the apparently retarded older daughter. Cynthia Rhodes as the knocked-up dancer, Wayne Knight as a comic, Paula Trueman as a geriatric kleptomaniac, Max Cantor as Robbie the seducer, Lonny Price as the smarmy grandson of the owner, and Charles 'Honi' Coles as the bandleader.Most of the cars are too old, the hair styles are wrong, and the Catskills resort was actually filmed in Virginia and North Carolina and looks nothing like Upstate New York.The dance ending is ridiculous with Swayze leaping offstage into the audience and gyrating in a group dance, and they all know the steps! Apparently Baby lands her Johnny ... a relationship that should last all of two weeks.",1,5,16,25 October 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Way Too Long
","A 90-minute movie packed into 132 minutes, this one goes on and on and on with nothing happening, supposedly building to the 'coming of age' moment between the 17-year-old and the 'older' man hired by daddy as a research assistant.The idyllic Italian summer has the guys playing cat and mouse about the house while the intellectual parents look the other way. There's lots of talk, lots of bicycle rides into town, lots more talk, shots of the apricot trees, and then some more talk.While the acting is good, the story drags. And it's odd that for a gay-themes movie, the only actual sex depicted is between the kid and a girl. Other than grabbing and wrestling, you never see any actual sex between the guys. I don't recall the word 'gay' even being spoken.Watched it once; I'll never watch it again.",8,1,4,14 March 2018
Singin' in the Rain," It Ain't Been in Vain for Nothing
","Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his 'second banana' role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break into films. The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's 'Singin' in the Rain' classic; all three in the 'Good Mornin'' number; O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh'; and Kelly and Reynolds in 'You Were Meant for Me.' The masterpiece however may be the 'Gotta Dance' production number with Kelly and Cyd Charissejust perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in 'Fit as a Fiddle' and 'Moses Supposes.'There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the 'Beautiful Girl' number featuring Jimmy Thompson. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly 'lip syncing' for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the 'I Would, Would You' number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing 'Singin' in the Rain' is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams 'I LOVE YOU' it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.A great film!",10,79,103,29 August 2005
The Fountain," Underlit and Lugubrious
","Badly directed film that could have been interesting if anything could be seen. But as it is, every scene is dark and murky so you can't see anything. Hence it's boring.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are basically wasted in this murky mess full of historical baloney, new-age 'live forever' crap, and and soggy love story with a dying heroine. Nothing comes together as we prance from the Inquisition (Spain's finest hour), the discovery of the fountain of youth, the droning modern couple (with her calligraphic book no less), and the golden bubble whizzing through space toward the Mayan dead star.It sounded interesting , but I can see why it was a huge bomb. It's slow, ambiguous, murky, tedious, dark, boring, and badly made. Even the snow can't act.And how did Rachel enjoy sex the night before she croaked if she lost all feeling in her body?",5,1,5,15 May 2007
Mudbound," Dreary Beyond Belief
","MUDBOUND lives up to its name and is thereby a likely Oscar winner in the upcoming awards. Dreary and overly long by 30 minutes, this one details the story two WW II vets (one white, one black) who return to their mud farms in Mississippi only to find that while they fought for democracy nothing in the 'ol' south' has changed at all. Racism and poverty and ignorance are still the hallmarks of the region and the vets cannot adapt. This one seems to be on the awards short list in several categories. After MOONLIGHT ridiculously won big last year, anything is possible. The actors are all OK but are nothing special. Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund, Mary Blige, Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell. Probably very exciting for those fascinated by watching mud.",1,33,82,25 November 2017
Shall We Dance," Great Cast; Good Dancing
","What a surprise this movie was. I expected it to be dull and by the numbers, but Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez all turn in good performances. The supporting cast is also top notch: Bobby Cannavale, Anita Gillette, Lisa Ann Walter, Stanley Tucci, Richard Jenkins, and Omar Miller are all terrific.Gere plays a long-married and bored lawyer who tries to find some fun in life. Sarandon is his busy wife and Lopez is a defensive ballroom dance teacher. The wife of course assumes he's having an affair and hires a detective. The odd ducks in the dance class all become friends and become supporters for each other. There is a dance contest and some nice storyline resolutions.Gere is loose and funny as the lawyer and actually does better dance moves here than in his acclaimed performance in Chicago. Lopez also does some good dancing, and Sarandon smolders as the jealous wife. Gillette has a good role as Miss Mitzi the dance school owner. Cannavale is hilarious as the tough guy who thinks dancing will draw women to him. Tucci is also very funny as the closet heterosexual who loves to wear sequins and dance. Jenkins is winning as the detective, and Miller is good as the fat guy. Walter almost steals the film as the loud, obnoxious woman who spends all her spare time training for the big dance contest. Shall We Dance starts slowly but once it gets going it's a winner.",9,0,0,19 September 2005
