The Double Life of Véronique," This is the double life !?
",People usually afraid to say 'I didn't like it' when a title carries a director's fame; but I didn't like it! However the train station scene was ideal & stuck in my mind.. There were almost no connection between Weronika & Véronique lives and at the end I didn't get how one's life affect the other one's as doubles!,4,1,2,24 June 2019
