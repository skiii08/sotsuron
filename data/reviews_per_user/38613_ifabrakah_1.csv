Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Good with one of the best quotes ever
","For some reason I was between two options, whether to see this movie or not, and I went with the first. Overall, this is something that not everyone must watch but those who are prepared to watch an irregular mixture of reality and imaginary. Good but not excellent, Would give it 7/10 but that one powerful quote made this movie unforgettable for me and rose its rating to 8/10.",8,0,1,21 August 2017
