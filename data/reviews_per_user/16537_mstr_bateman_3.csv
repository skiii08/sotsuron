It," Absolutely soulless filth
","There is not a single normal human character in this film. Not a single relatable person or motif. Everyone is a clich√©.
The white blue-collar dad who's a creepy kid-toucher, the fat single mother, the insane school bully, the neurotic kid with asthma, the fat kid, etc. etc. None of them behave in a way that is relatable by a real human being. It's like a bunch aliens in human flesh trying to act human but just can't get it right. The movie is not scary either, it's just vulgar and dumb and devoid of any humanity.",1,3,10,19 April 2019
Knives Out," Family bad, immigrants good
","I was recommended this movie as a classic whodunit with clever twists and colorful characters. But the twists weren't all too clever and the whodunit isn't so classic.
It is a stylish movie, but the story is actually rather lame and unexciting when you take away the A-list actors and the glossy finish. Besides, a few key scenes don't really make sense, but have to be that way because the plot wouldn't work otherwise (meeting dangerous people in dark alleys instead of crowded places type of stuff).
It was also impossible to miss the racial undertones. The makers of the film were obviously drawing a metaphor for the demographic shift in America, clearly expressing their satisfaction with a certain majority being on the way out. (Once you see the final scene you'll know what I mean.)Bottom line: You can watch it and you won't get bored, but don't expect too much.",6,16,27,7 February 2020
The King," Ridiculously bad with some good moments
","Like so many movies it started out quite promising but it got worse and more ridiculous as it went on.
From a visual perspective, it is very well shot and there are some great, intense battle scenes, but there just isn't any substance to the film. The bigger (historical) context is never explained, the story and actions of the protagonists are confusing or make no sense at all.
The young king just stumbles from whoring around in the ghetto into being a considerate, brave and intelligent leader of men on the battlefield. A very unconvincing performance. It would have been a little better had they at least cast a strong Englishman as Henry, but for some strange reason they picked a 60 pound skinny-pants-wearing Israeli. The French prince is portayed as a complete psychopath and idiot. A caricature.
And of course they had to drop in a little empowered female narrative at the end where Henry gets married. If you have half a brain, don't waste your time.",4,35,60,2 November 2019
