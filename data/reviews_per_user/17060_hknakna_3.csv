Black Swan," Poor Odette...Poor Odile...
","An anonymous NYC ballet company takes on a bold new interpretation of 'Swan Lake'. Unfortunately, the production, aside from some visually arresting moments, is anything but. The fact that Mr. Aronofsky, whom I greatly admire, was unable to deliver even a simulacrum of a new swan experience may be at the heart of why the film falters.Having been a dancer myself, I am reflexively attracted to all things dance but even the hypnotic effect of Tchaikovsky's music couldn't save the film. Aronofsky uses the mirror image both as a visual device and as a plot device but in neither case is he able to get past surface reflection. Where in the 'Wrestler' and even in 'RequiemÂ…' he deftly navigates the 'mind' field of human weakness, strength, depravity, longing, and loneliness, here there are only incoherent fragments. Nina (our protagonist) is a woman whose age I continue to wonder about. The room she occupies, in her overbearing mother's apartment, remains prepubescent and it's highly likely that this very beautiful woman/child is still a virgin who has never even masturbated. It's not that this scenario is completely implausible but it's disturbed enough to need some substantiation. Perhaps Aronofsky has only a two dimensional view of women and their interests portraying them as strippers with hearts, prostitutes with hearts and in this case childlike, suicidal 'little princesses' with hearts.Though Ms. Portman gives it her best, and I applaud the effort, I keep thinking that this movie would have been more credible if he had chosen to work with an actual mid-level, aspiring ballerina. I believe we would have forgiven unpolished acting for the more authentic experience. Actually, I've never been a fan of Ms. Portman's and Darren surely leaves her in a lurch with this wafer thin study of an emotionally stunted and psychologically complex character that is well beyond this actresses ability to make coherent. That said, I enjoyed Barbara Hershey's performance, and found myself thinking, 'I've missed her', more than once during the showing. It doesn't seem worth mentioning any of the other performances.There are some thrilling visual effects throughout but a few too many trite mirror phantoms that, unfortunately, overshadow the truly awe inspiring transformation of Nina/Odette into a black swan in the third act.Sadly, over it's entirety, the film lacks arc and believability, and I very much wanted to swoon over this film.",6,15,40,6 December 2010
Inception," Dreams unfettered by the messiness of dreams!
","I have a pretty high standard when it comes to the re-interpretation of dreams (or the workings of the mind in general) by filmmakers which is likely due to the fact that I myself am a dreamer. There is nothing more irksome than these half-conceived, mostly contrived dalliances that are gobbled up by the ever passive viewing public as if they were shedding a bright light on the subject. I could go on about how not one of the characters is developed enough to overcome the films main flaw of not being LIKE A DREAM or how Nolan couldn't seem to make up his mind which movie to make; the more psychologically gripping tale of multiple lives lived in an endless cascade of dreams or the non-stop, high octane espionage tale which would have been super fun if it had actually taken place IN A DREAM (but keepin' it real, the action sequences we did see were pretty standard). I won't, however, because I can't let go of the glaring inadequacies of Mr. Nolan's literal, linear, unimaginative, and perhaps disinterested efforts to delve into the dream world proper.While walking out of the theater, I got into a quick chat with another member of the audience. I stated that, :in the main the film was predictable' and he replied, 'I think it was supposed to be'. Really, since when are dreams predictable? Mein Gott! We're getting soft. People, we're not supposed to walk out of a movie concerned with this both known and unknowable subject matter rock-steady. On the contrary, we should all be wearing deeply puzzled yet deeply satisfied looks on our faces as though we'd been led across some great gulf and left there to work our own way back. The takeaway message here is that it takes more than the latest CGI to deliver a reasonable simulacrum of the sub-conscience. And for the proof of that remark one need only look at the work of Michel Gondry and of the master, David Lynch. Your mind will reel indefinitely.",3,6,11,24 July 2010
V for Vendetta," I felt I needed to say this.
","I don't often write comments but this moment deserves to be noted by all who will.As a film, there is much to recommend it and yet it is flawed. I would say that there is too much glamor, too much Hollywood show-offiness(if I may be allowed to make up my own words). That said, I get that that's probably the best way to reach the masses who crave the trendiest of forms. To be irrelevant, I actually am not that impressed by Miss. Portmans performance, truly, her poor accent is a distraction. I think the cinematography is good, the acting, overall, good. the pacing is good in short this is a good movie.It actually disappoints me to read the too long paragraphs describing line for line this movie not to mention the whining about how it's not exactly like the comic(big surprise). I don't think we should miss the the point here, as many of our leaders hope, by getting all caught up in trivialities. I would like to ask that we all send a silent thank you to all the parties involved in bringing this film to the people. I believe I spent most of this film with mouth open in shock. I almost felt that they(the makers) and we(the viewers) were going to face some sort of repercussions. I guess I have our new constitution aka the 'Patriot Act' to thank for that.Some things transcend their form and it no longer matters about the elements that made it, all that matters are the lingering effects. I felt it as I am sure many of you did. Subtlety no longer seems to affect the hardened shells of the grotesquely apathetic, only a sledge hammer will do. We are not yet at the stage of complete totalitarianism brought about by the fear driven message of justice by faith. we still have a chance before the task becomes tragically difficult.Go and see it. It's important.",9,4,8,22 March 2006
