Requiem for a Dream," Powerfully exacting, emotionally wrenching
","I first saw this film when I was about 14. It really blew me away. It is superbly edited, with Aranofsky transforming otherwise mundane daily rituals like cleaning or moving into intriguing expositions. Every character is completely, utterly believable and each performance is quite nuanced, to varying degrees. If for nothing else, don't just see this movie to be convinced of what you already - drugs, especially hard drugs like heroin and speed, are terribly dangerous, but for Aranofsky's daring, original, provocative style, the well-paced plot, and the excellent performances by the ensemble (especially Ellen Burstyn in a truly frightening, unique performance).",10,2,4,16 August 2006
The Departed," Simply superb
","This was a consummate piece of filmaking. Everything about it - the cinematography, acting, dialogue, pacing, and of course, the directing, was superlative. Easily the best film I've seen some time, a first best picture nominee of the season. Alec Baldwin was witty, slick self, and matt damon, leo dicaprio and Jack Nicholson were outstanding and completely believable of course as well. The ending may lack one small scene tying it together, but other than that, this film was simply flawless, and totally satisfying and riveting. I swear, there was almost NO talking during the movie, and people who couldn't sit down were standing in the hallway watching in awe. Don;t think about it - go see this movie NOW, dammit!",9,1,4,22 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Excellent, very funny; a living 'still-life'
","This movie was absolutely phenomenal. Very original. It reminded a little of 'Being John Malkovich' with a bit less randomness. I loved the way this film was shot - lots of straight angles, appropriate close-ups, good lighting. I liked how everything looked very clean and picturesque. All players performed admirably - great casting (although Emma Thompson seems to be playing to her typecasting in this one - but she's great nonetheless). I really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal - she's very cute and her voice is really sexy ... oh yeah, and she played her part very believably and naturally. Also, this was really one of Will Ferrel's best roles. I liked how he was much more subtle and subdued in this pic; He under-played Crick nicely, and his simple, blunt speech was well-delivered. This was a nice change of tone from his other roles and indicates a notable progression in the development of his craft as an actor (reminds me of when Robin Williams and Jim Carey began taking on more serious roles).My main point: It occurred to me near the end that the whole movie seemed like a living, moving still-life painting. There were many shots that looked like they could have been a painting - a slice of real life. Just as I formed that idea, there was a shot with Will Ferrel's character in his kitchen picking up a green apple from a bowl full of them. This really exemplified what I'm talking about here. Of course, the film has a good message as well. if somewhat clich√©d - to live life fully and with passion and you don't know what you're capable of until you try new things and take on new perspectives with openness and deep consideration. Wouldn't it be funny if we all tried walking around for a day with a notepad tracking how many moments of delight and how many sad moments we had? It certainly would make you re-evaluate the way live and react to the life unfolding around you.",7,1,2,24 February 2007
300," '300' Presents a Glorious, Action-Packed, Stunning Slice of Greek History
","At first sight the splish-springing blood and hyper-gory violence in 300 may seem cartoon-like and excessive to some. But this is only because the film is based on a graphic novel. Thus, it is indeed appropriate for the graphic-novel turned feature film scheme.This film is one you can literally call a 'picture.' The Larry Fong's cinematography in this absolutely movie stunning. Everything from the ebullient field's to the soldier's pewter-gray shield's to the rustic golden sun rays which occasionally shine through this hardened film give the film a uniquely polished look. It' as if Frank Miller himself painted each frame.The actor's own appearance will stun you as well. All the lead actors spent rigorous months to make their bodies look as though they were chiseled by Greek sculpters. The women are of course beautiful and breathtaking as well (though I don't think the female leads spent as much time in the weight room as these actor-turned-body-builders did.) At the start of the film, the characters did not seem believable. Gerard Butler and the modern, colloquial verbiage seemed out of place for a period piece. But as the movie progressed, the acting and the speech seemed more believable. When he Butler's Leonidas proclaims to the Persian messenger 'THIS IS SPARTA!' you can't imagine him saying it any differently, such is the power and conviction of his voice.The film is very accurate historically as well being quite realistic irrespective of the fantastic artwork and special effects. Besides a gnarled monster or two and the strange absence of food or water supplies for the soldiers in between battles, everyone and everything looks believable, and most importantly all the key plot points check out on the historian's checklist. These particular war-obsessed ancient Greeks really did 'discard' many weak-looking male babies and all disfigured ones. It really did happen as like the citizen-type selection process in Antz (at birth, the male baby ants in that film were either given spears or hammer's, signifying them for either the soldier or the worker-ant life).I found it inspiring, and I immediately thought of the soldiers who choose to enlist (and sometimes fight) in our army. Without them (and the laws that banished the draft), many would have to join up and fight against their will. The few and the proud these mighty Spartans are, indubitably.",8,5,11,13 March 2007
