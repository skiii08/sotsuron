First Man," Blair moon project
","I really didn't know the whole story behind Armstrong's landing but I didn't expect it to be so nauseating... the close ups, the constantly moving camera, the impossibly slow scenes. I cannot understand how anyone other that Neil Armstrong himself would rate this movie with more than 5.. The whole cast was great but the movie was awful.",4,9,15,19 October 2018
