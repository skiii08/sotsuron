Captain Phillips," A Superb Thriller !!!!!
","Another movie by Greengrass with On the edge of your seat thriller, highly intense & engaging! As always, great direction by Paul Greengrass. Exceptionally acted well by Tom Hanks(Captain Philips) and Barkhad Abdi(Pirate captain). Its really great to see Tom Hanks in his promising act as always! It's always a delight to watch him on screen with his hats-off act. Both the character, Hanks and Abdi will hold you on your seat till the climax of the movie. Story flows pretty with the pace and with the same intensity. Don't miss this intensifying thriller of 2013. A must watch and a title you must have in your thriller movies collection. Two thumbs UP! Go and watch it....",10,0,2,24 February 2015
Justice League," Movie that Critics are bashing but fans are loving. JUSTICE LEAGUE !! Satisfaction Served!
","Just watched the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie, reached home and writing my honest reviews.....Whatever the critics are saying, simply don't go by what they are saying!! Go for yourself to see how good the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie is. It is not perfect but than it is not at all that horrible and bad that these so called 'Critics' and sites/blogs are rating. I mean there are moments when Superman comes back and people just stood up from their seats and started applauding and so much more. If the latest Thor Movie (Thor:Ragnarok) can get so much good ratings and good reviews from critics i really wonder what went wrong with critics to rate so low scores to JUSTICE LEAGUE. I mean come-on! JUSTICE LEAGUE is not a perfect movie either but it seriously does not deserves only 2 STARS out of 5 or such a low ratings. I mean seriously....!I my opinion Thor:Ragnarok was nothing but a comedy movie. I know I know many would argue but it doesn't come close to my favorite 3 Marvel movies which i mentioned down in the end.There is surely and surely some serious issues with critics that went to watch JUSTICE LEAGUE like -><ul><li>they had hangover of previous night and it was still hammering their head, </li></ul><ul><li>or they are here to bash movies directed by Zack Snyder,</li></ul><ul><li>or they think that DC movies too must have comic dialogues right after every 2 Mins. (No offense but this has become Marvel movie trade mark now. Till the movie; Guardians of the Galaxy - 1 it was so good but then on-wards oh boy, every Marvel movie has been a comedy movie) </li></ul>So all the people out there who want to get entertained, don't listen or read these crazy, mindless critics and their reviews, or sites or blogs. Go for yourself and watch JUSTICE LEAGUE for enjoyment.Folks when you will leave the theaters after watching JUSTICE LEAGUE, you will go home with a smile on your face because of your dear characters of JUSTICE LEAGUE. And that's what your point is right? To get entertained.And wait till all the end credits roll up. There is a major post-credit scene waiting for you. Once you watch it, you will come to know from here-on how excited the DCEU is going to be now...PS: For people who think i am a DC fan, well I am a fan of good entertainment. I like both DC and Marvel whenever they serve me good entertainment. To list few:-Iron Man - 1, Guardians of the Galaxy - 1, Captain America: Civil Warare my 'THE BEST Marvel Movies' till date. There is no doubt about it. JUSTICE LEAGUE !!! Satisfaction Served !!!",8,3,7,17 November 2017
