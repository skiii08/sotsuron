Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol.2 is the 2nd half of one of the greatest movies ever.
","In my opinion, Kill Bill Vol.2 was one of the best sequels I've ever seen, even though it wasn't really a sequel. It seemed a little slow the first time I saw it, since I was expecting it to have all the same action as the first one. However, the second time around, I got to appreciate it for the great movie it was and how well everything came together. The chemistry between Uma Thurman and David Carradine was amazing. I think it's a crime that Carradine wasn't nominated for an academy award for his performance. Thurman should have been nominated as well. I thought the music and the atmosphere to this movie were great. The Kill Bill series was Quentin Tarantino's best work, in my opinion. If you've only seen Vol.2 once, you have to see it again to really appreciate how great it is.",10,2,4,11 July 2006
