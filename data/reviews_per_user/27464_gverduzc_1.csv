United 93," Not much better than the TV account of the incident
","I heard Roger Ebert and other TV wonks go on and on about this movie and was expecting something dramatically more realistic and interesting that the TV rendition of the flight 93 story. While it is a compelling and gut wrenching account of the incident, I found it only a little better than the TV version. It emphasized (and I expect accurately) the bumbling of NORAD and to some degree the FAA..obvious that we simply weren't prepared to deal with this sort of thing. Can only hope that in the future, when the next terrorist act comes along, we'll do a better job. I also noticed that Hollywood took their usual slap at Bush/Cheney, suggesting that they were unreachable as the incident unfolded thus delaying scrambling of jets to intercept the hijacked airplanes..at the end of the movie, in the postscript, the facts in this regard were clarified.",7,8,16,29 April 2006
