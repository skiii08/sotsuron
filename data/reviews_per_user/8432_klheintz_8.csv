Blade Runner 2049," Amazingly beautiful dystopian scifi
","I have been a fan of Villeneuve's work since I saw Prisoners on a whim back in 2013 and, since then, I have made it a habit to see all his newer movies and have enjoyed each one. When I heard that he would be directing the new Blade Runner, I decided that I would allow myself to get a little bit excited because I knew, considering his newest films, that it would be a well-made film and a well-made film it is. The original Blade Runner from 1982 did not originally do it for me on the first viewing. I know that is the case for a good amount of people but after I gave it a second chance, I have found myself giving it a third and a fourth chance. Nowadays I have come to really appreciate the film for what it is. So, to me, Blade Runner 2049 was a film that I was tentatively excited for and it wouldn't have surprised me if it turned out terribly. But boy, was I wrong. Now I don't want to break into summary territory; anyone who wants a summary can easily find a more coherent and well put together synopsis than I would ever be able to produce. Instead of that, I will talk about my reactions to the film.This movie is gorgeous. Seriously. It is one of the most beautifully shot films I have seen in recent memory and I was blown away at the stark contrasts of color presented throughout the entire film. The striking shots and the use of only a few colors in any specific scene was a joy to watch. I want to sit through this film again just so my eyeballs can be exposed to the striking colors. No movie can go wrong when Roger Deakins is the cinematographer and if he doesn't get the Oscar this year after so many amazing films, I will lose all hope for the awards. For such a long film, the fact he can constantly keep the viewer enthralled with the scenes is proof of his mastery.Performance-wise, the actors in this film are at the top of their game. The cast includes: Ryan Gosling as K, the stoic Blade Runner; Ana De Armas as Joi, the hologram AI edition of a girlfriend; Sylivia Hoeks as Luv, the stone-cold assassin (who might not be as cold as you think); and Jared Leto as Niander Wallace, the terrifying psychopath who purchased the remnants of Tyrell Corp from the first film. Even old Harrison Ford as Deckard, tries in this film. Tries! They all give great performances and, in my opinion, Ryan Gosling knocks it out of the freaking park. His scenes with Deckard and Joi are some of my favorite scenes of any film and I look forward to seeing this film a second time.The music! How can anyone forget that iconic Blade Runner music? Maybe, like me, you can't recall any specific beat or tune but you must remember the weird electronic music that can only be described as 'the future.' I don't even know what to properly call that style of bass and synth; however, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch sure found a way to recreate something similar. The pounding bass that shakes the screen (as well as your seat), screeching electronic sounds that make your ears hurt, and the combination of the two in a way that only increases the tension in the film are all things you should look forward to if you see the film. Anyone with a decent sound system should rejoice.Now that I have talked so much about all the things I loved about the film, I would be amiss if I didn't give a tad little bit of criticism. Certain parts of the film, while still adding to the film, aren't exactly necessary. I can't help but think that, if Villeneuve had only made a few small changes to the film, it could have been PG-13 easily. Blade Runner 2049 is not a 'Hard R' by any means and I think that if it was made with a lower rating in mind, it could have reached a much wider audience. Overall, the depths to this film is insane. The amount of hidden meanings and details throughout this gorgeous movie elevates this film to masterpiece status. I think it will require multiple viewings, some discussion, and even some research to establish a proper understanding of everything going on. I expect my opinions on aspects of the film will change over time and I look forward to experiencing that.",8,0,5,9 October 2017
Black Swan," A Nightmare-ish journey through the psyche
",I had to sit on this movie for a while before I could put into words my feelings on it. This film is terrifying and provoking in many many ways. I think the best thing the movie has to offer is the editing and the way colors are used to describe literally everything but still stay ambiguous. The clash of white/black shows the many ways characters are behaving or what their intentions are and it all fits somewhat inside of the story of the Swan Lake.The pacing of the story is also great. It never feels like it's slowing down and even the parts that are the slowest still feel important and add to the story. Never loses it focus and it is enjoyable the entire time.Another thing is the acting. Portman delivers the best performance of her career and shows us a girl who goes from mostly innocent to twisted and insane. It's so great and is complemented by a solid set of supporting characters. Kunis does a great job owning whatever scene she's in and is fun to watch. Cassel plays a twisted instructor with inappropriate intentions and he's creepy throughout but in a good way.Overall it's a great film following the insanity of the lead in a way I haven't seen before. So many things in the movie add to the entire picture and watching it multiple times will have you noticing even more things than the first time.,7,0,2,2 November 2016
War Dogs," One of it's kind
","War Dogs is an interesting movie. There's not many films out there that deal with arms dealers and even fewer, if any, could be considered a comedy. As a comedy though, it's a little lacking. Hill's character feels like an exact copy of his character in Wolf of Wall Street. Not necessarily a bad thing, it just feels like it doesn't have too much originality to it.I think the best thing the film has to offer is the chemistry between Teller and Hill. They both deliver great performances and when they are both on screen together it is great. In fact it's not just them, all the characters in the film are well cast and all do a great job.Now the movie is about 2 criminals who are selling weapons/munitions to the US government during the war. With a summary like that, you'd think it would be a little darker or more serious. It's very lighthearted with a story that could have been a lot more deep and even funnier.Overall it's not a bad movie. It's not a great movie, it's slightly better than OK. I just think it needed to play it a little more serious and not make some of the characters seem so likable.",5,0,1,11 November 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Better than the original, but plot holes and lack of direction in some characters keep it from greatness
","Ocean's Eleven follows the story of Danny Ocean putting together the biggest heist Vegas has ever seen. He enlists the help of a few close friends to help him put together an impossible team for an impossible job, and it's fun the whole way through. If you don't pay attention to some glaring plot holes.I enjoy this film, I really do. Even with the blatant plot holes, unbelievable means by which they pull of the heist, and the back-and- forth character motivations it is by no means a perfect film. But is a fun ride the whole way through and I am glad that I watched it. Ocean's Eleven wastes no time getting right into the heist, and the sequence of scenes depicting the gang being brought together is fun to watch and does a decent job of setting up some of their individual backstory. But these backstories, while serving the purpose of the film, do not give audiences much that seems very exciting except for maybe Tarr's bank heist. Steven Soderbergh utilizes more than just quick and witty dialogue to advance the plot but also takes advantage of silent storytelling with some scenes containing no dialogue whatsoever. He does this throughout not only this sequence, but various other scenes in the film as well. It's a nice upbeat way to advance the plot and break up major parts of the film.I have yet to talk about cast and this is one of my favorite aspects of this film. I have always been a fan of both Clooney and Pitt, so seeing them on screen interacting with each other is very cool. Sure, Brad Pitt's character, Rusty, kind of feels like a mat for Ocean's dialogue to bounce of, but it was enjoyable throughout. Most of the other characters don't have scenes that really stick out as fun dialogue or even good interaction except Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict.Something the film does terribly is the motivation and choices some of these characters make. Oh and the plot holes with the hooker ads somehow getting into the vault out of nowhere. Like what is that!? But back to these motivations/decisions. In what world does it make sense for Tess, who left Ocean because he was a liar, to go back to Ocean? That makes absolutely no sense to me. The better option, the option that should have happened, was for her to realize she's nothing but a trophy to them and leave. Ridiculous like the hooker ads somehow showing up inside the vault. Overall, I believe this is a solid heist film. Yes, it has a few plot holes but, the character decisions will make you confused, and it has some weird accents but I think it is an enjoyable ride throughout and definitely one I would recommend to someone for some light viewing.",6,0,1,9 October 2017
Don't Breathe," The Editing was great
","Don't Breathe is a different kind of movie in the home invasion genre because it actually follows those who invaded in the first place getting hunted. I have yet to see a movie like that so I found the beginning very enjoyable and was almost rooting for the 'Blind Guy.' That changed pretty quickly.The movie is very intense and the editing in the movie is very well done. The way scenes/shots are set up are freaking great in my opinion. There were many moments I went back to watch the last few seconds again because it was such a well set up scene. Definitely the best thing about the movie.Without getting into spoilers or anything, a lot is made clear towards the end of the movie but it still tries to stay relatively realistic even though the last 1/3rd of the movie doesn't feel like anything special.Overall the movie as a whole is still very good with certain parts of it feeling perfect and then other parts, like the flow of scenes towards the end, lose the appeal and tension of the beginning by throwing in typical tropes.",7,5,10,1 November 2016
Arrival," A well-paced sci-fi with a lackluster payoff
","The Arrival is a film I was very excited to see. Villeneuve's past 3 films have been solid films that I enjoyed quite a bit with my favorite being Prisoners. I am glad that he goes back to the weird twists that Enemy has with this one but they don't quite hit home to me like Enemy.The film is very very slow and methodical in it's pacing, and while it may seem like it drags on at points, I never felt bored with the film. My intrigue only grew as the movie progressed and you started to see progress in both story lines. I was glad that they focused on the human aspect and stayed away from any kind of alien action sequences. The slow discovery of the film reminds me very much of 2001 A Space Odyssey as I've seen many other reviews stating and it's a very similar film. Many movies nowadays fail to deliver discovery/mystery in a way like this. Now everything in the movie is put together in a great way but the whole payoff for the aliens and their purpose and how integral Adams is to everything just isn't that great. The twist hit home really well but once it is revealed you put all the pieces in place fairly quickly if you were paying attention and the film drops the ball by not throwing a few more. Overall it's a gorgeous film with wonderful pacing. I may be acting like an adrenaline junky by requesting more twists but I feel the buildup could've allowed for a little more to the ending.",6,1,6,25 November 2016
The Woman in Black," Predictable jump scares around an overused plot
",The Woman in Black isn't a bad movie. It's just average. Extremely average. I don't take average as bad though and I enjoyed watching this movie. Radcliffe does a great job in the movie but his character isn't anything special. He just plays a simple man who really acts a fool around sketchy stuff.My main gripe with the movie is how almost all the jump scares are predictable and the ones that aren't don't add anything to the movie or establish the ghost in any way. Makes it feel more like a haunted house attraction than an actual scary movie.What is great about the movie is the acting that I've already mentioned and the amazing cinematography. Many of the scenes would make for a really nice poster or wallpaper and I really enjoyed the scenes we get to see.Overall it's an average horror film that's very predictable in both the plot and the scares. Tries to throw in a twist ending but it didn't hit home for me at all. Pretty movies though,5,3,4,13 November 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Classic Horror that bleeds into the films of today
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is the first movie in a series of films that did become the 'typical horror movie' but this one doesn't suffer from it. It's got an interesting story, a solid villain, and some awesome scenes of brutality. It has just the right amount of those 3 elements as well.The acting in the movie is about what you can expect from the 80s, the dialogue is a little cheesy and the line deliver is nothing Oscar-worthy. But that doesn't detract from the film or even feel out of place but what does feel out of place is the music. The music is not good, may have worked back then but it did not age well.Going back to what I said about the right amount of the three categories I listed: The scenes of gore are really well done. Especially the first death in the film, It's one of the best scenes from a horror movie I've seen. Even the rest of them are well done and are very original.Overall it's a good classic horror movie with some crazy effects and a creepy villain.",6,1,3,7 November 2016
