Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing, to say the least
","First, let me say I'm a 'Star Wars' fan.  I still remember  being 11 years old and watching the original film.  I don't think I've ever had more 'fun' watching a movie.  It was simply a great film.  Years later,  I've seen the movie countless times, and whenever it comes on, or even, if it happens to be showing in department store, I find myself drawn to watch it, though I can quote the dialog and know virtually every detail of the scene.  And that's not because I'm the typical Star Wars geek (though I likely was in my youth), it's just a good, compelling film.  I never get tired of seeing it.Empire was an equally good film.  And excellent transition that carried the story exceedingly well. Sadly, Return was a disappointment and, though made over a decade earlier, apparently a precursor of what was to come. WARNING:  POTENTIAL SPOILERS This is not a good film.  It crawls at times, the acting, despite an incredibly talented cast, is horrid.  When I watch the scene with Liam Neeson, Ewan McGreggor and that _____ Jar Jar JamiacaMon in the submarine being chased by large sea monsters, and hear Neeson, an excellent actor, state, with no emotion whatsoever, 'there's always a bigger fish', it's like listening to a piano out of tune.  I ask myself, how poor must Lucas' direction have been to get such horrid work out of an actor like Neeson?Sadly, there is little for the actors to work with.  The plot, from virtually the opening credits, is senseless.  To call it comic-book level is to do injustice to comic books.  Stan Lee certainly never penned a plot this absurd.But what's really frustrating as a fan of the series is the damage it does to its own story and mythos.Allow a recap.  Star Wars was a wonderful 'fairy tale' of good vs. evil, hope and rebirth.  But the key points on which the original trilogy is based are either undone, forgotten, or simply stretched to absurdity.What many don't know is that Lucas intended multiple episodes from the beginning.  Indeed, it was originally intended to be a 12-part story. That said, it is becoming apparent that he hadn't worked the plot details out at the time and he's done much of it 'after-the-fact' and it shows.I've always thought he didn't decide Darth Vader was Luke's father until he wrote Empire.  If you watch Star Wars, there is virtually no foreshadowing of the event and it seems somewhat, contrived.  But that was nothing compared to what he does in Menace.Okay, in Star Wars, 'A New Hope' we get two droids, otherwise unimportant, who escape to the planet Tatooine.   They do this because Princess Leia, who is aboard the ship (remember, R2 and C3PO are not owned by her--they belong to the ship's captain) and traveling to Tatooine to meet with Obi-Wan Kenobi, a friend of her father's, manages to sneak a message/program into R2.  It's rather apparent that the choice of R2 is chance.Well, they land, meet up with Luke and he brings them, after discovering Leia's message to Obi-Wan/Ben Kenobi.  He makes the comment to Ben, that the droids must belong to him. Kenobi states 'Strange, I don't remember ever owning any droids'.  Freeze that, and remember it.Cut to Phantom Menace.  Young Obi-Wan embarks on what will clearly be one of the great adventures of his life, thus you'd expect it to be something he might remember.  He has the initial adventure on Naboo and, after rescuing the Princess Amidala and escaping the planet, is saved by none other than, the same R2 unit.  An R2 unit that will continue to play a significant role in his life.Okay, let's just say the 'coincidence' is putting the 'willing suspension of disbelief' to a rather strenuous test.But we're supposed to believe that when this same R2 unit shows up years later, involved in a story rather dramatically connected to this one (remember, Ben will know who Amidala is, who Luke is and who Leia is), HE DOESN'T REMEMBER THE VERY SAME R2 UNIT?!!!???Wait.  There's more.The escape forces them to land on, c'mon, guess where---Tatooine.Ooookaaayyyyy.  We're in serious coincidence mode here.Not done yet.Who does he meet on Tatooine?   Why, the boy who would become, Luke's father, his most promising student, and one of the great evils in the galaxy.  Little Darth Vader.Here it comes.Little Darth is not only a burgeoning messiah, having been immaculately conceived (what the @#$ is that about?!?), he's also a little Wile E. Coyote super genius.  In  his spare time, he's building a droid.Wait for it.C3POYep, the same C3PO who befriends R2 and year's later, returns to Tatooine, through SHEER COINCIDENCE to find his builder's son, and hook up yet again with Obi Wan Kenobi.Not, mind you, that either C3PO or R2 apparently still have this rather tantalizing bit of information anywhere in their databanks.And again, Obi-Wan meets a child who's building a droid, apparently a rather significant feat, and has no recollection of that very same droid who miraculously returns to the planet of its creation years later to....well, you get the idea.Frankly, it makes my head hurt.  It's one thing to play fast and loose with the rules of physics and the universe--I understand the difference between Space Opera/Fantasy and Science Fiction.  It's quite another to treat your audience like idiots who won't notice INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE AFTER INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE.I understand that for people who weren't remotely familiar with the series, it wasn't a horrible flick, though not a particularly great one.
My kids seem to like it.Regrettably, I find it barely watchable.  In fact, it's almost painful.Not a good film.  Poorly directed.  Weakly acted, and simply horridly written.",Null,0,1,17 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," And so, it finally ends. Oh, what could have been.
","Well, I finally saw it. I didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying.I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I'll never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting.And that's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas is (The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson).*****SPOILERS AHEAD******** The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome.First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the 'chosen one'. Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake.Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history--the great tragedy of Darth Vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the 'dark one to be' to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality.Well, of course he does.Sheesh.How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of 'she's lost the will to live'. Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO's mind is wiped, but not R2's--why????) stating 'I think these droids belong to you', Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be 'the chosen one' and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says 'strange, I don't recall owning any droids'.Oh good grief.Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars.It's an afterthought, and it looks it.I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever. Thankfully, this one, and the two preceding it, will soon fade.",4,14,26,7 June 2005
