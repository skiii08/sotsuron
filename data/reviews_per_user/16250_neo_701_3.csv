Iron Man 3," Disappoiting, very disappointing
","Well, many things have been said and told in this review section about Iron Man 3, so let me add my comments as briefly as possible ... Once again, there *will be SPOILERS*!The Good: - The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here. <ul><li>The CGI. There are some scenes, two especially, which are groundbreaking: the attack on Tony's house and the rescue of the Air Force One passengers. The rest is outstanding as well. </li></ul><ul><li>The fun. Some of the lines are hilarious, the British jokes (about soccer, Downton Abbey, etc) refreshing. Robert Downey at his best, again.</li></ul>The Bad: - The plot. The Extremis storyline, the Mandarin, Tony's panic attacks: There is so much stuff to make a good, even a great storyline. And then THIS? I bet everyone who reads this, have seen dozens of movies similar to the showdown and to the revealing of the baddie's masterplan. Come on, after 'Avengers', we expect more, we expect better! <ul><li>The villains. Guy Pearce is OK, but only OK. Viewers were waiting for a brilliant, scaring guy and get someone who is ... OK. And the Mandarin??? No. F***ing. Way. No. Just NO! Nuff said.</li></ul>The Ugly: - This is no Comic Movie. Why? Because the director is no comic freak, you can see it and feel it in each and every scene. There are more than two hours of film and Tony is in his suit for how long altogether? 10 minutes? I know this movie want to focus on Tony Stark, not his alter ego. But so did the first part and it was a comic movie in the sense of the word. This one is a comedy perhaps with good action sequences, no more and no less. Shane Black may be a good director, but he doesn't know what to make out of comic book stuff. Some examples: The Iron Patriot is wasted as is the whole character of Rhodey. The permanent changing of Iron Man armors for Tony is lame. As is the mind(?) controlled Mack 42, because it gets boring to see it flying around after the third time. And then, there is the Mandarin. Who at Marvel could approve to this 'twist', for crying out loud??? Which comic fan can possible like it??? I was looking SO forward to an epic showdown between Iron Man and his nemesis - and then came THIS?OK, that's where I have to stop. By the way, the 3D doesn't contribute to the action scenes. My advice: save some bucks and watch the 2D version. Or even better: Don't watch it if you're a comic fan. Not even on Blu-ray.",4,88,175,26 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good, really good. But not great.
","First of all, let me state that I recently saw Iron Man 3 and I've enjoyed Star Trek Into Darkness WAY more than the first. Why? Because it is plain and simple a very good movie. Iron Man, in my opinion, is not.One more thing: For everybody who compares this Star Tek movie to 'Wrath of Khan': Into Darkness takes place way earlier in Trek-continuity than the 'original' second Star Trek movie! You must compare it to the episode 'Space Seed' from TOS, because that's when the Enterprise first discovers Khan in space. In the time-line from J.J. Abrams' movie, Khan and his crew just hasn't been found by Kirk and his crew and so everything happens as it happens in the film ...But now into detail:<ul><li>The Good:</li></ul>The acting. Benedict Cumberbatch simply is PERFECT. Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana, Peter Weller, Simon Pegg and John Cho are also great. And even Chris Pine shows that he can act (no, really). The CGI. There is so much action happening in this movie and you do not ONCE think of it not being real. I guess that's the best you can say about CGI used in a film. There's one exception, though: See 'The Ugly'.The script. Adapting one of the most famous story lines/villains in Star Trek history is risky, to say the least. They did it very well. Cumberbatch's Khan is scarier than Ricard Montalban's and even though it's hard to believe that a Star Trek Admiral is even a bigger lunatic than Khan, at the end it all comes together fine. The chemistry between Kirk and Spock with all its tension is well scripted, too The dialogue. Yes, I know, this is also part of the script, but it deserves a special note. Funny, emotional ... and sometimes epic. 'nuff said.<ul><li>The Bad:</li></ul>The side characters. Bones, Chekov, Scotty. In this movie, they are just here to ... be here. Especially Chekov is so 'unnecessary' that they take him as a substitute to Scotty in Engineering?! I'm sure that aboard a starship there is at least one other person who is more qualified than a helmsman(!) to be Acting Chief Engineer? And Scotty as a 'Secret Agent'? Doesn't work for me. Next time, please involve more of the crew members in the actual main plot!The plot holes. This contradicts my praise for the script a bit, but I just wanted to point out that there are some really ridiculous scenes: John Harrison tells Kirk his real name and he calls himself just 'Khan'? Not 'Khan Noonien Singh'? Who would do it like that? Not me! Scotty can get aboard Admiral Marcus' ship undetected? I don't think so! Khan is not able to scan his torpedoes for lifeforms, when he beams them aboard? No way! A helmsman becomes Chief Engineer? But I had that one already ...Leonard Nimoy. Why was he in the film??? His scene was really unnecessary and even more ridiculous than the ones mentioned above. So will young Spock call his older self in each and every movie to come? And will Nimoy-Spock tell Quinto-Spock everything he wants to know? Frankly, I don't care: Please get rid of Obi-Wan-Kespock!<ul><li>The Ugly:</li></ul>The Beaming. There were so many great special effects - and then the beaming of people looks like they got caught in a bunch of wool? I don't get it ...The Showdown. I was a bit disappointed by the way, Abrams & Co did the final battle between Khan and Spock. I think, a villain like that shouldn't be defeated on top of a car. Khan deserves more.The 3D. Just. Totally. Unnecessary.That's it: Seven Stars, period.",7,3,13,11 May 2013
Man of Steel," Oh, man ...
","The Good: The first half of the movie. - The scenes on Krypton were quite OK as was the part when we learn how Clark was raised. Henry Cavill is a worthy successor to Christopher Reeve in my opinion, he actually CAN act. - Thumbs up for Kevin Costner as well.The Bad: The second half of the movie. - Come on, does anyone really want to see two guys punching themselves through a major city? This fight was so ridiculous, its sole purpose was to lay as many buildings as possible in ruins; even when Supes and Zod flew into space they had to encounter a satellite ... to destroy it, that is. It all seemed like a huge fight of the WWE: Everyone knows who will win, and everyone knows that one fighter can not really hurt the other. Boring, to say the least. Especially after the fight in Smallville, the final showdown is lame.<ul><li>There are so many plot holes in this movie that I don't even know where to begin. I know, this is a comic/Sci Fi Movie, but COME ON! E.g. Clark was exposed to the sun and the atmosphere for more than 30 years and grew as strong as he is because of that. Zod &amp; Co can NOT have these powers after being on Earth for such a short period of time. And what about telling the world that Lois Lane knows who Superman really is? Don't you think EVERYONE would like to know and almost everyone would find out?</li></ul><ul><li>Zod or rather Michael Shannon. Zod is such an iconic villain, such a great opponent for Superman in the comic books that there should have been a more charismatic actor than Mr. Shannon. Or maybe just a better one. 'Nuff said.</li></ul>The Ugly: - As in The Dark Knight series, you can see one thing: Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer are not your Friendly Neighbourhood Comic Book Freaks. Their stories are concentrating on the dark (sic) sides of their characters, their inner demons and their struggles. This doesn't have to be a bad thing for a superhero movie. But it becomes 'ugly' when the director is not able to do something iconic with the characters or with the script, respectively. Did you get the goosebumps, when Clark puts on the Superman suit in 'Man of Steel' for the first time? Me neither. - And: Like it or not, Superman stands for 'NO KILLING'. But this one doesn't. And that is the most sacrilegious thing that could happen in a Superman movie. - 3D: Unnecessary. Again.",4,3,7,23 June 2013
