The Incredible Hulk," Lovely 'til the very end (literally)
","I decided to watch this movie with only loose knowledge of the Hulk. All I knew going in was the very basics- Bruce Banner is a scientist who's experiment goes awry and he turns into a monster every time he gets angry. I didn't know what this version was going to be like, and I had NO idea whether a sequel was in the making (which would ruin the fear you get out of wondering whether the main character will or won't die). This movie is AWESOME that way!!!!!I loved the fact that Bruce Banner is a misunderstood villain. He tries to control his... I'll call it his disease, he works on controlling his temper. He even tells people, 'I'm not good when I'm angry.' He's used to playing cat and mouse with the government, is pretty smart (Well, duh, he's a SCIENTIST), very mysterious and (excuse my language) undoubtedly cute! In other words, there's no better choice for this role than Edward Norton. Even though he's technically a villain since he has no control over his disease, I still found myself loving every bit of him on screen. I'm not saying this is bad, but Edward Norton, at least in this, has a habit of making simple lines pull at you and make you love the Hulk. (Oddly, I found myself smiling when he said, 'The circumstances called for improvisation.' Who would've thought that barfing could be adorable?!) I was routing for him the entire time and Edward Norton never failed to deliver a line perfectly.Setting Bruce Banner and Edward Norton aside, the rest of this movie doesn't fail to go past expectations! Usually in action movies I just assume that all the main characters will live because that's just how action movies work. In this, my jaw dropped more than once and I did say, 'Aww, what? They're dead?' at one point before breathing a sigh of relief. The excellent CGI really helped keep the action pumping; I think my mind forgot that the Hulk is just an image made by a computer for about 10 minutes!'Now, why didn't you give this a 10?' you may be asking yourself. I gave this a 9 because the ending, though completely fitting, was a little disappointing. It was a bit like watching the end of Inception, you find yourself wondering whether Bruce has overcome his disease or whether the disease has overcome him. I'd like to think Bruce won.Robert Downey Jr. He had a completely random cameo at the very very end that apparently leads to the vague idea of a sequel of some sort (And this is coming from a die-hard Downey fan). I thought Iron Man was arrogant and, at the end of the first Iron Man film (which also came out in 2008), he believed he could fair by himself. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson told him other wise at the very very end of Iron Man, but why on Earth would Tony Stark listen to him and not all the other people who've tried to give him advice? This Avenger's movie better be EPIC or I'll feel like I just got slapped in the face!All in all, though, this is a great movie. Since you've read my review (hopefully), I'm assuming you've read how much information I came into this movie with. That's all you need to truly enjoy this film. And one last thing. I tried to resist, but I can't help myself: 'HULK SMAAAAAAASH!' :D",9,2,3,10 November 2010
Source Code," Worth seeing!
","From the beautiful opening shots of Chicago to the final gasps before the closing credits, Source Code keeps a grip on you. At first I felt like I was watching a weird rip-off of Inception, but the farther I got into Source Code, the more I wanted to see. There's enough humor in the dialog to keep this from becoming a mindless mess of science-y talk (like Inception was at parts) but enough twists and turns to make your mind reel over what just happened again and again.The concept that drives Source Code was obviously well thought out and throughout the film there's a preciseness in the acting that rings strong. Honestly, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Colter Stevens may just beat Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in Inception.There are two great things about Source Code that I want to point out. One is how smoothly the plot flows, considering how complicated the movie's concept is. Two is the soundtrack. The music truly drives this film along. If you listen carefully, you'll realize that the soundtrack sounds like a train chugging along. It made the action more intense and the sad moments even sadder.There was only one fault I could find in Source Code. It feels like it needed more time to be made. They left one noticeable plot hole, and occasionally they would forget a minor detail in the repeated pattern Colter Stevens is supposed to live through.All in all, Source Code is well worth seeing, and I recommend it as one of 2011's best movies (so far, at least). This movie deserves far more praise than it's gotten.As a side note, if gore makes you squeamish, you may need to cover your eyes a few times seeing Source Code.",8,0,0,20 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Improves on the first one
","Robert Downey Jr. coaxed you into the movie theater to see something you'd never usually see- a sci-fi comic book hero movie. Now you're back like a hungry kitten looking for more. And Rob Downey's metaphorically waiting at his doorstep for you to come back so he can give you some more (movies, I mean). Maybe I should stop with the metaphors. All I'm trying to get at is this movie totally dominates over the first one.Having one villain was cool. But how about fighting a whole army of robots programmed to kill you? WIth Tony Stark, saddle up. This is gonna be a crazy ride.My legs hurt by the end because I had been leaning on my seat the entire time! The action is more intense, the comedy really sticks out and everything really seems to bunker down and get into serious comic book entertainment mode. And the looming question of will Pepper and Tony kiss or not still bites at you. Are they going to make us wait until 2013 to see them kiss? Hmm.DEFINITELY if you saw the first one YOU MUST SEE THIS! And after speaking to some people, even if you haven't seen the first one you still catch on. You won't be sitting there going 'Huh?' for 2 hours.There's more of everything from the first movie (in a good way) in this, and yes, Robert Downey Jr. is unquestionably HOT in this! ^.^",9,4,6,3 October 2010
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man just keeps getting better and better!
","This movie takes everything from the first movie: all the love, action, and super-hero from the first movie and just makes it so much better! This one was much more serious than the first one. Peter/Spider-Man has everything going wrong for him. He's losing his powers. his job, his dream girl, he's ruining his grades and the entire time you just want it all to work out for him.Without a doubt the CGI in this one is much better than the CGI in the first, but that's obviously because technology had two years to advance itself. I still don't understand how they did all the scenes with Doc Oc. Hmmm. Magical Hollywood, I guess.If you saw the first Spider-Man I would without a doubt say see this one.I already have the third one sitting next to me waiting to be watched. This one's kinda like Iron Man 2- you don't necessarily need to see the first one to get the second one, but it's still a good idea to see the first one.In other words: SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,3,3,3 September 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Comes and goes
","I wanted to like this, I really did. I sat down and I told myself that this was going to be my new favorite super-hero film, that Spider-Man was trash compared to this. I lied to . Honestly, for the first half hour I found myself either twiddling my thumbs or scratching my head in confusion.After that half hour, though, I started to understand what was happening and I was starting to enjoy myself. And then there was a bizarre fight scene and I lost all interest again. Twenty minutes later I got interested again- but this is NOT a consistent film. I was horrified to find out I still had forty minutes to watch, but I stuck it out. And I thought it was worth it to sit through the mindless arguments and random fights, because I was starting to get into it. Yes, there are some great moments in this film, but they're smothered by bizarre conversations, too many innocent people getting killed and WAY too many flashbacks. (We get it, Wolverine wants vengeance!)If you're the type for unnecessary explosions and random sword fights (because technically their hands count as swords) then this is perfect for you. But if you're the innocent movie- goer who's hoping for the next best super-hero flick since Tobey Maguire swung across the screen as the invincible Spider-Man, I warn you- DO NOT SEE THIS! You will lose an hour and fifty minutes of your life!",5,0,2,2 April 2011
Spider-Man 3," Different than the first two... not necessarily in a bad way
","First of all I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had more action than the first two, more suspense (considering they most likely won't make a fourth movie I was honestly fearful for Peter's life through out the duration of the movie) and it was much darker than the first two. The villains were tougher, all the relationships were more complex... MAN was this a good movie!Yes, this could've been better. Any movie has room to improve. Some of the injuries Peter manages to survive seem a little too far-fetched, even for a super-hero. He walks away from some of these fights with a few scratches on his arms maybe and that's it! It might have been better if the film-makers had hurt him a little more considering how many women simply LOVE Tobey Maguire.As with the previous Spidey movie, the CGI improved. It needs to if you're going to have a guy made of sand and a creepy poisonous alien thing trying to kill Peter all while the Green Goblin's floating around. Sandman was VERY cool. Venom... not so much but seeing that he's a popular villain he was in his proper place.Most of the relationships really twist. I mean, they never really explain what happens with Peter and MJ, you're only assuming it works out. Spider-Man 4 could certainly help with this. The Peter/Ursala (the anorexic girl) relationship still leaves me puzzled. Hmm. I'll save that for another review.It doesn't really seem like the place to leave Spider-Man hanging (Haha get it? :P). A fourth installment would most certainly not be out of line. Spider-Man seems to collapse within himself and then rebuild in each installment. It would be nice to finally see him get a break. I love love LOVE every second of the movie. Just like any good comic book movie sequel, even if you haven't seen the first two you won't be completely lost watching this. Highly recommended. If you love action then you'll LOVE this!!!!!!",7,6,7,4 September 2010
Tangled," A little slow, but fun
","I didn't realize this was a singing movie. Ugh. I usually don't like singing. However, hearing Zachary Levi sing was enough for me to bite my tongue and not complain. If you've got little kids, they'll certainly enjoy themselves. Everyone knows the story of Rapunzel; it's nice to see her get a face lift in this. But like any Disney movie, this was incredibly predictable (Except for one part, but I'll get to that in a moment). The voicing was great, but it gets squandered by a delusional Rapunzel singing the SAME 5 NOTES OVER AND OVER AGAIN about how her dream is to see these 'magical' lanterns fly through the sky. I get the jist of it, but I just never really got into it.Without a doubt Zachary Levi and Rapunzel's pet chameleon (who's name is Pascal) are the strongest things this film's got going for it. Of course, in almost every Disney movie now there seems to be the clichÃ© creature of some sort that makes funny faces and amuses the audience. ClichÃ©s aside, Pascal is really funny, especially when he interacts with Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi's character). A chameleon for a pet is a great choice by Disney- his color would change with the tone of the characters and really set the mood.Flynn Rider is the unmatched diamond amongst the dust in this. Unlike the original Rapunzel story, he accidentally finds Rapunzel, leading to a rather funny scene where Rapunzel smashing her frying pan into his head. How he survived this I don't know, but it's a kids movie so I won't complain. Zachary Levi had fun with this and it really shines through.The star of this whole movie was, to be nice, a dud. After about the third time she sang about how she wants to escape her tower, even though she already did so, I really wanted to punch her in the face. Not hard, but enough to get her to STOP SINGING! Why on Earth Flynn Rider stays with her is beyond me. I felt myself getting angrier and angrier the longer the film lasted.Rapunzel and her singing ability aside, this was a great movie. There's a nice twist at the end that I don't want to spoil. It's worth your $15 to see Zachary Levi sing, but cover your ears once Rapunzel starts 'singing'. Take your kids or grandkids, they'll enjoy this, but hope with all your might they don't try to sing some of the songs on the way home.",6,1,9,22 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Brutal to those who never read the books
","Firstly, the only reason I saw this was because, some way or another, I have seen all the other films in this series. I never read the books; I tried but found them mind-numbingly boring. I am not one for fantasy wizards in England.Why is everyone acting like Daniel Radcliffe is God's gift to the earth? He has two faces in this entire film: angry and bored. Ugh. Ron isn't much better, and he looks a lot less disheveled in the previous films. He knows what shampoo is, right? Hermione wasn't as bad; Emma Watson is clearly a better actor than her co-stars. That being said, she deserves a better role than the girl-from-the-first-movie-who-was-really-dorky-that-we-all-think- Harry-is-going-to-sleep-with-by-the-end-of-this-film.I felt bad for all the Potter fans around me. I kept laughing at parts that aren't meant to be funny. They kept glaring at me, but I couldn't help it! The director obviously made no effort to explain any Potter-isms not explained in the previous movies. I literally sat through two and a half hours of mindless mumbo-jumbo. Why can't Voldemort (Ooooh! I said 'Voldemort'! Are the death eaters going to kill me? No. They aren't. Voldemort isn't real.) just hire some pimps to shoot Harry? And what's with all the wizards hating 'muggles'? I think it's pretty cool being normal!The CGI wasn't terrible and I had a good laugh. I guess I'll see the last in this series because otherwise I'll feel like I wasted all this time watching the previous ones. Do NOT put yourself through this if you haven't read the books!",4,6,8,11 December 2010
Spider-Man," Love it! :D
","Seeing this movie 8 years after it was made, I kind of expected rough CGI. I thought it was surprisingly good! (Even the Green Goblin wasn't too cheesy!)It's really easy to screw up a super-hero movie, as displayed by countless Super Man movies. This is not a bad super-hero movie. Aside from Iron Man, this is probably my favorite!Applause to Tobey Maguire for his performance in this. Looking at all the other choices to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, including one of my favorites, Leo DiCaprio, I really can't think of a more suitable Spider-Man. There're a lot of physical scenes in this movie, (some are CGI, but as I mentioned the CGI is incredibly well done and there are parts where you are wondering if it's a Maguire or not) and he couldn't have done a better job. Not to mention he's just adorable in this and you can't take your eyes off him!I've never read a comic book in my life and I liked this. However, I'm a super-hero movie fan, so I asked around and most everyone had high remarks. High action and high entertainment- highly recommended to anyone looking for an action movie! (Be warned- once you see this one you'll want to see the second and third ones, too!)",9,0,1,28 August 2010
Back to the Future Part III," A satisfying ending to a satisfying trilogy
","This makes me want to go back and watch the whole trilogy again!!!!!!!Marty, I mean Clint Eastwood ;), is blasted back to 1885 to save the doc from a gang of thuds. However, once he's there he discovers quite a problem. I'll try not to give too much away.You thought blasting Marty into 2015 was funny? Yeah, I agree, but this was just as funny. Some of the humor this time comes from continuity (especially the sequence of 'I had a horrible nightmare.' 'Well, you're back in (fill in the blank) now.' 'WHAT?!' But it's still funny the third time.) Within 5 minutes of Marty arriving he's already nearly killed, which is probably the least amount of action you'll see in the entire movie. A lot more romance, a lot more action and a lot more humor can be expected from this one.Not to be punny, but while this movie goes a little off the rails from the first movie, it's still entertaining and keeps you guessing.Michael J. Fox still has the best facial expressions. Lol, I really want to see this whole trilogy again!!!!!",9,2,2,25 September 2010
The Dark Knight," Not what I expected, but still great
","This... is not what I expect from a superhero movie. However, since Batman is technically not a superhero since he has no super powers, this was fantastic.The Joker was acted neither too seriously or too playfully. He was sinister, creepy, amusing and fascinating. You never knew his next step and I absolutely loved that. And his constant changing story of how he got his scars and his purely insane crimes kept me amused until the very end....And Batman. Though I was surprised at first (for the odd reason of thinking he doesn't look like a superhero), in the end I really liked him. He's serious, unmovable and guileful.There's action, action, action galore, romance (though it becomes somber) and an excellent script. I was perplexed and mystified and, undoubtedly entertained.Now, the reason I gave this an 8 was for Harvey Dent. Without giving anything away, he really really started creeping me out after about an hour. Though this was necessary for the script. Hmm. I'll bump it up to a 9.",9,1,3,22 October 2010
Inception," Stunning...
","I'm not really sure what I should be saying about this movie. It was... different. Not in a bad way, but it was different. I definitely liked it. ...Hmm. I've never had to think this hard about what to write in a review!First, I'd like to say that the soundtrack for this is probably my favorite (soundtrack, that is). It truly accentuates the emotions that the actors show. You feel the excitement from 'Mombasa', the pain in 'Old Souls' and... I don't really know what emotion I felt, but 'Time' is definitely the crown jewel. You definitely get that, 'Aw, what? It can't end here!' feeling when the movie ends, and I'd say that without 'Time', the movie just wouldn't have had such an exciting ending. Hans Zimmer brought out the big guns for this film.The idea that you can do crazy things with your mind has been around forever, but I don't think the idea that you can control your dreams has ever been explored. Originality is sparse at the movie theaters, but every so often something like 'Inception' comes around and makes you realize just how awesome movies are. I kept thinking I had a grasp of what would happen next to the characters, then the complete opposite would happen. 'Inception' leaves you begging for more, yet begging for the action and suspense to end!Would this film have worked without Leo DiCaprio? Probably not. He was the perfect choice for his role. I don't really know how to explain this, but I was cheering him on the entire time, even though a lot of the group's problems came from his unconscious. I know that's confusing, but that's what makes this movie so great. You're completely lost the entire time, then at the very end you realize that you knew everything the entire time!I know this review is confusing. I never said I expected this to be my best review. Reviewing skills aside, this is a movie you NEED to see. Trust me!",10,2,7,12 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Yeah it's not the Holmes you're thinking of- it's an even better one
","Living with a die-hard Doyle fan, I had to hear all the terrible things about how this movie is 'nothing like the real Sherlock Holmes' and how 'dumb' it looks and 'look at how stupid the trailers are' for months before this actually came out. So, naturally, the day after it opened (we weren't going to see it on Christmas!) I grabbed a friend and we went with the Holmes dork to 'see how bad it is'.It's NOT bad. In fact, it's fantastic! I can't think of anyone who could've better delivered some of the sarcastic lines Holmes had than Robert Downey Jr. The role just seemed to fit him perfectly, and I enjoyed every minute of his screen time. (This might have been in part because he's just so hot but he played the role very well and deserved that Golden Globe he won.) And who could've better played the smart, mostly patient Watson than Jude Law? His funniest lines would demeaning what Holmes had just said, giving you a two for one- laughing first at what Holmes would say and then laughing again at the reaction. The 'bromance' these two have on screen is just perfect. You couldn't ask for a better duo.What the Holmes geek I went to see this with didn't understand is that people nowadays love seeing explosions and fights and hot romance. No, this movie didn't over-stress mindless fighting and random explosions. If one happened to come up it's because it fit, not because they wanted to pawn off mindless explosions.Probably one of the best things about this movie is it's soundtrack! I rushed home and bought it and have since found myself listening to it over and over again. Half of them are somber and quiet, while the other half are exciting violin pieces. They fit the time period this movie's set in but don't bore most modern audiences (none of the people I saw in the theater looked very bored and most online reviews of the soundtrack are positive.)When you think Sherlock Holmes a lot of people think of an uppity British guy who's way too smart solving mysteries. That's not Sherlock Holmes. This movie captures his other side: a bad-ass martial artist who's incredibly smart and knows that and rubs it in everyone's faces.Omigosh I can't wait for the sequel to come out (12/16/11)! Now I'M the Holmes geek! :P",8,0,2,22 August 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Great sequel to a great film!
","Though fully understanding the entire concept of time travel that this movie follows is a little harder now that they jump around so much, this movie was GOOD. Or, to put it as I originally thought: beastin'.There's a lot more humor in this one than in the first. Watching this from a 2010 perspective, some of the humor in 2015 came from 'Haha they thought we'd have flying cars!' But a lot of it was irony and simply just very good writing. And good acting.A very, VERY satisfying sequel that pumps you up for the final of the three movies. I literally have it out of its case ready to pop in the computer.Michael J. Fox did an absolutely perfect job in this movie. You couldn't ask for more. I had to pause the movie several times because i couldn't hear the dialogue over my laughing. (most notably.. principal: 'You've got three seconds to get off my property with your nuts intact. One!' Marty: 'Wait, I just want to know what's going on!' principal: 'Two.' Marty: 'AHHHHH!' Lol. His face is classic.)It's probably a good idea to see the first one before this one, but you can still keep up if you haven't. If this was a cake I'd say it's delicious. And the soundtrack was better in this one, too!BTW Marty McFly is NOT a butt head. Or a chicken.",9,0,0,24 September 2010
1408," Psychologically... horrifyingly... stunning.
","I am not one to sit around watching horror films. I am one to sit around watching super- hero flicks and sci-fi's and comedies- genres I consider not even remotely close to horror. I am the type who can't even read the description of a horror film on Wikipedia without feeling slightly terrified. Quite to the contrary, I absolutely love Stephen King. And so when I stumble upon 1408 I instantly wanted to watch it, despite the unsettling feeling that I was going to be freaked out by this. After bracing myself through gory trailers, I anxiously pressed play on the computer... and I was instantly ported into the first movie I've seen in a while that honestly makes you think.1408, while it does on occasion have undead... zombies? Well, undead ghosts jump out at Mike Enslin (John Cusack), most of the fear you get doesn't derive from slash-and-tear cliché horror. I'm getting the same feelings I got from Inception. I just couldn't help but think of how closely I could relate to Mike Enslin. The emotions Cusack portrays are organic and I honestly invested myself in Mike Enslin and routed for him throughout. (And to clear things right now, I have seen all versions of the film and I'm reviewing the theatrical one, I think. (Not the original version, the other one.)) By the end of the film I was so... seriously shocked by what had unfolded that I was truly speechless. While Mike Enslin might have deserved what he got to some degree I nod my head to John Cusack- he played a believably sad ex- husband/grieving dad. Most actors simply have a generic sad face that you get bored of after 20 minutes.1408 is not your conventional horror flick. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say I feel like it's more of a mind-bender flick than anything. Challenge what you think you know and SEE THIS FILM!",8,0,1,23 August 2010
Iron Man," This is what I look for in a superhero movie!
","Iron Man... isn't the first hero I think of when asked 'Who's the coolest superhero ever?' Well, he wasn't until now.Robert Downey Jr. plays the perfect billionaire in this. (I mean, you need someone who looks good with his shirt off. Nicholas Cage was seriously considered for the part? Yuck!) Practically every time he opened his mouth he had something funny or important to say. No time wasted in this.Rob Downey, of course, wasn't the ONLY good thing about this movie. :) They picked a sinister villain (you can't have a superhero fighting lame wanna-be criminals), a hot love interest and they seriously deserve 11 stars for the writing.It's fun, it's got action, it's got romance, it's got humor and it's got super powers. If you're looking for the perfect superhero movie, skip past all those Superman films and pick this up. You don't have to call yourself a nerd or a comic book reader to watch this (though by the end I was practically out the door rushing over to the nearest comic book store)!",8,4,6,3 October 2010
Back to the Future," Two Words: SEE IT
","A movie blessed by the talent of Steven Spielberg has to be good. That's what you expect Back to the Future to be. Good. No, no, This movie is REALLY good.The whole idea of time travel is incredibly confusing, and for the most part they try to explain all the technical stuff that's going on as the movie progresses. It's really easy to screw up sci-fi movies and they easily dodged failure.The plot was engaging. When it was theatrically released in 1985 I'm sure it was funny. It. Still. Is. While the humor might be laughing at how retro everything sounds at times, you still get a good laugh in more than once.AND it has Michael J. Fox! Epic. Just epic. He's got the best perplexed face I've ever seen. And he makes the whole 'time-traveling into 1955 business and almost splitting up my parents' business believable.A lot of funny moments. Clever, well-written and very, very enjoyable. 10 stars (I'd give 11 but you can only give 10!)",8,0,0,24 September 2010
