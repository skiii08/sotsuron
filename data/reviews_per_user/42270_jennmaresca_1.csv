The Lobster," Not my cup of tea...
","I give this movie a 'I'd watch it for free if I was super bored' out of 10. (3/10) First off, this was definitely not a movie I would watch again. Just to clarify. I only watched it because someone I care about loves it and I wanted to like it for his sake, but I just couldn't.  If I could overlook the plot and the way I felt about it, I might say its a good movie. Costumes and set design is nice to look at and all, but I couldn't get over how uncomfortable this entire movie made me. The concept is interesting... single people have a certain amount of time to find a suitable partner with whom they have something in common, or else they get turned into an animal of their choosing. I just didn't like the way the story played out or the style of acting. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz (and every other actor within) play characters who have zero social skills and I just didnt vibe with it, if I'm being honest. It's not a bad movie. But it is most certainly not my cup of tea.",3,7,9,22 June 2018
