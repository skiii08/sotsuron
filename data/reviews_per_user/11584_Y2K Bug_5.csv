E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This one's a keeper!!!!!
","I saw this movie countless times when I was younger, and even now I still remember about three quarters of it. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is special. It stays with you for a long time. It's gotta be the best Spielberg movie ever!",Null,0,0,20 February 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Guys, if you are going to do Shakespeare, do it RIGHT!
","Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! This has got to be one of the worst versions of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I saw this version and thought it was okay. Then I read the play and at the same time saw the old version, and I have to say, this version is very sketchy, most soliloquies and speeches are missing and they have removed a lot from the play. The acting was good though, but overall this film is sketchy and overrated.",Null,1,2,13 April 1999
The Princess Bride," Great movie
","I like this movie because it appeals to all ages. And another unfortunately rare feature NO SWEARING!!!! Which means we all can watch it without having to feel uncomfortable with our younger cousins, siblings watching it. This goes to show you that you can still make a good movie without having all the swearing!",10,1,2,22 April 1999
A Bug's Life," The goofs were funnier than the movie itself!
","It was cute, but it wasn't the best, by far. I found it really drawn out, long and kind of dull. When you think that the goofs at the end were funnier than the actual movie, it makes you think. This movie would have been better if it had a better dialogue, for one thing, and more conflict.",5,1,5,22 April 1999
There's Something About Mary," Worst Comedy EVER!!!!
",This movie stinks! Didn't like it at all! One word 'BORING!!!' It was gross!! Sick humor. Please do not waste time and money on this piece of turkey! RATED: TURKEY!!!!!,Null,0,0,24 August 1999
