Black Swan," Entangling
","Originally watched part of it on a really long flight, when I probably didn't felt much like my normal self. Had to cut it off in between, since a kid was sitting just next to me. Remembered it a couple of times afterward during my routine life, so I finally gave in and watched the whole movie. Long story short, I think there is something in it that attracts people(or at least me).The movie depicts very human, palpable emotions that everyone can feel with great details. The elements and references are not too complex to the point of making you want to quit watching it, and are well appreciated and digested. This is not some movie one would feel ambivalent after watching it. I highly recommend it for a change of mood.",8,0,3,14 January 2017
