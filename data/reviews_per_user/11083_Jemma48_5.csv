The Blair Witch Project," warning: possible spoiler!!!!!!!!!!
","ok, first of all, i thought this film was quite scary, although it has to be said, it is annoying when they switch off the camera light so u can't see anything! it looks really real, and i thought that it was. but then at the end it tells you who wrote it and directed etc. so it cant be real right? I hate it when josh goes missing, partly cause i think he's kinda cute and partly cos it makes them weaker as a group. I think that he would have been better off 'staying under the tree with the vine'. i also think that mike kicked the map into the creek cause he was posessed. i hate it when they walk all day and end up back at the same place. and is it just me, or is heather way too much of a control freak, and loves the sound of her own voice? all in all, this movie was great, so much so that i have seen it several times (although not alone, and definitley not with the lights off!)",Null,0,1,18 December 2003
Final Destination 2," almost as good as the first
","i liked this movie cos it was kinda funny, but nothing could beat the first final destination. im glad they made second one, and i hope they make a third. it was nice to see that they had included somebody from the last one, so we know that they didnt all die, although i would have liked it if Alex could have lived for longer. as ever, there are gory deaths, and plenty of parts to send shivers down your spine. it was a good follow up, and im glad to say that it was worth the cost of buying it. definitely a must-see if you've seen the first.",Null,0,1,10 January 2004
American Pie," hilarious!
","this movie is an extraordinary piece of comic genius! you start watching this movie, having seen the trailers and read the summary on the back of what its about, and you think 'yep......i have a good idea of the kind of movie this is going to be'. then you watch it and your blown away by the sexual references that this movie gets away with, and you cant stop laughing cos never in your wildest dreams could u sit and watch this extremely rude film with your grandparents. there are points in this movie when you sit and cringe cos of what is happening to the on-screen characters. this movie is unimaginable, and is so unrealistic, but who cares when its so amazingly funny?!",Null,0,1,9 January 2004
Final Destination," a fantastic movie! possible spoilers!
","i loved this movie after i saw it for the first time. it is fantastic, and all of the cast did a brilliant job. i had never heard of devon sawa before i saw this, and didnt know that he was actually the real casper at the end of casper. anyway, he is absolutely gorgeous! i think ali larter does a good job of playing clear rivers, and they work well together on screen. i hate the part when tod dies cos he is so innocent and totally doesnt deserve to die! he seems to be a sandwich short of a picnic if u catch my drift and he has to struggle for ages before he dies. there are kinder ways to kill people off, but i guess the movie wouldnt have been half as good if the characters hadnt come to a sticky end one by one. your thinking all the time, who's it gonna be next? and when you see the signs, you might b like me and walk around for a few days after wondering if little things that happen are 'signs' of your death! this movie totally makes you paranoid!",Null,0,2,10 January 2004
A Walk to Remember," isnt this the most beautiful movie ever made?
","i thought this movie was amazing. i have to say i didnt go to see it at the cinema, but i bought the video when i felt like watching a new film. i cry every time i watch it......and shane west is the sexiest guy on earth! I think that this movie is total proof that you can make a good movie that doesnt include too much bad language and absolutely no sex! anybody who criticises this movie is obviously blind (just look at the lead actor/actress), deaf (just listen to the soundtrack) or stone cold heartless. I have to say that i went out and paid loads for the soundtrack after i watched the movie. it is the greatest movie ever made. and yes, i am now a huge switchfoot fan!!!!!",Null,1,1,18 December 2003
