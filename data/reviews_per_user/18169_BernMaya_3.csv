United 93," Raw, honest and superbly presented! A must see!
","The story of flight 93 is an inspiring and heart wrenching story that needed to be told. All those of us who witnessed the events of 9/11 unfold on this fateful September morning remember clearly what we were doing and where we were. I was personally on my way to work when I heard that AA 11 hit Tower 1. 90 minutes later, I watched the Pentagon on fire from my office window. From that moment, my view of the world had changed for ever. I was quite relieved to see that this movie did not try to politicize the issue and just narrated the events faithfully, without any agenda. The footage was raw and poignant. Greengrass did not try to tone down the barbarism of the highjackers who cheered when they learned that 'their brothers had hit their targets'. We also get a glimpse of the terror that the passengers had to live through and overcome. The movie gives due credit to Thom Burnett's composure, heroism and leadership. A bunch of every day Americans who have been put together on this doomed flight and decided they would not go down without a fight. The movie was very well done, with very little background music and some real footage of the events. I was so shaken when it ended that I sat throughout the end credits, unable to move. I was very surprised to see a number of people from NORAAD and the FAA play themselves. How more realistic can it get? The bottom line is that this is a great movie and tribute to the first front line casualties of the war on terror and must be seen with the respect these heroes deserve.",10,6,13,1 May 2006
The Bourne Identity," Another great novel, butchered by Hollywood. When will they get it right?
","Where do I begin???? Did Mr Ludlum loose his mind before he passed away? How could he allow Hollywood to destroy the beauty of his finest novel, my favorite spy novel of all time? 'Based on a novel by Robert Ludlum' is an understatement. There is nothing from the novel except the name of the main character Jason Bourne -who is not even the true identity of the main character, but his CIA cover - and the fact that he had amnesia and had a microchip planted in his hip, that's it. Oh, no wait, he also worked for a CIA cell called Treadstone 71. Where is the true assassin, Carlos the Jackal, the reason why Treadstone created the Bourne identity altogether? The script writers obviously have a very naive and distorted understanding of how the CIA works. My dad was a CIA officer and I can assure you that they do not go around killing people all over the world, innocent as well as guilty, just because someone at headquarters ordered them to do that. They also don't sentence one of their field officers to death simply because they lost contact with him. In the novel, David Webb was a washed out CIA officer who underwent plastic surgery to take over the identity of well known assassin called Jason Bourne. He spoke many languages, European and oriental, and was sent to draw out Carlos from his hideout. The beauty of the story is his relationship with the Canadian economist Marie St-Jacques and his quest to find out who he was. In the movie, Jason Bourne had to run away from other CIA assassins, while in the novel, it was Carlos and his men who were after him. the CIA was trying to figure out what happened to him, not kill him. And whose idea was it to cast Matt Damon in the lead role? Jason Bourne is supposed to be in his 40s and not a young looking kid. In the Bourne Supermacy, he actually is a college professor and Marie gets kidnapped (I'm sure the Hollywood version is completely different, have not seen it yet). When Hollywood turned Mission Impossible into a movie, they had the entire team killed, turned the team leader into a traitor, and left Ethan Hunt to be the solo hero. Now they butchered the Bourne identity altogether. Please read the story, or at least watch the TV movie with Richard Chamberlain. It is more faithful to the novel. What a disappointment this was. If a story is good enough to be a bestseller, why change it? Oh and the scene where Matt Damon rides a corpse down 7 floors and then walk away without a scratch... I mean come on. Are you kidding me?",1,5,14,29 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Best movie adaptation of a Potter book
","In my opinion, this is the best movie adaptation of the Potter books. I enjoyed seeing the visuals that I could only picture in my head while reading the book. The battle at the department of mysteries was choreographed really well and I really enjoyed seeing the DA in training as well as the old picture of the members of the Order. The portrayal of the dementors attack at the beginning of the story was so much darker than I imagined. I'm so glad we had a brief glimpse of Kreature. I just wished Jim Dale did the voice over. He is amazing in the audiobook. I never expected the movie to be able to retain all the details in the book, but I wish we had more of the Weasly twin pranks and were able to see more details about James Potter's torment of Snape. The movie also failed to explain the reason why Harry was lured into the department of mysteries ***warning spoilers*** as only the subject of a prophecy can retrieve the record. Noteworthy was Daniel Radcliff's acting. He really matured as an actor in this movie. The actress playing Luna was outstanding, she really brought her to life, with so much softness and so much humanity. Gary Oldman did a real moving portrayal of Sirius Black and dominated every scene he was in. This actor has an amazing ability to express so many emotions without saying a word. When he got hit with the Ava Kedavra curse, I made a loud gasp, even though I knew it was coming. The look on his face was a mixture of surprise, sadness, fear and love for Harry. He is just an outstanding actor. Helena Bonham Carter was born to play Bellatrix Lestrange with her evil laughter and her piercing eyes. Snape appeared much nicer than he is portrayed in the book and we do not see Lilly Evans defending him like in the book. Finally, the lady who played Umbridge was phenomenal. I know she got an Oscar for Vera Drake, but she certainly deserves one for this movie. She delivered an unbelievable performance as the sadistic, manipulative and cunning bureaucrat that sucks the joy out of life. We also never learn that she sent the dementors against Harry in the summer. My only disappointment is that the fountain statues did not come to life like in the book.I cannot wait for book 6 to be made into a movie. I wonder who will play Slughorn. Can't wait.",10,0,3,21 July 2007
