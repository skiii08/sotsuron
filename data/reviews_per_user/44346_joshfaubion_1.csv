Iron Man 3," This movie is a piece of garbage
","This movie was literally the most over blown piece of crap one could ever attempt to watch. Like seriously if any of you thought there was going to be a cool movie because mandarin, iron man's arch nemesis was in it, ehhh, wrong. He isn't actually in it in the end, in the movie it is simply an actor playing the mandarin, i know this sounds like a joke, but its not. I don't consider this a spoiler because the movie is straight restarted. I mean its a blatant attempt to poke fun at corporate corruption but seriously we wanted to see a cool superhero movie with a climactic battle and character build up. It is a joke that this movie got a 7.7. Seriously how is this possible? If you thought 2 was bad it looks like an Oscar winning film compared to this one. I SERIOUSLY Don't KNOW HOW THIS HAS A 7.7 or how it was a critical success. THIS FILM IS A JOKE",1,12,25,14 May 2013
