Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing for the wrong reasons
","This is a film I'll remember. Disturbing and brutal - essential piece of work on a serious subject; the human addictions.I wish the actors and music were kept, but this was made in a different way. With less superficial advice and characters I'd connect with. Characters compatible with the real world. With no exaggerations and taking into account that various drugs, are used by various people, at various times in their lives, for a variety of reasons. It's really a complicated subject, people who do drugs end up in jail, people who do drugs become murderers, people who do drugs die from depression, people who do drugs become artists or prime ministers and sometimes they live happily until they die.''Requiem for a Dream'' is a film that will stay in your mind for a long time after you first see it, it's solid and well-executed, but it is going to be shallow on the very topic that it's trying to be instructive; the topic of addictions. People-failures controlling the viewer's depression is the main idea. There's much more about the dangers of drugs; the diversity of people guarantees that our life is not monotonous - and drug users are much more than a couch potato with an eye that glows.My vote is 5.",5,2,3,16 October 2009
