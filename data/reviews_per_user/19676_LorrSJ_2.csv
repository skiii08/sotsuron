The Ring," does the job better than others
","i love horror/supernatural movies, rather then slasher types, because of the thoughts that it implants into your head. i saw the exorcist when i was 15 and it wasnt the movie that frightened me, but the thought that the devil could take over my body. i know it was stupid, but the movie did it to me.it is the same for the ring. the movie itself was no scarier then the sixth sense, but the thought of footage that kills you played on my mind. the dvd i watched had the entire 'real footage', and after the movie i began to watch it. the movie was so effective, that as i watched, i subconsciously looked away for a few moments at a time so i didnt watch the entire footage. about half way through i was forced to eject the dvd (on command from the brother's friend) since the footage could not be stopped. however, i will end up watching the entire footage later (i hope).the movie itself was not as scary as i thought it would be, but resembled the sixth sense quite a bit. but i recommend watching the 'real footage' alone in the dark after having watched the movie. it will give you the biggest scare of your life. another thing would be to watch it with mates, and create myths about the 'real footage' actually killing people or the rumour that the japanese version of the movie had put people into physciatric hospitals.to conclude, the thought of the ring itself is scarier than the actual movie.",8,1,1,24 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," I wish i was a mutant!
","I had only seen the original X-Men movie (2000) a couple of days before the opening of X-men 2 (2003) and found it very enjoyable, so i watched it two more times in as many days. However, compared to the sequel the original seemed quite dull and boring! I could not believe my eyes as i sat through the most exciting movie i have ever witnessed. And to my surprise it is a lot darker then the original.Not only does Bryan Singer know how to create a movie as exciting as X-men 2, but he (with help) came up with the best assasination attempt and prison break ever (these aren't spoilers, they're also included in most plot summaries and trailers). As i watched, i totally disregarded the actors performances, not because they were bad (they were the opposite), but because it didnt seem like they were trying to act out their character, rather it seemed like they were the characters. Hugh Jackman (go the Aussies) is perfect as Wolverine, and its like Professor X was modelled from Patrick Stewart. Anna Paquin (Rogue) looked great, and every other actor took their parts seriously, which gave the movie an edge (rather making the X-men look silly and corny). Look out for a teenage Colossus, Remy Le Beau's (Gambit) name on a computer screen, and a scientist on TV, Henry McCoy (AKA the Beast). The movie may not be entirely faithful to the comics, but the changes give it much more realism.Of course, X-men 2 isnt the last of the films, and i cant wait to find out more about the next movies. Not only will i see it again at the movies, but i'll be dying to get my hands on a proper DVD version.If you want to see a movie full of action, suspense, amazing fight sequences (i consider them better then any from the matrix), a great story, perfect performances, and surprises (a bit of romance as well), then i would heavily recommend seeing X-men 2, and not just the once.",10,0,0,1 May 2003
