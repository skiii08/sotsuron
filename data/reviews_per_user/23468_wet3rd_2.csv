United 93," sad but true
","considering this type of event was not scripted within the FAA or the military , id say they all did an outstanding job. This movie best exemplifies the American spirit.Its the stuff we are made of. The main reason we are this country is what it is in the world. All I know of these events were correctly portrayed. Had the hijackers not crashed the plane, the two f16s that were less than 10 minutes away would have surely brought it down. So the passengers saved an agonizing decision that surely would have been made. I did not feel this movie exploited the event in any way. Being in the industry, all was realistic in its portrayal. Well worth seeing.",7,2,8,29 April 2006
Driven," Expecting more
",I expected much more from this movie. The special effects werent bad but the technical end was all hollywood. The essence of open wheel racing was rarely captured. The start of each race was almost a nonevent showing only a distant figure waving a green flag. So much more could have been achieved. Grand Prix remains the king.,5,0,0,27 April 2001
