Iron Man 3," Red is the new Black
","Oh man... this is so good in an unfamiliar way. It has rekindled the spark of a teenager trapped in the shell of a cynical adult movie goer.In a race that began in 2008 to be crowned Hollywood's Coolest and Most Awesome Superhero Movie, the score is now 3-1 with Iron Man on a two- point lead. The screenplay, co-written between Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) and Drew Pearce is cleverly penned and packs the right punch for an action movie. By drumming up the significance of Tony Stark's development from previous films (The Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2) without losing grip of dramatic unity as a whole; Shane Black (also the film's director) conceptualized a heroically simple, winning formula.Another satisfying aspect of Iron Man 3 (and this converts to audience payoff at the end of 130 minutes), is the sweet simple fact that narrative does not detain viewers with unnecessary exposition and scenes. The big bad guys waste no time playing mind-games for the sake of delaying a final showdown, thus one-upping other blockbusters where it counts. Ergo, no shortchanging and an effortlessly fluid plot.Things kick off with a flashback to 1999 during pre-Iron Man days, establishing Tony Stark's first meeting with future adversary — a then crippled scientist named Aldrich Killian. Desperate for resources from Stark Industries to develop experimental virus 'Extremis' (yet turned away so unceremoniously), sets off rising malevolence from Killian (played by the unforgettable Guy Pearce, even more loathsome here than when he was hateful Charlie Rakes in Lawless). There's also brazen, immediate threat from a grim terrorist leader (Ben Kingsley's prowess and versatility in full glory here as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery) — bent on blowing up America at whatever cost necessary. And for what it's worth, I like the spin on Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) damsel-in-distress anticipated — compelling touch to an otherwise archetypal character.To further inject urgency in the conflict, Tony Stark wrestles with the aftermath of New York (from The Avengers) and taunts The Mandarin on national TV, further exacerbating his wrath. A strike against Stark's mansion hatches a loosely comedic, coming-of-age with 10 year old Harley — it is here that leading man Robert Downey Jr. ingratiates himself as one of the best personality actors in Hollywood — incensed with moral rage at the right moments, oozing unsentimental smooth in others.I had fun spotting flashes of nostalgia in favorite superhero moments (Spiderman, Superman, Batman and even Transformers) throughout the show as well, and still can't believe they destroyed a fine looking limited edition Dora the Explorer digital watch. Nor of the fact that a highly entertaining movie just ended. What a generous, high-octane hell of a ride.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",10,26,53,3 May 2013
World War Z," The EOW genre is constantly evolving — there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope
","tl;dr - Set aside expectations related to the zombie genre and enjoy World War Z as a disaster popcorn flick.**********Max Brook's muscular, world weary 'oral history of the zombie war', a thinly veiled geo-political mouthpiece on the world at large seen through the eyes of an agent working for the UN, has taken shape and form through a movie of the same name — World War Z. But make no mistake about both being made from the same mold.Rather than pander to the novel's ambitious fictional output of global perspectives (survivors from virtually every continent on Earth were interviewed by the novel's narrator) — this summer flick directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland, Stranger than Fiction) is sensibly scaled down on politicking and military machismo. With a tried and tested sci-fi disaster formula, the result works fairly well on its own terms. Vastly different from Brook's scathing, testosterone driven bestseller and the archetypal zombie gore fest; this latest End-of-World extravaganza is less tired and less verbose. By virtue of that, translates to a much more engaging experience.********** Brief Synopsis: After decades of living in risky, high-stakes existence as a UN investigator; Gerry Lane (Pitt) is now comfortably retired to a cozy, domestic life in Philadelphia with loving wife, Karen (Mireille Enos) and two young daughters. Problem is that a mysterious virus has spiraled out of control and gone global, resulting in a win-win proposition from former colleague Thierry -- the state guarantees refuge and protection for Gerry's family in exchange for his unrivaled field expertise. Thus we are immediately whisked to the main exposition -- Gerry, accompanied by the Navy SEAL and a virologist (developing the vaccine) traverses international borders in search of patient zero -- the journey spans South Korea and Israel, to the WHO in Wales and eventually Canada. Trivia: The novel places origin of the zombie outbreak in Dachang, Hebei. Incidentally, the film hypothesizes with narratives about the spread of SARS as a deadly epidemic. It can therefore be understood, that the virus in WWZ is implied to have begun in Northern China.**********It is no controversy that World War Z is plagued with production troubles and the screenplay has undergone a few re-writes, but manifestations of this in film authorship isn't grave or jarring. To the contrary; Forster's version has softened Brook's high-minded hyperbole in exchange for a modest, grounded and back-to-basics approach — this makes for undeniable commercial appeal.Visually, after a cumbersome and erratically edited zombie rampage sequence in the first act, DP Ben Seresin (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and special effects rebound with impressive large scale photography. The outbreak of zombie hordes in Jerusalem's disaster sequence deserve mention — it is here that the narrative's kinesthetic urgency receives a healthy dose of adrenaline. Action aficionados will be pleased. Seresin's chaotic apocalypse overrun by waves of running undeads is also given counterweight by a quiet, noble dimension found in Gerry's measured and cool-in-crisis stoicity. Brad Pitt's iconic persona as a humanitarian in real life, may very well have influenced his portrayal of Gerry, infusing the kind of personality and screen image that transforms naturally in a Hollywood film.But the cleverest stroke in characterization, is that of Israeli soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz). A sound approach in keeping characters fresh and creative is that material be produced with caveats in mind. Flat, boilerplate stereotypes of women being one example of many. For this reason, I was surprised to discover that much of the film's feistier, more relevant survivalist moments originate from her flair for timing and intuition.All being said, preconceived notions about what zombie films should and ought to be have divided zombie lovers into two main groups. Fans of Romero's classics may prefer depictions of slow-moving zombies (Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead), while others embrace the idea of super sprinters (28 Days Later, 2004 Dawn of the Dead). The good news is that this debate, when filtered through the lens of a global disaster flick, becomes irrelevant (or less so). I guess my point is the EOW genre is constantly evolving, there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope. The only real complaint is an excessively dramatized, prolonged exchange between an infected doctor and Gerry in the film's final act. You get less awkward, more authentic moments between Rick Grimes and the bicycle zombie girl back in Atlanta. But that's another apocalypse.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",9,100,200,21 June 2013
The Impossible," Emotionally stirring drama. Entertaining!
","The Impossible delivers what it promises; and movie goers can expect an intense, disaster film set against 2004′s Indian Ocean tsunami.This latest film by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) is based on a real family and their harrowing experience while holidaying in Thailand. When violence struck the seaside region of Khao Lak on boxing day, all five individuals were separated and left to fend for themselves.Bayona spends half an hour introducing British family; the Bennetts, establishing relationship dynamics that effectively presage each member's survival instincts. Henry and Maria (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) are loving and middle-aged parents to privileged kids: eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) is 12 and outlier of the group; second child Tom is 9½, thoughtful and sensitive with a soft spot for astronomy; youngest son Simon is 5, young and adorable apple of the eye.It's just another morning by the pool when cataclysmic destruction arrives and the first wall of wave smashes against the resort. Palm trees and structures collapse, tourists and locals are washed away. In one of the most riveting sequences of this film, we witness the violent assault Maria endures when submerged underwater--she is physically mutilated, crushed, knocked, twirled, punched, slashed by miles of debris before spotting Lucas. The second act begins with a frantic and painful race against time to safety before another wave hits.Pervasive atmosphere of this film is dank and risky, but the fact that Maria and Lucas are still alive shrouds unspeakable hope that their loved ones will live. In classic passion and ferocity so often evoked by Spanish cinema; we worry for these characters and despair at the brutal invasion of fragile life. With Maria teetering on the edge of fatal injury and the fates of Henry, Tom, Simon still unknown; Bayona successfully creates emotionally stirring drama. Brilliant performances by Watts and Holland will also bring tears to the soft-hearted.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",8,1,2,28 January 2013
Life of Pi," No sex scenes, only mesmerizing visual poetry...
","First of all; Life of Pi has very little appeal for movie goers unfamiliar with Yann Martel's novel. They will have to glean from whatever information is available before deciding whether to watch it in the cinema or buy on DVD.Second; movie poster is a 'big heads in the sky over tiny people on the sea' type, and it doesn't stand out among the ones with catchier designs.Third; it casts two virtual unknowns--fierce looking Bengal feline and plain looking Indian boy (newcomer, Suraj Sharma). Which means there will be no attractive Hollywood celebs to ogle at and no sex scenes to anticipate.Fourth; the movie tagline is cliché--'The Journey of a Lifetime.' It is so generic that it can easily apply to any movie off the top of my head: Castaway, Chronicles of Narnia, Titanic, Alexander, PathfinderLastly; the movie poster underplays two things that will most certainly sell the film, Ang Lee and 3D.**************************** But watch it anyway because Life of Pi is unlike any film Ang Lee (Taking Woodstock, Brokeback Mountain) has ever made, yet it is the most profoundly moving piece of cinema in his twenty years as a filmmaker. From the very beginning; lush evergreen and a mellow giraffe fade in before enchanting melody drifts across the airwaves--it instantly captivates, right until the very last frame. I would have liked to describe Life of Pi as a genteel; romantic cousin of Slumdog Millionaire but that would be off base. Both exude different energies. One is extroverted and dynamic, while the other is intuitive and intensely dramatic.Adapted from Yann Martel's 2001 novel, this film is a 3D adventure fantasy drama based on adapted screenplay by David Magee (Finding Neverland). In broad terms, it tells the story of a 16 year old boy named (after a swimming pool in Paris) Piscine Molitor 'Pi' Patel; and his journey as a shipwreck survivor, adrift on Marianas Trench--deepest part of the world's ocean.Story is told from one narrative viewpoint—an older, middle aged Piscine in a flashback as he recounts his 227 days ordeal stranded on the Pacific Ocean.He lives with his parents (they run a private zoo) and elder brother, Ravi. After an unforeseen land dispute, the family boards a Japanese ship in an attempt to sell their zoo animals around the world before settling as migrants in Canada. But a storm hits and passes; with his family gone, Pi finds himself stranded with a lifeboat and some animals. Hours turn into days; as he contemplates the difficult situation, thematic focus of this film unfolds. Separation, survival, self- discovery, the will to live, hunger and thirst, faith and belief all culminate in one of the most impeccably crafted bildungsroman I have ever seen.No one in recent years has improvised upon French Impressionism so spectacularly as cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Tron: Legacy, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) did in this film. We see a cloud filled sky blazing with azure before young, curious Pi plunges into the pool but imageries are never indulged for its own sake. Frame after frame; photography continues to fascinate by embodying important symbolic ideas and emotions of the story. Visual poetry in this film is mesmerizing, and I'll be damned if Miranda fails to bag an Oscar for it.There is a scene in the final act that brought me to snot dribbling tears. When Richard Parker stopped in his tracks at the edge of the jungle, right before he enters it. The fact that he has no human characteristics makes it poignant; the emotional impact came very suddenly, I wasn't at all prepared for it. cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",10,2,5,23 January 2013
Oblivion," Ugh... generic big studio property. Bit of a downer — average at best and yawn worthy at times
","Joseph Kosinski's follow-up to his 2010 film Tron: Legacy (which I really enjoyed); is a stunning and eargasmic feast for those who like expensive effects. For everybody else, overall treatment of this science fiction mystery is dull and uninspiring.I'll do without PC geek speak and use layman language.The time is 2077 and decades earlier, an attack by aliens known as 'Scavengers' rendered our planet uninhabitable. So human beings relocate to a space station in Titan, and send machines back here to extract whatever natural resources are left. The plot in Oblivion involves Jack (not Reacher), an engineer stationed here to repair and maintain robots that patrol the bosoms of Mother Earth. Now, the main objective of these robots (aka 'Drones') is terminate any leftover 'Scavs' that may threaten the human outfit. Paired with icy communications officer and girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), Jack also provides tech support to the extraction machines. They have two more weeks before the mission completes, but massive explosions happen one day and Jack uncovers heinous truth.At the risk of spoiling everything, the events that follow are devastatingly predictable and a paste-up of elements from the following genre titles:1) Total Recall — memory wipe and restoration of a romantic past with flashes of cheesy nostalgia in NYC with female astronaut Julia (Olga Kurylenko)2) I, Robot — conspiracies leading up to a showdown with omnipotent A.I. villain, Sally (Melissa Leo)3) The Matrix — no prize for guessing who's the chosen one after Jack's encounter with guerrilla leader of the human resistance, Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman)Now for the tangible: territorial space and atmosphere created by DP Claudio Miranda, is reminiscent of the vastness seen in Prometheus — a disappointment considering his innovative photography n in earlier project, Life of Pi. Character and set designs also evoke traces of kinetics found in 2001 Space Odyssey and Wall-E. Toss airborne battles and cloning tragedies in the mix; essentially, Oblivion is a generic big studio property screaming sentiments about drone wars and global warming.It has the epic looks and formalist style of something very impressive. But archetypal narrative and limited range in acting (more often seen than felt) wrecked an otherwise bona fide of a blockbuster I was led into expecting. Bit of a downer — average at best and yawn worthy at times, though not intolerable.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",4,19,38,24 April 2013
Man of Steel," Time to call it a day...
","At the end of Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, we agreed that 2013′s Superman is a real sight for sore eyes. But I fell out of love with the caped crusader many years and caricatures ago... as handsome and smoldering hot as the leading man in Henry Cavill could be, I wasn't invested in the outcome of Clark Kent's fate as much as I'd wanted to originally.Maybe these things are no different from passionate affairs that burn and fizzle out all in the thick of a night — one realizes what a massive waste of time it'd been only after waking up the next morning with gathering clarity.The magic stardust that co-writers Christopher Nolan (also the film's producer) and David S. Goyer sprinkled around The Dark Knight has disappeared. At a running time of 144 minutes with less than 20 lines of dialog given to its key protagonist, this film might as well be titled 'Friends of the Man of Steel'. When supporting characters are constantly forcing the narrative with long, loud and generic speeches; perhaps there is a grave problem with the focus and design of this story.Man of Steel is also an unimaginative reboot of the Superman franchise. The first act is devoted entirely to a lengthy do-over that begins with dad Jor El (Russell Crowe) and mom Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), deliberating their newborn's fate on planet Krypton. Here, cinematographer Amir Mokri (Transformers: Dark of the Moon) is limited to the same weary CGI effects and steel-silver-black palettes seen in techy Hollywood films. Ditto for composer Hans Zimmer's deafening crash-bang cues each time something very bad is about to happen on screen.Even the awestruck respect I had for Michael Shannon's acting chops as a corrupt officer of the LAPD in Premium Rush, gradually faded away as General Zod's gormless, permanent frown kept spacing off and staring into the depths of some grand, epic unknown — it must have been just as tiring for him.Why did I fork out money to watch a run-of-the mill movie I'd seen several times before? Why would anyone make the same mistake repeatedly and still believe things would finally change the next time round? Perhaps wild idealizations that accompany the search for what was once perfection are responsible for my predicament the morning after.There is little left to remind me of why the mention of Christopher Nolan's creative input sparked assurance in quality mainstream films. Flashes of grit and style so keenly felt in 2004′s Dawn of the Dead are missing as well. After the awful Sucker Punch, tiresome Dark Knight Rises and now, Man of Steel... the mature, sensible side of me hopes to never sit through another Nolan-Snyder collaboration again. You have to be 12 to enjoy watching this.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",1,7,17,16 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Block out the Oscar hype and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you.
","As Sigmund Freud said, 'One is very crazy when in love.' Silver Linings Playbook delivers a little less than what its title suggests, but as a romantic comedy, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Adapted from Matthew Quick's novel, this film by David O. Russell (The Fighter, I ♥ Huckabees) shines as a date movie.Bradley Cooper leads with familiar, sun-kissed energy that made him the stereotypical guy-next-door in chick flicks (The Hangover I & II, Valentines Day) and Jennifer Lawrence flexes elegant moves in a genre new to her filmography (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) but in Silver Linings Playbook, the real show-stopper turns out to be Papa DeNiro.Pat Junior (Cooper) is bipolar and after eight months in a treatment facility, leaves to recover at his folks. Despite the bad run with his estranged wife (that landed him there in the first place), Pat still loves her and believes that conquering his psychological demons will win her back. Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow nursing old wounds and idiosyncrasies of her own. Sparks fly when both meet at a party thrown by Pat's BFF (played with finely tuned sensitivity by the underrated John Ortiz).This is not an odd romantic pairing; but the emotional vicissitudes demanded of Pat's role seem to fall short in its rough-hewn delivery and thus, weakening mental health themes in the finished film. Fortunately, the silver lining lies in a strong lineup of supporting cast and Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) shines as an un-diagnosed OCD with eccentric (but believably instinctive) ground rules about 'good and bad jujus'.Bulk of the film's humor and depth (premised on psychological anxiety) comes from DeNiro and it comes as a delightful surprise. I would love to see a sequel or TV-series patterned after his breakout performance in this film--spin-off of sorts. As Pat's father, the idea that some of his neuroses may have imprinted on Pat adds a natural layer to the subplot-- father and son dynamics.At the end of Silver Linings Playbook, I left the cinema believing it was written with a heartfelt message nestled in its narrative. But the output fell short, thus inviting criticisms about exaggerating stereotypes for the sake of a few laughs. The mental health industry has also responded with comments about inaccurate portrayals of bipolar behavior.But like I said; for date movie material, it dazzles as cookie-cutter romcom (with an edge).Block out the Oscar hype (nominated in eight categories) and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you. This feel good comedy is an entertaining peal of laughs and it stands on its own merits.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",7,3,6,21 January 2013
To Rome With Love," Woody's dramatic concerns about the allegorical enemy strikes again...
","Back in 2011; a screenwriter named Gil Pander traveled back in time to the roaring 1920s of Paris, and mingled with literary greats in nostalgic fantasy Midnight In Paris. Last year, an entourage of whimsical characters plucked from the same vivid imagination make their way to Rome. And therein lies the structural spine of Woody Allen's latest film, To Rome With Love.Four stories unfold simultaneously in this romantic comedy: a mortician discovers his vocal talent in the shower, a young architect is tempted by his SO's salacious best friend, a pair of newlywed's find themselves entangled in sexual exploits, an office clerk awakens to find himself catapulted to overnight fame.In one particular vignette; American girl next door Hayley spends her summer holiday in Rome and falls in love with lawyer, Michelangelo, in a typical tourist-meets-local encounter. The couple's spur of the moment decision to wed brings forth the arrival of Hayley's retired parents, Jerry and Phyllis--a cynical opera director and his incisive psychiatrist wife.During a get-together hosted by the Italians; Jerry discovers that Michelangelo's father Giancarlo possesses a soprano voice fit to sing Pagliacci in the Vienna Opera House. Plausibly driven by resentment towards retirement--Jerry promptly takes it upon himself to unveil this extraordinary find to the rest of the musical world.At one point; after Giancarlo's live performance involving stage lighting and a portable shower box, Jerry declares that he is one to 'think outside the box'. To which Phyllis tiredly laments (in Allen's archetypal neurotic fashion) 'You equate retirement with death. Giancarlo is an undertaker. He puts people in boxes and you want to think outside the box.'*cue snort*Classical plot structures often take the form of a journey, an escape or a search. With regards to this virtuoso of expressive cinema; Woody Allen's Jerry is fleeing from an invisible, allegorical enemy. Subject matters of doomed love, sex and death have always been dominant themes in Allen's works; provoking the kind of painfully self-aware and deadpan humor unique to his stylistic neurosis. To Rome With Love is no different from those pieces. And audiences familiar with the menagerie of characters as real as Allen's dramatic concerns will delight in this film. It has been many years since Woody Allen graced the silver screen--that our favorite skeptic exits hiatus in his forty-fourth feature is a rare event to be relished by fans.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",8,0,1,17 January 2013
Django Unchained," Quentin Tarantino waxes lyrical and morbid humor in this superb revenge flick
","Django Unchained is written and directed by a veteran of exploitation films whose debut feature 'Reservoir Dogs' depicted violent scenes punctuated with countless expletives--a politically incorrect style that recurs throughout his career. This consistency in pattern brings to mind the implicit criticisms and allegations recently brought upon him during a heated exchange with a Channel 4 news journalist. Two decades in and Quentin Tarantino's ethics as a film maker--it appeared--are suddenly called into question simply because the interviewer saw fit to venture (unannounced) into philosophical-social psychological territory.Violence in films (it seemed) is now synonymously associated with gun violence in meat space. By refusing to answer loaded questions grounded in knee-jerk assumptions, Tarantino was thus rendered unprofessional and perhaps even tacitly guilty. In my opinion, the accusative tone so implicit in the method of interview was intellectually dishonest and sensationalistic. But I digress, so back to reviewing this film. Inspired by Sergio Corbucci's 'Django' and Richard Fleischer's 'Mandingo', Django Unchained is a highly entertaining fusion of western and exploitation genres depicting main protagonist Django's (Jamie Foxx) transition, from enslaved helpless negro, to a shrewd and sharp shooting hero.This film is a classic example of metaphorical power put to brilliant, dramatic use. From the opening; we are shown the rough and massive terrain Django has to surmount in his journey to rescue Broomhilda (deliberately misspelled from mythological maiden 'Brunhilda' for comic effect)--his wife sold into slavery at Candyland. The villain standing in his way is a ruthless and sadistic man; Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), owner of the slave plantation where Hilda is held captive. Now that Django's escaped the brutal fate of being a slave, he will abide by the moral code of reciprocity and rescue the love of his life. As for how he came to possess the guts and resources to undertake this dangerous mission fraught with gun toting white supremacists, well, that is explained by bizarre affinity with bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (acting maestro Christoph Waltz).I shall not go into excruciating details and spoil this otherwise enjoyable film. It has a running time of 165 minutes but do not let that deter you from watching. Comprised of clever denotative and connotative symbols commonly used to great effect by cinematic auteurs, Django Unchained is an accessible yet dynamic piece of work. That Quentin Tarantino waxes lyrical and morbid humor (and gets away with using the n-word) in this superb revenge flick is just icing on the cake. I hope he wins this year's Oscar for best original screenplay.P.S. It is a shame that Samuel L. Jackson wasn't nominated for his chilling portrayal of Stephen, a racist black servant.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",9,0,2,16 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," A conscious revolt to straight-up Marvel movies. Entertaining!
","This film is fairly divisive and I'm aware of the naysayers that find those 'lame jokes trashy', 'character development problematic' and 'dialogue full of clichés'. In defense of these three major complaints, I say well of course it's not the funniest film there is, but no less humorous than any other film in the superhero genre. Pretty damn entertaining on the overall and casting did a great job with Quill the Starlord.What I find earnest about this film, is James Gunn's intentional treatment of the space western being a different beast entirely from conventional superhero flicks. Whether in conscious revolt to self- important straight-up Marvel movies, OR mere satisfaction of style and whim consistent with career trajectory as an indie writer- director of B movies (Dawn of the Dead, Slither) I can't say with certainty. Maybe a combination of both. With that in mind, is James Gunn officially an auteur? Yes. Does being one also make him an artist? Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, considering Kubrick's axiom that 'a film is or should be, more like music than fiction.' I'm inclined to agree with all final verdicts that declare 'Guardians of the Galaxy being an unpretentious, fun and likable mess.'Too many cling to the naive belief that a movie rises and falls with character development — not necessarily. While it is okay to care about character development, over insistence is to place too much emphasis on just one element and overlook the rest.What matters is the overall design works in favour of story material using suitable language. GotG is geared towards the edgy, cheeky and comical. Bunch of goofs and misfits become friends and save the galaxy.It's a real shame that clichés in the film intentionally deployed before being voluntarily jettisoned by self-awareness midpoint (as a form of comic device) has completely escaped the naysayers.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",8,1,5,27 November 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt. Outstanding.
","Political controversies aside, Zero Dark Thirty is a thriller par excellence that grips you firmly and quietly by the neck. It is also the kind of film that demands focus from the outset. If you choose to give in--investing 157 minutes will pay off handsomely. At the center of Kathryn Bigelow's ninth feature is the manhunt on Osama Bin Laden, and the world knows he is dead. The film title is military speak for half past midnight--Osama's alleged time of death. Popular misconceptions will have you believe that knowing how a story ends works against it; but this film operates outside political and social repertory. What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt.Set two years after 9/11 attacks and told from a predator's (the US) perspective, it starts on the strength of CIA operative Dan (Jason Clarke). Stationed at a black site somewhere in Pakistan, he interrogates a detainee connected to Saudi terrorists using brazen techniques. At this point, you may be tempted to write the sequence off as propaganda by torture apologists, but don't be too quick--Dan is a red herring--a vehicle at best, for the sole intention of designing cause-effect to the outcome of Zero Dark Thirty's key narrative.New agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) is assigned to the team and Dan guides her transition in this highly elusive, volatile world. Like a cold and calculating chess-master, Maya quickly learns how to exploit variables of the game. She thrives on psychological warfare required of interrogators, yet cranks to the right rhythm necessary to benefit from a politically oriented trade. Throughout the chain of events leading up to Osama's death; Maya is often photographed behind barriers, suggesting the distance necessary for her to guard against and self-protect.This is when it occurred to me that something strange is happening to Bigelow as a director--she has emerged from The Hurt Locker with a style that is distinct, yet subtle. In the classical paradigm of historical-war films often infused with dramatic muscularity; Bigelow has forsaken traditional myths, and engineered a new kind of modern, masculine instinct.Zero Dark Thirty is set in the thick of a chase spanning ten years, but it moves fluidly with unknowable force--driving you forward into a riveting climax executed with precision and realistic memesis.Apart from a screenplay by Mark Boal that reveals masterful technique, film score by Alexandre Desplat (performed by London Symphony Orchestra) evokes the right emotional currents critical to this film. Its musical motifs parallel the aura surrounding Zero Dark Thirty's mysterious protagonist--melodies are sophisticated and stoic, with an undertone of sensuality.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",10,12,27,21 January 2013
Flight," Stylish film that pulsates with visual and postmodern wit.
","One of the pleasures of Robert Zemeckis's latest film is the way he introduces Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a suave airline pilot who shuffles domestic flights for a living. When Whip isn't jet setting around America in a JR-88; he is crack sniffing, hard drinking, and getting busy with beautiful flight attendants. In theory, he is the archetypal macho high flyer, a smooth operator with wind beneath his wings (I apologize for dramatizing... can't bring myself to pass up on corny metaphors.) But in reality; Whip is a product of vice addiction, in denial of his weaknesses, an antihero with a broken spirit.****************************Note: Possible spoilers for the first act of this film ahead. The first action occurs during a brief flight bound for Atlanta. Safety is compromised by gathering storm and strong draft; resulting in violent turbulence, which Whip successfully negotiates with his repertoire of strategic moves. But the close call forewarns an even bigger crisis in minutes to come. At this point, I am tempted to rave in detail about the nerve-wracking sequence preceding Flight's second mishap. Zemecki lives up to his name as Hollywood's poster boy for visual effects (The Polar Express, Beowulf, Forrest Gump)--but I'd rather not. Because the next sequence is even more spectacular.Flight 227 eventually succumbs to technical malfunction, enters a steep dive plunging all the way down for motherearth when Whip is forced to perform one of the riskiest tour de stunt (sic) known in aviation and Hollywood physics--rolling the airplane.Bottom line is; they will inevitably crash. But not before Whip mitigates foreseeable damage by stressing the jet into inverted position midair. And the elegant touch is this: it is logical insofar as preventing uncontrolled descent is concerned--when the airplane flips, it regains balance and altitude. Of course, the speed and precision in timing required of this maneuver is easier said than done. Which is why Whip emerges from the harrowing escape a public hero; whose talent as a pilot reduced impact upon crashing, thereby saving many lives on board. Yet things get complicated because this film is more than mind blowing action; this unique aspect justifies Denzel Washington's Best Actor, and John Gatin's Best Original Screenplay nominations in this year's academy awards.An investigative agency responsible for assigning accountability launches inquiry into parties involved: the airline, aircraft manufacturers, crew members. With commercial and financial interests vested in their verdict, all the hero worship is not enough to pardon Whip's liability as sole authority in the cockpit. And to further implicate him; toxicology screens taken while he was unconscious reveal damning proof of alcohol and cocaine. From the angle of negligence, being incarcerated for manslaughter is a concrete possibility.Herein lies the thick of Flight--under that veneer of cool amidst the chaos hides a tired, passive aggressive man. He sabotages legal aid granted by the pilot union; sinks low into the deep end of shame and self-destruction. As the plot gradually unfolds in the second act of this riveting film, the observer (audience) is being persuaded into private dimensions--there are moral impasses that underpin Whip's rational imperative.Many stories have explored virtue and redemption with utilitarian narratives, but few managed to do so without being cliché. Flight stands out with sleek cinematic language in an authentic way. The result is a stylish synthesis of figurative dilemmas, pulsating with visual and postmodern wit.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",9,0,2,18 January 2013
Looper," Superb execution on a tired and old premise. Entertaining!
","In this latest film by Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Breaking Bad); the premise is old but execution, superb. Looper is very entertaining for a time travel science-fiction thrillerNow that I have gotten sensationalistic thoughts out of the way, there is no doubt that it is a tad cluttered (or misleading) for something sold as 'sci-fi time travel'. But hey if Looper is messed up, then 2046 must be f**king depraved.Considering the number of films in this genre (Source Code, Frequency) tend to lure viewers in with the promise of paradoxical intrigue only to finally climax in a cesspool of logical absurdities (and thereby, obliterating any fun or entertainment I could have possibly gleaned from the entire viewing experience) I'd say Looper concluded with a nice touch.Eight out of ten either cop-out of the premise in their final acts, or bend the rules of time travel so far out of shape that narrative collapses under the weight of a rigid past-present-future time line.At least, Looper was entertaining enough to finish in one sitting without cussing. The appeal lies in not taking it too seriously.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",7,2,5,20 January 2013
Cloud Atlas," Unless you want to spend $12 on mind rape in the cinema, don't bother.
","First off; the novel by David Mitchell must be reviewed separately because the recording arts (cinema) must be differentiated from the representational arts (literature) by virtue of medium and also, I haven't read it.Cloud Atlas will divide audiences into three camps; you will 1) like it for it what appears to be profundity, 2) dislike it for what appears to be complexity or 3) dislike it for what appears to be intellectual dishonesty. Just to be clear, its directors have rebutted those belonging to the second camp with responses that imply ignorance on the part of viewers and critics. But their reactions cannot be further from the truth because this film, is not as abstract as they imagine it to be. Since Cloud Atlas is adapted from a novel; those who believe (or argue) that if, a work of art has reached full artistic expression in one form, an adaptation will inevitably be inferior The Coen Brothers' 2007 masterpiece No Country For Old Men and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange are proofs that such belief simply isn't true--it can be done.**************************** This convoluted mess can be summarized with voice overs from three characters: Isaac Sachs (Tom Hanks) on determinism, Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) and Sonmi (Doona Bae) on consciousness in the realm of quantum physics. The execution is so pretentious that it makes The Man From Earth look like great cinema, and reduces David Hume's lifelong inquiry into causality resemble middle-school homework. I am surprised that it is written by creators of The Matrix. Andy and Lana Wachowski claimed their vision of Cloud Atlas is 'cinematic art'. And if their claim is true, then Cloud Atlas is poor quality of the elite abstractionist tendency. The gist of it is: interactive collaboration between both parties (artists and observers) is critical. And with Cloud Atlas; attention is solely focused on the directors' obscure vision and fallacious theme (debunked in causal determinism inquiry), with no heed whatsoever being paid to observers who reward their so called 'art' with viewership. The Wachowskis are making mockery out of 1) cineliteracy, 2) rigorous directors (Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Haneke) and 3) movie goers who actually respect and love film aesthetics. The snobbery so implicit in Cloud Atlas reeks of bad manners and ethics.**************************** Basically free will is impossible unless Isaac Sachs is conjuring the universe as he lives, or he is (and everybody else are) all part of the same consciousness experiencing different strands of existence simultaneously. This is the whole shebang of what Sonmi blabbers about in the last act but here is the clincher: the disappointing thing about Cloud Atlas-- unlike films that attempt to explain the WHYs with coherent rhetoric and narratives(Synecdoche New York); all they ever do with this adaptation is regurgitate pop-philosophy by having characters echo WHAT their views on causality are, and CONCLUDE with deliberately vague gibbering without so much as a credible premise USING CINEMATIC LANGUAGE.This film is not the least bit original, inventive or thought provoking--it is offensive that its filmmakers imply artistic inferiority in those who dislike it.**************************** Besides its core message on causal determinism (cause-effect), there are a few points worth noting. Number One: Story begins with montages that defy linear timelines for no good reason. For better examples, see Memento and Amour for how timelines are manipulated to advantage. Save yourself the effort of trying to understand the structure because no thoughts were being invested to its form and function. This film's (jagged and broken) non-linear editing is a cop-out passing off as being 'abstract'; for the challenging task of fusing six stories in one graceful, coherent tapestry. The real shame is; if done right, this tapestry serves as symbolic simultaneity between two entities--the consciousness and the cinema. Potential in an elegant rhetorical device is squandered blindly. **************************** Number Two: Dialogues, especially the ones set in post-apocalyptic earth (Tom Hanks and Halle Berry) are written in seemingly undecipherable connotative symbols. By that I mean: 1) centri = centre and thus 'eurocentric' = centered on Europe, 2) pute = think and thus 'impute' = to attribute, to think of as. No prize for guessing what 'cog' actually means. This pattern manifests again in the third act of Neo Seoul segment when The Archivist lambastes at Sonmi, and spouts new terminologies such as 'corprocrats', 'psychogenomicist'. But don't be floored, the gesture is Cloud Atlas's idea of creative 'originality'--a reference to emerging transdiscplinary trends in the sciences. **************************** Number Three (Ockham's Razor Fail): Install a dictionary app on your smart phone before watching because they wrote the script using thesauruses--opting for redundant ten dollar words over simple vocabulary.****************************Number Four: See Carlos Castaneda and Alexander Solzhenitsyn for uppity parallelisms in this film if; after all the negative reviews from respectable critics, for one reason or another, you find yourself with three vacant hours insignificant enough to exercise mental gymnastics in futility. Unless you want to be mind raped, this film isn't worth a damn.****************************Bottom line; big, relative, complex, transcendental subjects (physics and philosophy) are best reserved for directors with wit enough to shoulder the ethical weight of exploring such life changing themes. Why let the promise of visual effects and Hollywood casts seduce you into enabling such film making tactics? Wait for it to air on TV if you are genuinely curious about the hype this film has been generating.Cloud Atlas is an annoying metafilm about metaphysical philosophy. The result is epic tomfoolery.",1,40,82,19 January 2013
Warm Bodies," Zom Rom Com?!
","Tagline explains the gist of it, 'He's still dead, but he's getting warmer.'Told from the perspective of a walking 'corpse' in his early twenties, R (played by teen idol Nicholas Hoult) walks, acts, grunts and gobbles like a zombie but the unique difference is; he feels like a human being. Infection from chemical warfare hasn't robbed him of all emotional and mental faculties!In this zombie romance based on Isaac Marion's novel, consciousness wanes overtime and not immediately. When humans 'turn', they become corpses just like R and slowly disintegrate into full-blown nasties called 'bonies.' We find out later that the cure-all solution apparently lies in... umm, some heart and sweet lovin'.When consuming brain matter belonging to victims, R experiences flashes of their memories — literally absorbing nutrients physically and physiologically as he feeds. One day; he meets cute with Julie (Teresa Palmer, who bears a striking resemblance to Kristen Stewart from some angles), daughter of Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich) — a leader of mankind's resistance against the undead. Hunger gives way to neural activity, hormones and warm fuzzy feelings; the pair soon bond over John Waite's rendition of 'Missing You' among other MTV hits.Rest of the plot's development is formalist predicament — 'lovers in overwhelming odds' — Romeo and Juliet against the scrim of gun-totting homo sapiens and carnivorous bonies.Warm Bodies is the type of fusion flick that will attract a fair amount of praise and disdain from die hard fans of stock genres that range from zombie (Dawn of the Dead), goth (Twilight), romantic comedies (Crazy, Stupid, Love), apocalyptic sci-fi (Children of Men) to serious dramas (Inception). We watch with a preset of ideas about what it should or ought to be, so I'm going out on a limb here to say that this latest feature by Jonathan Levine (50/50) is a pretty fun and amusing trip. It took some time but eventually, I came to enjoy the film what it's worth — offbeat fiction for forlorned romantics.There are moments when Warm Bodies border on pedestrian vanilla; relying on pop music and goofy-dry humor to compel the narrative but this routine ends after the second act. On the overall; Levine's protagonists make a handsome couple, relatable and charming in this interrobang of romcom in zombie-apocalypse. Story is really sweet, the effect is entertaining.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",7,3,5,12 February 2013
