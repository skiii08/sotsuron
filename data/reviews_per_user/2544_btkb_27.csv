The Avengers," REALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS!!! THIS IS JUST AWESOME AND FUNNY!!!
","Finally saw this movie! This one I definitely love the fighting scenes. First one, Captain America and Iron Man fighting with Loki. Second, Thor fighting with Iron Man and then Captain America. Third, Hulk fighting with Thor since Bruce couldn't control his power. And lastly, my favorite scene of all, Avengers fighting with the Chitauris. Not sure if they were called that. My favorite scene that made me laugh was when Hulk grabbed Loki and smashed him and called him 'puny god'. REALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS!!! THIS IS JUST AWESOME AND FUNNY!!!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Worth it and Awesome to Watch
","My favorite Avenger. It was cool seeing the fight scenes. The first one being Hulk vs the soldiers, and the second one where Hulk fights Abomination. Edward Norton was great in this movie! I feel like if this was going have any comedy to it, then Mark Ruffalo is better for it! Overall, it was great! IT'S WORTH THE WATCH!!!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Iron Man 3," DEFINITELY WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
","When I first saw this, I was like, 'Dang, they destroyed his house. Where he had all his gadgets and technologies in there!' The end was really good. The fight scene at the end was cool. All of the Iron Man suits, or J.A.R.V.I.S. fighting with Killian's people. Hope I didn't spoil for new viewers. But, DEFINITELY WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",10,3,4,18 March 2020
Memento," Not What I Expected
","It was super surprising! I feel like the story or plot goes backward here since there is a lot of flashbacks going on, explaining what happened. This one is worth it. Watch this movie!",10,0,0,1 May 2020
Captain Marvel," Surprisingly Good in my Opinion!
","Really enjoyed it! Captain Marvel looked great! It was also funny to see Nick Fury as well! Worth the watch!!I can see why not many people like this movie since it showed Captain Marvel getting her super powers to the point where she has become the strongest avenger. Either way, the movie was good in my opinion. It is still worth the watch.Brie Larson looked pretty good as Captain Marvel!",10,3,4,18 March 2020
Iron Man 2," WORTH THE WATCH!!
","Finally saw Rhodes in a suit 'War Machine.' I always love the fight scenes. For this, I would say War Machine and Iron Man fighting with Whiplash and the drones was my favorite. Second would be when War Machine was fighting with Iron Man during the party. Definitely WORTH THE WATCH!!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Us," Great Movie! Not Bad!
","This was pretty good! The ending was super unexpected. Certain things in this movie gave an idea or meaning to what would happen to the movie, or what the references were.
The ending, on the other hand, where all the people are holding hands and are around the place or land, was something I did not understand, or felt it was not necessary. I don't know how to explain it, but it felt like it was unnecessary.
The movie, overall, was great! It was pretty cool.
I would say Get Out is more better than this, but this was still a great movie!",8,2,7,19 March 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," REALLY FUNNY AND AWESOME!!!
","I didn't expect this to be REALLY funny! My favorite part was the beginning, and when Thor sees Hulk coming in and says, 'YES!' because he knows him. I like how Hulk smashes Thor like he did with Loki and Loki gets up and says, 'YES!' I also liked the way Korg talked too. Their team names was pretty funny when Thor said, 'Revengers!' Also, when Hulk jumped out of the space ship expecting to transform to Hulk but instead crashes on the floor with the *thump* sound. Then he turns to Hulk and fights Hela's giant dog! The ending was awesome. DEFINITELY WATCH THIS!! IT WAS FUNNY AND GREAT!This movie definitely made up for Thor 2! Way to go MCU!! All the actors/actresses were spot on!",10,3,7,18 March 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," WATCH THIS MOVIE!! WORTH IT!!
","It was actually pretty funny, especially Ned. The fight was great, and in the end, the new suit for Peter looked way cooler!
Tom Holland was perfect for the Spider-Man movies! I did not expect Zendaya to be in this!
This was definitely awesome and worth the watch!",10,3,5,18 March 2020
Elf," Funny Movie
",Watched this movie at my school for Christmas. Will Ferrell was pretty hilarious in this film. Every minute of this was funny! Watch this movie! You can watch it during Christmas if you wanted to.,10,0,1,1 May 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Awesome Action and Worth Watching!
","I loved the fight between Bucky and Captain America. The cool part was when Captain America threw his shield at him, but Bucky caught it which surprised him. The ending was great. I was surprised to see Falcon since I didn't know he had a suit too. Thought he was just a random person that jogged along with Captain America. It's definitely worth watching!",10,4,4,18 March 2020
Doctor Strange," WORTH WATCHING!!!
",The fighting was pretty cool. I didn't expect the end to be Thor meeting him. Part of the scene from Thor: Ragnarok. This was pretty cool to watch. Doctor Strange fighting with Kaecilius along with the other two with him was pretty cool. I didn't know his last name was actually Strange. Worth watching!,10,1,2,18 March 2020
Ant-Man," Funny, Awesome, and Worth it!
","Here, Luis made me laugh because the way he was telling the stories and how everyone's voices was his voice! Also, Ant-man fighting with Yellowjacket was pretty cool. The funny part was when they zap at each other or broke something, but when you look at it, it looks as if nothing happened. Since they were fighting in bug sizes. Another fight I liked was Ant-man fighting with Falcon. Comical and awesome movie!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Awesome and Worth it!
","The fight was cool. When I first watched it, I forgot how the ending went. Then I realize the ending was where he was frozen for 70 years. I guess he was like Aang from the Last Airbender. I had to watch this three times! I guess that shows how good this movie is! DEFINITELY WORTH THE WATCH!!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Justice League," Not What I Expected, and Wish They Did this to Make it Look Better
","It's still pretty good. The CGI to this was different compared to MCU version. Then again, I shouldn't be saying that since it is still a tough work when it comes to making it SUPER cool! I mention CGI because some of them you can tell it is fake, rather than having that realistic feeling towards it.
I enjoyed the fight. I wish the fight between Superman and Steppenwolf was longer. Superman looked more OP in here. Then again, he is Man of Steel.
It is still watchable, especially if you are a DC fan!",7,5,7,17 March 2020
Captain America: Civil War," ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!
","I was surprised to see Black Panther showing up in this. Bunch of the fights in this were awesome. Like, Black Panther going after Bucky, Avengers fighting with Bucky after getting hypnotized, and all of the Avengers (excluding some) fighting each other. The ending was pretty good. Enjoyed every minute of this movie! Worth the watch!I guess this would answer why some of them did not meet each other or had contact with each other as you continue watching the Marvel movies. Well, mainly Infinity War when Bruce Banner asks what happened. You will see!",10,4,8,18 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Best Avengers Movie I Have Ever Watched
","This was EPIC!! It was AWESOME! Everyone should definitely watch this! I WAS MIND-BLOWN!!! I loved it!
I was kind of sad that Hulk, or Bruce Banner, doesn't get to fight much. I still enjoyed his comedy to this movie.
The ending to this movie is the best of all. I was sad to see some of them die though.
This is a movie that almost EVERYONE should watch! It is funny, awesome, lot of action, and more!
I can see why SO MANY PEOPLE talk about it and SPOIL IT!!!",10,2,7,17 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," MIND-BLOWING!!!
","Finally watched this film as well. I was sad at the end seeing some of the Avengers, or Marvel characters, disappear in ashes. Another sad part was seeing some dead. The beginning was intense! Shows how strong the villain was! Definitely worth watching! You will be MIND-BLOWN!",10,0,1,18 March 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," WORTH IT!! FUNNY AND AWESOME!!
","When I first saw this, I enjoyed the scene where Peter meets Rocket and Groot along with Gamora. The fight was cool. Then, they meet Drax. In the end, I thought Groot died, but found out they had to plant him. Now he is baby Groot! This movie was great! WORTH IT!! FUNNY AND AWESOME!!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Worth it! Funny!
","It was cool to see the Avengers fight again! The sad part was when Hulk left leaving Romanoff sad. Another fight I liked was when Hulk was fighting with Iron Man with his Hulk Buster suit. I thought Wanda was about to do the mind thing on Hawkeye, but he sensed her coming. Kind of wished Quicksilver was alive. Better to watch this before Ragnarok! WORTH IT! FUNNY!",10,2,4,18 March 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," WORTH THE WATCH!!!
","Drax always laughing at a lot of things. Rocket made me laugh too. I kind of liked Groot as a baby. The ending was pretty sad. I didn't expect Sylvester Stallone to be in this movie. It was cool! I also didn't expect Peter's (Starlord) father to be the villain, and that he was Kurt Russell. Worth the watch!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Thor," Worth it! Watch this Movie! Awesome!
","The last scene was pretty cool since Thor, without powers, got his powers back and defeated The Destroyer. Actually, the first scene of the fight was cool too. Thor and his friends along with Loki fighting with the Frost Giants. Definitely worth the watch!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Jaws," Great Film!
","I thought it would be a bit horrible because when it comes to shark attacks, especially Great White Shark, it has to look real. Luckily, this movie did really great job at it. Steven Spielberg is always the best director when it comes to movies like these!
Worth the watch!",10,0,1,18 April 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Reviews about ALL of the King Kong Movies!
","Kong: Skull Island (2017) - You have three great actors/actress in this film: Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel Jackson. The three characters from Marvel movies. This movie was awesome! Of course, it is better than the original and the remake of King Kong (2005). The CGI in this was terrific. Can't wait to see King Kong vs. Godzilla! This is worth the watch!King Kong (2005) - This was really good! Surprisingly, Jack Black was in it. The movie did really good with special effects and all. King Kong looked great! I feel like this remake was better than the first remake. It is worth the watch!King Kong Lives (1986) - It was pretty good. Surprised to see the lady who played Sarah Connor in this movie. You get to see King Kong and Female Kong escaping, along with having Baby Kong in this movie. The movie is pretty great. The ending was sad.King Kong (1976) - It was not bad, but it was a bit different. I liked it since it is not animation anymore, and they have improved in making King Kong look real. It is not that bad. It is different, but it is still worth the watch.King Kong Escapes (1968) - Surprised to see King Kong fighting with his Cyborg King Kong! It was not that bad. Worth the watch!King Kong vs. Godzilla (1963) - It was pretty cool. King Kong fighting with Godzilla was awesome! You might tell some of them are fake when it comes to vehicles and trains getting stomped or destroyed. At the same time, it is pretty cool and great to watch! Can't wait to see the remake of this movie!Son of Kong Son of Kong (1933) - I did not expect King Kong to have a son! This was pretty good. King Kong's son looked shorter, but he looked pretty cool. Same animation like they did with King Kong in the first movie. It's pretty cool to see what it was like before CGI existed. Great movie!King Kong (1933) - Not bad! The animation of King Kong looked great! Of course, CGI wasn't there in the 30s, but it was still a great movie!",10,1,2,22 March 2020
Black Panther," THIS IS GREAT!!!
",Finally watched this film after hearing everyone saying 'IT WAS AWESOME' or 'WAKANDA FOREVER'. Boseman and Jordan both did awesome in their part. The fight was the best one of all! I can see why this movie had AWESOME reviews!,10,3,7,18 March 2020
Iron Man," Awesome and Worth It
",It was AWESOME! The fight at the end was really cool. Including when he built his Iron Man suit. IT'S REALLY WORTH THE WATCH!!!,10,0,2,18 March 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Still Worth it!
","The fight at the end was pretty awesome. I thought Loki actually died, but the ending was pretty good. It is better to watch this movie to understand what is going on in Endgame, as they do their journey. Trying not to spoil it. Anyway, WATCH THIS!! It's worth it!I gave it a 9/10 because comparing it to the first one, this one looked a little different. It was still great, but it wasn't like the first one. I guess that is confusing. Pretty much, this movie did not look like it was going to be better than the prequel of it. It is still worth it!",9,0,0,18 March 2020
