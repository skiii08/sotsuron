Minority Report," Weirdly disturbing, but extremely well done
","Minority Report may be a science fiction movie, but it manages to keep a sense of suspense and by the end, you don't know what to expect from it.The dilemma not exactly explained in the film that the viewer has to face is tough, but throughout the movie PreCrime's flaws and benefits shine through clearly.The movie is very fast-paced for a sci-fi movie, but I think that's how it gets it's uniqueness to shine through.Overall, Tom Cruise might not be the best actor, but by-god is this a great movie.",9,0,0,6 August 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Cinema Masterpiece
","This movie is absolutely amazing. The setting, satire, comedy, vulgarity and controversy are hilarious, and the musical aspect, well, I'll say one thing, is satirically hysterical.The war scene is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, and the way Matt and Trey made fun of everything gives the movie life.The only meh thing about this movie is the 'there's the girl that I like' scenes by Stan to Wendy, but I can say they get hilarious and also are satire in themselves.The way the movie pieces together at the end is extremely smart and well-done.Also, they did a very good job at not making this feel like a really long episode, with a large scale that makes it feel like a movie.The transitions from 2D to 3D animation are amazing, and the scene where Cartman uses his v-chip to banish Saddam Hussain is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.Overall, this is a fantastic movie. Oh, and also, I think everyone at one point should see it. It is more than preserved cinematic satirical comedy PERFECTION. If rating a movie 11/10 was possible, even that would be too small for this piece of artwork that deserves to be preserved for all eternity.*out of breath* so this is a good movie.",10,0,0,6 August 2019
