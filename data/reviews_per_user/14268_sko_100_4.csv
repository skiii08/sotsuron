Mission: Impossible III," Another excellent installment! :D
","JJ Abrams is awesome! If you're an Alias or Lost fan, you have no reason in the world not to watch and thoroughly enjoy this near perfect popcorn thriller. Think Alias, fused with the Mission: Impossible (for that, read Tom Cruise) style and a huge budget to play with...with a talented and good-looking cast and this is what you get.The acting, let's be honest, won't win any Oscars but was more than adequate for this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman exudes creepy power and sinister criminal genius in his role as Davian, an international terrorist; Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup play their spy movie stereotypes with vigour; supporting team members Ving Rhames et al play their respective parts with comedy, loyalty and downright coolness and as ever, Tom Cruise becomes the archetypal screen hero he seems to born to play, complete with tears, yelling and adrenaline-fuelled rushes towards the goal.This film WILL have you on the edge of your seat (at the bridge part that you preview in the trailer, my hand was almost shaking in excitement), comprised of a handful of mini missions that'll leave the kid in you grinning, and expect all the questions of loyalty, emotion and righteous anger from the man behind Alias. Cinematography is brilliant, picking all the right angles to accentuate the angles and the score by Michael Giacchino (again from the Alias crew...if it ain't broke....) is spot on. All in all just brilliant. As perfect an action film as I've seen in a quite a while and if you go in expecting an octane, high-kicking rush, rather than a dramatic expose on espionage :P you won't be disappointed! I hope you enjoy half as much as I did.",9,2,4,12 May 2006
Big Fish," Beautiful, uplifting tale
","I must admit, being as (relatively) small minded as I am, it took me a while to finally watch this film. I mean, come on, with a title like 'Big Fish'? About a man telling lies? I think you can see where I'm coming from. I was terribly wrong.The only reason I gave this film 9, as opposed to 10 stars, is because it lacks any discernible plot, something that is normally a very big thing for me. However, that's not really the point. From start to finish the film is so beautifully made, and Ewan McGregor is the brilliant as the larger-than-life everyman, the man so 'big', he always felt like a 'big fish in a small pond'. And, the ending made me cry, as Edward 'returns' to the river, with 'everyone... and I MEAN everyone' is waiting there for him.It's tempting in the first half, to see Ed Bloom as a mere liar. He tells tall tales that, as an older viewer, I'm quick to dismiss. But as the story unfolds, and Ed's wife says 'Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.' I deliberate with Will Bloom, the disbelieving, jaded son of Edward, sick of his father's tales and the seemingly untrue element to all of them. It's not until later on, that we realise that there is an element of truth in them, be they symbolic or otherwise.Although it is sad when Edward dies, as no-one really wants such a character to die, it is nevertheless an extremely moving and uplifting moment, as Will Bloom accepts Edward for who he is, even if declines to prefer his methods. He accepts Edward, and takes up the mantle as story teller, leaving his father contented at peace, telling a story of such heart-rending, spectacular theatrics that it's almost as if Edward is channeling it through him.Commendations to Mr Burton again for giving us such an excellent movie. Beautiful and delightfully kooky as you'd expect, his collaboration with the cinematographers and long-term colleague Danny Elfman brings a film that's a must see for all ages. After all, everyone loves a good story!",9,2,4,4 April 2006
Casino Royale," Forget what you thought you knew
","First of all, apologies for the tagline-esquire summary line, but it sums up many, including my own, views of the film. Gone are the days of the invincible Bond, to whom injuries are mere fashion accessories. Gone is the Bond who masks every insecurity with glib retorts. Welcome to a new age of Bond. What Martin Campbell and Daniel Craig bring to the table is a Bond at the beginning of his development: he has just recently been granted his Double-O status and it shows. When he falls, he groans. His feathers and ego get easily ruffled. When he makes his comebacks, they smack more of self-defence and desperation than the customary flippant indifference. And we get an insight into why he treats women like he later does.Daniel Craig, with his new spin on the James Bond role has garnered both rave reviews and curses (cynics may with some reason say from women and men respectively) and both are somewhat justifiable. He convincingly plays the damaged action man, and even us guys would have to begrudgingly say he looks good. He also rises to the challenge of the increased emotional demand with admirable ease...he's not called upon to cry but covers pretty much the rest of the emotional spectrum during the film. However, this is a different Bond. For starters, there is the obvious physical difference: where his predecessors were lean and brunette, Craig is blonde and musclebound. His humour is also more wry than the traditional jokes that are JUST about on the acceptable side of cheesy. This Bond is also darker: not enough per se as to lose our sympathy for the protagonist, but as has been oft stated, it is certainly closer to James Bond as Ian Fleming initially intended. Whether this changes are for the better or worse is a matter of personal taste, but Daniel Craig is certainly no Lazenby.Finally, I'm torn as to Casino Royale's merit as a film. As a fan of the previous movies (yes, even Die Another Day) I was struck by the difference in Bond and tone. We also lose the gadgets in favour of mobile phone technology and internet searches (MI6 using Google?!?). At least the Aston Martins, in all their shiny splendour, remain. And I wasn't personally a fan of the editing. There were perceptible Acts to this film, with stark location changes and objectives to them, and while the plot was never entirely ridiculous (but where they ventured that way, the action justified it) and the segues perfectly acceptable, nevertheless the film lacks the flow of Martin Campbell's previous Goldeneye (a slick specimen of what a Bond movie should be, in my opinion). Each Act and set-piece is expertly executed and I have nothing but utmost respect for all that was done. The action is brilliant, in particular the free-running sequence you've already seen glimpses of in the trailer; the poker, tense (I WOULD advise learning the rules of Texas Hold 'Em first if you haven't already) and the emotional exchanges, charged with all the quality you'd expect from such a well-selected cast.In short, the movie is quality. The actors are without exceptional brilliant, in particular I would grant Mr Craig a standing ovation, and there are enough nods to the franchise and books (the recipe for the Vesper martini!) to make the fanboys satisfied. The action sequences are tense and downright exhilarating, and as stated, Craig handles these with apparent ease. The only potential downfall, if indeed it is to be thus regarded, is the change in the approach. I personally wasn't a fan of it on paper, but was won over by the calibre of the ingredients, but that is strictly a matter of taste. Either way, you know you're going to watch it, and I'm far from advising against it. Enjoy!.....Bond: Give me a vodka-martini. Bartender: Shaken, not stirred? Bond: Does it look like I give a damn?",8,1,6,16 December 2006
Atonement," Another excellent turn from Joe Wright
","Mr Joe Wright, if this directing lark doesn't work out for you, you CLEARLY have a sparkling career as a landscape photographer waiting for you. In a manner similar to his previous British literary adaptation, the infamous 'remake' of Pride and Prejudice, every shot was of such beauty, that for, as has previously been said of Raging Bull, you could take any frame of the film and it would a make a more than sizable photograph, and for my part I'd certainly put it up on my wall. Even the mind-blowingly long tracking shot of war torn Dunkirk beach was simultaneously filled with despair and yet a certain picturesque quality, perhaps intentionally contrasting it between the chocolate box imagery of the seaside and the stark contrast with the current situation. And as ever the sets in this film are so clearly painstakingly set up, the beach shot the most sizable notice of this, which even the harshest of critics could not fail to be impressed by. The first act was, again echoing P&P, almost like a film AND a ode of love to the great English countrysides and stately homes, panning over the trees and charmingly uneven hilltops, even adding a dash of glamour to what appeared to be overgrown weeds.In newspaper reviews, a couple of critics accused Joe Wright of being style over substance. The style is undeniably there. But I think in order for the film to have stood up as well as it did, there must have been a hefty great deal of substance also. I think the main problem was that the book, I'd imagine, with its to and fro narrative, didn't QUITE translate onto film. Although each section was beautifully crafted in its own way, it did seem to jump to time periods with no prior warning, such that you'd have to later realise what was going on. A minor niggle I know, and it may not annoy anyone else. As previously stated though, each part was expertly navigated by Joe Wright and of course this was also in great part thanks to the actors involved. The three actresses playing Briony were stubborn, numbly guilt-stricken and resigned respectively (the relative newcomer playing 13-year-old Briony is a standout find). James McAvoy again displays why he is so sought after with a sterling performance as a least flawed character in a film filled with imperfect people. Keira Knightley managed to avoid pouting her way through the movie and is again brilliant in her flawed English rose role, making the transition from aloof elitist to lovelorn with perhaps an over-swiftness, but that again may be what the script asked of her. The support cast provided a more than adequate frame, though not given much limelight to work with as the three main protagonists do such a brilliant job. As corny a prospect as it sounds, I think the sets and shooting locations should be credited as an invaluable cast member also, adding an additional emotional facet to every scene appropriately, taking your breath away without taking your eye away from the acting in the foreground.In short, mature and sensitive directing form Joe Wright (surely a name to look out for); Robbie, Cecilia and Briony x 3 all ever so much more than adequately portrayed; an excellent story from award and kudos-garnering Ian McEwan smartly adapted for screen; mouthwatering cinematography and locations tied up with another star turn from Dario Marianelli, returning for his second Joe Wright collaboration with an flowing and swelling score punctuated, appropriately by typewriter sound effects. All the emotion and beauty of Titanic set onland, sans boat and Celine Dion. A must-see.",9,5,15,8 September 2007
