Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I liked vol 1
","Volume 2 had some excellent parts reminiscent of the first, but my god the entire first act of the movie is disgustingly boring and full of weird plot holes.",5,0,0,31 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Overrated in my opinion
","I will admit I had high expectations to begin with because people hyped it up for me. It was entertaining at certain parts, but didn't really keep me interested. I have a feeling I missed things in scenes that I would have understood if I knew all the background of the characters better, but watching the previous marvel movies didn't give me that insight. One of the things that annoyed me right off from the beginning was Hulk fighting Thanks. He takes a few combo punches and the just goes down. He doesn't get angrier and stronger, but just sort of slumps over. If they explained that part better it might have made some sense to me. Good movie to pass some time, but not as amazing as everyone made it out to be.",6,2,4,22 August 2018
