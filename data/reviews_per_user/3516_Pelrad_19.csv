The Blair Witch Project," Blair is merely 'fair'
","I thought that 'The Blair Witch Project' was overrated and not very scary. It is more about a bunch of incompetent university students swearing, yelling, and fighting than it was about a witch. While 'Patch Adams' was much too polished a movie, this was much too raw. If they'd done a normal rather than documentary B-movie style and put in some more mature actors with cleaner dialogue who didn't spazz out every five minutes, it would have been much better. Still, I liked the woods and the run-down house at the end.

It," Where is the return as adults???
","The remake of the evil clown movie, i.e. IT... After trying to stomach too much gore, bullying, and violence and feeling unsatisfied by the lack of spine-tingling, I got about halfway through the movie and wondered when the kids now as adults would reunite to take on the evil. Needless to say, it never happened. Very disappointed. I prefer the original two-part movie which was a story of kids traumatized by evil seeping around town and trying to figure out what was going on. Years later they reunite as adults to face their fears and avenge their lost friend by finally taking IT on. It made an impression on me, as many of us as kids growing up sense that there is something not right about our town and return to it later in life to figure out what was going on. I feel the new IT blew it by axing this major plot point. Visually, it was decent as were the performances and it came close to engaging me but ultimately failed. 5/10",5,0,1,28 October 2017
Kung Fu Panda," Finally a Film About China the Chinese Love
","There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's 'Mulan', they didn't like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",10,20,27,25 June 2008
Star Trek," Pubescent Trek
","I've seen all the Star Trek movies, all episodes of the original series, and all episodes of The Next Generation. When I first heard about the premise for the new film, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand I thought it would be interesting to see how the original gang came together and some background of the original characters. But on the other hand I wondered why they were reverting to the past instead of moving forward with the saga.The opening scene was visually stunning. And, visually, the film was a treat, comprising a heck of a lot of detail. But when the pubescent characters were gradually introduced running around recklessly with their teenage hormones, I began rolling my eyes. If the casting director had chosen good actors, things would have been much different. Simply put: the actor who played the young James Kirk can't act. Many of the actors were television stars. And bringing second-rate TV actors onto the big screen is never wise.The other thing that I resented was the young Spock character. The actor did a fairly good job, but what was so admirable about the original Spock and arguably the draw of the original series was his lack of emotion. And using this against Kirk and especially Bones' emotional reactions was appealing. Any show works best when the characters are diverse rather than redundant. When you employ cultural imperialism by making Spock give in to the inferred superiority of Earth or human culture, you not only make things less interesting but give people a bad taste in their mouths. The film seemed to be saying, 'Let's test Spock's logic by destroying inferior planet Vulcan and his mom and have him finally give into our superior human ways by showing lots of emotion.' What adolescent stupidity! Finally, time travel has been done too much in Star Trek films. The story could have been just as good if the Enterprise had encountered a formidable ship from an alien race of the present. They did it obviously just so that they could have the older Spock in the movie. I thought it would have been better had they just opened with the old Spock as a narrator, reminiscing about old times and then saying, 'I bet you are wondering how it all came together and how the original crew came together on our first mission.' And then the movie goes into the story.To sum it up, visually the movie was fun at times. But with annoying teenage recklessness, bad acting, Spock's outbursts, cultural imperialism, and tired time travel, this was a bad Star Trek movie.",4,24,35,21 May 2009
Citizen Kane," 'Citizen Kane' is not a bad film, but it is not a great film.
","Those who argue that this film's greatness stems from combining some of the most innovative techniques in filming forget that technical achievement cannot solely make a film a masterpiece. 'Citizen Kane' is not a bad film, but it is not a great film; it lacks an inspiring story and, for the most part, is quite monotonous. I have no intention of viewing it again. As far as Welles and Film Noir is concerned, 'Touch of Evil' was a much better film. I give 'Citizen Kane' 6 out of 10.",6,1,5,24 January 1999
Citizen Kane," Is it just to use cinematography as the sole criterion for 'best film of all time'?
","Citizen Kane   **Â½ / 4This film is regarded by some as the greatest motion picture of all time. Most of these cite their one and only reason as its innovative and influential cinematography. This raises the question: is it just to use the latter as the sole criterion for stamping a film with the 'all time best' label? A further question that may be raised: does a movie that is technically brilliant qualify as great without due regard given to its ability to entertain?Although the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and judging motion pictures is as subjective as it is objective and an art as much as an analysis, I'd like to identify several elements, which are universally considered to make a movie great: the enjoyment one is given by its plot, dialogue / script, musical score, depth of character, solid acting and directing, and cinematography.In my view, an all time best film must be outstanding in all of these; Citizen Kane was not. Its plot was overtly dull and unsophisticated: reporters review the boring life of an uninteresting man who rose to prosperity. Citizen Kane had no memorable dialogue whatsoever (compare it with 'Casablanca' in this department); its script was nothing special. Its musical score was a far cry from the creative genius of someone like Ennio Morricone, Leonard Bernstein, or even John Williams. There was absolutely no depth of character in the film-none that appeared had any heart or appeal. Its acting was only satisfactory. Mind you, the actors did not have very difficult roles to play. Because of this, one could not direct praises towards the director who had an obviously unchallenging job. This leaves cinematography. Influential? Yes. Innovative? Yes. The greatest of all time? No. Even 'Touch of Evil', another Orson Welles' classic (and much, much better than Citizen Kane), had far superior black and white photography and use of shadows.Does all of this mean that Citizen Kane was a bad film? No. Citizen Kane is an average film and, though overall boring, generally deserves a marginal 'thumbs up'.",6,0,1,30 April 2000
Amistad," strikingly beautiful sets and costumes
","'Amistad's' strength is in its portrayal of the horrible treatment of the Sierra Leone Africans who are illegally captured for slaves in the 19th century.  The film is gilded by the strikingly beautiful sets and costumes where even 'Doctor Zhivago' pales in comparison. The photography was more than stunning. However, the film is slightly marred by the somewhat empty performances by the Americans in the film who lack emotion and engaging dialogue, and the film doesn't unfold as smoothly as one would expect from a Spielberg creation. These negative elements have caused many critics to give 'Amistad' only a 'good' review. I feel that the film, as a whole, however, is not pulled back from excellent status to that extent. I give Amistad 9/10 (Very Good).",9,0,1,23 March 1999
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Mostly Unwatchable
","Watching Star Wars Rogue One reminded me how stubborn the entertainment industry is. They come up with a bad idea, which is often a move backwards, thinking it is creative and ignore public backlash against it. First we got that hand-held, shaky camera idea which hasn't gone away. The newest 'invention' is making movies so dark, we may as well have a radio play instead. Visually, Rogue One is way too dark making one strain the eyes to see what is happening which has become the trend in Hollywood. It's like Hollywood has lost all confidence in its movies and insults the viewer by letting him not see the actors and what is going on. Beyond this, the brightness and contrast are out of whack, colour is drained out, and it looks all blurry. Rogue One looks just horrible. It's very ugly and unattractive.The second annoyance I had was the dialogue which was delivered in a very wooden style and way too long in most scenes. Okay, we get it, let's move on. The director had the actors ramble on and on when this was supposed to be an action/war movie.The previous Star Wars films worked because the dark evil spirit and the contrasting good/light spirit were delivered not by tinkering with the cinematography but allowing us to see the actors' faces and thus the emotions, motivations, and attitudes that protruded. We could see how they treated each other, how they felt about each other, something we can't see in Rogue One because of the fogged up murk.The film's only saving graces were Donnie Yen and the final battle scene. I give it 2 stars for those two out of 10.",2,37,75,20 December 2016
The Fifth Element," The greatest Science Fiction Comedy ever made
","Earth, water, air, and fire require a fifth element to battle evil: life force. Loving life is not born from materialism; it is the darkness of materialism that destroys the love of life. Every few thousand years, as 'The Fifth Element' reminds us, humanity develops an obsession with material things and this evil threatens the destruction of civilisation.Fresh, bright, visually dazzling, 'The Fifth Element' is the greatest Science Fiction Comedy of all time. Its inspirational message of love will draw tears, its uproarious humour will sap your breath from laughter, its action scenes, including the largest indoor explosion ever created for film, will have your amusement soaring.  Starring one of the most amiable stars of the century - Bruce Willis - as well as Mila Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker, this is one for all ages to savour. This movie is so much fun to watch that any flaws in the plot or in the editing are rendered wholly inconsequential. Its eccentric Dickens-like characters are an absolute delight, the dialogue is contagious, the soundtrack is brilliant, the international flavour the film gives with its varied races and accents rouses the heart with a glorious outlook on the future of the world,  and the special effects are so breathtaking that the movie will look good on any TV set. This is one film of which one will not tire easily after repeated viewings. 'The Fifth Element' is a winner.",10,0,1,27 August 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," The Great Depression's desolation is effectively re-created
","Besides entertaining, the motion picture can educate, inspire, or raise awareness about important issues occurring or having occurred in the world. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a film about the Great Depression. We don't learn much about it from the film, but the film's quality does something just as good, it raises the viewer's curiosity about it, and he is inspired to look it up. What caused it? How widespread was it? Did anyone actually starve to death because of it? If so, how many? How did it end, i.e. what was the solution to conjure up its demise?Many films have been made about the Great Depression. This is one of the best. It is based on the novel by John Steinbeck (who also wrote 'Of Mice and Men' and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962), 'The Grapes of Wrath' was nominated for the Best Picture of 1940 by the American Motion Picture Academy (Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' won).Henry Fonda gives the performance of a lifetime as a young man who has returned from jail to discover that his family's spirit has been crushed from their loss of land and home. They come across a flyer advertising 800 agricultural jobs in California and decide to head out west. Unfortunately, thousands of people responded in the same way to the add. Rather than hire only the manpower needed, the abusive employers hired all they could but cut their wages lower than what was required for survival.The Great Depression's desolation both in the environment and in the spirit of the people is effectively re-created. The characters were memorable with their weak command of English. 'Grandpa' was a hoot. This is a classic. 10/10.",10,2,4,21 April 1999
The Thing," ...the best horror film of all-time.
","I disagree with critics who regard the lame original of this film as superior. The 1980s version of 'The Thing' is not only the best of all the works of John Carpenter but the best horror film of all-time, in my opinion. Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley are two among a research team in remote Antarctica. When a 'nearby' Norweigan camp seems to have gone berserk, an investigation reveals that they had dug up an alien from outer space capable of absorbing and imitating any life form. Who is human and who is 'the thing'?",10,1,2,24 January 1999
In the Name of the Father," Overdone
","Daniel Day Lewis is a masterful actor. So is Emma Thompson. This film is based on a true story and rarely has a dull moment. But it is marred by 'melodramatic' overacting. It is overdone. The events that occurred are rammed down the viewer's throat. The film is pedantic. Yes, we are smart. We know that what happened was very unjust. The film doesn't have to keep hitting one over the head in presenting this tragedy as if we are too stupid to figure out that the arrested men are innocent. Duh!The film is much too violent. We don't have to view every violent scene that supposedly occurred in actuality in order to get the point. Tone it down, folks!Still, it is a good film overall. Police brutality has gotta go, eh Rodney King?I give it an 8.",8,4,9,27 April 1999
American History X," RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGIC
","THERE ARE MANY MORE RACES THAN THE BLACK AND THE WHITEAmerican History X is about racism, but more exclusively about the tensions between the white and black races, so deeply-rooted in the U.S.. Yes, black people make up the largest minority in that land - I believe about 10% of the population - but U.S. film-makers are becoming a little more awake, beginning to touch upon the lives of other races. For example, another 1998 film, 'Smoke Signals' dealt with two Native people. American History X, thoughtfully touches - though in a low-key way - upon other races, like the Koreans who 'took over' ownership of the grocery store.When I was in the most racially diverse region of the world (the Caribbean), I observed how interracial marriage both preserves that diversity while creating unity. When a black person marries a white person, one child will come out completely black, one completely white, and one a beautiful mixture between the two. (Blondes and brunettes intermarry and we have not eradicated these hair colours creating an exclusively brown-haired society!)RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGICSome people were understandably upset that the film failed to 'rebut' many of the arguments in favour of the Neo-Nazis. I thought that the brilliance of the film was that it subtly argued that this was futile. Rebuttals on one side are only met with rebuttals on the other and so the argument goes on back and forth endlessly. The arguments at the dinner table with the Elliot Gould character confirmed this. The film showed that reforming a racist is done not through appealing to his mind, his logic, his reason, but through his heart. Those that marvelled in wonderment over Derek's black laundry co-worker befriending him with humour about sex, thinking that it would have been more reasonable for him to argue racial issues failed to see this point I think.The film pointed out how self-defeating the ideals of white supremacy (or supremacy of any race) are by showing how illogical the beliefs are. At one point, the younger brother states that it is best to steer clear away from anyone who is not a White Protestant in the midst of his insisting on doing away with Jews. Of course, the founder of Christianity, a faction of which is Protestantism, was a Jew! Another point that shows how self-defeating their beliefs are is that they want to do away with immigration. But their ancestors, themselves, were immigrants. All whites immigrated to the Americas from Europe. They never asked for permission from the Native people. The characters do take up this point and try to argue that the whites were good immigrants because they built up a great civilisation. But it is crystal clear how weak that argument is.'American History X' shows us that it is nearly futile to try to reform a racist by appealing to his faculty of reason, because his beliefs are not based upon reason, they are based upon emotional hatred. Derek's laundry co-worker began joking about an unrelated issue, an issue which Derek could not argue against and set up defences against his own point of view. The wall of hatred around his heart was penetrated. Blacks and whites actually had something in common that they could laugh about!  The mind can only be righted through appealing to the heart. This is the central message of 'American History X'.NOT INTENDED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDYAnother criticism given to the film was that it was unclear how Derek was led down the path of racism. It was commented that it was initiated by his father using the 'n' word at the dinner table and by the fact that he was murdered by black people. It didn't seem to me that the film was saying that these were the exclusive reasons for Derek's embrace of racist views. It was just pointing out a few of the many fragments off of which he fed along this dark path. 'American History X' was not aspiring to be a psychological study of how people become racists. It was simply revealing the darkness of racial hatred. I'm sure that such a psychological study could not be satisfactorily concluded in a two-hour non-documentary film; it is a complex issue. There is no one cause, and outside incidents are just a pat on the back, because everyone has free will to embrace whatever beliefs he chooses.CONFUSION OF ECONOMIC VERSUS HUMAN ISSUESMany people, also, seem to confuse economic issues with human ones. Racism is not a 'right-wing' issue. 'Right-wing' vs. 'left-wing' are policies of economics. They have to do with such issues of public versus private ownership. A person can embrace the economic theory of capitalism and be a strong proponent of racial equality; while, another can side-with socialism and be a racist.HOW DO YOU REMOVE DARKNESS FROM A ROOM?The film's ending has its pro's and con's. One the one hand, yes, it is conventional, but on the other, it allows the film to leave an emotional impression on the viewer which helps him to reflect on all that he has seen.In conclusion, 'American History X' pointed out to me that hatred ('hate' is the verb, 'hatred' is the noun, please), like darkness, hatred cannot be depleted by attacking it. You can't remove darkness out of a room by shovelling it out, only by turning up the light of love which automatically dispels the darkness away.The films advises that one should always end a piece of writing with a quote, so here's one. It is paraphrased from the sayings of Gandhi:'If you simply take an eye for an eye, it won't be long before the whole world goes blind.' (9 out of 10)",9,0,0,13 April 1999
JFK," The second greatest movie ever made
","Most of what I had to say about this film has already been captured in other users' comments, some of which are excellent reviews. JFK struck me as being mostly about the virtues of truth, courage, and justice - about how precious truth is and how easy it is for people to cower away from it. Some of the dialogue was spectacular: 1. When Garrison is arguing against the theory that JFK was assassinated by the maffia; 2. When he battles with his wife over the importance of his work in order to make the country a better place in which his children can grow up; and 3. His presentation during the trial. When he kept running the tape over and over showing the president's head exploding, I broke down and cried. I couldn't believe that such an event could have been allowed to occur and how the investigation by the officials of one of the cruelest murders in history could have been so sloppily done.Oliver Stone has been criticized for making an over-statement and for weaving fiction into the facts. I found the film 'In the Name of the Father' as an appropriate example, unlike JFK, of 'overstatement' - of how pedantic 'shoving it down your throat' style weakens rather than strengthens the film's message. The fact that one of the most respected and loved world leaders in history was assassinated and no-one knows by whom and why makes it impossible to over-state the drama. I thought that Stone's 'weaving in fiction' is poor criticism. In order to make the film interesting, you could not have the camera following Garrison's reading documents. Instead, you must have dialogue. So, Garrison meets the mysterious Mr. X played by Canadian actor Donald Sutherland. It is acceptable, to me, to have the methods in which facts were discovered fictitious as long as the facts themselves are real. And this is what Stone did.The performances, direction, and editing of this spectacle were first rate and made the film intense to the fullest degree. I also liked the fact that the film focused on the greater issues, touching on other assassinations of the time - Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.. Finally, the fact that the film featured an all-star cast soothed my heart. It was kind of like Hollywood was saying that this atrocity was such a disgrace, 'we're getting our best people to make it known to the world'. 'JFK' is the second greatest movie ever made (right behind 'Lorenzo's Oil'). (10 out of 10)",10,3,16,18 March 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Series with Some Promise Crumbles Like a Tower
","The sequel to the fairly good 'Fellowship of the Ring' falls apart at the seams, as most sequels do. While the irritating close-up of the supposedly powerful ring every ten minutes in the first film is removed, we get a character, more annoying than The Phantom Menace's Jar-Jar Binks, continuously saying 'precious, precious' over and over and over again with a voice like someone scratching their fingernails down a blackboard. I wasn't intrigued by a single line of dialogue nor by any of the wooden characters. This is basically 'The Mummy Returns' linked with what some consider to be classic literature, simply to give it credibility, and devoid of any interesting plot. Here's the plot: 'Oh, look, there are some monsters. Let's go slaughter them. Ah, done. Oh, guess what! Some more monsters! Let's kill them. Oh, and you wouldn't believe it. More monsters...'. Do yourself a favour and go for something with a bit more substance.",5,0,0,5 January 2003
The Piano," Gives the disgusting message: 'It's okay to abuse women'
","'The Piano' gives the message: it's okay to abuse women because they will end up falling in love with you anyway. There have been famous trials where the keepers of 'sex slaves' have held their defense as being that their captors fell in love with them, so what they did was justified. This is the same message that is given by 'The Piano'. In the film, we are supposed to believe that a woman is 'forced' to marry a man that she doesn't care for, as if she had no choice; thus, women are portrayed as animals rather than humans - having no free will. Like the movie 'Radio Flyer' which had abused children overcome their victimization through fantasy, 'The Piano' has the woman take out her frustrations by playing her piano. She insists that it be taken to her new home - a remote location. Her will seems to be strong here, even though we are to believe that her will was not there when 'forced' into marriage. Incidentally, she is mute but obviously not deaf. She further 'escapes' being with her husband by taking piano lessons from a man that begins molesting her - played by one actor who could pull this off (Harvey Keitel). We are given a very clear message that she cannot stand this - which seems right. But, suddenly, she falls in love with him. He is slimy and sleezy. Her husband finds out, but, surprisingly, he doesn't seem to mind - he hides in the piano to watch their goings on. But then he forbids her to see him. She writes him a brief love-note which her husband intercepts and reacts violently to this. Hmmm...he didn't mind watching them in the act, but when he finds out that she writes him a love note, he goes mad? Strange. I won't give away how the story ends; you are probably sick to your stomach already. No film could paint such a degrading view of women. The film is pro macho man and anti-woman. Its only redeeming value is the beautiful music and symbolism of the piano which seems to be the source of all the evil. (2 out of 10)",2,6,12,15 April 1999
The Red Violin," Way to go, Canada!
","While the vast majority of the world's films emerge from the United States, along with a handful from Italy, the U.K., France, and India, a country of only 30 million people, not well known for creating masterpieces in film, has come up with this jewel, 'The Red Violin'. Canada has generated scores of famous actors - Michael J. Fox, Jim Carrey, Donald Sutherland, William Shatner, John Candy, and Neve Campbell to name but a few, but Hollywood's empire of film production has drawn them all down south, while, ironically, so many US films are shot in Canada (especially Vancouver).In the past, Canada made the odd good, low budget film ('Who Has Seen the Wind', 'The Grey Fox') but in the past decade, its government has been setting more funds aside for the development of its entertainment and culture industry. The result has been the creation of about one very good film per year ('Decline of the American Empire', 'Jesus of Montreal', 'Black Robe', 'Exotica', and 'The Sweet Hereafter' to name a few).Just as Canadian film-makers borrowed England's Helena Bonham Carter in making 'Margaret's Museum', the latest Canadian creation - 'The Red Violin' - features a well known US actor - Samuel L. Jackson. Perhaps 'we' have done this as a drawing card to attract attention to great films that, because they are Canadian made, run the danger of passing unnoticed outside of the country.I glowed after watching this heart-galvanizing spectacle of beauty out of slight feelings of humble patriotism, seeing that my country really is capable of landing a winner in the movie making game. Everything is likable about 'The Red Violin' - great acting, dialogue, production, cinematography, music (score), compelling characters, and interesting stories woven together into a work of art. And, just think, this was pulled off without Hollywood's gargantuan enterprise of talent, experience, and funding. WAY TO GO, EH!",Null,1,1,30 June 1999
Pulp Fiction," Empty, Sick, and Disgusting
","'Pulp Fiction' along with 'The Piano', 'The Crying Game', and 'Terms of Endearment' is one of the most overrated movies ever made. The Americans sure love their violence. This one glorifies it to the nth degree. Harvey Keitel gives another low-life performance. The plot is empty drizzle. There is no resolve either good or bad at the end of the film. It is empty, sick, and disgusting. There is no theme. The dialogue is made for skin-heads as Bruce Willis' hair style in the film confirms. And Uma Thurman's famous head-shaking scene is ultra silly.",5,2,6,15 April 1999
Blade Runner," An Artistic Masterpiece
","Well, with 70 user comments already, I feel intimidated to add one, but there are a few things I HAVE to say about this masterpiece. 'Blade Runner' was unrecognised and the recipient of very mixed reviews by critics when it first hit the cinemas in 1982. It was the first big sci-fi film since 'Star Wars' and its sequels and was unjustly compared to these very different kinds of sci-fi movies. It is only recently that it has been recognised as a great film. Its original soundtrack was unavailable until recently as well.I remember watching the Academy Awards and being disappointed by the nominations and the results. Didn't Vangelis' ('Chariots of Fire', 'Missing') deserve a nod for best film score? 'Blade Runner' was nominated for best visual effects and, as usual, the Academy went for the SENTIMENTAL favourite, much less deserving of an Oscar. 'Blade Runner' had virtually a whole city created by a computer (computer graphics weren't as easy to generate back in 1982!) while, the winner of the Oscar, 'E.T.', simply had some kids ride bicycles in the air.'Blade Runner' was not a film with a complicated and original plot with surprises and twists randomising the heart-rate of the viewer sitting propped up on the edge of his seat. Nor did the film have intensive dialogue and interesting characters. Its plot was simple. Its script was concise (although there are some memorable lines). Its characters were somewhat plain (except, perhaps, for J.F. Sebastian). But all these were meant to be, for Blade Runner was not intended to be a high-powered drama; it was meant to be an artistic masterpiece, a film about ambience and atmosphere, a film directed at creating particular moods in the viewer, a film intended to dazzle the eye and exhilarate the ear. And it succeeded at these aims marvellously. It is art and film noir at its best.A gloomy, dark, rainy, depressing Los Angeles, in the future, is the scene of a 'blade runner' assigned to bump off rebellious 'replicants' - artificial life forms created for slave labour in space. The film opens with columns of fire spouting into the air next to flying automobiles and chillingly smooth melodic synthesisers from the composer Vangelis. It is crowded, smoky, and various ethnic languages have melded together in the local Creole dialect. I liked the idea, also, of the umbrella stems being fluorescent lights.'Blade Runner' seemed to be a blessing on the actors that played in it; for, many unknowns became famous after the film and had the good fortune of winning roles in blockbusters. Rutger Hauer who plays the leader of the replicants became well known and starred in 'The Hitcher'. Sean Young, until this film, unknown, appeared in such films as 'Dune', 'Wall Street', and 'No Way Out' with Kevin Costner. Darryl Hannah, another unknown, made it big in 'Splash', 'Roxanne', and teamed up with Sean Young again in 'Wall Street'. Edward James Olmos emerged from obscurity and acquired the role of the police chief in TV's Miami Vice series. He won a number of Emmy Awards. William Sanderson became 'Larry' of 'Larry, Darrel and my other brother Darrel' in the TV series Newhart.I was sorely disappointed with the Director's cut of the film. One would expect a D-Cut to ADD footage, but footage was only removed - Rick Deckard's voiced over dubbing, the ending, and so on. All that was added was some silly dream of a unicorn. LEAVE THE ORIGINAL CUT ALONE!!! The D-Cut took away from the film's charm. Again: Leave the original cut alone! Why mess with it? DON'T!I wish that more films were made in a similar spirit to 'Blade Runner'. Recently, 'Dark City' re-captured some of its charm of it but lacked much of the old 'Blade Runner magic', a great score to name but one lacking element. I give 'Blade Runner' 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,26 April 1999
