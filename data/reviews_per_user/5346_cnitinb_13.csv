Black Swan," I felt it...it was perfect
","Black Swan directed by Darren Aronofsky is on surface a horror , at another level deeper it is a psychological thriller and at the core level it is an insightful tale about the ultimate question, are we embodiments of both evil and good? Nina Saywers(Natalie Portman) is a ballet dancer who wins the role of the 'Swan Queen' in the 'Swan lake' staging. Her role requires her to don the role of both the pure virgin-white swan and her evil counterpart the Black swan. Her tutor Thomas Leyroy(cassel) points out that she is perfect for the White swan but fails to connect with the evil role. Nina makes a conscious attempt to accept and 'feel' the Black swan, but soon she realizes that it's not just a role anymore and the dark side of her begins to appear in real life. Mila kunis plays the role of colleague- Lily in whom Nina sees the 'Black Swan' and begins to get insecure. Kunis excellently portrays her role and keeps you guessing about her actual intentions. Cassel portrays a character with shades of gray and shines through. Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother is convincing. But the show stealer is of course the protagonist Portaman, who's powerful and enigmatic performance will grip the viewer from the beginning of the film and only leaves your mind long after the ending. The plot as mentioned before has many layers to it,but what makes this movie work is that no matter at what level you perceive the film, it is still hugely entertaining and satisfying. At times the film feels chaotic and crazy but the jewel in the crown is the ending that is both convincing yet open for an interpretation. Black swan definitely is a classic and if not for anything else , it will be remembered for Portman's preeminent performance.",8,0,1,22 May 2011
Iron Man 3," Tony faces terminator(like bad guys) and has panic attacks!
","Director Shane Black's Iron Man 3 begins in a flashback, in the year 1999, when Tony stark is just being himself and ends up sleeping with a scientist and disappointing another. This sets up a very interesting prologue to what could have a been an amazing adaption of the 'Extremis' comic series. It does manage to keep you entertained till the end (post credits in fact) and later if a realization sneaks in on you that maybe it wasn't all that memorable, you are not alone. The movie has two super villains, the Mandrin (a well know character in the comics) played expertly by Sir Ben Kingsley and Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce) the 'Extremis'( a regeneration technology) scientist. Strangely enough the latter turns out to be more menacing in the end, in this nerd-turns-super villain yarn that is not entirely original. Even the extremis goons and Killian himself will definitely remind you of those famous killer machines with regenerating powers. (read: Terminators)The protagonist Tony stark is having a personal crisis post 'Avengers initiative' after facing 'gods', aliens and a Hulk'. The Aliens(Chitauri) have not only physically drained him but have crept into his nightmares causing anxiety disorder. His girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) has taken over the reins of the company again, but it is evident that Tony's insomnia and stress has taken a toll on their relationship. The creators have tried to include the famous comic arc in a way that might have seemed creative on paper, satisfying both the comic geeks and the rest of the movie goers, but in execution, something goes amiss. It is hard to pin point what exactly is lacking, the action scenes, especially the one involving the sky dive from the air force one, is jaw droppingly good. The characterizations have more dept. Last year we saw a billionaire face his deepest fears, suffer thoroughly only to 'rise' a hero again (but he gives it all up in the end) , this year we see another billionaire go through pretty much the same thing . Pepper Potts is joined by Maya Hansen(Rebecca Hall) as the co female lead and both their characters are fairly well sketched. The plot has a good many twists too, yet there is something very evidently formulaic. One particular surprise is momentarily amusing but ultimately turns into a huge disappointment, it will seem like major character and a versatile actor were simply unused. Usually a movie with the above mentioned faults will collapse like a poorly constructed tower and disappear into oblivion, but not Marvel's Iron Man 3. There won't be a free moment to dwell on the missteps, for the movie runs at break neck speed throwing an action sequence one moment, clever but emotional scenes like the one involving tony stark and a smart ten year old kid, in another. It is a pure entertainer from start to finish pulsing with mind blowing CGI and witty one liners one would expect from an iron man film. Although it should be mentioned that the post processing 3D here looks nowhere as good as the Avengers did. So in the end, complaining that Iron man 3 is not thought provoking or dark enough is just inane. This is no Nolan flick. It is a vibrant and deeply engrossing summer blockbuster from Marvel who should be praised for trying to bring out the human side of iron man while making it completely worthwhile. Looking forward to the next marvel movie this fall, just hoping the God of thunder doesn't come back with anxiety issues. Damn you Aliens!",7,1,4,27 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Fast, Flawed yet Fun Sci-fi Adventure of the Starship Enterprise
","There is a line that protagonist, Captain Kirk says in this movie- 'I don't know what I am supposed to do but I know what I need to do'. Director J.J Abrams clearly felt the same while helming the sequel to the 2009 reboot hit Star Trek.There is everything in this movie that is 'needed' for it to be successful. The old crew is back, there is meaner villain and the special effects are simply astounding. The post processed 3D is surprisingly complementary to the CGI. In fact it is safe to say this is the best looking sci-fi movie ever and the fact that it is a stark trek film seems fitting. However the endearing element of 'adventure' which is intrinsic for a star trek feature seems grossly deficient. The USS enterprise crew is tasked to hunt down a terrorist named John Harrison. It initially seems like a simple retribution mission to avenge the death of innocents. However startling events unfold that threatens to wreck the space ship and the crew. There is a constant sense of peril throughout. It works for some time but then resolutions are slapped out so rapidly that by climax, you will probably know how it will end. Chris Pine as James T Kirk takes the best parts from his original character(leaving behind the cringe worthy overacting from his 60's counterpart), Scotty played by Simon peg takes up most of the screen time among the supporting cast. To his credit, he does a fine job and deserves it. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as ever, sportively playing 'Uhura', a side kick and lover to Spock. Karl Urban as the favorite interstellar surgeon Dr. McCoy(Bones) seems to be mostly paying a homage to DeForest Kelly(60's) Bones, complete with 'Dammit! I am a doctor not a torpedo specialist' line and the trademark one eyebrow raise. Alice eve(Dr. Marcus) is quite forgettable while John Cho as Sulu & Yeltin as Chekov all play their roles remarkably well.But the star of the show is Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock. Qunito proves in his second outing that he is this generation's finest Vulcan. He balances the role perfectly by playing tribute to Nimoy's spock(60's) and bringing in his own originality in a perfect mix. Cumberbatch as the villain(by now everyone knows which role he actually plays!) initially seems miscast considering the race , accent etc. but all that can be forgotten when he says 'I will walk on your cold corpses' in an eerie sociopathic tone.(Reminds one of Alan Rickman's villainous roles).This is a non-Trekkie review. I have seen a couple of the original episodes and some movies and don't care if a Klingon pronunciation is wrong. But I am a sci-fi junkie and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Spock would probably comment 'This film is going to be a blockbuster, logically'. But we humans would enjoy it a little more if the emotional scenes weren't so forced and there was a bit more of the 'going boldly where no man has gone before' parts.",7,6,16,11 May 2013
Life of Pi," A visually opulent triumph of film-making!
","Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!",9,215,295,22 November 2012
Prisoners," A riveting slow burner
","The Dovers a religious family meet up for thanksgiving lunch over at the Birches, their friendly neighbor. Both families have two children, a teen and a kid. By evening the two kids go missing. A creepy looking young man who had his RV parked outside is the main suspect. Detective Loki(Gyllenhaal), an efficient investigator with cent percent solve rate is assigned to the case. However there is nothing that ties the suspect to the missing girls...or is there? Did Dover(Jackman) pick up something the police couldn't? Could this father with anger issues be right after all? Morality is put to test when strong suspicions become motive for vigilante investigation. Soon Winter approaches and the case is tuning cold with dead-end leads.Thriller lovers rejoice, the dry spell for suspense masterpieces ends with prisoners. With stellar performances from the entire cast topped off with a compelling portrayal of Keller Dover by Hugh Jackman, Prisoners is 150 minutes well spent.Make no mistake this is NOT a fast paced thriller with action sequences and multiple twists. Prisoners is a slow burner that tightens the tension steadily and by climax the pressure hits the roof. The aha moment when Dover puts all the pieces in place and the consequences that follow is simply a stroke of genius from writer Aaron Guzikowski.A good suspenseful plot can be occasionally seen in an episode of a procedural TV show. Terrific acting from an ensemble cast is usually a part of an award bait drama and then rarely comes the amalgamation of both resulting in an 'Argo' or a 'Silence of the lambs'. Prisoners definitely belongs among these classics and hopefully will be duly awarded not only for the performances but for the direction and writing that transforms a decent story into a terrific movie.",8,1,1,29 September 2013
Elysium," A generic sci-fi movie, low on thrills and intelligence
","Neill Blomkamp's Elysium starts off with a moderately interesting yet not completely original premise. Its 2154 and earth is in a nearly dilapidated state. The rich have moved on to a Utopian space station called Elysium where exists a nearly magical device that can cure any disease while the poor remain on earth still struggling to make ends meet and dying of various illnesses. One such orphan Max(Damon)a dreams of visiting Elysium before he dies. Events at the factory he works for, force him to take drastic measures to make his dream come true. Jodie Foster plays the antagonist Delacourt and sadly its one of her worst roles ever. Her character is a caricature villain who exterminates poor sick people while trying to become more powerful and with the corny lines written for her,there is not much of a performance she can muster. Another antagonist in the film who is far more menacing is Kruger, a psychotic mercenary played impressively by Sharlto Copley, who was the protagonist of Blomkamp's fantastic debut district 9. Although the pacing of the movie is good there is an inherent fatigue in the way the vaguely familiar plot unfolds. Throw in a female lead who is a childhood friend of Max who somehow gets entangled in his messed up life and a child who mouths off kiddish tales that you know will somehow reflect the movie's ending, the film drivels towards the predictable climax. Although the freshness and trenchant tone of his earlier film is largely missing, the realistic CGI that blends with the somber looking backdrop is back and is quite impressive. However CGI is only a part of sci-fi genre which makes this film only partly worth the time and money. All I can say is if your in a mood for a film that involves trashed out earth and a man made space abode, hey there is the infinitely better WALL-E!",5,2,4,28 September 2013
Inception," A Classic, wickedly clever and Mesmerizing
","An extractor is person who can steal your 'subconscious idea'. Its a world where you can enter, exit and connect the dreams of you and others. An architect is required to 'build' the settings around in a dream, a 'forger' can shape shift into a known person in your dream, a 'kick' or a violent stimulus is required to pull you out of a dream and finally a quaint object like a top is called a 'totem', a device that helps to distinguish dream and reality, a device that keeps you sane. WOW! Welcome to the world of 'Inception' created by a genius called Christopher Nolan. The movies starts off with an intriguing scene that forms a part of the climax and then flashes back to the past. All the concepts stated above is explained wasting no time as the plot proceeds, resulting in a smooth and a superb narrative that has you hooked. This time an extractor called Cobb has to plant an idea into a company heir-Fischer(Murphy), to dissolve his company. cobbs is aided by Arthur(Levitt), Ariadne(Page) the architect and Eames(Hardy)a forger, Yusuf(Rao) in charge of sedation and their recruiter Saito(Watanabe). What follows is their pulse racing adventure into 4 levels of dreams i.e dreams within dreams in order to achieve what was though to be impossible-An 'Inception'. Trying to stop this mission are the 'military projections' of Fischer, that are like 'white Blood cells' trying to kill the 'foreign bodies' that are saito's crew. Also Mal Cobb, Cobb's dead wife haunts his memory threatening to make the entire mission an epic fail. Cobb needs to complete the mission but to do so he also needs to end his inner demons of guilt associated with his personal life. The CGI is breathtaking and completely appropriate, the actors all do a fine job and DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his carrier. Some Parts of the plot aren't easily understood. They are like a puzzle you know you will solve if u have just give another try. Basically it's a movie that does something that others rarely do...it makes you think! In conclusion, Inception is a classic no doubt, its so wickedly clever and unique that you will be proud you liked it.",10,2,6,7 August 2010
Despicable Me," Animation -good, 3D-impressive, Story-good, But nothing new...
","Despicable me is a story about a Villain name 'Gru' who wants to be at he top of his profession, by stealing the moon! His only competitor is a nerdy villain called 'vector' who steals a shrinking machine from Gru. The machine is required for stealing the moon. So Gru adopts three orphan girls who sell cookies to get inside 'Vector's super-protected mansion and uses them in his plan to get back the machine. But then what will he do with them later? Can a super villain be a father? What follows is an adventure that is mostly predictable , although it is enjoyable in every way. The three girls are indeed very cute and Steve carell does a fine job in giving life to Gru. The 3D is impressive if not breathtaking. It's only the story that lags slightly in the beginning although funny dialogues and loads of slapstick humor make up for it.In Conclusion, it is understandable if 'Despicable me' is not appealing to all adults. However it is definitely a movie that should be in the top part of a list of 'Good family flicks' to watch on a Sunday.",7,2,5,8 August 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," A fabulous Rising of the silent guardian for one last time!
","In the first film of director Christopher Nolan's Batman series, Bruce Wayne's father asks him ' Why do we fall Bruce? ' and answers 'So we can learn to pick ourselves up', these wise words form the theme for this grand finale . It is a completely satisfying and a respectable send off to the resurrected franchise.When an incredible film like 'The dark knight' is a sequel, then the follow up movie would have expectations so high, that it's often never met. It would be extremely unfair to the director when media hypes up such a film and the paparazzi go on frenzy every time there is an outdoor shoot.The Dark knight rises clearly went through all of this. Yet, it manages to please the fans and unlike the 'forced third' of some franchises it feels like a vital continuation and a meaningful conclusion to the batman story. Bruised and retired as the batman for seven years, Bruce Wayne limps through his manor and watches helplessly as the sassy thief Selina Kyle, steals his mother's pearls. There is a new embodiment of evil in Gotham called Bane who is equal amounts brain and brawn. This forces the Dark knight out of his retirement and plunges him into a dark, gritty and personal fight against anarchy. The past haunts him and the future is ominous while the present sees him separated from the handful of people who care for him. This is perhaps the most emotional and hard hitting Batman story that the Nolan Bother's clearly meant as a Frank Miller tribute. The movie runs for a lengthy 2 hour 45 minutes but it never feels slow. Action scenes have the Nolan signature and is edge-of-the-seat guaranteed. New characters like Miranda Tate, Selina Kyle(never called the 'cat woman') and Detective John Blake are seamlessly integrated into Nolan's Gotham and although many would like to, it would be inane to compare Bane to the joker. Although both of them wanted mayhem, Joker stood as a benchmark for just how low and treacherous the mind of a modern man can fall while Bane stands for how far a deeply wounded man would go to seek warped justice through revulsion & vengeance. Although Hardy gives a fine presentation, he may not seem as good as Heath Ledger simply because his character was differently written.If nit picking for the sake of a balanced review must be done then the only flaw one can find is the pacing of movie was uneven at times.All actors seem to be perfectly in tune with their characters; Christian Bale gives his best performance and a fitting swan song to the iconic character while Anne Hathaway shines the most amongst the new cast, leaving the audience wanting more of her screen time. Gary Oldman as Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred and Freeman and Lucius Fox are some of the finest supporting roles both in terms of the deep characterization and their performance. The Batman franchise is definitely up for a reboot in the near future but Chris Nolan's Batman would probably be the most realistic and gritty version ever. The Dark knight rises may not surpass its predecessor but it is still going to be a modern classic and that for a super-hero movie is a Plaudible feat.",9,1,5,20 July 2012
Toy Story 3," The Toy-gang, 3D, A Prison Break, A Classic Ending.
","Toy Story was a movie that reintroduced Animated Movies to the mass audience, way back in 1995. Now 15 years later comes a movie when animated movies are plenty, most of them fail to charm us like they once used to and a time when sequels are rarely good as the originals.A few months back, I concluded(rather hastily) that this year no animated movie can beat 'How to train your Dragon' and was almost sure of it after seeing the latest Shrek. But then who would have though the good old woody-Buzz-and-the-toy-gang in their third installment would change all that with a gripping plot, brilliant graphics, right amount of humor and a superb ending that would make sure you will remember the toys for a long , long time.Andy, the kid had grown up to become a teenager. He's going to college and decides to bundle up his favorite toys in the attic. But 'fate' has a different idea for the toy gang and they end up (along with Barbie)at a daycare. Initially it looks like a homely daycare but it turns out to be far from that. A couple of charming new characters, neat script and an immensely fun adventure will ensure you forget all your worries and enjoy the next one and a half hour.Finally,The ending is the best seen in any animated movie that will leave you totally satisfied and hoping that a couple of years later the toy gang would return to surprise the box office and make one other day just awesome for you .",9,1,2,28 June 2010
Identity," An underrated masterpiece, oh so good!
","In 1991, there was silence of the lambs, then in 1995, there was copycat and Seven, 2003 was the year of this phenomenal masterpiece. Its quite unfortunate that this movie is often never compared or mentioned with the others.The movie starts as two side plot , one dealing with a psychiatrist, Dr.Malick(Alfred Molina) saving his patient from death sentence and the other one involves a group of people stuck in a rain storm at a motel , fighting off and fending themselves from...a killer! The two plots are connected , how exactly? Unfortunately that cannot be revealed here without spoiling the plot.The story is completely engrossing and this is one such perfect edge of the seat thriller that will tighten the screws so hard and to such an extent to drive the viewer crazy and hungry for a solution. Unlike many thrillers the ending here is the best part of the story and will leave you completely satisfied and at the same time in a state of shock.Quite honestly, Identity should be place not just among the above mentioned classics , but a level higher with Hitchcock's psycho and vertigo. All thriller lovers, don't ever miss this..grab your copy of Home video today!",9,0,1,12 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A swift and a splendid swan song.
","Harry potter and the Deathly hallows Part 2 starts off the very next second the part 1 ended. Yet somehow, everything looks a tone murkier and creepy , maybe it was the haunting music or maybe it was the 3D. But to make one thing clear the 3D here is done just right. Its not distracting but its not even Avartarisque.The trio continue their journey to find the Horcruxes while the once safe heaven-Hogwarts is eventually under attack by Voldemort. The entire 2 hours runs really fast, filled with splendid action sequences and plot twists all ending in a fitting climax.Radcliff , Watson and Grint give earnest performances.Most supporting characters from the previous seven films return, at least for a cameo. Its is no doubt that amongst them it its Alan Rickman as Severus Snape who stands out with his best performance till date. A flash back sequence involving him is one of the finest moments in the film that the audience will remember for a long time.The only thing the movie allows us to complain about is the 'pace'. Its moves at such fast pace that you cannot help feeling that the ending seemed a tad rushed. There is not enough time to feel sad about certain deaths nor will you find time to cheer as a death eater falls. But probably its the price to pay for 3D. Too long and it might have taxed your eyes too much, to take the attention away from the plot. So the fault could easily be forgotten.In conclusion, Many potter fans felt the third film was the best of the lot, but Deathly hallows part 2 easily dethrones it. Director Yates must be commended for not getting tired of the series and giving it a respectable, memorable and most of the all the most enjoyable swan song.",9,0,1,16 July 2011
The Social Network," A Fincher classic
","The social Network directed by David Fincher is the story behind the pillar of our social lives- Facebook. It claims to dramatize the 'events' that took place in developing 'facebook'. Mark Zukerberg(Eisenberg) , just after being dumped by his girlfriend and drunk ,defames her on his blog, he later creates facemash.com a portal to rate and compare university girls based on their looks. All this leads to a lot of flak from others and then an idea. The idea that will become the most used social networking platform, ever. But this 'idea' is built on with the help of the winklevoss twins(Hammer) and funded by his best friend Eduardo(Garfield). But a few years later we see Zukerberg at a court being sued by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo. The film is about the events that led to the case.We all know this, the real Zukerberg claimed the film is almost entirely fiction while the makers claimed its entirely true and only 'dramatized'. This very difference of opinion made millions to want to watch this movie. But all that apart, 'the social network' is another Fincher classic. Fabulous performance from Eisenberg and Garfield , also Timberlake was surprisingly convincing as the cunning and suave entrepreneur-Sean parker. The perfect casting is the highlight of this movie and a great screenplay(by Aron Sorkin) complements it. The dialogues are smart yet they don't seem dramatic, the pace of the film never makes any moment of this two hour flick seem boring.And so it really doesn't matter if its fiction or completely real, the events in 'the social network' is something you will remember often , when you 'add a friend' or 'like' a comment on facebook simply because a 25 billion dollar company that puts wheels' our social lives couldn't have been made for the silver screen in a better and classy way.",8,1,2,15 January 2011
