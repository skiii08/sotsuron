Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the stupidest movie I ever saw
","Anyone can say anything, this movie is even stupider than a Japanese cartoon (like PokÃ©mon)! The story is idiot, some characters are EVEN STUPIDER THAN TELETUBBIES! For example, Jar-Jar Binks, who is an idiot, crazy, characteristic-less frog with long tongue. Or Darth Maul who is a red, horned devil in black robe (and he is the FRIGHTENING bad guy?!). And some scenes are even worse, like when the two Jedi Knights visiting the 'frog king' or when the boy genius Anakin races in the pod race (and wins!!!). These scenes are just in the movie to become a 2 hours long child story. I am a hard-core Trekkie, but also I know what is bad. And this IS bad!",1,1,3,17 October 2002
The Pianist," Movie for thinking people
","Although the movie itself is quite cheap and the make-up and special effects are poor, the story itself and the cast is great. This movie is FAR better than the Pearl Harbor-type action films, showing WW2 as a heroic fight with a lots of explosions and gunfights, it shows us the real fight, the fight for survival. A dramatic masterpiece, The Pianist is perfect for people who like watching films not because they want an hour and half of blood and fight to have fun and then forgot it. It is for the ones who want to see history with the eyes of a victim of war. Adrian Brody is a great actor, wanna see more of him!!!",9,0,1,21 October 2003
