The Blair Witch Project," What is suggested is much more terrifying than what is shown...
","There are pretty much two types of horror movies these days: 1) the too-hip for their own good teenagers running around in a self-conscious kid oriented slasher flick kind, and 2) the 'Alien' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' direct to video rip-offs starring eighties cop shows and sitcom stars and talk-show hosts that usually contain one word in the title that is reminiscent from the latest horror theatrical hit(see 1) and is chock full of every cinematic cliche in the book. So imagine my suprise when the cast and crew of 'The Blair Witch Project' created one of the most terrifying movies ever made. This movie works for many different reasons. One is that it brings terror to the average person again, which most classic horror movies do. Another is the fantastic and believable acting by the three main actors, which makes their descent into horror even more scary. But the main reason is the terror is suggested and the three filmakers stalker is never shown, making people use their imagination. This movie proves that a man's imagination is a lot scarier than the average gorefest.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
Vertigo," Mysterious, intriguing, and interesting...
","Some think of this film as longish, and while it is, you rarely notice it because you are being drawn into James Stewart's obsession which is like being taken to a different world. Hitch portrays Stewart's character as sympathetic, but disturbed enough to try to remake his lost love in another woman. It is absorbing and intriguing, and kind of a mystery until the last half of the film. 5/5 stars.",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fantastic movie, but it does have some flaws...
","When I wrote my first review for Episode 1 on this site, it had been a week since I saw the movie. I had seen it opening night, with all the fanatics. People had lightsabers and were whooping and hollering and clapping and cheering...it was the best experience I had ever had at the movies. Well, when I wrote my first review, I still was coming off that high. I was all pumped up and wrote a quick, four line review. One week later, I saw the movie again. 'Fantastic,' I thought,'were those critics who disliked this movie on crack?' After a few months I decided to see the movie again. Then, I started to see a few flaws, but hey, it's Star Wars, it's great anyway. I saw it once more and noticed even more flaws. And now that the Summer has faded(sniff), I can look back and take a better perspective on the whole ordeal.It breaks down like this: 	Acting: The acting, overall, is good. Liam Neeson does great, and is obviouosly trying not to be overwhelmed and overshadowed by the F/X. Ewan McGreggor is good, but Obi-Wan isn't really as big of a character as expected. Natalie Portman is pretty stale as Queen Amidala, but is better as Padme. Jake Lloyd is good some of the times, but sometimes he isn't, and makes Anakin seem a little too modern. But overall he isn't bad. Sam Jackson brings a good touch to the movie in his cameo, and I hope to see more of him in Episode 2. Terrence Stamp is also good in his small but important role as Chancellor Valorum. Like I said, the acting, overall, is good, but you get the impression that these actors could do these roles in their sleep.	Direction: George Lucas directs the action sequences with skill and craft, especially the lighstaber duel at the end and the pod racing scene. The Gungan-droid battle is also well directed. The space-battle scene is exciting and looks great, but is a bit too short.	The Score: The score is great! Very faced past and classical, and it fits the mood of the characters.	The F/X: The F/X is terrific. The best ever in a movie.
	Jar Jar: Jar Jar is actually the most fleshed-out character in the whole movie. He definately isn't racist, and is actually pretty funny most of the time.	Overall it is a great movie, and I hope I didn't over analyze it. I 'm already counting down the days to Episode 2. 4/5 stars.",10,0,0,26 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Spectacular; don't let the cynics get you down.
","To use a cliche, words cannot describe this movie. So let me just tell you, when the Lucasfilm logo appears, and the Star Wars title comes on, I had the biggest grin of all time on my face. Chances are, you will too. 5/5 stars.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Wow!
","When I first saw this film, I had no idea it would be the greatest action film of all time. But when that big ball starts rolling down, ready to topple our cocky hero Indiana Jones, Spielberg had me to the end of the film and hours after that. Indiana Jones is a daredevil archeologist who will do anything and everything to get the piece of history he is after. But when the U.S. government asks him to get the Ark of the Covenant before the nazis do, he may just be in over his head. The movie takes you and our hero from an African jungle, San Francisco, and to the blistering sands of Cairo. And the only time the camera slows down is for a little comic relief is for a little comic relief from Indy's ex-girlfriend who wants to find out why Indy dumped her all those years ago. For those of you who haven't seen it (who are few and far between), drop what you are doing and see it immediately.",Null,0,0,16 April 1999
Ed Wood," 'Worst film you ever saw. Well I'm sure my next one will be much better.'
","Tim Burton. He's a great storyteller. The first two Batman movies were well directed and nicely performed by its stars, and had some other good elements. Edward Siscorhands was very poetic and good, and Depp was terrificly sympathetic as the protagonist. I loved The Nightmare Before Christmas and I think it is one of the best animated films of all time. Mars Attacks! was very comical and I seemed to enjoy it more than everybody else did(though I would have liked to see stop-montion flying saucers).But he was born to direct this movie. This movie is so offbeat and so oddly comical it could have only been done by him. And throughout this film you can see clearly that Burton understands Ed Wood. Any other director given this script (and an excellent script it is) would have rewritten and made fun of Ed Wood. They would have scoffed at him and lobotimized the character for laughs. But not Burton. He plays Ed's relationships with the other characters so well. Ed befriending a dying Bela Lugosi is very well done. Not too gushing with emotions but not too rigid, he plays it like they're friends. Bela is played superbly by Martin Landau. Bela knows the movies he's making are not the high quality pieces he was making in the thirties, but he's happy he's getting work and that somebody has faith in him enough to put him in one of their movies. That somebody is as big a fan of Bela's as Ed is. Ed's the shining light in old Bela's life.And Ed. Somebody knew there was a story in Ed Wood. You feel sorry for the guy, knowing he's gonna turn out to be a porn director. An average Joe who wears Angora sweaters and is so upbeat he doesn't let pesky little things like huge executives denying him a movie. And that's where the movie succeeds the most. Ed's such a likeable guy. In the movie, there's not a mean-spirited bone in his body. He'd never back-stab one of his friends. And Johnny Depp. He's great. He's been a great actor before, but has always played a deadpan personality, but in this he's over the top and very comical.On one last note, there's on great shining star in this movie: Bill Murray. He has a good time playing Bunny Breckinridge, the homosexual sex-change-wannabe.All in all a great comedy. I hope I didn't make it to serious sounding, because really it's a great comedic film. The movie is just downright, out-and-out funny.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
Ghostbusters," Terrific
","The 1984 film 'Ghostbusters' was my favorite film while I was a small child, and it remains to be to this day. It is a great combination of comedy, horror, romance, and exciting, eye-popping special effects that would make George Lucas envious. Bill Murray's sarcastic persona is at its best here, and proves that with a witty script, provided by co-stars Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, he can do almost anything. And after 100+ viewings, I still get a humongous grin on my face after I see that certain 'monster' stomp down that chaotic New York City street.",10,0,0,12 April 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," A great flick.
","Man, this is just what horro fans wanted. Like any other Tarantino film, this one respectively winks and nods to the past, but rockets ahead to new directions. Cliches could, in this situation, come out of every scene, but don't. For instance, in the scene after the big bar room brawl, the heroes are discussing vampires. Instaed of saying 'Oh, I don't believe in vampires,' they get right down to the point and come to terms with it. 	Robert Rodriguez's guirella-style film making is great here, with a high-budget. The actors really do a good job, too. The special effects crew are really allowed to go all out here in the fight scenes. It was also nice seeing special FX guru Tom Savini make an appearence. His role, especially when he is in a fight scene, reminded me of his biker role from Dawn of the Dead. 	 I'm glad this has found a well-deserved home on video. It deserves it.",Null,0,0,17 March 2000
Psycho," A horror masterpiece
","This is one of the most well-crafted horror film of all time. I can't say much about this film that hasn't already been said, so I'll just say it is eerie, suspenseful, and well-told. With this, Hitchcock became one of the best directors ever. 5/5 stars.",Null,38,74,28 July 1999
Jaws," One of the best horror films of all time!
","This is a tense, scary film. It features absorbing characters sporting realistic dialouge. And it also features a huge, fake looking shark named Bruce. But due to Steven Spielberg's directing(or is that Verna Field's editing?) Bruce is only shown a few times and the film relies on the viewers imagination for the real scares. It is kind of like a B-movie directed by Hitchcock. Coincidentally, John Williams' music is reminescent of Bernard Hermann's work. 5/5 stars.",Null,0,1,26 July 1999
Halloween," Shocking masterpiece
","This film inspired so many horrid rip-offs (including its own mindless sequels) that most mainstream audiences overlook it, but it is one of the best horror films of all time. The story is pretty familiar now, nothing more than a psycho killing teens, but John Carpenter relies on visual scares and turns this into a masterpiece of suspense. 5/5 stars.",Null,0,0,29 July 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the classics, but it has gotten a bad name
","Only in the 80s could a psycho child killer become a pop-culture icon. Of course I am talking about Freddy Kruger. There were Freddy dolls, Freddy magazines, Freddy rip-offs, and even a Freddy music video. Of course, there were those sequels, where ol' Fred made sarcastic remarks and became the viewpoint character.	So nowadays, whenever you ask somebody whether or not they like A Nightmare on Elm Street, they shake their heads in disgust and say something to the effect of, 'Boy, Freddy sure did get old after a while.' Well, any child's hero who becomes as over-exposed as he was would get old after a while.
	But they must not remember this one. This one was intense and shadowy, and Wes Craven really used his idea to full effect. The murder scenes are grueling and bloody. Freddy didn't make lame remarks like he did in the others. The teenagers in this movie are better developed and more memorable than any of those dimwitted oafs in Friday the 13th.	If all you think of when you hear the name Freddy Kruger is the abominable Freddy's Rap, you need to see this horror classic. It ranks up there with Evil Dead.",Null,0,0,9 October 1999
The Matrix," A WILD EXPERIENCE!!!!
","This movie is mind-bending. It's mind-warped. It's mind-blowing. It's... well it's this: Aliens+ The Terminator+ Star Wars+ comic books+ John Woo+ Anime, but, it's not just a plodded out re-hash of all these things. It's a well-thought-out, well-constructed action/sci-fi cyberpunk epic with fantastic visual sequences. It is the ultimate 90's movie-geek movie. 5/5 stars.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," You've seen it, you know how good it is...
","Usually, people write reviews to tell the ups and downs of a movie so another person can decide whether or not it is their type of film that they would enjoy. I'm sure, if you're reading this, that you have seen this movie, whether it be on T.V., Video, or on the big screen. So I don't know why anyone now would want to write a review of Star Wars. But I'll try. No, I'll do, or do not there is no try. This film revolutionized movies, some say for the worse. But can anyone blame the stupidity and god-awfulness of Batman and Robin on the  coolness of this movie? Star Wars is an old pulp-inspired serial treated with respect. Those old films were never given something as original as a lightsaber. George Lucas dosen't treat this anything more than it is, but at the same time, there is an underlying religious and mythic aspect to the film. Luke goes through the same transformation as Bilbo Baggins and other epic characters have gone through. He is reluctant to go on his mission at first, but through a series of events he is thrust into the center of action. He mets the guardian father-like figure in Ben Kenobi, the doubter in Han Solo, and the evil personified character in Darth Vader. In this particular film, he is whiney and naive, in the second film he is the learner, and in the third film he, finally becomes a hero and is a Jedi master. But I've already gotten too preachy. This may be a theological and mythic film, but it also is fast paced and fum from the get-go. What I'm trying to say is that it is the link between classic and summer action blockbuster. If you haven't seen it...oh...never mind.",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
Back to the Future," A modern classic.
","This movie is a delightful romp that ranks as one of the best recent fantasy films(along with Ghostbusters and Raiders of the Lost Ark). It doesn't suffer from an annoying, too-hip teenage protagonist that is abound in John Hughes' films and Kevin Williamson's crop. Marty is a likeable kid who is forced, in a freak accident, to 1955 and has to save his and his sibling's future from never occurring. Even though he has a time machine his main problem is still time. Good thing he has the eccentric Doc' on his side. The plot has many twists, but is easy too follow. It is well-directed and well-writen and is followed with two, satisfying and successful sequels. Hop on the Back to the Future bandwagon. Now.",Null,0,1,23 July 1999
