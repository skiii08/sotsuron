Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Strange Tides wash...ashore.
","Strange Tides wash...ashore. Sometimes you can be surprised at what you can see and hear at a movie; 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' is one such movie. One: When Jack Sparrow was trying to get away from men pursuing him, he jumped down and into a horse pulled carriage. Inside was an aristocratic looking woman. In order to appease her to his good, he began to whisper (seduce) in her ear. She being immobilized,and after gaining his objective, he leaves her - but her expensive ear jewel is gone. The whole time he was seducing her, he was stealing her ear ring! How true with the great seducer of all time. When Satan whispers in the ear of man, he is stealing what precious jewels he can. The first seduction of man occurred in this fashion. While he was whispering in the ear of Eve, he was stealing the precious jewels God had given Adam and Eve. Satan's deceitful promise ended in man being robbed - death. He took the jewel right out of the ear while speaking seductive words. Two: There was a scene with men in a small boat out on the waters. A mermaid swam up to the boat. One man was mesmerized with her. He was drawn to her beauty. He wanted to be with her, so he went to go over the edge of the boat to be joined to her. As he was about to join his lips to her, her beauty changed to fangs. Some mermaids took men to the bottom of the sea. This one, later, washed up in a fishing net. A reminder Satan can allure man to become one with his false beauty, but his plan is insidious; his plan is bring man under his power and carry him down to the bottom of the sea (death). Three: Even the clergyman was drawn to the mermaids beauty. Though his motive may have seemed virtuous, for him to be with her, he went down with her into her world. Even in the movie, it did not show that he going with her produced the outcome of love and life - it alluded to that. The reality in our world is that any man drawn to the beauty of this world, whether clergy or whatever, will be taken down to the depths of the sea - death. Four: There was a corpse of a treasure seeking pirate in a room of scattered treasures, which treasures had the appearance of cankering. The corpse had a ring still on his finger. The words of Jesus came to mind, 'For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?' (Mark 8:36-37) All treasures will canker. In the moment of death, a prized ring sits on a dead body. What will a man give in exchange for his soul? Who would have thought ' Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' would have spoken such truths? Strange Tides wash truth ashore.",Null,0,1,11 August 2011
Warrior," Warrior ( November 14, 2011)
","I went to see 'Warrior' with my two sons, not knowing exactly what to expect. Knowing it was about two brothers who end up fighting each other, I thought it might contain something useful for them to see.Many times movies can move me emotionally, sometimes I may tear up, but in this movie I wiped tears away from off my cheek.I did wonder if the writers were the 'older brothers.' Or, since it was released on September 11, was there some subliminal message between American 'brothers' with terrorists being the younger brother.Warrior brothers does not seem like it should be synonymous. Brothers fighting goes all the way back to Cain and Abel. 'And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thous doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.' (Genesis 4:6-7) In 'Warrior', fallen countenances are seen. Sin (destructive things) can be seen ruling over the lives of the brothers and the father.Tommy had an alcoholic father with all the dysfunction that brings. His mother left his father; Tommy went with her, while Brendan stayed with his father. Brendan also stayed with his father so he did not have to move away from his girlfriend. Tommy and his mother moved across the country; she got sick, she did not have health insurance, she got Tommy to rub her body in oil (praying for healing from God, and she died). I guess Tommy felt everyone betrayed or abandoned him; father, brother, health care assistance, and God. He went to the Marines. In battle, his brothers mistakenly fired on him and those he was with - killing everyone but him. He lost his 'best brother' and ran to desert the military, only to run upon brothers in need and was able to save lives. Yet, he fled and took on his mothers maiden name to avoid military court martial.He got dealt bad hands. There is not a lot you can do sometimes to change the cards you are dealt, you can only change how you respond to the cards you are dealt. Tommy's countenance fell. It fell toward his father, his brother, health care affordability, God, and his military service.He had a lot to deal with. Like Cain, Tommy was wroth and his countenance fell. In the ring, fighting against his brother, he appeared much like Cain. '...and it came to pas, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.' (Genesis 4:8) Brendan had issues with his father and with Tommy. Brendan could not trust to allow his father into his life and expose his family to the pain his father caused him. Brendan had evidently gone to college and he was teaching at a high school. He had married and had children. He had bad hands dealt, also. His child had a heart problem, he had medical debts, his house was underwater, and when he sought to make extra money in a 'questionable' way his 'brothers' (school administration) suspended him without pay. The principal of the school and his students personally wanted to stand with him - but their hands were tied professionally.Brendan needed money to keep supporting his family; Tommy needed money to support his killed marine 'brother's' wife and family.The father is watching both his sons fight in the ring.I did not want to see either brother win in the ring against each other. I did not want to see brothers fight. How can brothers win when they seek to win at the expense of other. It is like a boundary, that if you cross it, you uncover your brother - you kill him.In 'Warrior', Brendan won the fight in the ring. A lot of questions remain unanswered. Did the military police take Tommy and court martial him? What kind of relationship would Tommy, Brendan and their father have? Was money and both brothers' needs put above their brother relationship? Can one or both brothers say, 'I'm not going to fight you? You're my brother?' Since Adam and Eve, we are all brothers in humanity. Also, since Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and later Seth, we are either Sons of God, or sons of men. There will always be two lines of brothers, though there are many subclasses. (blood brothers, military brothers, frat brothers, professional brothers, etc.) Within the subclasses, you can have either Sons of God, or sons of men.Jesus is the firstborn Son. He is the elder brother who was willing to die to give all humanity the opportunity to become His brothers and sisters.'The Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?' (Genesis 4:9) Cain was a liar and a murderer. He slew his brother.Jesus spoke of Abel as being righteous. (Matthew 23:35) Cain is referred to, as 'of that wicked one, and slew his brother.' (I John 3:12) Every man is born with 'sin lying at the door, with its desire unto you...' (Genesis 4:7) Every man must rule over him.'Warrior' was intense. I cried. I left heavy.I thank God for my elder brother who gave a knock out punch - the winning blow - to the adversary of all men.",Null,0,1,16 March 2012
Twilight," Loved to Death
","What seems like a typical teenage story, (girl falls for bad boy, bad boy's deviant nature is of no consequence to girl) - she's fascinated with him.The storyline says Bella meets a mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. He is like no other boy she has ever met. 'He's nothing like anyone she has ever met, period.' He sounds a lot like someone we all probably have met, even if at the time of our meeting we did not recognize who he was.Someone tall, dark, and handsome. Someone who had a mysteriousness about him, having something that compelled us to look on with a fascination.Who is this one who has intelligence, beauty, and intrigue; and with such, draws us unto himself? In Ezekiel 28, one can see the nature that is 'full of wisdom and perfect in beauty,' also 'there is no secret they can hide from thee.' Isaiah 14:12-15 speaks of Lucifer, son of the morning.This wisdom, beauty, and 'mind reading' sounds a lot like Edward. God created strong, spirit beings who were to be ministers unto man under God's authority. Satan wanted to be as God. He rebelled against God and one-third of the 'stars of heaven' (angels) followed his rebellion. They were cast to the earth. Revelation 12:7-9 says, 'And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.' Satan can be seen in the garden of Eden tempting man to rebel against God. It is a subtle tactic he uses, basically saying, didn't God say you could eat of every tree. When Eve says yes, but not of one tree, Satan contradicts God's commandment by telling her 'Ye shall not surely die: (he entices her desire for more than God gave) by also saying, 'For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be a gods, knowing good and evil.' She ate, and her husband with her ate also. All one has to do is look around and see who spoke the truth - man dies. Satan lied.Who is Edward? In 'Twilight', Bella is attracted to Edward. If she now has fallen in love with him, will she continue till she is one with him? It reminds me of the battle for mans soul. Satan can manifest himself into beauty. He desires man to worship him, not God; but, at what cost? Jesus said, 'For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?' Matthew 16:26.The seduction unto darkness is a seduction unto death. Satan has an end, and those who follow him receive as he. 'And the third angel followed them saying, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.' Revelation 14:9-ll.Bella may be attracted to one who will love her to death. Man can be attracted to one who promises to love him to death. The person tempted to leave light and walk in darkness may believe the power of darkness will stay with them and empower them to obtain. Yet, as soon as one departs from light and joins to darkness, one is in death. Satan may keep his promise - he loved you (or he stayed with you) until death. He seduced you to death. From the garden until now, Satan is keeping his promise to love man to death.In the 'Twilight' I see Bella being loved to death.",Null,1,4,30 October 2011
In Time," ...Takes Away the Life.
","I thought 'In Time' had a subliminal capitalism theme.Most people in the USA are born into the capitalistic market.Most people, at least in the USA, will, at some age, enter the capitalistic market seeking to sustain their life: where else is there to go? Years ago, man had his land. He could provide for himself and his family. Sons would inherit their father's land and have to provide for themselves and their families. Somewhere, man left his land. Maybe the promise of an easier way to make a living with promises of good wages, benefits, and pensions lured them to sell their own means of making a livelihood. Sons no longer had their fathers land, they now entered in and began their lives on another man's land.Some may say, 'Where is the promise?' 'Where is my good wage, my benefits, my pension, and early retirement?' Some may be living the promise; others may be living the promise only to find the promise not as promising as they thought it would be. And others find the promise only for the promise to break its promise.The market system can be like playing 'Monopoly.' You start off with $200.00 (at least when we played, newer versions may start you off with more). Every time you pass go, you get $200.00. Right off the bat, you may have to pay taxes. You might have to pay doctor's fees, or you may get assessed a certain amount for repairs. If you're lucky, you might receive money: a stock dividend pays out, you get an income tax refund, or some miscellaneous money is given to you.Most people play with the aim to buy property, put houses on them, trade the houses up and put hotels on the property - and make money!!! I tried playing 'Monopoly' without buying up all the land and putting hotels on them. I received my wage, I bought some land, I put a house on it, then, I just wanted to get around the board. It got difficult. It was becoming extremely difficult to get around the board without landing on properties that had hotels that charged me extremely much for landing on their property. Favor helped at times, I received the 'pot' in the middle, or I received from a 'community chest.' Going to jail seemed to be a blessing; at least I didn't have to land on someone's property.In the movie, there was a quote, something like, 'The poor die, and the rich don't live.' In our game of 'Monopoly,' those who bought all the land and were putting hotels on them and trying to make money and win, also, had to avoid each others land. They were sweating it. They were counting their money and trying to determine where the roll of the die would put them. They were gaining money, and losing money, and trying to make deals to get themselves ahead - and even at times, looking at my little piece of land and wanting it so they could add it to there's and make more money.Friendships can be made, not only the poor looking to the rich, but the rich looking to the poor. 'If you sell me your property, and you land on my property, I won't make you pay.' That sounds like a deal, that sounds like I get to stay alive. I would have to give up my property, they now can establish a monopoly, but they promise I don't have to pay if I land on anything that belongs to them.I played till I died.The market does not within itself have to be evil. It's not the market, it's man. Ezekiel 7:11 says, 'Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness.' The word violence translates into 'unjust gain.' Proverbs 1:19 says, 'So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.' Greed takes away the life. Unjust gain is violent.I saw at the market the other day, a bag of potatoes costing over $7.00. Someone making minimum wage will have to work one hour for one bag of potatoes.There was another quote in the movie, something like, 'Many have to die, so a few can live forever.' Greed takes way the life.In 'In Time,' people lived, died, timed-out, expired, killed, loved, gave and stole seeking to sustain their life.Revelation 13:16-18 says, '...And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.' 'In Time' and 'End Time' reveal to what and whom man belongs.",Null,0,1,14 December 2011
The Happening," People Stopped Cold in Their Tracks
","What could be happening in 'The Happening?' People begin to stop cold in their tracks. Next, we see people killing themselves. Some fall off buildings, some shoot themselves, others are seen hanging from trees and lying in roads.It appears the people are under some mind control; as if, they come to a place where they are frozen in mind and death is the last resort. The winds blow. Some believe the wind is spreading some toxin in which is the death; but, later we see the wind blowing and one family who chooses to love are not affected by the wind of death.The other people either seem to be ruled by fear, ignorance, or self-preservation to the point of murder. Some seem to have chosen isolation as a means to be separate from mankind, only to know the right thing to do, but their actions are not in love. 'I suppose I should invite you to dinner.' This woman is doing the right deed, but not with the right heart; her love has waxed cold.The two teenage boys who began to curse and try to break into a man's house for food, acted not in love, even if getting the food for the little girl would be deemed right. The man who shot the two boys did not act in love. He acted in fear. He feared those outside his house would bring death to his house. He brought death to his house. The end result to his fear, was to kill. His love waxed cold.Others succumbed to death by death overpowering their mind.Jesus speaking of the conditions of the end times said, 'And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.' (Matthew 24:12-13) In 'The Happening' we see many stopped cold in their tracks. Their love either waxed cold or they had no love to begin with. The winds of testing blow to test what sort of man man is. Many times, most men are found cold.Jesus said, 'But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.'",Null,0,1,31 October 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope Can Set You Free
","We bought a piece of land. It was embarrassingly overgrown in weeds. It had trash deposited on it. We used swingblades to chop through the growth to get down to the ground. One day as I was swinging, a man walking down the road said, 'You bought a bunch of weeds.' It was true, but they were my bunch of weeds. I kept working. It's like there was nothing beautiful to see, but I saw it - I could see beauty, when there was no beauty there to see; and, yet, there was beauty there to see, it just was unseen to most eyes - but it was there.As spring came, something else came - daffodils. They were everywhere; vibrant yellow on green stems; life amongst death; beauty amongst ruin. Nature itself was saying there is hope; life was springing back with death and ruin its backdrop. Chickweed flourished everywhere; lush green, much greener than grass. The ground was a blanket of green; the lushest weed that had ever brought such pleasure to my eye. It flourishes in the spring, it dies out in the summer, and reappears in the fall. Its like waiting for a friend to come, then go, only to come again.'The Shawshank Redemption' reminded me of such hope and life amongst despair and death. Of good and evil, with awfulness many times seeking to overcome goodness and put it out, only to see goodness, even if brought to death, shine through the darkness.A tagline for this movie says, 'Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free.' Brooks hanged himself; Red embraced hope. I thought of Revelation 21:8 where it says, 'But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.' The first kind of person mentioned is the fearful. I thought of Brooks, he had a chance at life - but, he chose death. He was fearful. There will be those who enter (chose) eternal death because they were fearful. The prison doors have been opened, they are told they can have liberty and freedom, and yet, like Brooks, fear holds them prisoners to death; they seal their own death, they enter eternal death.Red came to the same place as Brooks, yet, he made a different decision; he chose the hope set before him.Red, along with Andy, enjoyed their paradise. They chose to hope, and to follow that hope; that hope led them into life.As for our land, that 'bunch of weeds' to the man walking by, it too has followed hope into life. People now say, 'You sure got it looking good.' We even had a land speculator contact us - wanting to buy our land. She ain't for sale. I may not be able to fully accomplish my hope on that land in my lifetime - but, I can hope. Every day, I can hope. Every spring, I can see the daffodils come back after winter. I can see the lush green chickweed come and go and come again. Andy and Red had a boat and the Pacific Ocean.A plastic Wal-mart chair under the shade of the trees, with the seemingly ever-present, gentle breeze is my Pacific Ocean.Hope can set you free.",Null,0,0,29 November 2011
