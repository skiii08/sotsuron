Deepwater Horizon," NO plot and highly misleading
","VERY impressive: NO plot and highly misleading. Promulgates the idea that oil comes from dead dinosaurs and gives the impression that it was just 2 low-level BP guys on the rig that made the decision to cut costs by skipping a cement test and failing to keep routine maintenance top notch. No clear indictment of BP's criminal company culture of safety negligence for the benefit of stock dividends and executive remuneration, as established by Lord John Browne and continued by Tony Hayward.Much urgent and heroic pushing of buttons and switches and discussing gizmos with no explanation of what is going on or how this drilling target was geologically any different from all the other offshore locations on Earth (Macondo being unlike most other drilling targets because of extremely high fluid pressure in the formation, just below the fracture threshold of the rock layers holding the oil in). So from this movie, we get the news ALL oil drilling is SUPER dangerous. The usual Hollywood negligence to script-writing. Might be meaningful to rig workers, except I have the suspicion that anyone knowledgeable would smell plenty of foni- baloni cooking.And then the solemn photo-tribute to the 11 guys killed as the credits roll. Fine, but were they brave as they died one-by-one fighting to control the well, as the script implies? I understand that all 11 were instantly killed in the initial blast. Of course, 99.99% of the viewers will of have no idea that the Alexander Kjelland (1980) and Piper Alpha (1988) rig disasters each killed an order of magnitude more.And the only environmental representative in the movie is one bird (who, nevertheless, gave an Oscar-worthy performance).",1,198,409,30 September 2016
