The Blair Witch Project," I don't get it
","Watching this movie was an absolute waste of time, I got the movie because of the ratings and reviews, which I now believe were paid for. The movie is not scary, it's not entertaining, it lacks direction and purpose, there's nothing intriguing about the movie, it's an absolute waste of time. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. It doesn't even qualify to be called a movie, maybe a rehearsal video for a bad movie.",1,4,10,14 September 2018
