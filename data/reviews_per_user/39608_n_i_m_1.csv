Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar was SO CUTE! The Queen Rocked!!!
","I didn't watch the other Star Wars' much, but i will this one! I dont understand why all you psychotic freaks say Jar Jar was a racial thing or that he was a 'Jar Head' or a 'Butt Monkey' I mean, come on.. be original. Anyway, Jar Jar gave lots of humor to the movies with things like 'yousa, mesa, ex-squease me' and most of all 'HOW WOODE!!!' hahahahahahahahaahahahhahahaha He's hilarious!!! And Natalie Portman was great! The Queen ROCKS!! She kicks all other characters in the BUTT!!!! GO SEE STAR WARS: PHANTOM MENACE.... 'i am not worthy!'",Null,0,1,19 June 1999
