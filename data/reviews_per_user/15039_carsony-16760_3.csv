Casablanca," Perfect
",Perhaps the most perfectly cast film of all time. Harsh reality in its subject matter at a time when the US wasn't even in WW2 yet. Rewatchable and always relevant. This movie is flawless,10,0,0,7 February 2020
Inception," I don't get the hoopla
","This movie is confusing in terms of how wide spread the use of inception tech is. Is it like the internet and everyone knows about it? Also, why are they able to get shot and yet dream up rock climbing and skiing skills but can't dream up some Kevlar or something like that? It's a cool concept and is a run ride. But best picture material? Not even close",6,2,6,7 February 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Hey look what's on
","One of those movies that always seems to be on some channel and I always end up watching it. A movie almost entirely comprised of men enduring prison and corruption and surviving rape and attempted murder offers something surprising, hope.",9,1,1,7 February 2020
