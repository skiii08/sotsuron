The Equalizer," Just a good movie... Nothing special.
","An average movie with a common and clich√© story. A guy , who was a CIA agent , has started a new quiet life. But when he meets a young girl under the control of Russian gangsters, he has to help her. The plot was really obvious. There was nothing unpredictable that could surprise you. Denzel was good, as usually, and his character was quite likable and enjoyable. Violent scenes were good, but I need more than that. I am not saying that it's bad, but i didn't find anything special about this one. There are so many movies exactly like 'The Equalizer'. So, as I said before, it is just a good movie. Don't expect anything more. My rate is 6/10.",6,1,2,1 March 2015
