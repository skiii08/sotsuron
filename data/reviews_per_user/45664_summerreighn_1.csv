The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Missed opportunity
",This being a part one I was expecting a lot of build up with no real satisfying end result and as there isn't going to be a lot of action because of the part of the book they chose to focus on I felt that they had an opportunity and missed it to have some good character development between characters like Finnick and Gale and katniss's movie crew instead of fill up time with the cat chasing a light around. I did like seeing some of the propaganda that comes along with the war not just all of the bullets and bombs. But overall I was pretty bored with the whole movie and didn't find myself caring but these characters anymore.,Null,2,3,20 August 2015
