Hereditary," Movie was kind of slow.
","I waited for many months to watch this film, only to be let down by the fact that the first hour and 55 minutes were slow going with nothing much in the way of fear going on. It wasn't until the 1hr56min mark that things started getting good and that left only about ten minutes of horror fun. Those last moments were pretty good in my opinion, nice and gory, but they could have made it so through the entire film.I was sadly disappointed by this film which I had been waiting what seemed like forever for.",5,0,1,26 August 2018
