Requiem for a Dream," Unbearably powerful; ranks as one of the greatest films of all time
","It has been two days since I have watched Darren Aronofsky's second feature, Requiem for a Dream, and I have just now begun to regain some sense of composure.  Aronofsky has created one of those rare films that are so astonishing in emotional power and technical brilliance, and it has had the effect of leaving me staggering for two days following the experience.  This film is an achievement that is easily worthy of mention along side Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.The content of Requiem for a Dream has been established in most of the comments before mine, and thus I will instead address a few select points. With the addition of Requiem for a Dream to his resume, Darren Aronofsky must now be considered one of the most visually arresting directors currently working in cinema.  I must once again address comments pertaining to Aronofsky's supposed use of 'MTV visuals', and wonder whether it is the wish of this society to remove all innovation from the use of the film camera.  Those who condemn Aronofsky's style remind me distinctly of the boorish studio executives who took it upon themselves to cut Orson Welles' Touch of Evil because his technique was too revolutionary.In the style of all great visual directors, Aronofsky uses the camera to not simply capture his story, but to convey those emotions and psychological intangibles that an actor is not capable of providing the audience with.  As the characters in Requiem for a Dream spiral further into the tragic abyss of drug addiction, Aronofsky is able to, in every single sequence, provide the perfect shot with which to establish the psychological condition of his actors--a condition that cannot be portrayed in any other way due to the very nature of illicit drugs.Behind Aronofsky's talent is an emotional experience of unbearable power, punctuated by astonishing human performances from all four of the lead characters, most notably Ellen Burstyn in one of the most brilliant performances I have ever witnessed; her loss to Julia Roberts continues to prove that the year 2001 held the most shockingly commercial Academy Awards ceremony in the history of the institution.  The descent of the characters is completed with one of the most brutal, shocking, and emotional sequences in cinema history, a frenetically edited finale which generates such emotion that it cannot be adequately described with mere words.  Finally, Clint Mansell's brilliant soundtrack must be mentioned, as it is as vital to this film as any of its other aspects.In closing, Requiem for a Dream is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and stands as the most important parable of addiction ever captured on film; this film not only should, but must be shown to every child considering illicit drug use.  Much like Malick's aforementioned The Thin Red Line, Requiem for a Dream will be considered truly great in 25 years, when the likes of Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love have long since been forgotten.",10,1,2,23 July 2001
The Natural," You can't always do whatever you want, even if you try hard enough.
","ï»¿Let's face it: it didn't really matter who was cast in this film. All of the so-called characters are basically caricatures that are so cliched, it becomes ludicrous. I must give Robert Redford points for trying to make something out of this script, and he is one of the few reasons I gave this film a higher rating than it probably deserves. He brings an unmistakable presence to his film characters, and 'The Natural' is no exception. Unfortunately, I think he was being a bit to optimistic in thinking that anyone could make something of a character who's depth can be completely described with one sentence: 'Aging and down-on-his-luck baseball player who believes in 'playing the game how it was meant to be played.''Perhaps the most ridiculous addition to the film is Robert Prosky as the sinister team owner.  This is just the type of film where the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black, so I guess it may seem fitting that his character conducts his business in an office, all the lights off and the blinds shut. He doesn't like light, we are told, but are given no valid reason as to why (although one can easily guess by studying the rest of the film). Yes, he threatens the hero with blackmail. Yes, his sinister shadow can be seen behind his office blinds overlooking the night games, although the fact that he can see the game through closed blinds and that his shadow can be seen at all without any light on in his office seem to contradict simple logic. But, by the time these things occur, the film isn't worried about small details like these anymore.The first half an hour or so of 'The Natural' are very promising, which in turn makes the rest of the film even more of a let-down. The use of slow-motion is excellent, although it is used to show us the shattering of glass a little too often. The score is perhaps one of the movie's brightest points, smartly providing the mood for each scene. But, in the end, this film falls prey to dull characters and an uninspired script. I tried to like 'The Natural'. I really did. I guess it just goes to show that, contrary to what this movie tells us, you can't always do whatever you want, even if you try hard enough.",4,8,19,22 July 2001
The Waterboy," The Horror...
","There is absolutely nothing worse--in cinematic terms--than a bad comedy, and 'The Waterboy' is the very definition of a proverbial comedic dead zone. I've seen anti-war dramas that contain more laughs than are found in this film.  The entire body of 'gags' consists of Adam Sandler communicating with a speech impediment and then screaming and running into people at random, leading me to believe that this film was, in fact, penned by a crack writing team of chimpanzees.  Naturally, the plot is non-existent, which admittedly is to be expected from the likes of Sandler.  Every facet of this film is repulsive, and it is, in its entirety, shockingly devoid of any conceivable value--whether it be intellectual or entertainment.  Anyone who doesn't wish to reduce their I.Q. to that of a thimble is advised to avoid 'The Waterboy' at all costs.",1,0,2,13 August 2001
