Requiem for a Dream," Don't miss this
","I only recently saw requiem for a dream, and, although never having heard of it before, was blown away.  The acting, directing, screenplay, and even soundtrack are stellar.  I had never expected either of the Wayan's brothers to be able to act in a film of this depth and intensity, but my respect was earned with this work of art.  I highly recommend the directer's edition, as it simply intensifies the emotional value of this film.  Rent it, buy it, borrow it, just don't miss this masterpiece.",10,0,0,6 September 2001
