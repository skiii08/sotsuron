The Ring," This film is a disappointment!
","I went to this film prepared to be spooked, but was very disappointed!  It was campy and a cheap rip-off of all the other horror movies I've ever seen. Its weak attempt at fear falls flat.  It had obviously lifted elements of The Others, The Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project, and believe it or not The Invasion of the Body Snatchers; but still did not come anywhere near matching their expertise.  This film is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.",1,7,14,4 January 2003
Lost in Translation," Hated it
","I watched Lost in Translation.  I'm surprised to be writing this, because I know that most people really enjoyed it, and I thought that I was going to like it too.  But, in all honesty, I hated it.  I didn't just kind of dislike it, but I found it one of the hardest things to sit through ever. Half way through I really wanted to turn it off, but I was sure that it was going to get better.  It didn't.  I disliked the story, I disliked the music, I really hated the mood and atmosphere that the movie created. I found it depressing.  One redeeming quality that this film offers is that the acting is actually not bad.  Bill Murray does a good job, although I thought that his acting in Royal Tenenbaums was far superior. It's as though, actually, they were trying to re-create the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums for this picture, and were unable to do so. Save your money and rent something else.",1,6,14,20 August 2004
