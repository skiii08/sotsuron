The Blair Witch Project," I wasn't scared!
","Well, what a disappointment!  I went to see this movie on the recommendation of the radio personality that I listen to in the morning.  He said he was truly scared to death.  The preview was very scary, making me not want to see it.  But, I became so curious after reading about how the film was made and how the actors were chosen, that I realized I had to see it.  So, there we were sitting in the theater waiting to be scared and it never happened. I guess I'm just jaded or something.  Now, I admire the film as innovative and different.  I am a huge fan of independent film.  And there were a couple of things that were creepy, but I really felt it didn't deliver.  I told this to a young friend of mine, and then he went to see it and was scared out of his wits!  I have heard some people say that the reason they were so scared, was because it was true and the footage was the actual footage!  How funny is that?  People really think this is real!  Hey folks, it's a movie --  written by writers and those are actors.  I guess if it were real, it would truly be scary, but then we wouldn't be seeing it in a movie theater. Anyway, in closing, I felt it was too subtle, they could have made it a lot scarier!!",7,0,1,5 August 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Boring.......
","Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie!  I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I've had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case.  This movie has nothing to offer.  Even with the wonderful performance by the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue.  This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.  It had almost no laughs. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only thing special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I'll be looking for her movies in the future.  So, in conclusion, this movie was a major disappointment.  >",1,3,6,24 December 1999
