The Expendables 2," Disappointed again. Less so than the last Expendables
","I feel that if I were to write a lengthy review, I would have wasted more time on this movie franchise so I am going to keep it as brief as possible. Without giving much away, I just want to help steer clear the guys who are on the fence about wanting to watch this movie and may be looking for a good movie plot.Although the plot and script are better than the first movie and the lines seem to be a lot less cheesy, it still suffers from the really bad introduction of cameos. It's as if every time they are cornered in the plot, along comes another cameo to pull them out of the ditch. This is one of the reasons although better than the first movie, still a bad script. There needs to be a better build up to events in the plot. Although having said that, the plot is more gripping than the first movie (if only a little).Questions I need to ask (maybe I missed this from finding it hard to stay awake):1. Just like in the first movie, if Willis' crew are so tough that they were going to punish Stallone's crew for failing, why not just do the missions themselves? 2. Why would he take on the worst baddies fearlessly and fear the wrath of Willis' crew? 3. Why did Chuck Norris have this giddy little smile throughout his cameo appearance that said he was there to bake muffins rather than be the so-called-lone-wolf?Plus many more questions I can't be bothered to list.",4,1,3,12 April 2013
The Village," A gripping film from beginning to end
",The film like all of M.Night's films have a gripping suspense from the first moment till last. He has mastered how to build up a story starting from the first moment and than like all of his films literally unraveling the surprise neatly at the end.Its a great film that stands out from all the Hollywood rubbish. A true director that always works on a great story and doesn't rely on effects to make the film good. In my opinion one of the best films in 2004.The story evolves around a village and there neighbors that keep them secluded to their village. Saying anything more will truly give away the story and I wouldn't want to take the pleasure away from anyone. PLEASE WATCH THIS ONE!!!!,8,0,0,22 October 2004
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What the hell was that?
",This was a very long film which didn't really have a plot that justified it being that long.Moral of the story... Some guys get all the luck and can't see they have it. Some guys are content with nothing.,4,3,5,21 February 2020
