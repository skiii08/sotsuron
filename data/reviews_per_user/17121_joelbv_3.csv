Requiem for a Dream," If you want to start an anti-drug campaign, use this movie
","The movie starts with this guy Harry who is getting the television out of his mothers house to sell it for drugs. Than you see him and his friend Tycone use it and get high, and a few minutes later we meet Harry's girlfriend marion and these are the main characters, Harry, Tycone, Marion and Harry's mother Sarah. Harry and Tycone are running a drug-scam and are doing very well, he's crazy in love with his girlfriend and vice versa, and his mother is getting on a tv show and starts using diet pills. All the main characters feel great but then things go wrong, Tycone escapes a hit and ends up in jail, but their partners in crime got killed. When Harry bails Tycone out of the jail, they realize they have to start all over again with their drug scam but they can't get it going on any more. In the mean time Harry's mother is getting addicted on the diet pills, and see uses them more and more, and to get money for drugs for themselves, Harry's girlfriend starts being a prostitute. It gets worse and worse for all of them and at the end they all bear the dreadful consequences of their drug-addiction.I kept my summary short so I wouldn't give away to much of the movie. This movie is a must-see movie and I found it quite shocking to watch. What I also liked about the movie is the way they shot it with the quick pictures of for example the drug abuse. I think when your young and your in high school everyone, especially in Holland, gets tempted to use drugs and I think if schools just show this movie, instead of the stupid things they showed at our school, you get a lot more people thinking about the dreadful consequences of drug-addiction, and I believe it would help a lot better as drug prevention",Null,0,1,11 January 2004
American History X," great story, about two brothers who got influenced by the wrong people
","This is a very good movie because it showes how much your environment could influence you. The older brother starts becomming a nazi because of his father. At first his father tells him that he shouldnt believe everything his black teacher tells him and also makes clear that the american law is discriminating against white people. Than when his father gets killed in an African American neighbourhood he's becoming a Nazi, and later because of the influences in prison he has to review his opinion. The younger brother also becomes a nazi, but it seems to me that he has and always had serious doubts about the things nazi's believes in. I think he just became a nazi to support his brother. Well that's everything i want to say about the movie, not really a summary but just my opinion about what influenced the brothers to do what they do, and this is shown very well in the movie American History X",9,0,1,29 December 2003
