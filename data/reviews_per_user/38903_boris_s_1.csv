Requiem for a Dream," Very deep and sarcastic movie. Darren Aronofsky produced a masterpiece.
","Darren first caught my attention  with his debut 'Pi'. And now, 'Requiem for a dream' confirms that  Mr. Aronofsky is growing to be one of the best directors around.Everyone has a dream. But for some the dream becomes an obsession that simply takes a life away from the person. That's what Darren shows us in this masterpiece of sarcasm and bitterness. The movie is not an average 'I am a good person so shed a tear for me for I've run into problems lately' Hollywood style production. The main characters, (An excellent play  by all actors) don't deserve pity, they were asking for trouble from that start, miserable youth and TV-addicted lonely former housewife. They can't fight for their life so  they all got what they deserved, for their life was worthless. And Darren, using an excellent FX and camera work puts the viewers literally beside the characters as they descend to their ultimate doom. So just embrace yourself for a very dark journey, and think, if your life is any better ? 10/10",10,0,0,2 June 2001
