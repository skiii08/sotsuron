Hereditary," Great acting. Lots of problems just in the beginning.
","I really wanted to like this. I love all the actors, but it takes more than great acting to make a great movie. Spoilers now. I turned it off after the party disaster. It was all SO implausible. Who sends their kid with severe nut allergies out of the house without an EpiPen? (Probably has happened in reality). And then why would the brother try to speed to the hospital instead of calling an ambulance, since they were apparently in the middle of nowhere? (Probably has also happened in reality). And THEN, why were police not involved when the brother accidentally caused the decapitation of his kid sister, left the scene of the accident, and just goes to bed with his sister's decapitated corpse still in the back of the car?! She's then he's just back at school?! A couple of those things are completely illegal, yet not one person in the writing room thought of having even a 10 second scene with police asking questions? That was the last straw for me.",2,1,4,5 September 2018
It Follows," it wasn't AWFUL, just pretty boring and had no logic
","i expected a good scary movie. it was not. in fact it was pretty boring from beginning to end. and definitely NOT the genre re-invigoration that other people claim it is.for some reason, a sexually transmitted ghost (i'm gonna call it STG) that can follow you around at a slow walking pace is just not that scary to me (i mean, it DOES try to kill/screw you if it catches you, but if you just walk a little faster you'll be fine). even though it can look like anyone, the STG just decides to look like a couple creepy looking people and some friends and a friend's mom.apparently, all you have to do to get rid of the STG is have sex with someone else (it sounds like a horror-comedy though it is not); if the STG touches you, it will kill you and then move back up the line killing the last person that had the STG until it gets to the beginning person. Question: how do they know this? if it had happened before, there would be no one left to pass the story (or the STG) on to anyone else. and if all you have to do is pass it on to someone else how come the first guy (Hugh/ Jeff) that give it to Jay was still seeing the STG after he gave it to Jay?and at the very beginning there is a weird scene that seems to be from different movie entirely: girl runs outside her house in high-heels and into the street, looks like she's going to back away from the camera (in terror) all the way down the street, then abruptly runs to the other side of the street, runs down the sidewalk back toward her house (but across the street) crosses the street and runs back into her own house. wtf? next she's on the beach at night, telling her dad on the phone that she loves him; the next scene she's dead and mangled on that beach. this was the intro. another question: if this girl is presumably the girl that gave it to the guy (Hugh/ Jeff) that gave it to Jay, how did she give it to Hugh/ Jeff? if she had ALREADY given it to Hugh/ Jeff, why was it still going after the high-heels girl?i kept waiting for the big reveal but there isn't one.",3,13,31,19 July 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Horribly Unfunny
","I don't understand why this got so many stars by so many people. And I love cartoons.If you loved 'Up,' 'Finding Nemo,' 'Monsters Inc,' 'WALL-E,' and/or all of the 'Toy Story' movies (and you're an adult), you will be disappointed with this movie. Through the whole movie I was just waiting for something to grab my interest, but alas, I waited in vain. Maybe if you assume it will be bad, it will be better than expected, but I thought it would be good and was pretty disappointed with the whole thing. From the jokes to the creativity of the characters and even the voices were just lacking something. The animation was good (what animation isn't good these days?) but unoriginal and boring.",2,29,61,12 January 2013
