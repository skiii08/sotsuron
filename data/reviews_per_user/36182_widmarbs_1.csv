Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Taratino tries to draw attention to himself...
","This movie was an arrogant piece of work by Tarantino.  It moves slowly and the dialogue is often out of place and cheesey and seems to be trying to draw attention to Tarantino more so than it does to the plot and character development.  There is no better example of Tarantino trying to put himself above this movie than at the end when the letters 'Q&U' take up the entire screen in giving credit to him and Thurman for creating the character of the Bride.  With mild attempts at scoring a few cheap laughs, the movie does a displeasure to itself and the first volume.  There were too many shallow, meaningless violent gags and not enough of the intrigueing dialog and wit this has become the norm for Tarantino.  The film is above average, but does not meet the lofty expectations that people have set up for it.  6 out of 10 at best.",5,3,6,16 April 2004
