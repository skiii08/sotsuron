The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn: Breaking Hearts
","Breaking Dawn has been breaking box office records since its release. Sadly though, I really can't see why.Aside from the importance of the wedding to be shown, and the last 30 minutes of it that 'saved-the-bell', this movie is boring.The only thing about the movie that I liked is the fact that, in this installment, Jacob Black owned Edward Cullen.Not being a fan of the series, the book, nor the story, should make me expect less.However, that is not a reason for this, or any film to be made this bad.",5,6,9,27 November 2011
