The New World," A Masterpiece!
","I am on my knees thanking the almighty and the film makers for such a wonderful piece of work. It is such a welcome break from the regular, loud, in your face, over the top tag line, poorly acted product that is coming off the Hollywood assembly line these days as regularly as lies out of the white house.This movie is astonishing, it moves with a tranquility and an innocence that I have not seen in long time. It takes it's time, makes you lose yourself in the moment, in the swaying of trees, in the laughter and eyes of lead actress Q'Oriaka Kilcher. Even Collin Farrel, the loud mouthed over the top Alexander that has 'graced' us with his overbearing presence many, too many times, is a revelation in this movie. He is, dare i say it, sympathetic! soft spoken, gentle. Here one can sense what this guy is capable of doing, given the proper DIRECTION. But Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply breathtaking. The freedom with which this 16 year old moves and LIVES in front of the camera will bring you to tears and laughter, all at the same time.I know, how this all sounds, and I know also, that I did not go to the theater to see this movie, but rented the DVD (this is in my opinion due to the poor marketing, or shall I say lack there of which can be attributed to the absence of faith by the studio, that quality is worth a big campaign), but my thirst for a beautiful, not just entertaining, or funny, but a truly BEAUTIFUL movie was finally quenched! Thank you Mr. Malick for your unique voice and talent. You will be remembered as one of the greatest!",10,4,9,11 May 2006
