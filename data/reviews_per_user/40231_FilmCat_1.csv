The Blair Witch Project," At last, someone understands the psychology of fear...
","I confess I was a late-comer to this film and that I was not expecting to like it.  I was dead wrong.  In this film, which features potent performances by the three lead characters, the creators understand and thereby masterfully execute with chilling results that fear is based on the unknown and the unseen - that which lurks in the shadows of the infinite human imagination.  It's by not showing and detailing whatever is 'out there' that true fear grows and is augmented.  This film frightens and disturbs by intimately involving the viewer in a journey into darkness.
