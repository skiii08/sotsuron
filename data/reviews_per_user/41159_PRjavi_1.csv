Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Is just very cool
","i just like it very much Kill Bill: Vol. 2.is just very cool and straight with the story.continues as The Bride(Uma Thurman) continues to completing his vengeance of Bill(David Carradine) and his remaining members Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah) and Budd(Michael Madsen),i like it very much because the story flows just were the vol. 1 just left off,the Force's of 'The Bride'  is just stunning that even broke a coffin with his very hands and walk her way out to Budd's house again fight Elle.the fighting is just better than the first one,though not as bloody that the first,is just not exaggerating though,and have is bloody bodies too hehe.and the stuns and blows were better than the first seeing 'The Bride' kicking butts is just a cool experience.and too Pai Mei(Gordon Liu) kicking 'The Bride's butt is just cool too.the whole movie is very good,it envolves in the plot and story why her wants to kill them.is to get revenge and secure that they not do to other persons what they did to her,in a bloody form of taking justice but they did worse on her.thats why i like it very much the Performance of Thurman is good too.showing seriousness and hatred for they and sometimes compasion and love for others.Quentin's kill Bill sequel is better thatn many others sequels because he did not change the story and format of the movie.thats why i like Quentin Tarrantino in this sort of movies,because he is the best in this sorts of movies.i am a big fan of Kill Bill series and i recommend to anyone who whant to see a woman's Force's of Will and Prowess with self-confident to do her goal,Kill Bill :)",10,0,1,24 April 2004
