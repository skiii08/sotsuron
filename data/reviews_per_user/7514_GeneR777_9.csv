Howl's Moving Castle," A Fantastic Film Worth Every Moment
","I have to admit to being swayed by the jacket covers for DVD's and the marketing material used to promote movies. So when I saw Howl's Moving Castle and one of the characters (Howl) as a half-human, half-blue beast, I immediately thought, 'Eww, that's weird. What in the world were they thinking?' Even though it is by Miyazaki, I have to admit that bias/immaturity on my own part. So I stayed away from the film for quite some time. (I've also noticed a pattern: I tend to stay away from the best films out there for the most stupid, shallow reasons only to be later blown away by how good they were.) So eventually I managed to rent this film. I do not even know why it got on my Netflix list. But I saw it. And I was hooked. I watched it once, twice, three times, okay, I stopped at five times because I had to return it or incur the wrath of my girlfriend. But there were several moments throughout the film that really touched me and I was so moved by Emily Mortimer's rendition of Sophie's emotions that it left me perfectly spellbound by the end of the film. 'Okay, I'll just watch one more scene...' (I also realized you probably can not do this, because pretty soon if you start at any part of the movie chances are you will continue watching until the credits...) Okay, the review: It's a spellbinding film. A bit unconventional by Western standards, but definitely a movie that takes the audience on an adventure (which is rather refreshing if you consider how many movies promise adventure and give you recycled material today). This film is very endearing as all the characters feel real. Miyazaki excels in creating humorous characters and situations, developing a very warm view of life and everyone in it. The story is sometimes slow, but overall it feels honest and original which is saying a lot in today's cinema. Definitely worth renting at the DVD store, or, if you can, watching it on the big screen.",10,2,4,30 June 2006
Sucker Punch," Why Sucker Punch Works and why it will rock DVD sales
","I originally wrote a review the day after I saw Sucker Punch. I panned it. To me my initial feelings were rather lukewarm at best. But then I gave it some time. And as I went through my days afterward my mind would wander back to the story and think about the visual food for thought. Yeah, the girls are hot. Yeah, the action is over the top, but if you look at the emotional landscape that is being explored in a more literal fashion via the action then yeah, this is a pretty cool idea. Sometimes films come along that are a 'sucker punch' in terms of originality. The general public usually reacts negatively to it which leads to poor box office results. But later on the audience has had a chance to digest what was given and revisits the film and breaths new life into it. My prediction is that such a situation will happen with Sucker Punch. It'll probably not recoup its initial budget at the box office. People will flood the IMDb forum with reasons why it did not work. We will probably see about a few dozen threads at least where people will vent their reasons why they hate the film and why you too should not see it.But given some time it will recoup via video sales and other distribution deals. Why? Because it's still a solid story. The style of the movie is an Otaku's wet dream, but overall result is still the same: it does surprise and give ample food for thought. Think of it as stylized parable about repression, personal will and sacrifice. Because sooner or later after all the negative backlash and reviews blow by those emotional messages will be all that will be left. And people will remember it for that reason.",8,467,693,1 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Not as great as I had hoped but still fun
","I love the comic book, Iron Man. I perhaps always have. I also loved the first Iron Man movie. I'm not a purist, I just think it's a fun story. And it probably helps that I also enjoy TheOnion's video they did making fun of Iron Man's trailer back in 2008. Classic! However I digress...The good parts of this story are simply what you can surmise from watching the trailer: 1.) Bad Ass robots and suits all over the place. If you are someone who like the nerdgasm that sits at the heart of the Iron Man story then you are going to like some of the battles. 2.) There's a pretty good badguy in Sam Rockwell. Could have been a bit stronger but he's becomes a better baddie by the end of this sequel. The Mickey Rourke character was okay. Could have made it still a bit stronger. 3.) MINOR SPOILER: Personal angst and drama of Tony Stark. Ehhhhh. It was not so enjoyable this time. Mainly because we have to deal with an issue that plagues him throughout the story until (of course) he solves it at which point you may be shrugging and thinking, 'Okay, check that problem off the list. Next problem Tony will have to innovate around?' I think at this point whatever angst he might have had in the first movie about his father-son issues and his doubts about his own purpose gets pushed to the side which is a real shame, because, heck, that was a vulnerable part of Tony where he found himself actually contemplating his own mortality and and purpose in the world. So, my opinion? Pushing that very cool dramatic father-son issue to the side was probably not the best choice. But heck, at least it wasn't completely forgotten. And it did play a certain role in him figuring out his own next invention. But seriously, too many dramatic issues in one two hour movie made the overall treatment of the dramatic issues rather shallow -- too much ground to cover, too little time. Over all, I still give it an 8 out of 10. Not saying it was exactly what I had hoped for but it was still rather satisfying. May not see it again for a while, but that's okay. I'll still go see the next one... and probably the ones after that if they make them...",8,0,1,17 May 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," A Refreshing Comedy -- I'll probably see this one again.
","This movie makes a good case for adapting spicy books like The Devil Wears Prada. Rather than overtly conforming to Hollywood formulas which pace romantic comedies at 90 minutes, this film is a hilariously fun film which takes a breezy look at the fashion industry and its various players.All three principal characters played by Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Stanley Tucci, are immensely pleasurable to watch. We enjoy them because they relish what they do, and what they do is not very nice.The joy in this film is seeing the constant degradation of the main character played by Hathaway. But the flip side to the constant dumping which also makes the film equally pleasurable is seeing some cunning moves by her character that earn her a measure of respect.You do not have to be a woman to see this film. In fact if you have a basic IQ which allows you to speak in complete sentences, to understand sarcasm and have had experiences with Ultra Type-A personalities you will probably relate to and enjoy this film.This is a good date movie. It is also a good way to unwind if you have had a long week.",9,2,5,1 July 2006
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good - but not has good as I had hoped
","SOME SPOILERS(?) Not really... (But DO stay for after the credits!) It is quite possible to love Captain America the comic book too much. It is also quite possible to love those trailers with Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine telling skinny Chris Evans / Steve Rogers that 'It's about being a good man.' And it is quite possible to get entranced by the humility and guts of this young man who would do good. Because at the heart of this comic book hero is a story about a good, pure- hearted man who would do whatever he could to do the right thing... and keep getting back up when bigger and more capable men would have long given up. And that is touching. And for the first half of the movie the story touches this admirably. My only beef is with the second half which seems to ditch the brooding character development of what is essentially a gentle and loving soul learning to finally enjoy his life... and gets too much into the action. Now, GRANTED, this IS a comic book movie. And GRANTED, this is also an action adventure story. But the spine of the story as portrayed in the first half of the story should have played a more central role in the second half. I think that would have made this into a 'perfect' super hero movie... but moreso a solid, and touching drama. Because at the heart of this story SHOULD have been about a good man, learning his self- worth, and the love of a good woman who would inspire him to move forward even when he far outlived her. THAT, would have made the story thematically and emotionally unified. So maybe if the story was 30 minutes longer with that aspect of the drama placed within the heart of the story I would not have felt so numb and let down in the second half. Maybe. Maybe not. Just one other point: This movie is MEANT to be a setup for next year's AVENGERS movie. It would be a serious waste if they stopped making Captain America movies just to focus on Avengers stories. At the heart is still a man who is discovering his own self-worth. And that is plenty important in this day and age.",7,2,14,22 July 2011
She's the Man," A fun movie. Not Shakespeare but worth the $10.00.
","If you want to see a film that is pretty darn funny then go see this film. Although the overall film may sometimes feel a bit disjointed the main actress, Amanda Bynes, makes it a worthwhile view because of her very endearing carefree goofiness. In fact when you see how she plays awkward as a boy it makes the entire film rather impossible to resist.I would recommend it to anyone who does not take the entire film-making process too seriously and remembers that entertainment means, well, having a good time. Even though it gets a PG-13, it is very apparent that this film is suitable for just about anyone save for very young children and those people with an aversion to goofy humor.",10,4,8,19 March 2006
Batman Begins," Finally, a Batman Movie.
","If you go to this movie and you are a die-hard comic book Batman fan you will not be disappointed. If you liked the previous Batman movies, you will probably be surprised how much better this take on Batman truly is. But if you even thought that Batman should stayed the way it was previously portrayed through the Tim Burton versions, you should probably spend some time visiting a nearby bookstore that sells graphic novels and real some of the better graphic novels before continuing with this review.Why? Because this movie is perhaps what most die-hard Batman comic book fans wanted the first time around. A big reason may be that for at least the last 15 years the writing for the Batman comic books have been very edgy and in many ways far more cerebral than what Tim Burton gave us way back when. Batman is considered the 'Dark Knight' and also the 'detective' -- the everyman forged by circumstances and haunted by a past of regret and misfortune to become something more than the mere law enforcement crime fighter.Does this make it as carefree and enjoyable as, say, MR. AND MRS. SMITH? Maybe not. But satisfying? Yes. The campiness that was evident in the comedic Batman series of old was not something that most of these diehards probably care for nor desire to see in their superhero.And why would they? After seeing what graphic novels could truly become through the works of Frank Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN YEAR ONE, and Alan Moore's THE WATCHMEN (not a Batman storyline but something quite exceptional and worth mentioning), it seems that the expectations of Batman was to create something edgy, that was in many ways based in reality and above all, brooding and logical.That is what we get when we see BATMAN BEGINS -- a somewhat realistic storyline that explains via the many cause-and-effect events why a young man suffering the haunting death of his family would find no other recourse than to don a batsuit and prowl the night.This is not a film that is so fantastical nor focused on the weirdness of the badguys (the previous movies should have really been titled, JOKER, PENGUIN, and THE RIDDLER, not BATMAN since Batman was really more of an afterthought of the series not the real focus of the stories). Rather BATMAN BEGINS is really the first cinematic story about BRUCE WAYNE, who is also BATMAN.And that makes this story far more overdue and interesting than what came before.What haunts the entire premise of Batman is in fact the question of WHY:Why would someone even consider donning a cape and all to fight evil?Why would a billionaire who supposedly has so much money and therefore influence, still resort to such means? Why wouldn't he simply try to inspire community development via civic activities? Why wouldn't he take the Capra-esquire view and become a philanthropist -- giving away his money to the needy like MR. DEEDS GOES TO WASHINGTON? Why not simply use his money to become influential within the court system to try to fight justice that way? And how does one exorcise one's demons if one lives with the guilt that one may have contributed to one's own parents' death? How would he face his fears? Would he allow his personal hatred to warp his mind, to make him weak, and transform himself into the very thing he despises? Does he become the cowardly lot that he despises due to his intense hatred? Yes. We see this in the story and how it took the dignity and outrage of those he loves to snap him out of his cowardly ways.All of these questions are addressed in a very logical manner. And as a result it becomes a very analytical view of the nature of man. WHY is the question being asked in the movie -- something the filmmaker does an incredible job answering. Why does one man become a criminal and another a crime fighter? What kind of roll models such as RA'S AL GHUL and the LEAGUE OF SHADOWS provide young Wayne, and why do the ninja suits that Ghul's forces use, make it almost inevitable that young Wayne would create the Batsuit? Why does the rhetoric of Ghul's henchman, DUCARD, make it logical for Wayne to choose a Bat as his persona? In the comic book world, Batman is considered the 'modern' detective -- a thinking man (but also fallible) who, by his own force of will and intellect -- wages a war against the darker aspects of humanity. BATMAN BEGIN succeeds because it never forgets this fact.",10,1,3,11 July 2005
Cars," A bit disappointed, but then I've been spoiled by Pixar's Success
","Not the best Pixar film (but then again any film following in the wake of The Incredibles would have a hard time) I found Cars to be pleasant but rather uninspired at times, a bit long in the middle, and overall recycled as far as ideas are concerned.It seems that Hollywood has an obsession with following in the footsteps of the Golden Age directors such as Frank Capra whose works have become formulas for generations of stories that seem to fixate on the goodness of the common man, pitting the virtues of one group against the corruptive influences of fame and the prospects of fortune. Anyone who has seen Mister Deed Goes to Town, Mister Smith Goes to Washington, etc. (even The Majestic if you want to throw that in for good measure), has probably seen these age old themes used over and over again. These are good themes, and have very simply messages about the importance of having one's priorities straight, but seeing it one more time in an animated film seems rather wasted.Perhaps it is nostalgia that drove this piece -- an easy temptation for any writer to succumb to (look at Akira Kurosawa's last few films for future reference) but somehow seeing this film it made me feel a bit cheated.Granted, like I said before anything that came after The Incredibles would have to be stupendous to match the amount of anticipation that probably developed in the last year and a half so it is fair to say that this is a very entertaining film.But let's face it: if you are spoiled with the amazing quality of the previous Pixar films it will be easy to see this film as a bit of a letdown. But if you keep an open mind and simply go to have a good time, you will not be disappointed.",7,0,0,13 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Regrettably I did not enjoy it.
","I have been a very big X-Men fan for the last twenty-five years and enjoyed the first two films because they remained somewhat true to the spirit of the characters and the story dynamics. So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the third film. Even with the change of the director I figured it would not be so different in tone and theme. However I was wrong on both counts. When I go see a film such as an anticipated sequel I ultimately satisfied to some degree by simply being able to immerse myself in the world of some of my favorite characters. In some cases the sequels I have seen are good at keeping true to the characters' nature and relationships and thus continuing the fun. In this case however I was conflicted because: 1.) on one hand I loved seeing the characters played by some of my favorite actors (a BIG kudos for whoever thought of about casting Olivia Williams as Moira McTaggart -- what a hottie!) and 2.) I did not like the plot choices that the screenwriters and director made in this film. RE: Character Deaths If you see this film and are a die-hard X-Men fan you may agree that certain characters getting killed off made the overall dynamics of the story rather un-X-men-like. Having certain characters romantically involved with one another which was different from the comic book also make it feel a bit weird. I will not elaborate further but if you see the film and know the comic books you may agree with me on this. By the way one could argue that these unanticipated deaths actually enhances the overall storyline because it raises the stakes for the audience since none of the characters are immune from death. And a few deaths are okay, but it seemed like a little overkill (pun intended) in this film. RE: Plot Yes, there is a story contrary to popular opinion. And it's not too bad really, however there are a LOT of story lines going on simultaneously which makes you think if the film were any longer or convoluted that wthe audience would simply lose track of the progression in the story altogether. RE: In the End By the way if you do go see this film stay for the scene after the credits. I am beginning to do this more and more and they do throw in a final scene after the credits that you will not want to miss. RE: Directing Choices Ultimately I believe a director is hired for how he presents his stories. While Ratner is more than competent in his abilities to direct this film, how the story ultimately plays out in terms of tone is also his responsibility. This is a darker X-Men, true. But I believe the amount of deaths that exists in this film -- i.e. soldiers getting disintegrated -- was unnecessary for telling the story and overall rather disturbing. We know it's CG when you see it, but to see people being atomized over and over again is just sickening and unnecessary. In X2 we know a bunch of the baddies are going to die due to their own grenades however Singer at least has the good taste to not indulge in the violence. In X1 and X2, the spectacle is not the story but a tool at the hands of the director. In X3 it seems that fact is somewhat forgotten. Even though I walked out of X3 rather happy to see some of my favorite characters, after a few hours the overall impact of all tha violence left a bad taste in my mouth and I came to the conclusion that I really did not like this film. RE: The Future Is X-Men: The Last Stand the end for the X-Men? I doubt it. There's still plenty of material that could be used for sequels. However I wish the Donners reteam with Singer for the next project. He seems to have been pretty good at keeping spirit of the project on track.",1,2,3,29 May 2006
