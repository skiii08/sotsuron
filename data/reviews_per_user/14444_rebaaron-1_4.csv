First Man," No patriotism. No movie.

Passengers," The Opposite of La La Land
","SpoilersI watch a lot of movies and almost all of them crash and burn. The ones that are trying to sell me something: gays, and now trans (50 shades of crazy), multi-culti, communism, political correctness in all its various strains, and horror get a zero. When you think about it, that's about 80-90% of today's movies. The action movies are in trouble too. So many rely on tons and tons of CGI (x-men, avengers etc.) Some are all CGI (Jupiter Rising, Adventureland). The former are bad. The latter are worse. Some movies that could otherwise be good, are destroyed when the star appears on screen. He or she has been so politically active (Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck) that my reaction is, There's that bitch or moron, who wants to teach me what's right and wrong. I have a priest or rabbi for that. It takes me right out of the movie. These dumb actors are supposed to entertain me, play a role and disappear. I won't go see them anymore. They are just killing their box office. How smart are they?All the above is so that I could get to 10 lines of text and say something about this movie. So here goes.I loved it. It was set in the future, so, sci-fi and every drop of CGI (just beautiful) added to the movie. It was a delicious love story with wonderful actors, and it raised a novel and interesting moral dilemma. It was witty and the dialogue was funny and clever.In the end love conquered all (I like that.) It was the exact opposite of La La Land, which was of the opinion, that career and fame were more important than love, which may be true, but it's not how I like my movies or books. I loved La La Land until the ending, which left me with the taste of ashes in my mouth. I gave it a 7 instead of a 10, because of the ending. Of course, Hollywood loved it. It's full of people who gave up all to be in movies. Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and Chris Pratt are our new A-list.",10,4,10,8 February 2017
American Sniper," I'm proud to be an American and they can't take that away.
","American Sniper is the movie that should not have existed. Even though the book was a bestseller, nobody in Hollywood wanted the rights. And why would they? The Iraq War already had an official narrative in Hollywood. It was bad and wrong. Its veterans were crippled, dysfunctional and dangerous.Before American Sniper, Warner Brothers had gone with anti- war flicks like Body of Lies and In the Valley of Elah. It had lost a fortune on Body of Lies; but losing money had never stopped Hollywood from making anti-war movies that no one wanted to watch.Even the Hurt Locker had opened with a quote from leftist terrorist supporter Chris Hedges.An Iraq War movie was supposed to be an anti-war movie. There was no other way to tell the story. Spielberg's own interest in American Sniper was focused on 'humanizing' the other side. When he left and Clint Eastwood, coming off a series of failed films, took the helm, it was assumed that American Sniper would briefly show up in theaters and then go off to die quietly in what was left of the DVD aisle.And then American Sniper broke box office records that had been set by blockbusters like Avatar, Passion and Hangover Part II by refusing to demonize American soldiers or to spin conspiracy tales about the war. Instead of pandering to coastal progressives, it aimed at the patriotic heartland.In a sentence you no longer expected to hear from a Hollywood exec, the Warner Brothers distribution chief said, 'This is about patriotism and all the things people say the country is lacking these days.'The backlash to that patriotism and the things the country is lacking these days didn't take very long to form and it goes a lot deeper than snide tweets from Michael Moore and Seth Rogen. Academy members were reportedly passing around an article from the New Republic, whose author had not actually seen the movie, but still denounced it for not showing Chris Kyle as a bigoted murderer.Hollywood progressives are both threatened and angered by American Sniper. And with good reason.The most basic reason is the bottom line. Between Lone Survivor, Unbroken and American Sniper, the patriotic war movie is back.",10,10,37,22 January 2015
War Machine," Hollywood Leftists make another anti-war movie
","This movie has every Hollywood anti-war clich√© in it. If you kill the enemy, it just makes more enemies. If you jail criminals you just get more criminals. Wars can't be won, especially by fighting. The indigenous people are happy to have El Quaida, ISIS, or the Taliban rule them. They don't want to be saved. They do. That still doesn't mean it's America's job to do it. The problem is we fight the wars stupidly. First we can't seem to identify the enemy. If Iran is the problem, we should be fighting in Iran not Afghanistan. The Israelis make the same mistake, facing off against Hezballah when the real address for their enemy is Iran. They should be hitting Iran with everything they've got not getting their noses bloodied by Hezballah. Trump knows what to do. Let's just watch and learn.",1,2,18,3 July 2017
