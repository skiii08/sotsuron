10 Cloverfield Lane," A great movie but with a normal ending
","The technique of the story telling, the photography and everything is great. The way it unwrapping the mystery and make audience keep questioning the situation is very nice.But I have to say when the moment the real bad guys shows up, it ruined the genius of this movie. Feel like free fall from one of the top mystery story into a routine apocalypse story ending...Worth watching for sure. I'd gladly give it a 6.5. Just a little shy from getting a 7.",6,0,0,11 June 2017
Parasite," Over rated
","The poor is 'clever'. The rich is dumb. There's no depth in almost any of the characters. Every one in this movie has a paper thin character that only serves a very superficial role. Not to mention all the plot holes that can't last 3 seconds of thinking.Setup is nice, but the poor mooched half way through but the progression stopped by the intrusion of the 2nd parasite. Right after the serious of incident all the tention they built up got washed away, instead of let it escolate to a meaningful conflict it resolved in a chaotic farce.It's a nice topic and the setup has it's pretentials. But they end up with shooting the pellet with less than half berral of powder.It's a ok movie, but way far off from winning an award.",5,4,8,6 April 2020
