The Blair Witch Project," Simply the only film I`ve ever seen that scared me
","Very good film. Although you`ll probably hate the main protagonists, the winging Yanks that they are. Their flawd characters simply make them seen more real. Also it has an ending to die for but for God`s sake don`t let your friends tell you about it before hand. These things combined make this the ONLY film to scare me, once it`s in your head you won`t be able to get it out.",9,1,2,3 November 1999
