Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Solid fun as expected
","Those critics are obnoxious. TPM is pretty good. The visuals and special effects are spectacular. The young Anakin is cute and lovable. Jar jar binks is kinda irritating though. Some of the scenes, esp, the pot race will definitely spin off some amazing and exciting yet non-violent video games. George is out to make some money. It could be better though, ie, an epic, if he let a more competent director to do the work. In any case the TPM deserves a 8/10. A must see. Definitely worth the admission price. I am very happy to pay the $4 matinee (2:30pm) on 5/19 release date.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
Dark City," Dark City is short on sci-fi
","'Dark City' is long on mystery and film noir but short on sci-fi. The premise lacks any sci-fi bases. It reminds me more of some gothic/vampire films and the equally stupid 'the fifth element'. The ending 'mind' battle between the hero and a blank archbadguy is particularly laughable, given the presumed seriousness. However, some ideas like altered reality and symbolisms are interesting though derivative. The acting and cinematography are of fairly high quality, except for the weak doctor role. The ending sunrise scene is very moving with the splendid music. 7 (of which 2 belongs to the lovely Jennifer Connelly) out of 10 is a fair rating. Recommended for rental.",8,0,1,18 April 1999
The Matrix," A Sci-fi Pulp Fiction Oozing Cool Styles
","The Matrix is a sci-fi pulp fiction oozing cool styles. People with limited imagination and tastes may prevent themselves from thoroughly enjoying the film. Elements of the plot are derivative from a LOT of previous works (Dark City, Blade Runner, Alice in Wonderland, religions (esp., Christian and Buddhist) and etc.). However, they are combined and executed with finesse and originality. Style-wise, it reminds me of Kubrick's' 'A Clock Work Orange' and Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. Keanu Reeves is a best fit for the role, where explicit emotional acting is NOT required. Certain premises in the plot may not be scientifically convincing, but they are irrelevant. The matrix PROVOKES your imagination while overwhelms you with stunning visual effects (CG and camera works). I expect it to be a huge box office success. A solid 9 out of 10. Go see it on a big screen in a modern cinema. A definite DVD collector's item.Open your mind.",9,0,0,11 April 1999
