The Avengers," Awesome!
","Definitely the greatest superhero movie of all time. Marvel has set the bar high with this one and so far, they're doing a good job of keeping up with that despite not being able to raise it higher!",10,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Another great Spidey film!
",It was amazing to see what they did to Harry's character. He went from being Peter's best friend to mortal enemy. I can't blame him though cause what do you expect would happen if you found out your best friend was the one who killed your father?,10,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man 3," What a way to end a trilogy!
","Tobey Maguire makes such a great Spider-Man, hands down. We've seen him at his best, but in this movie, we saw him at his worst, and although I must say I wasn't that big of a fan of how cheesy he looked with that emo cut, it was still enjoyable for me watching him beat the 'venom' out of him.",10,1,1,7 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Don't know what happened with this one
","Marvel films are known for sneaking humor in between action sequences, but I don't know what they did with this one. The choreography was lame and I don't understand why Thor felt like he was trying too hard to be funny.",8,3,3,7 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Pretty good for a all-hype-looking film
",It's easy to see how this became the visual masterpiece it is. The creators put a lot of love and passion into its making and the results are amazing!,10,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man," Nostalgia feels!
",This is one of the few films that you can watch when you're bored and still be excited about what's going to happen (even though you've watched it over and over already and you've memorized almost all of the lines).,10,0,0,7 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Still good tho
","Sure the final fight with Thanos is more than epic, but I expected more than that. I wanted substance and a plot that didn't rely on 'quantum' for all the questions and explanations.",8,0,0,7 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Captain America is best Captain
","This is the movie where Captain America became my favorite Avenger. Sure he doesn't have monstrous abilities like Iron Man and Hulk, but to be holding his own on the same ground as them is just a testament to how great of a hero he truly is.",9,0,0,7 November 2019
Thor," Chris Hemsworth rocks!
","Chris Hemsworth plays a great god of thunder! Much like how Downey has molded into his character, Iron Man, Chris has done the same thing too as Thor.",10,0,0,7 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Great performance by Chris!'
","Action sequences aside, this movie was a great sequel to the first film. So much character development for Thor and I just love how he reunites with the crew from 'Thor,' especially with Jane.",10,0,1,7 November 2019
