The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever made
","This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  I was not scary at all.  All I got out of was motion sickness, I can't believe this piece of crap movie made so much money.  I rather watch Star Wars Episode I everyday non-stop than watch this movie ever again!",1,12,22,2 June 2002
