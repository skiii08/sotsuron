Blade Runner 2049," Hoped for a worthy sequel
","I really really wanted this movie to be good. However Blade Runner 2049 has turned out to be a slow, long and uninteresting experience. Although the visuals are really great and make you watch in awe, the storyline is just too weak and the action too little. This movie is just not at all in the same league as the original Blade Runner.",4,3,5,7 January 2018
