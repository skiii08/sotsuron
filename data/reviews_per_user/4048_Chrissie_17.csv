The Rock," Connery ages gracefully.
","Sean Connery is one of those men (like Ricardo Montalban) who ages like a fine brandy. For his presence alone I'd forgive a lot. But fortunately, there's not a lot to forgive. The Rock is an action pic -- plausability in retrospect isn't the issue. It just takes you along for the ride, and with one of the sexiest guides ever to grace the screen. (This may explain why women seem to like The Rock more than men do.)Nicholas Cage is endearing as a bungling geek-type who should have been issued a new pocket protector instead of a sidearm. His perpetually stunned facial expression fits the character.The Rock isn't War and Peace, but it's great entertainment. Enjoy.",Null,1,1,28 June 1999
Saturday Night Fever," Not What I Expected
","Saturday Night Fever was a disappointment. I expected Travolta's character to be more ... interesting, to say the least. He somehow never gets past being shallow and vain, except for the anger over his friends about the dance contest. But in a way, that was vanity, too. The cliches about Catholics were tired and overwrung -- I thought the thread of the Catholic girl and her boyfriend was particularly pointless, unless the whole goal of the movie was to get in as many anti-Catholic jabs as possible.Saturday Night Fever had a lot of potential, but sadly missed the mark and survives only as a specimen, interesting as a study of the times but good for little else. Even the dancing was a disappointment.",4,4,11,21 June 1999
Gremlins," Nasty.
","It's disturbing that this film is supposed to be fun and amusing -- the poor befuddled snowplow driver's home being destroyed; the tavern being trashed while the girl is being terrorized, the science teacher viciously attacked, the murder of the town meanie. It would have been quite possible to make the gremlins pesky and troublesome without urging the audience to laugh at horrible misfortune.The characters were all cookie-cutter cliches: wise old oriental, bungling inventor dad, sad-eyed tragic love interest, perky and resourceful kid, and the resurrection of Elvira Gulch, who was a much better character in the Wizard of Oz.Sure, Gizmo was cute, and the scene where the monsters all gathered to watch Snow White had its charm, but overall Gremlins lacks anything endearing or enduring.",5,8,21,25 July 1999
Mulan," Lacked consistency, but otherwise not bad.
","I approached Mulan with some trepidation. Disney had become fairly heavy-handed with the political correctness and I feared that Mulan would take it a step further. But the PC Police kept their nightsticks tucked in their belts on this one. Although there is quite a bit of disrespect for Chinese culture (why is our preference for strong-willed women superior to the ancient Chinese preference for demure women?), it's done with remarkable restraint considering the source.Mulan is a likable character, and Wen's voice brings tears to your eyes. She, like Belle, risks all to save her father. She isn't simply a brainless, helpless Barbie doll awaiting rescue. Mulan's svelte physique was refreshing as well, after the wasp-waisted Pocahontas and her predecessors.My biggest complaint was the jarring lack of a coherent tone. Characters switch from highly formalized speech to modern slang from sentence to sentence. The soldiers would be warriors one moment and dunderheads the next. We are taken in a twinkling from admiring Mulan's ingenuity in aiming the rocket to cause an avalanche and bury the barbarian hoards to rolling our eyes as a horse laden with a grown woman, a burly man, and a dragon bungee-jump by virtue of a piece of rope tied to an arrow one of them is grasping.Considering how some animated 'classics' (All Dogs Go To Heaven comes to mind) are utterly stultifying, Mulan stands out as being watchable. It's no match for Beauty and the Beast, but you don't need to cringe when your kid pops it in the VCR.",Null,0,0,24 April 1999
12 Angry Men," Breaking the rules.
","12 Angry Men breaks the rules of screenwriting:Instead of showing us the story, it tells us the story through the dialogue of the jurors.Instead of giving the eyes a visual feast, it hunkers down in a single room (aside from a couple of opening shots).Instead of giving us a clear cut protagonist and a clear cut antagonist, it gives us twelve visible characters and one invisible character caught up in a web of indecision.And it's brilliant. Sometimes you just gotta break the rules.",10,0,1,15 May 1999
Beauty and the Beast," Breathtaking
","When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality. Hasn't everyone, at some time, felt like a hideous beast hungry for someone to love us as we are and in doing so, transform us into something beautiful?The film itself more than delivered. Belle was the first Disney heroine who wasn't either boy-crazy or a doormat/victim. She has brains, heart, and above all, character. The Beast's transformation from monster to hero is believable and poignant. In a world where possessiveness has become the norm (witness the selfish custody battles of birth parents tearing children from the only homes they've ever known), the Beast's heart-wrenching insistence that he had to let Belle leave because he loves her is a breath of fresh air.The music is perfection, the animation astonishing. Together they raise filmmaking of any kind to new challenges. The ballroom scene is heartbreakingly beautiful.If you've been in a coma for ten years or have some other excuse for never having seen this gem of a movie, correct that omission as soon as possible. And have a hankie nearby.",10,10,12,10 April 1999
The English Patient," An Immorality Tale.
","The English Patient is right up there with Titanic in the groundbreaking new genre: Visually stunning movies celebrating  amoral, unlikable characters. Look at the core themes of this lame little number: Adultery is okay if both parties are pretty. It's noble to betray your allies in wartime in order to retrieve the corpse of your adulterous lover. Lust equals love and it is the supreme value, even if it means other people get maimed and killed and tortured, not to mention just emotionally worked over. I mean, yeah it's nice that our anti-hero's lady-love didn't have to get a boob job to be considered desirable, but she was so morally repulsive that it ended up being a back-handed complement to the small-breasted women of the world. I guess we're only attractive if we're tramps?If you haven't made the mistake of watching The English Patient, save yourself the trouble. Go rent Casablanca instead.",3,5,9,10 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Three hours wasn't enough.
","I'm a naturally contrary creature, so I didn't want to go see LOTR simply because everybody else seemed to be seeing it. My daughter persuaded me, telling me she'd buy my ticket and promising me 'lots of eye candy.'Well, blessings on my daughter's head. LOTR was a breathtaking delight (and not just when Aragorn threw his hood back and my hormones gave me a jolt that drew an 'Oh, my!' from my lips). When the end credits started to roll, I whimpered, 'What? No more?'I'm just hoping they'll do a theatrical re-release before TTT opens in December. There are friends who missed this in the theater and I'd love to share it with them in all its majestic scope.",10,1,1,7 September 2002
Edward Scissorhands," Magical
","I never tire of Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton has revived the lost art of telling a fairy tale. The once-upon-a-time suburbia is as apt for a modern fairy tale as the petty kingdoms we're familiar with, and the whimsical Inventor plays the benevolent magician role to the hilt.We have the fairy godmother in Peg Boggs, a peppy Avon Lady who frees Edward from his imprisonment in the lonely tower. Her daughter Kim is the aloof Princess whose love Edward wins. An assortment of imps and ogres populates the world Edward strives to navigate. Is there any way the misfit can fit in? It's too tempting to try to push Edward Scissorhands into a mold. Don't. Just revel in it and let yourself be a child again.",10,0,0,7 May 2001
Liar Liar," Funny, Funny.
","What are some folks expecting -- Dr. Zhivago? It's a FARCE, people! The premise -- what would happen to a lawyer who couldn't lie? -- is funny in and of itself. But it's the touches of depth that make Liar, Liar rich. Carrey's legal advice to his repeat offender client ('Stop breaking the law, a**hole!') captures the flavor. There is also an underlying morality -- that your kids are more important than money, that some things are just wrong no matter how much you benefit from them, that material success is no reflection of character -- that helps the film rise above the level of purile humor.Okay, so you don't get profundity. If you want that, read Plato.",10,0,0,7 July 1999
Man on the Moon," Majorly depressing
","I guess the real difference between a lunatic and a genius is that the genius gets applauded and the lunatic gets committed.I came away from this flic feeling sorry for Kaufman, but not because he was a misunderstood genius. If he was anything like the person portrayed by Carrey (and other readers assure us he was) there was something profoundly wrong with the man, but because people found his problems entertaining, they preferred to watch him self-destruct.I guess we could get into a debate about the reality of mental illness. We could debate Kaufman's sanity. But somebody that driven to get a reaction out of people -- to the point where his own family didn't even know whether or not to believe him when he told them he had cancer -- needed psychiatric help, not a critique of his 'performance.'",Null,0,0,19 October 2001
Amadeus," A masterpiece.
","Amadeus is as rich and deep as Mozart's own Requiem.Most reviewers miss Salieri's fatal flaw, which is not his jealousy: it is his own monstrous ego which leads him into a Faustian abyss of madness. Mozart's egotism, in contrast, is the innocent egotism of a child. For all of Salieri's austere asceticism and Mozart's reckless abandon, it is Salieri with the guilty soul.History was tampered with in the interests of dramatic effect. Mozart was not made more outrageous for the film in order to convey to a modern audience how shocking his behavior was. To the contrary, he was toned down, contenting himself with flatulating at parties rather than defecating on the table. Although Salieri did indeed plot politically against his rival, and although Mozart believed to his death that Salieri was poisoning him, the truth is that Mozart poisoned himself with alcohol and laudanum. An anonymous patron did indeed mysteriously commission the Requiem, but it was not Salieri. Mozart did dictate the Requiem on his deathbed, but to his pupil, Sussmeyer, whom Constanze hired to complete the work after her husband's death. Mozart really did keep Shinkenader and company waiting until the last minute for The Magic Flute, but while the cast partied downstairs, Mozart wrote feverishly upstairs while Constanze read to him and pumped him full of coffee to help him stay awake for the task. And so on.Amadeus drew on sketches of original costumes and sets to depict Mozart's operas, and it is these details that add richness to the film. If for some reason you've put off seeing Amadeus this long, correct that oversight now. It's worth it.",10,3,7,6 April 1999
Men in Black," Mind Candy.
","MiB gets panned for having a weak plot. It's a comic book, guys! It has enough of a plot to keep the action moving, which is all the plot it needs.Tommy Lee Jones is the world's sexiest straight man, and Will Smith bounces off him like a pinball.A suggestion for the sequel (stolen from Dave Barry): Make it close-captioned for the humor impaired. Some people just can't get a joke unless you explain it to them",10,1,2,7 May 1999
National Treasure," Dumb but fun
","I can't quite understand why critics insisted on trashing this bit of mind candy, other than perhaps because they were expecting more. I, on the other hand, went in looking for a bit of dumb fun, and I got it.Okay, Nicholas Cage's character always figures out the answers to riddles in less time than it would take him to tie his shoes. Okay, we clearly see bright shiny modern nails in 200+ year-old wooden structures. There are plenty of anachronisms and plot holes to keep you occupied should you get bored. But the point of the film is supposed to be that it's fun.No, it's not Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's more like The Mummy without the 'Ick!' factor. It's good enough for what it is.",7,0,0,17 July 2005
Titanic," Diminishing returns
","I forget what prompted me to see Titanic for the first time -- I think it was a comment I read in an article by a Japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little ones.See it I did, however, and I was so visually stunned I entirely missed how lousy the movie was.I went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the Titanic and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted. This time I noticed how lame the characters and plot were.I went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesn't have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas, and pay for our tickets, if I'd take him. That last time I left the theater absolutely outraged.Titanic is a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization. Characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins. Instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby, Kate and Leo reminisce about the night they met. Leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow Kate onto the floating door to save her life, when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead. Titanic was a monumental ego-trip and monument to selfishness. The only sympathetic characters were the designer, the captain, and the Irish widow with the two small children. I could smack Cameron in frustration -- imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and Kate's shallow character! Picture it -- the widow flees Ireland to join her brother in America after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue. The widow sees Kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is. Take it from there -- it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookie-cutter lust story. Pathetic.As I told my kids on the drive home from the theater, 'If you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children, don't bother coming home.'",4,2,3,10 April 1999
Identity," Seriously messes with your head
","Identity is right up with 'The Sixth Sense' for suspense, surprise, and leaving you going, 'What's happening?!' I just got out of the theater, and I'm going back tomorrow to see where the clues are that I missed. What a roller-coaster ride!",10,20,35,4 November 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Grows on you
","I had no inkling this film existed until I saw a poster for it outside a theater. I was killing time waiting for a friend, so I decided that I could look at George Clooney for an hour and a half.I was expecting a goofy jailbreak movie. I didn't realize this was art film. But art flic is was, and I left the theater weirded out but strangely intrigued.Ulysses Everett McGill is a smooth-talking fop of a prisoner who convinces two buddies to make a break with him. Their goal: to retrieve the loot from McGill's armored-car heist before it's left at the bottom of a brand-new lake. The misadventures loosely follow Homer's 'Odyssey' in a lush visual and musical landscape. To say more would, I think, diminish the magic of just letting it all unfold before you.I bought the soundtrack -- a must, since I couldn't get the music out of my head. I rented OBWOT a few times. I can't get George Clooney lip-synching 'Man of Constant Sorrow' out of my mind.When I spot OBWOT for sale, I'm adding it to my collection. This one is destined to become a classic.",8,0,0,9 November 2001
