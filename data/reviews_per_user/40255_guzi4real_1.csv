Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Am I too old for this kind of movie ?
","I really was looking forward to Star Wars episode I, but I was really disappointed when I finally saw the movie. I found the characters to be much too naive and the plot kind of ... 'no frills' type, easily predictable. I suppose that if I was 12 years old, the movie would have blown my socks off, the same way Star Wars IV, V and VI did a couple of years ago. Of course everything in this world is about money, but deep inside I kept on hoping that George Lucas would make a movie for adults and not for kids, a movie for the guys who saw the other episodes but had since then grown up and were expecting something much less 'fairy-tale'... On the other hand, I expect kids to love it, and I really loved Portman's performance. However, suddenly finding Ewan McGregor in the role of a jedi warrior, well it contrasts somewhat 'violently' with other roles he has played in his career (I thinking of Trainspotting of course)...",5,0,1,1 September 1999
