The Ring," Weak plot
","Nice looking movie with decent performances. However the plot left so many questions that in the end you just shrug it off and walk away. I would recommend it to a curious soul by saying 'It's a good rental but don't fall through the holes in the plot.' This movie contains one of the best 'how did they do that,' scenes of all time. It involves a spooked horse and a ferry. Another hole in this movie is that they don't even enlighten us as to how they did it in the DVD 'extras.' Speaking of the extras, the 'cutting room floor,' scenes only serve to add the confusion.It starts out as a typical teen horror/slasher flick then goes for a 'Sixth Sense,' look and feel. It does both nicely, but is rudely awakened by the numerous question marks that are brought up. The Riddler would love this movie. I won't go through them, but if you are the type to accept anything presented to you without question, you will love this one. As far as being scary, when I was a kid a movie could have that effect on me. But that was many moons ago. This movie falls into the category of 'next.'",Null,2,5,28 October 2004
