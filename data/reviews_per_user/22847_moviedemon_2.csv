The Avengers," Feel Like A Kid Again - Go See The Avengers!
","I know there's comic book fans that have their favorites. There's also the film fans that have their own favorites. There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered 'better'. For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again. So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The Avengers or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie. It is just a boatload of fun.",10,27,51,6 May 2012
Gangs of New York," Dust off a spot next to 'Raging Bull' and 'Goodfellas' and make room for 'Gangs of New York'.
","GANGS OF NEW YORKMPAA: Rated R Runtime: 166 minutesTagline: 'America Was Born In The Streets'CAST: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, John C. Reilly, David Hemmings, and Henry Thomas WRITTEN BY: Jay Cocks ('The Age of Innocence'), Steven Zaillan ('Schindler's List'), Kenneth Lonergan ('You Can Count On Me') DIRECTED BY: Martin Scorsese ('Mean Streets,' 'Taxi Driver,' 'Raging Bull,' 'Goodfellas')PLOT: The year is 1863 and the setting is New York's five points, which is historically considered the most violent part of the world at the time. The film's back story deals with the conflict between 'native' gangs and Irish immigrant gangs, as the forefront of the film delves into the character of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonard DiCaprio), who seeks revenge against Bill 'The Butcher' (Daniel Day-Lewis), his father's killer. REVIEW: Compelling. That is one word that you could use to describe Martin Scorsese's epic film, 'Gangs of New York'. Other words you could use are mesmerizing, brilliant and all those other fancy words that critics like to use on such Oscar nominated films. But this time, these words are appropriate and well deserved. 'Gangs of New York,' which was originally conceived back in 1978, stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day Lewis, who is absolutely brilliant. Ahh, there's that word again! But yet, it is true. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance of Bill 'The Butcher' is one of the most amazing performances in quite sometime. And though, Lewis steals every scene he's in, the supporting cast is also quite effective. Most notably, Jim Broadbent as William Tweed, Cameron Diaz as Jenny, and Liam Neeson is excellent in his brief turn as Priest Vallon. But don't forget the meticulous screenplay, the detailed set designs and the impeccable direction of Martin Scorsese, who surprisingly has yet to win a Best Director Oscar. However, I will have my fingers crossed for him (and Daniel Day-Lewis) on March 23rd. OVERALL: Dust off a spot next to 'Raging Bull' and 'Goodfellas' and make room for 'Gangs of New York'. ***1/2 (out of 4 stars)",9,0,0,17 March 2003
