Lucky Number Slevin," Long, long time, even too long ago
","I was capable to give 10 to some movie. I even registered myself to IMDb which is big big step (i never register to anything). But that one shakes me and hit me between my eyes. Great scenario that keeps rolling in different shapes and forms. And only at the end every end fits in place, even last bullet to the cop guy. Faboulous dialogues with nice jokes and sayings. I could use a tons of them in real time. and great work of actors, especially sad ironic (cynical?) Hartnett. even last standing man Wilis with his talent and capabilities lets the game roll. Freeman, Kingsley - as a lambs... Never thought that after Phone Booth I can give anyone 10.All my respect to anyone involved in that movie. i wont spare any more words, just MUSTSEE category.",10,2,5,2 July 2006
