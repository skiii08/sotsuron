Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ugh... *SPOILERS*
","I don't know what George Lucas was thinking... The first three were amazing. This movie was not very good at all. First of all, Jar Jar is just the most horrible character to ever hit the screen in cinematic history. I mean, George Lucas wanted to get the kids watching?!?!? The kids don't even know what Star Wars is!!! See, he didn't focus on what the Star Wars fans would want. I mean from the very beginning I knew... This movie is going to be bad. Once Jar Jar hit the screen I knew this movie was going down the crapper. The only scene I liked was the big lightsaber duel (the one that cause Qui-Gons death). Ray Park is very talented and it was very entertaining. However, the part where litle Anakin Skywalker is piloting the Naboo starfighter was just corny and terrible. I just bowed my head in shame when I saw him wearing that huge helmet and pair of goggles... All in all I give this movie 4/10 because it ruined my belief in Star Wars...",6,0,1,2 September 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Holy mother of god!
","I just came back from seeing the Matrix Revolutions and it blew me away! I mean it literally BLEW me away. The movie exploded and I flew back 18 feet still sitting in my seat! That's how good this movie is! It completly outshines the other two movies by so much! The special affects were spectacular! The action kept me on the edge of my seat, the whole Zion battle was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. Although I must say this movie was just not all action... That's right, unlike the Matrix Reloaded which was just a giant action movie (not saying that's bad either) but Revolutions was a lot about preparation and Planning. There still was a lot of action and fighting though.I still think I may like the first one the best because that one started the epic adventure. Then I think of the movie I just saw and think: I like them in different ways. The first Matrix was good for introducing you (obviously) The second for Action (action taking you deeper into the story) And the third one for making you think and (as I said) BLOWING you away.I give this movie a 10/10. And I must say: 'Everything that has a beginning.... has an end'. By that I mean my review has just come to an end.",6,6,12,5 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," An Action movie...*SPOILERS*
","When I went to the theatre to see 'Terminator 3' I wasn't expecting much. They waited so long to make it and the commercials didn't make it look that great. However, when the credits rolled I was very impressed. It was a very entertaining film with a good story line and ending. I liked it how before The Terminator (Arnold) was crushed he said he would be seeing John again. Thats what I like about the Terminator, it has to deal with the future. Now I thought the fact that judgement day did come in the end was a good idea. They couldn't just copy the end of Terminator 2 so they had to change it. They changed it well. Though in the narration of John Connor John says: 'When I was 13 years old' (obviously reflecting on Terminator 2) they had got it wrong. It is clear that it says on the screen of the computer screen that T1000 uses: John Connor 10 years old. I think they people who made the movie were too lazy to actually watch the movie and check so they just got how old the actor was who played John (13). But, this movie did keep my attention very well and I give it an 8/10. It is out of theatres now but I reccomend renting it on video/dvd. Its worth your money...",Null,0,0,2 September 2003
