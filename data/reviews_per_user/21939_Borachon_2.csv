The Blair Witch Project," stupid, boring, not scary, no music, the list goes on....
","This movie is sooo stupid! I live in the middle of the woods, and I dont even get half a shock in the 'scariest' parts of the movie! I mean come on, the title says 'Blair Witch' I didnt see a witch, i dont know, I just might be blind. This movie might be good if your into looking at nosehairs, or listening to 3 kids say 'f**k' every 10 seconds like they're adults. Others seem to love this movie, but its just not my type. I first saw this movie at the dollar movie by myself in the dark, not one chill!If you want to see a real good horror movie, with real animal tortures, and what this piece of crap tried to be like check out 'Cannibal Holocaust' or other good ones like 'City of the Living Dead' 'Last House on the Left'. Even 'Scream'  witch is NOT a horror movie but a certian type of comedy is scarier than this junk.--------3 out of 10, thats just for the old womans speech, and the sounds at the end credits",Null,0,1,17 July 2000
Scream," Horror movies are going down the drain....
","After this series of teen 'horror' movies (Scream trilogy, I Know what you did Last Summer, Urban Legend ect...) I figure real horror is going away, this movies are dumb! There is always a fine woman, a psycho, and stupid comedy! Wes Craven has actually had real horror at one time (Last House on the Left) I just hope he comes back with a bang (and Wes, please nothing other than horror! People know you as a horror director and nothing else) The beginning was ok but no 'horror'! I hope there is a director that has the guts to put a good horror movie out in the upcoming years.If you are looking for a horror movie that has real horror in it see Cannibal Holocaust, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Cannibal Ferox, Last House on the Left, Any Ruggero Deodato, Fulci film. Or if your looking for gore see Guinea Pig films, Story of Ricky-Oh, House by the Cemetary. As of late there has been some good horror/thrillers one of them being Stigmata.4/10-for the good casting, funny moments, and the big success.",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
