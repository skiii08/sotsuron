The Double Life of Véronique," An enigma....
","The Double Life of Veronique is an enigma. Like most viewers, I fell into the trap of trying to unravel the mystery when there was none. Weronika is a young Polish concert musician with a heart condition and cool aunt. Just as she collapses from a fatal heart attack in the middle of a performance, the action shifts to France where we meet Veronique - played by the same actress Irene Jacob. She was born on the same day as Weronika and is her double. In fact, she felt a pain at the moment that Weronika died.The Double Life is a beautiful looking film, not just because of Irene Jacob's perfect breasts. The music is a central element and strength of the film. It is a very romantic film and the minimalist approach to dialog adds to the beauty. The railway sequence is quite unforgettable. In watching the film, its important to let go of reason and rely instead on emotions.",7,8,12,27 November 2006
Inglourious Basterds," A welcome return to form after 15 years
","I still remember the rush I got when seeing Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction for the first time. I ended up seeing both multiple times and took something new away from each viewing. The media hype around Tarantino, which I believed at the time, was that he could do no wrong. It really seemed in '94 that he was not only the greatest director in the world, but would change cinema forever. Unfortunately his produce since Pulp Fiction was neither prolific nor impressive. The primary weakness with Tarantino's three works post Pulp Fiction and pre Inglourious Basterds was his constantly parroting or paying tribute to other works he had admired instead of going out and doing his own thing, creating something original. An excess of verbosity slowed the pace as well. Viewing the trailer and reading initial reviews of Inglourious Basterds led me to believe it suffered the same shortcomings. To be honest, the trailer for Inglourious does not sell the film I saw. And Tarantino's frequent arrogance and more recent track record have opened him up to a lot of criticism - much of it unjustified in the case of this film.Anyone who has read any review of Inglourious would know that the villain is a sinister Col. Hans Landa and that the opening sequence is one for the ages. He is a unique movie villain like Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men or Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He doesn't speak, he interrogates and interviews in a eerily calm manner. It requires nerves of steel to maintain your composure with him around! His audacity in the last 20 minutes is breathtaking. The opening sequence was worthy of Sergio Leone, whose Once Upon a Time in the West and Lee Van Cleef in The Good The Bad and The Ugly no doubt influenced Tarantino's handling of the entire sequence.I actually liked the criticized bar sequence even more than the opening. Long yes, but it slowly builds up to a brilliantly directed climax. The twists and turns, the playful banter which turns into something deadly are among the memorable sequences of cinema history. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus has given a performance that is almost on par with Christopher Waltz's Col. Landa. If his performance is Oscar worthy (not that that should be the yardstick!), his interview of her and her reaction when he exits is also equally worthy. I should mention here that the name star of the film, Brad Pitt, is really only one part of a great ensemble cast. His performance is superb and not the caricature that the trailer implies. A sequence where his hick officer is forced to act 'Spanish' is just brilliant comedy. He has the accent of a southerner down pat. I only wish he'd been given more time. I hope the director's cut adds something to his role.In closing, I'll add that Tarantino's knowledge of cinema was never in doubt. His camera-work and understanding of the mechanics of film-making were always good, but he has exceeded himself in this film. There is something classical about the photography (beautiful long takes) and cinematography, which almost no director can emulate. As a former fan and later critic of Tarantino, I'm blown away by Inglourious and despite his cheek, I do think he may just have made his masterpiece!",8,5,13,30 August 2009
Mississippi Burning," 1964 - The year America was at war with itself!
","1964 - The year America was at war with itself! Thats a pretty good tag-line. The promotion for this film seemed to pitch it as a thriller or a buddy movie. It is neither. This is a very mature investigation of a racist Mississippi town where the brutal murder of three civil rights activists took place in 1964. The film is inspired by real-life events.Dafoe and Hackman play the two FBI agents sent to investigate. Their differing styles of pursuing the case and Dafoe's belated admiration for Hackman's 'method's' is an interesting layer of flesh added to the structure of the film.You will see some really nasty racist characters played by familiar faces like Brad Dourif, Lee Ermey and an especially violent Michael Rooker. All are excellent. Frances McDormand really steals the movie as the wife of racist Dourif.This film is far more intelligent than some of the Stanley Kramer movies of the 60's which dealt with racism. It does not shy away from showing the seriousness (and sickness) of the racial mindset without being excessively preachy. It is in fact very watchable - largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi small-town Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.Highly recommended!",10,50,62,6 September 2006
12 Angry Men," The nature of prejudice
","12 Angry Men is excellent! Its probably the best film in the careers of all concerned. Yes, its better than Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, just as good as Fonda's Ox-Bow Incident, and almost equals Lee J. Cobb's The Man who Loved Cat Dancing (just kidding about Cobb!!!). This is NOT a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. We have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. The humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a Hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. The vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. Juror #8, Henry Fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. For the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case.In his Western classic The Ox-Bow Incident, Fonda is a bad man who over the duration of the night learns to shed his prejudice. The audiences knows he is wrong and feels relief when he makes the right choice in the end. What is interesting when comparing 12 Angry Men to Ox-Bow is how roles are reversed. Fonda is the only truly good and decent man in the jury and does not have a prejudices to shed. In fact, I as an audience member made the journey from someone convinced that the teen was guilty - based on the overwhelming evidence against him and my own hidden biases - to a person who realizes he has pigeon-holed someone into a mold which may not be accurate. The way this taut drama engrosses the viewer while raising awareness on important social issues is nowhere more evident than in the final scene at the steps of the courthouse where you really feel revitalizes after having spent a few hours in a small claustrophobic room. One of the best examples of films that can truly be said to elevate cinema to an art form, 12 Angry Men is unmissable!",10,2,3,10 January 2007
Oldboy," There's no halves with Oldboy
","Wow! There's no halves with Oldboy. I haven't seen so many negative reviews for a film so highly regarded by many others. Perhaps its the violence, which is understandable because it can be gratuitous and would make anyone cringe. Major plot holes have been pointed out by others. I would tend to agree with that too. The plot is indeed derivative - the basic Count of Monte Cristo premise has been rehashed before for countless TV shows. Yet despite all these valid criticism's (all of which I agree with), I think Oldboy only falls a notch short of excellent.The magic is in the execution. The script is quite complex and the editing, camera-work do it full justice. In particular, the entire school sequence and the single-take corridor fight are brilliant.The plot has Oh Dae-Su, married with one young daughter, kidnapped and imprisoned in a comfortable room for 15 years. When he is released, he does not realise, despite being told that he has merely moved to a larger prison. Hell-bent on revenge, it takes him the rest of the movie to realise that he was better off in prison.Themes in this movie likely to offend include attempted rape, murder, torture, incest and eating a live baby octopus.",10,10,70,28 October 2006
Finding Nemo," Amazing - really funny
","Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!",10,1,2,8 October 2006
Match Point," Woody Allen does Dostoyevsky in London
","I've always admired Woody Allen. The sheer number of great films he's made - Hannah and her Sisters, Manhattan, Midsummer Nights Sex Comedy, Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex, Manhattan Murder Mystery etc. Although some of his newer films weren't totally up to speed, I wanted them to be successful (not in the financial sense, but critically).Match Point is Allen's first film in years to be not only critically but also financially successful. He didn't act in it and its not even a comedy and no its not set in Manhattan. This is a thriller. The lead is an ambitious Irish tennis player who chose not to turn tennis pro and moved to London instead. He gets involved with the only daughter of an upper-upper class businessman (the excellent Brian Cox) who can give a son-in-law a great career. He also falls in love with the businessman's son's fiancée - a struggling American actress played by Scarlet Johannsen (oh she's hot!). I won't say more about the plot and no its nothing like Hannah and her Sisters. Instead, it is partially based on Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.I liked the London photography, the artwork and the Enrique Caruso opera piece which was used to great effect. The first scene with Jonathan Rhys-Myer and Scarlet is great. The verbal play reminded me of Bogart and Bacall. But none of their later scenes except the one in the café had that writing spark - less style and more realism which was a little jarring. I also felt Meyers was not a very good lead and acted poorly in several scenes. Emily Mortimer does a good job as Meyer's girlfriend.I would recommend this as a good but not perfect film.",8,1,1,23 August 2006
Crash," Beautiful movie
","Crash is one of the best films of 2005. In my view, it is not so much a racial film as it is a picture of a cosmopolitan city with all the problems associated with them including crime, corruption, alienation and racism. We see a number of different people - some blatantly racist, like Matt Dillon. Others are the victim of racism - like Terence Howard and Thandie Newton as his wife. Others, like the Iranian store-owner, just happen to be victims of their own limited communication skills.There are various ways this film can be read and a number of messages implied from the various sub-plots. At the end they all preach tolerance and humanity if we are to lead civilised lives as part of a diverse community.What makes this film superb is the calibre of acting. There are a number of known faces all giving solid performance. There is no single star. Its very much an ensemble piece with nicely fleshed out characterisations and plots which intertwine neatly in the end to show how everything is related. I rate this higher than that other great ensemble piece Robert Altman's Shortcuts because the characters are more fully developed.",9,1,9,7 September 2006
Shutter Island," Scorcese's on a roll here
","Scorcese has often been called America's greatest living director. Certainly with classics like Mean Streets, Taxidriver and Raging Bull to his credit decades ago, and others like Goodfellas and Gangs of New York in the intervening year, there is much weight in holding him in such high esteem, along with the expectations that come with it. My first impression with each new film since Goodfellas has been that its lesser Scorcese. He appears to have fallen from the lofty standards he set early in his career. The themes of the film do not have the gravitas one expects of a Scorcese film etc. On first viewing, I felt that way about both Gangs of New York and The Departed. Second and third viewings changed my opinion and I now know both films to be classics and the Scorcese magic is self evident.Shutter Island, which is a big move away from the broad range that Scorcese normally works within, is a horror-thriller film - well, more thriller than horror and thus more mainstream than his usual fare. The only other mainstream Scorcese film that comes to mind is Cape Fear. While I was never impressed with Cape Fear, the original B&W noir classic being far superior, I readily admit to loving Shutter Island from the first frame.People forget that Scorcese is the original film nerd and his understanding of cinema and the great masters is unparalleled. In this visually enchanting masterpiece, I saw clear shades of King Kong, the Val Lewton films of the 40s e.g. Isle of the Dead, Hitchcock's Vertigo and North by Northwest and of course the expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. However, it was all of a piece with a clear visual style that gelled and worked. There are remarkable set-pieces littered throughout the film - too many to mention. The performances are uniformly great. While, De Caprio, Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson are all acclaimed, Mark Ruffalo is less well known and shines in this, his best role since Zodiac.I won't go into the plot details but given that this is a thriller, suffice to say that there is at least one major plot twist. I've seen several reviewers commenting on and emphasizing the big twist. Many saw it coming and disliked the film, others couldn't see the twist coming and loved the film as a result. I think that basing your opinion on the plot twist misses the point. With the large number of thrillers that Hollywood churns out each year, I don't think is a plot twist out there that hasn't been covered threadbare by multiple films. What is important to me is the visual sense and style, which is present in Shutter Island in bucket-loads!",8,0,1,15 August 2010
The Thing," Another John Carpenter classic
","John Carpenter is one of the most influential directors in the horror/thriller genres. He has at least four classic films to his credit in my personal order of preference - Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York. I liked Assault and Halloween better than The Thing largely because of their low-budget feel. The Thing, although probably better directed, is a big-budget movie from an established and successful director who was all of 33. It doesn't have that gritty, low-budget feel that made Assault so stunning - although its certainly more testosterone fueled and there is NO female involved in the making of this film. This is the second adaptation of the John Campbell sci-fi short 'Who Goes There?' which was first filmed in 1951 as The Thing from Another World. The original was reputedly directed by Howard Hawks but I find that hard to believe. The original was a drag, there was no atmosphere or any of that B-Movie feel that films of the period like Them! or Invasion of the Body Snatchers give fans of those films. There was also a ridiculous love interest angle which added nothing to the film. The John Carpenter remake is actually more faithful to the original sci-fi short story apart from being eminently more entertaining.The basic premise of both films is a group of scientists based at an Antarctic station come across an alien - a 'Thing' from another world which starts attacking and killing them. A very similar theme was tackled in Ridley Scott's Alien. Alien, which is actually better than The Thing, was set in outer space and even more scary than The Thing. Its release a few years before The Thing may have been one of the reasons for The Thing's originally dismal box office returns. However, rest assured that the usual elements that make for a good John Carpenter film are all present in The Thing. Namely, great atmosphere, a good ensemble cast, thrills aplenty, a unique musical score (Ennio Morricone this time) and at least one classic scene of nerve biting tension. The classic scene in The Thing is obviously the blood testing scene which just doesn't let up on the tension - it keeps building and building.",9,0,1,10 November 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Unbelievably bad!!!
","Wow!!! This was so bad. I missed the original Wes Craven 1977 version, although I have seen the pretty decent Last House on the Left and the Scream/Nightmare on Elm Street films. At least unlike other viewers who didn't like this film, in my case it doesn't suffer in comparison. Its perfectly capable of suffering on its own dismerits!!! The film is downright gory and disgusting. There is an unpleasant rape scene in the middle to boot. There was not a moment when I felt scared. No horror but plenty of revulsion. I think I'll give the 1977 version a look because a campy low-budget style with 1970's grade-B acting may actually make the plot tolerable.Don't waste time on this if you are looking for a decent horror film to watch. This is not horror!",3,0,1,23 August 2006
The Battle of Algiers," One of the crowning achievements of cinema
","The Battle of Algiers is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic history. Unarguably the leader of its genre - war/politics - each frame of this masterpiece is cinemagic.Based on Saadi Yacef's biased memoirs, but done in a much more neutral manner by Italian communist filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo, this has a marked Neorealistic influence stamped on it. From the opening frame when an Algerian is tortured into revealing the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe and the movement of the paramilitary into the casbah to nab/kill the FLN leader, you'll know this is the real McCoy. There gritty realism, the amazing crowd scenes, the hustle-bustle, squalor and beauty of the Casbah weave a cinematic magic.The bulk of the action takes place during the eventful year of 1957 in what started out as a gentlemen's war but eventually degenerated into all out civilian bombings when the French played dirty by planting a bomb in the casbah. The FLN retaliation is swift and brilliantly executed - disturbing though it is. The tactics used by the FLN and French Army as shown in this film have been studied for years by various terrorist organizations (especially the PLO) and by governments (including the Pentagon).There are so many wonderful moments in this film that you get sucked into another world, another time from the word Go! It is wonderfully watchable and intelligent at the same time. The dialogue is superb too - especially Ben MHidi's 'Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets.' In real life, the vastly experienced Ben MHidi - an elder of the movement - was in his early 30's when he 'committed suicide' so that gives you an idea of the youth of the FLN support base.Unmissable!!!",10,2,5,19 September 2006
Underground," Good looking but overlong
","This is the only film of Emir Kusturica that I have seen, and his most acclaimed . My first impressions are that Kusturica has an amazing visual sense, is very good at extracting larger than life performances from his actors but does not know the meaning of economical storytelling or narrative progression.All three central characters in this epic saga of the country once known as Yugoslavia are superb. They have unique, beautiful faces and give truly exuberant performances. Then there is the color and overall cinematic look of the film - really good.But, the film is overlong where it does not need to be - some sequences drag on forever. This could easily be cut from three to two hours without any vital plot development being lost on the way. The progression from scene to scene - true it spans half a century - is quite choppy. I don't think Underground is going to age at all well with time. Most of the metaphors already feel dated a decade later given the new realities of the Balkans. A more watchable (and very funny) film on the Balkan conflict is the excellent No Man's Land.",7,4,9,16 October 2006
Independence Day," One of the better high-concept movies..
","As a rule, I don't like high-concept movies. However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.However, its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdy-cool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the clean-cut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday, but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you.",8,105,179,11 November 2006
No Country for Old Men," Relentless evil
","A lot has been written about the Coen brothers's new crime thriller No Country for Old Men. Nearly all the reviews have been ecstatic and touched on the many qualities of this masterpiece so I really have nothing new to add. But, I just saw it two hours ago and it has left me reeling. So, I really have to get my feelings off my chest and touch on some aspects of the film that immediately come to mind. This is not a plot synopsis.Its too early for me to collect my thoughts and say this is their best film. I've been a fan of the Coen's since I saw Blood Simple in the early 90's. But, I suspect that this is their best film. Yes, better than Fargo or Lebowski, both of which I loved. The first thing that makes it special is Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. He is certainly one of the most resourceful, remorseless and evil characters ever committed to celluloid, on a par with Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. There is a conversation between him and a over-friendly gas station owner towards the beginning of the film thats up there with the most chilling scenes I've ever seen. And they're just talking.The supporting cast is of a very high caliber, Josh Brolin being a revelation and Tommy Lee Jones playing a role only he could have done justice to. Woody Harrelson has an excellent cameo role. He plays one of many unfortunate souls that cross paths with the deranged Chigurh and can only say 'you don't have to do this'. The way his face turns red, he knows he's going to die and the calm exhibited by the monstrous Chigurh will remain in my mind for a long, long time.The Coen's have always been strong on the technical aspects of film-making i.e. cinematography, sound, editing etc. but this is by far their best work. The action mostly takes place in motels and a dusty desert near the Mexican border where the drug deal went south. In both cases, the visuals are perfect. That is exactly how you would expect a motel to look and smell. That is the perfect secluded place in the desert to make a drug deal. Both locations/sets stick in the mind. The sound too is really important to this film and perfectly done without having a soundtrack. The editing is extremely taut in the few action scenes between Chigurh and Moss such as when Chigurh comes to visit him in motel #2. The tight editing really gives the action and suspense a greater punch.While there is much humor in the film, especially in Tommy Lee Jones's banter, you can't relax while watching this. It grips you from the first moment and you're on a horrifying nightmare journey that you hope is going to end well. But it isn't!",10,2,4,1 January 2008
Before Sunset," Great start - poor finish!
","I saw and liked Before Sunrise when it first came out. It was a watchable romantic-comedy without being exceptional. I only saw it because of limited film choices at that time. I guess I had a broader range of films to see when the sequel Before Sunset came out and only saw it recently because the high IMDb user rating sparked my interest.First off, it is better than the original. It's been the case with several movies that the sequel bettered the original e.g. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Spider-Man 2, LOTR: Return of the King and (I know I'm stirring up some controversy) The Godfather - 2.Before Sunset starts out very well. We are given a short and sweet recap on the events of Before Sunrise. You can comfortably watch Sunset without having seen the original. We then have Celine and Jesse walking through Paris chatting and catching up on their lives. They also take a short boat ride on the Seine and eventually a car ride to Celine's flat while continuing their conversation.The entire film is a conversation between two people with no action. What makes the film unique is that the conversation sounds very natural, the kind of conversation two normal, intelligent people who click would have. That, plus the beauty of Paris makes this very viewable and romantic. We have a bombshell or two dropped along the way about what the two have been up to in the past nine years. It adds to audience interest and the complexity of where they find themselves vis-a-vis each other.Sunset comes badly undone in the last 10 minutes. The moment Celine starts singing 'Let me sing you a waltz' and mimicking Nina Simone, the film nosedives. The conversation becomes unreal and forced where throughout the movie it had seemed so natural. The ending was a cop-out. The story needed to find an end and me being a noir fan, you can guess what end I would have preferred.",7,1,3,28 October 2006
The Lives of Others," It's for me...
","Not too many films get full marks from me but The Lives of Others does. Its one of those rare films that lives up to and exceeds the hype, creating fascinating characters you will always remember and has moments of great power and beauty.The Lives of Others is set in communist-ruled, Stasi controlled East Germany. A powerful politician wants to bring down a popular 40-year old writer who is respected by his peers and recognised and accepted by the intolerant State apparatus. The politicians motive is a woman who he lusts after and who loves the writer. The film is a fascinating insight into the way the Stasi operates - the wiretapping, secret camera, phone-tapping etc. that fascist regimes used against their own citizens. The sober nature of the subject matter, the authentic look of East Germany created by the director and the excellent cast were enough to make this a very good film and well-deserved Oscar winner. But what makes this a classic is the end. I won't reveal it and I know its drawn criticism from some IMDb users, but I found it to be very intelligent and subtle in the way the film closes. It reminded me of another lovely film - Majid Majidi's Baran.",10,4,6,25 November 2007
Hero," Exquisite
","Hero, China's most expensive film, is the best in the series of recent martial arts epics made by directors like Yimou Zhang and Ang Lee. I saw House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon earlier and liked both. But Hero is on another plateau altogether.Very loosely based on historic events - the rise of the Qin empire - this is a mythical historic epic. Each and every frame of the movie is shot with care and exquisite emphasis on visuals. The colors, costumes and settings are letter-perfect in beauty and symmetry.The plot is Rashomon like. The Nameless Hero appears before the King of Qin - ruler of one of seven warring kingdoms. He claims to have killed three dangerous assassins who threatened the life of the King. In flashback we see how all three - Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow - were killed. The King counters with his interpretation of what the Nameless Hero's real agenda was and how he accomplished it. Hero then tells the King what really happened. All three versions of events are told in flashback.The beauty of the settings and the sword-fights is truly stunning. But, there are two moments which are truly amazing. The first is with the thousands of arrows flying through the air. The second is the fight between Nameless Hero and Broken Sword on water. I don't know where it was shot, but I'd love to see the place. Apart from these two scenes, all the other scenes are visually stunning as well. The A-List cast includes favorites like Tony Leung and Ziyi Zhang, but Jet Li and Maggie Cheung are the central figures.",9,0,1,25 October 2006
No Man's Land," Best film on Bosnian conflict
","No Man's Land is a war-comedy about soldiers from opposing sides trapped in a bunker between opposing firing lines. It is the story of four soldiers over a period of several hours. The movie is very funny because its very realistic and shows the utter absurdity of war.One of the two Serbians - the most experienced of all four soldiers - is shot dead, but not until he has lain a bouncing mine under a wounded Bosnian. The wounded Bosnian needs to go to the bathroom real bad and not to urinate. He also wants one of the cigarettes from the pack the other soldiers have swiped from his pocket - except he has a smokers cough. The other two soldiers (one Bosnian one Serb) both come from the same village and scored with the same town beauty who has since emigrated.Over the space of a few hours, the bunker becomes a ceasefire zone and the story of its inhabitants is blown up into an international media issue - thanks to a compassionate French UN soldier and an intrepid English war correspondent.Funny, highly watchable and not at all preachy, No Man's Land gets its message on the absurdity of was across very effectively. While watching it, I was alternately reminded of Dog Day Afternoon and The Big Carnival. An excellent anti-war movie with no winners in the end.",9,0,1,16 October 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," Touching but not a classic
","Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. The central characters are an orphaned brother and much younger sister in WW2 Japan. The city of Kobe has recently come under Allied fire bombing and most of the wooden houses have burned down including that of Seita and Setsuko. The children first live with a family friend who quickly becomes very nasty. They then move to a bomb shelter and try to survive the war.I like the fact that this film is anti-war and it does tell a touching story. But, I don't consider it, on first viewing, to be quite the classic it's made out to be. To be honest, I couldn't get into the whole anime thing. Even the faces were not realistic. If this had been a real movie with real actors, it would have been tougher to make, but the impact (for me) would have been far greater. Some of the plot points didn't make sense either. If Seita could access all that money in his mothers account, why did Setsuko have to reach a point of starvation for him to get his hands on it.Please don't let my views on this film discourage you from watching it. Overall, it is a good film and very well perceived by critics and IMDb voters.",7,3,13,24 October 2006
Inside Man," Good heist flick
","I just saw this on release in a local cinema. I'm not a huge heist film fan and high-octane thrillers aren't really my thing but I liked this movie a lot. The best thing, of course, was the plot. Really intricate unlike the negotiator. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington have both come in 'one' of if not the best film of their respective careers to-date and both are quite good. This is an intelligent thriller and moves along very well just based on an excellent script. The heist is amazingly well planned.This is not a typical Spike Lee joint but he proves he's a good director with the pacing. See the pandemonium when the news of the heist first breaks (near the beginning of the movie). The camera goes crazy but when we get to the bank, its totally calm. Different mood tones are created. It was also nice to see an old legend like Christopher Plummer in a decent role. My only complaint would be that the Jodie Foster character was not fully developed. Well, there isn't much in depth characterisation or background info for anyone because the plot is more important and fast-paced.",8,1,1,22 April 2006
When Harry Met Sally...," Great romantic comedy...
","When Harry Met Sally... is one of the best rom-coms ever made. Nora Ephron wrote three scripts for Meg Ryan - When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. All three are romantic comedies. All of them are incurably romantic and reference B&W/old classics - Casablanca, An Affair to Remember and The Shop Around the Corner respectively. All three are very good, with When Harry leading the trio.Harry and Sally meet each other on a road trip from Chicago to New York where both are relocating. We see their initial two encounters turn to disaster but they eventually decide to become friends ten years after they first met. They also decide not to have sex so as not to destroy their friendship. Of course they are eventually going to develop feelings for each other and of course the hero always gets the girl in the end - no deviation from the standard script Hollywood has been rehashing for decades.What makes this particular re-working of a fairly standard plot is primarily the script. Very intelligent, with lots of wit and good dialogue. Then, there are classic scenes, the best of which is the 'I'll have what she's having...' diner scene. The inter-cuts to actual old couples who've been together for decades discussing their relationship is brilliant.Romantic comedy is admittedly not a genre that pushes the boundaries of cinema. But, its very enjoyable and When Harry Met Sally is one of the enduring classics of the genre.",10,0,1,29 October 2006
There Will Be Blood," Flawed masterpiece
","There Will Be Blood was a memorable viewing experience and like Apocalypse Now, I'll remember this as a classic epic but ultimately a flawed masterpiece. A gripping film from the start although the first words aren't spoken until 12-15 minutes into the film, this is essentially a character study of a greedy prospector sacrificing everything for money and power and in the process losing any vestige of love or humanity that may have existed in some dark recess of his soul.Visually, the film is stunning. The attention to period detail in the dusty oil towns, the clothes, the oil derrick is perfect. Daniel Day-Lewis, great actor that he is, gives his career best performance as Daniel Plainview - a charismatic, conniving and determined man who we find at the start of the film (1898) working alone in a silver mine. The film charts his rise (and fall) over the next 29 years and his many clashes with Eli Sunday, a evangelical preacher who to Plainview is simply a false prophet, God being merely a superstition for the materialistic oil-man. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance holds the film together and the closest film I could compare it to is DeNiro in Taxi Driver, another fascinating character study.There Will Be Blood has its fair share of violence and amorality with lives lost in oil wells, a blow-out deafening Plainview's son, and of course Plainview's clashes with Sunday. The first physical clash is completely unexpected and shocking as Plainview becomes increasingly drunk and nasty through the course of the film. The second is almost comical and Lewis' best piece of acting in the film - when practicality has to bow before the church. The last, in the end, is what destroys the authenticity and gripping power of the preceding two and a half hours. Plainview's coldness towards his helpless, damaged child is one of the most affecting and disturbing things I've ever seen in a film.There were many ways to end the film. The one chosen by Anderson was perhaps the weakest. Throughout the lead up to the film, its obvious that the craftsman of the film is a genius. Why he chose to end such a magnificent film this way is a mystery to me. However, I think comparisons to Citizen Kane and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre are valid, because this is a film that will be remembered for a long time.",10,1,6,12 February 2008
Downfall," Best biopic ever....
","I read Sir Ian Kershaw's definitive biography of Adolf Hitler little over a year ago. I had studied that era before, but that book really gave me a pretty thorough insight into this monster. This man who was after all made of flesh and blood and was for over a decade almost a father figure and a person to be revered by the German people - among the most literate of Europe at that time. I hated Hitler even more after reading this well-researched biography because I understood how intelligent he was, how great an orator; a person with an aura yet so bloody-minded and bigoted.The Downfall is uncanny because the image that I retained of Hitler after reading his biography is exactly the portrait presented in the film. I can understand how disturbing this film would be for people born and bred on one-dimensional caricatures. The Downfall shows the real Hitler - charmer, lover of dogs and little children, dynamic orator, unrepentant warlord, completely delusional madman. He was all those things and The Downfall is a three-dimensional view of the real man and his last days.The film contains the usual rogues gallery from Hitlers last days: Eva Braun, Goebbels, Speer, Himmler, Keitel, Jodl, Fegelein, Mohnke and the chilling Magda Goebbels. All are portrayed realistically even if some come out looking heroic in their stubbornness. The mechanics of film-making are excellent, and the performances/acting superb.Fegelein comes out looking honorable (which I can understand) and Speer's comes out positively heroic, which I believe to have been one of the great errors of judgment history has made. I refuse to believe he was as innocent as his autobiography portrayed him. Actual conversations Hitler had in the last few days, actual snap decisions, rantings and ravings are all captured realistically in this film. I found almost no fiction in The Downfall and I was already familiar with the very 'realistic' portrayal of events. In fact a lot of ground was covered in the three hour running time in covering a large number of factual incidents. This is an amazing achievement and I would say a history lesson for the open-minded. I would however agree that children, being impressionable, should not see this film because they might come to the wrong conclusions about Hitler.",10,3,5,29 October 2006
The Lion King," Would you believe its dated!
","The Lion King made a big splash when it was released in the mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies. Irons even sings a song or two and has a pretty pleasant voice.",7,5,10,12 October 2006
Lord of War," Can't decide what it wants to say...
","I went into this film with high expectations after some positive reviews on IMDb and from fellow film buffs. I was a little disappointed. This film is not clear about what it wants to be. Is it an intelligent dissection of the arms industry and the moral issues or is it entertaining crime/gangster movie like Pacino's scarface. Sadly its neither and wavers between both ends of the spectrum.Nicholas Cage is a great actor but hasn't given a real performance in years. This film is no different. And Jared Leto is just irritating as his junkie brother - especially towards the end when he starts getting a morality attack at the wrong time. The camera-work is superb though and flits between Ukraine, Manhattan and Africa quite well. I don't know if it was on location shooting or sets but they look really realistic. I won't call this a bad movie and it has several interesting ideas and some educating moments but its definitely not a classic or a film that can be lauded as highly intelligent. That would be giving it more credit than is its due.....",6,2,4,28 May 2006
The Producers," You fish-faced enemy of the people
","This was Mel Brook's first big success which he wrote, directed but did not act in. Over three decades later he turned it into a successful Broadway play and there was a remake with Nathan Lane in 2005. The legendary black-listed comedian Zero Mostel (one of the original Hollywood Undesirable 12) plays a failed Broadway producer Max Bialystok who has taken to scamming old ladies. A young Gene Wilder (the fish-faced enemy of the people) is an accountant who has the disastrous idea that an unsuccessful play can earn more money than a successful one.He and Max sell shares for their sure-fire flop Springtime for Hitler - written by a Nazi psycho. They sell shares for slightly more than 100% - more in the vicinity of 25,000%, but thats OK because a play portraying Hitler as the hero is bound to fail right? Wrong! We have the lead actor playing Hitler - called LSD (another in-joke I think!)to thank for that.While some of the dialogue is certainly funny, personally I think the film didn't age too well. I saw it for the famed Zero who originated the Tevye role in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway, because I'd never seen him before in any movie. But, I understand the Nathan Lane remake is better.I don't know if I'll see that soon, but anyone wanting to see The Producers may want to watch the newer version instead which is supposed to be better than the original.",6,7,12,9 May 2006
Kagemusha," Kagemusha - The Double
","Only for a director of Kurosawa' caliber could Kagemusha serve as a dress rehearsal for more serious fare like Ran! Like Ran, Kagemusha is set in 15th-16th century Japan and deals with Lords, Kings and succession battles. Where Ran was based on Shakespeares King Lear, Kagemusha is based (however loosely) on historic fact.Certainly Kagemusha does not have the exquisite battle scenes of Ran, but it holds up well to its more illustrious successor. The compositions are lovely, starting from the opening frame with Lord Shingen, his brother and petty thief Kageumsha. The colors are beautiful and this is one of the best examples of color photography.There is an emotional core to the movie as well - much stronger than Ran perhaps. When Kagemusha is thrown out in the rain is particularly affecting. The process by which he moves from being a moral-less man who considers Lord Shingen to be a killer of hundreds and robber of domains to eventually aspiring to serve the dead Lord with fierce loyalty is beautifully done.Kurosawa is one of the all-time great directors. Although Rashomon and some of his earlier B&W films are his best, Kagemusha and Ran stand out in the later part of his career as unmissable epics.",8,0,2,12 October 2006
Hart's War," Terrible!
","Hart's War is a bad movie. Its boring, it rips-off and tries to copy movies like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape without having any of their intellect or style. What makes it worse is that the film seems to feel it has a message. There are numerous sub-plots, not one them interesting or fleshed out. The trial is unimpacting and the end is a cop-out.If the film were merely stupid and unoriginal, it may still be watchable on a quiet evening with nothing better to do. But Hart's War is boring. All the actor's - especially Bruce Willis - look totally out of place and wooden. Bruce Willis has lived out his career and may have done this for the money. Terence Howard was still up and coming (hopefully Crash will change that). But Colin Farrell! He is such a talented actor and appeared in a really good war movie called Tigerland. So why waste time with such a lame script. Skip this one.",5,2,4,7 September 2006
V for Vendetta," Fails on every level
","V for Vendetta is probably the worst film in the IMDb 250. It could even be the worst in the Top 1000. This film fails on every level and after watching it I'm amazed at peoples taste. V is full of clichés and frankly I could not find one redeeming aspect to this mess. Alan Moore - the creator of the comic character - disowned this film. Good for him! I never read the comic but I'm told it was quite good.I'm stumped to list the problems with V because in order to criticize a movie, it needs to have a core, a treatment which you can disagree with. But V has no core, no structure, just a lot of pretensions and intellectual posturing without conviction. I've always liked Natalie Portman - see the amazing Leon - but she's the biggest joke of this film. Her accent is a mess and frankly she looks completely lost. For me, the entire film was a collage of ideas, scenes and themes from other movies. The resultant whole is direction-less, pointless and an embarrassment for the entire team that contributed to this rot.",3,2,6,1 November 2006
