Mission: Impossible III," Crazy Guy makes a Good Movie
","www.kajatm.comMastercard you want me to fill in the Blanks? Well here you go?Tickets to the First Summer Blockbuster: $6.50 1 Cherry Icee: $4.00 Blowing up a Lamborghini: $250,000 Block Buster Budget: $185,000,000 Employing 4 Chinese people to shoot a 15 second shot on screen: $.04 cents *Finding out that the 'voice' from the Mastercard Commercials has one eye that goes this way and one eye that goes that way: PricelessMission Impossible 3 is the first blockbuster movie of the year and it does not disappoint. When I entered this movie I was under the impression that I would hate it but to my surprise I ended up really enjoying this movie. The star studded cast includes Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Keri Russell, Laurence Fishburne, and Jonathan Rhy Meyers (Match Point). But even with that many stars in one movie no one personality stands out or takes over the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman does an excellent job of playing the bad guy. Tom Cruise keeps it together long enough for you to remember that he is still a great actor. Ving Rhames, well he is Ving Rhames kind of like Samuel Jackson, One Bad MF, enough said. Laurence Fishburne also does an excellent job but it is hard to get his roles for the Matrix out of my head. Keri Russell is in the movie for about a total of 10 minutes which brings up the question of , 'why she is even mentioned in the opening credits?' And finally Jonathan Rhy Meyers is an up and coming star that does an excellent job and because of his role in Match Point he is 2 for 2 on my list, keep up the good work.From beginning to end this is a great movie which unlike the past two MI movies does not have a scene that is so unrealistic (I am looking at you John Woo, remember when you made Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott have a battle while on motorcycles) that you'd need a frontal lobotomy to believe what you just saw on screen. This may be a case of the fact that MI:3 was produced, written and directed by JJ Abrams and for all of you that are Lost fans we know that he is just a genius. I really enjoyed this movie and if you can get by the fact that Tom Cruise is a nut I would highly recommend going out to see this movie. It is pretty much what you expect from the Mission Impossible series and if you are a fan of these types of movies you are not going to be disappointed.Loyal Readers I have a challenge for you. While watching Mission Impossible 3 I challenge you to try not to think about Tom Cruise and his jumping up and down on a couch, or him dating a girl that is 16 years , or him eating a placenta. Now that is Mission Impossible.Stay Tuned for Mission Impossible 4 where Tom Cruise attempts to date and impregnate a sperm. But then again, what do I know?* You may not have noticed this but at the beginning of the movie his eyes are doing some crazy stuff. He kind of looks like that crazy guy in town that when he is talking you don't know if he is looking at you or the person standing right next to you.",8,1,1,7 June 2006
Match Point," A little slow but well worth the time to see it.
","www.kajatm.com In Woody Allen's latest movie he explores the value of a good condom, some good luck and just how a woman's constant hounding can drive a man into another woman's arm. Chris Walton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer) is a former tennis star trying to make ends meat teaching tennis to the rich. Chris eventually meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the son of a very rich business man. Tom and Chris become friends which leads to Tom hooking Chris up with his homely sister Chloe Hewett (Emily Motermier). Chris being the intelligent man that he is decides to pursue Chloe because lets face it money, like alcohol, makes a girl look a lot better than she is. As their love grows Chris runs into problems with Tom's fiancé Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) because no matter how rich Chloe may be he still wants to get into Nola's pants. And honestly can you blame him? If you have ever seen Scarlett Johansson you know what I am talking about. This girl is so hot she could make a burlap bag look good. Chris spends the majority of the beginning of the movie hitting on Nola without her fiancé finding out all the time climbing the corporate latter under Chloe's daddy's help. Eventually because of liquor and a PO'd mother-in-law Nola is driven into Chris' waiting arms in an open field in the back of Chole's and Tom's parent estate.Chris and Nola pursue their relationship further after a messy break up with Tom and the fact that Chole keeps hounding Chris to knock her up. Because Chris is protected at work by the fact that he is the son in law to the man in charge this give Chris ample time to leave work whenever he wants to go and bang Nola. Chris ends up knocking up Nola which causes a series of events that could potentially ruin his relationship with his sugar mama Chole. Nola unwilling to the abort the mission Chris comes up with a plan to 'take care' of the situation. What that plan is I will not say and how it ends up you will have to go and find out for yourself.One thing that really bothered me about this movie was the fact that Chris continually takes calls from Nola in front of his wife on his cell phone. It is like Woody Allen has never heard of call ID or voicemail. Not once in the entire movie does Chris check his phone to see who was calling and if it was a good decision to answer the phone. If you are honestly screwing around on your wife I think you might do a better job of screening your calls.The moral of this movie is that if you are going to have an affair with a hot Hollywood actress you'd better bring a condom because you never know when one of your little guys is going to get past the goalie and potentially ruin your life.I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. The movie moves kind of slow at times but the ending makes up for it. But then again, what do I know?",8,1,2,7 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as good at #2 but very good anyway
","www.kajatm.comX-Men The Last Stand is the third installment of the X-Men series and in my opinion it is one of the few trilogies that actually lives up to the hype. From beginning to end this movie is non stop action and contains a lot of special effects that are pretty cool and pretty creepy at the same time but more on that later. Staring Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Famke 'Hot' Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey/Phoenix), Kelsey Grammar (Beast), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Anna 'Hot' Paquin (Rogue), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut), Rebecca 'Hot' Romijn (Mystique) and Halle 'Too Hot for Words' Berry (Storm), X-Men The Last Stand should win an award just for casting. When I first heard that Kelsey Grammar was going to be playing Beast I thought to myself, 'Self, Dr. Fraiser Crain can't play Beast', but and this doesn't happen very often I was wrong. He does an excellent job of portraying the intelligent side of Beast and because of make-up and special effects he does an excellent job of making the audience believe his mutant side. The other new addition that is worth mentioning is Vinnie Jones and honestly I couldn't think of a better person to play a bad ass like Juggernaut. Vinnie Jones is one of my favorite bit actors and has done an excellent job in such movies at Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and Gone in 60 Seconds. If you need someone to play a bad ass, Vinnie Jones is the man for you. The only issue I had with his character is how they made his body look so big. Granted Juggernaut is supposed to be a huge unstoppable force but you could really tell that he was just wearing a body suit. There really are two main story lines going on in X-3. First is the creation of a new medicine that gives mutants the ability to go back to normal humans. Of course this causes a riff in the mutant community. Magneto is leading a group of rebel mutants that will stop at nothing until the cure is eliminated. The X-Men represent the other side of the coin and spend much of the movie trying to stop Magneto. The other storyline is how Dr. Jean Grey survived after being consumed by a ton of water in X2 because of her hidden mutant talent. Because of the extreme stress of this event it causes her to become the Phoenix, a level 5 mutant that has the ability to pretty much kick the crap out of any other mutant. These two story lines of course intersect at the end. ****Warning! Potential Spoilers in the Next Paragraph! The only thing that really upset me about this movie is that I knew the X-Men series of movies is coming to an end. I started to think that after all the characters that were killed off that we'd never see another X-Men movie. But you need to stay until after the credits have ended. There is an additional scene that if my friend Ken did not know about I would have never ended up seeing. This scene pretty much opens up a door for another X-Men movie and God willing that will happen.Now for the special effects in this movie. The scene where Magneto rescues Mystique is just awesome and well worth the price of admission. What they can do with a computer is just amazing. One of the scenes at the end (and no I won't ruin it for you) that involves Wolverine and Dr. Jean Grey is also awesome. However, the scene in the beginning of the movie where Professor X and Magneto go to meet with Jean Grey is just creepy. Since the scene is supposed to happen 20 years before current times they decided to digital enhance both Professor X and Magneto's faces to appear that they were 20 years younger. In reality all it really did was freak me out. Yes they do look younger but at the same time they both look like wax figurines that have come to life. It is so distracting that I found myself concentrating on the way they looked vs. what was going on in the scene. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. Just like Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and Lord of the Ring The Two Towers the second movie in this 3 movie set is still the best. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone except for small children. There is a lot of violence in the movie that is not appropriate for children viewing. If you are fan of the X-Men comic or just movies that are based on comic books I think that you will really enjoy this movie. But then again, what do I know?",9,1,2,7 June 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The movie needed to be longer.
","www.kajatm.comThe movie Good Night and Good Luck looks at the battle between Joe McCarthy and Ed Murrow during the 1950's over Joe's obsession with finding Communists in the United States. Ed Murrow is played by David Strathairn who has been in such classics as League of Their Own and Sneakers. David does an excellent job of playing Ed Murrow and it is amazing how he hasn't gotten bigger parts in Hollywood cause in my opinion this guy is right up there with William H. Macy as one of the most talented actors in recent times.The overall look and feel of the movie is right on with making you feel like you are watching actual footage of the 1950's even to the point that when they are showing TV clips of Ed Murrow it sounds just like 50's TV should sound. However this is where the greatest of this film ends.Just a fair warning, I had issues with this film from the beginning primarily because it is one of the selected few movies that the 'Academy' has chosen as best picture this year. And since I have serious issues with the 'Academy' not selecting Walk the Line as a best picture nominee my expectation are that a movie like this should surpass that brilliant film. That being said, I thought this movie was fair but no where near a Best Picture candidate. First off this movie is only an 1hr and 20 minutes long, OK maybe an 1 hour and 30 minutes long but that only takes into account the stupid commercials at the beginning and previews that made me even more angry. (More on that in a bit). Yes you heard me right an 1hr and 20 minutes long and it could have easily been a 3 hour movie (also known as the 'edited' version of any Peter Jackson film). Now it may be the fact that I am in my 20's but this movie did a very poor job of explaining the background of film or the era. I really don't know who Ed Murrow was expect for recognizing the name kind of like when you see someone that you know but you can for the life of you remember their name. I would have really enjoyed to know how Ed Murrow ended his career with CBS and how the effect of his attacks on Joe McCarthy ended. But once we get to that point they just decided to end the film leaving you with the sense that you wanted more. I just think that this movie falls way short of any movie goer's expectation.Secondly, this movie has Robert Downy Jr. in it where he plays a team member of the CBS team that supports Ed Murrow. After viewing this film I came to the conclusion that Robert Downy Jr.'s character has absolutely no point. The only thing that we really find out about Robert Downy is that he is married to another person at CBS and that is a no-no. So, would someone that saw this movie please explain to me what the point of his character was? I do have a theory on this. I think that because Robert Downy Jr. is still chummy with a lot of his Hollywood pals that this was a way for him to get a 7 figure check to continue to support his drug habit. Where else can a guy that has been busted for drug use several times still continue to pick up a check that size. Everyone complains about Baseball players using steroids (a drug) but when it comes to actors it is acceptable. Come on, if Joe Blow got busted for drugs as many times at Robert Downy Jr. they would be serving 8-15 in the state pen with their new friend Bubba. I guess it is just a sad statement on society when a guy like this still goes on collecting huge checks and no one says a word.OK back to the commercials before the show. Pepsi has a new commercial out featuring Jimmy Fallon dancing like an idiot after drinking some Pepsi. One question for you Jimmy Fallon, how is your career going? Good choice on leaving SNL. Commercials like this make me want to stop using their products. Some of these major companies like Pepsi should do some sort of study that ask question like 'After viewing this commercial are you a) more likely to use our product b) Now hate our product and are never going to use it again. Guess which one I would choose? I would say that you shouldn't waste your time or money to see this movie. I would recommend renting this movie if the movie store was all out of movies and your choices came down to Caddyshack 2, Gone Fishing or a Thin Red Line. If you really want to see a movie that does a better job of covering the era and Joe McCarthy I would recommend picking up a copy of Guilty by Suspicion with Mr. DeNiro. But then again what do I know, I am just part of the dumb public that still pays for movies like this.",3,0,5,7 June 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," Best Movie of 2006
","www.kajatm.com Finally after consecutive week of seeing Good Night and Good Luck and Firewall and I got to see a movie that was worth the admission. A movie that had a good story line. A movie that had good acting. And a movie that I would recommend to anyone of any age. Unlike Katie Holmes' parents, this movie did not disappoint me.The World's Fastest Indian is based on the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a guy from New Zealand that is obsessed with getting to the United States so he can drive his custom made Indian Motor cycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The movie really focuses on the adversity Burt Munro had to overcome to get to the US to achieve his dream. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, like usual, in the lead role of Burt Munro and really demonstrates how Munro was an individual from a generation that was kind and courteous, a generation that was considerate of others and a generations that knew if you treated people with respect that you'd get a lot farther than being a prick. People of today can learn a lot from Burt Munro.It is going to be a sad day when Anthony Hopkins dies and can no longer bring us great performances like this one. He has been good for so long that I think we often take his acting ability for granted. He does such a great job of portraying Munro that you eventually forget that you are watching Anthony Hopkins on screen and you start to believe that you are watching the true life story of Munro. Anthony Hopkins is what every actor in Hollywood should try to strive for with their career. He doesn't play himself; he plays an accurate representation of the characters that are put before him unlike some actors in Hollywood, Harrison Ford I am looking in your direction.I really cannot say enough about this movie. It gives me faith in Hollywood that there are still directors out there that can make movies that are original, that have good acting and actually have a storyline that you give two shits about. As far as I am concerned directors like Roger Donaldson and Jerry Bruckheimer can keep making movies that are based on true stories because they are far more interesting than the 'Blockbusters' that get put out every year. The fact that the World Fastest Indian hasn't gotten a lot of hubbub in advertisements or that it isn't playing at some of the biggest theaters in South Eastern Wisconsin speaks volumes of how the movie viewing public has been brainwashed into thinking what should be a good movie.At this point of the year, The World's Fastest Indian is my pick for Picture of the Year. I know it is a little early but I have confidence that this movie will survive until the next nominations. I will be very surprised if Anthony Hopkins doesn't get nominated for Best Actor and wins that category but then again I am never surprised what the 'Academy' does anymore. This movie doesn't have political undertones, it doesn't have two dudes humping each other on screen and it doesn't have some unbelievable thing that happens on screen that only a computer could generate. So maybe I should retract my previous statement that this is going to be nominated for picture of the year because it doesn't fall under the Academy's new definition of what a best picture should be.Overall this was a very good viewing experience for me. If you have the opportunity and if you can find it playing at a theater near you I would recommend taking the time to see this cinematic master piece. But then again, what do I know?",10,3,4,7 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," One of the Worst Movies of the Year!
","www.kajatm.com The best way to describe The Da Vinci Code is a movie that was made too late. Like Wyatt Earp to Tombstone and Deep Impact to Armageddon, The Da Vinci Code is just another version of National Treasure with one key difference, it being good. I was bored with the story line, bored with the acting and overall I really didn't care if they found the remains of Mary Magdalene or not. Being one of the 10 people in the United States that haven't actually read the book, I was expecting to be surprised by the storyline or to be at least entertained for the 2 hrs (closer to 3) but ended up watching my watch to find out when it was ending.Now this is the normal part of my review where I go into further detail about the movie and what happened but I have pretty much wiped the movie from my memory so that isn't going to happen this time around. What I do want to focus on is who has kidnapped the real Tom Hanks? On a scale of 1 to awful, his performance was pretty much awful. What happened to the guy that was pretty much Oscar worthy just because his name appeared in the credits? It was like watching a cardboard cutout of Tom Hanks on screen. He showed no emotion, no charisma to the point that I thought that I was watching some Bizarro-World Tom Hanks playing the lead role. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Spielberg didn't direct this piece of garbage and Tom Hanks only puts in 110% when Spielberg is directing. This kind of performance can ruin a career and I hope that we haven't seen the best of Tom Hanks. Finally, what is with his hair in this movie he looks like one of those skater guys in high school that shaves all of there head expect the top part so it looks like you have normal hair but in reality it just looks like some creature crawled up on you head and died.The whole story line tries to trick you into thinking that other things are going on and that the clues aren't that obvious. Unless you are about 3 years old you or you have drool coming from your mouth right now you can pretty much figure what is going to happen and who the link to Mary Magdalene is. Honestly, the more I think about this movie the more upset I am getting that I will never have those 3 hours back. I have an idea, when you make a movie try to make it entertaining; it makes it some much better for the viewer.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see a movie that is very similar and is well done even though the lead character is Nicolas Cage I would highly recommend seeing National Treasure. Maybe some books are better left to being books. From what I have heard the book is outstanding that was not the case with the on screen adaptation. Don't rent it, don't see it and please encourage others from making the same mistake that I did. But then again, what do I know?",2,2,4,7 June 2006
V for Vendetta," Alphabetical Review
","www.kajatm.com A for Another, this was Another movie that was good but not great.B for Bullocks, the word Bullocks is used over and over and over again. Yes I understand you are British and this is a way to swear on screen without getting censored in the US but enough already. This word is getting very close to the word Wicked as my most hated word.C for Confusing, this movie is often Confusing at times. Everyone speaks in English accents and at times it is hard to follow the dialog. There is one specific scene that is kind of a stretch and it is pretty much the arc of the movie so if you don't buy into it or you get confused as to why the main character did it, it makes the movie kind of confusing.D for Dave, this is the first movie that I have seen since Dave Chappelle's Block Party so anything after that is going to be a good movie. I cannot express enough how terrible that movie was.E for Ending, this movie has a great Ending, which I will not ruin but it will let you leave the movie theater very satisfied.F for Fudge, as in Fudge it is hard to write a review using the entire alphabet.G for Government, The goal of the movie was to focus on how the Government makes choices that are not in the best intentions of the people but you start to feel that this movie just might be a cut on the US government.H for Humor, there are some very good lines in this movie which always makes a movie better.I for Includes. This movie Includes good action, good acting, a good ending, good story line and overall a good viewing experience.J for Jim, hey it is my review I can give myself a little shout out every once in a while.K for Killer as in Killer visual effects, Killer fight scenes and a Killer ending.L for Liked, I Liked this movie but I didn't love it.M for Mask, the main character V wears a Mask the entire movie which will prompt everyone to go out and buy said mask for their Halloween costumes this year.N for Not, this movie is Not for everyone. Definitely not a kid movie. There are several scenes that include blood spurting and killing.O for Oh. Oh this movie was good but I was hoping that it would be great. Worth seeing but not worth purchasing and that is where I draw the line between great and good.P for Please don't make this into a Trilogy cause I don't think I can sit through another 2+ hour move that doesn't live up to the first two. Or a movie that pretty much makes the main character into Christ.Q for Quality, both Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving have Quality performances in this movie. The only thing is that I was expecting was for Hugo to look at the Audience and say 'Mr. Anderson' R for Rather. It was Rather nice to see this movie without paying for it. How did this happen? Well let me tell you. Ken and I invested some internet time in filling out an application for an AMC Movie Watcher Card. If you live by an AMC theater I would high recommend filling out the online application. You get cool stuff by using it like free movies and discounts on concessions.S for Start, I am officially making this movie the Start of the summer movie season which means no more garbage movies from Hollywood like I had to see throughout February and March.T for Thanks, Thanks to DC comics and Marvel comics to signing deals with motion picture companies to turn their comics into feature films. Keep it up.U for Under-appreciated, Movies like V for Vendetta are often Under-appreciated because they don't teach us a moral lesson or they don't teach us something about history or they aren't about some obscure person that you don't care about. This is a good movie where you can just check your brain at the door and be at the movie for the reason you went there in the first place and that was to be entertained.V for Vendetta, did you expect me to come up with a different V.W for Wachowski. The Wachowski brothers have put out another quality movie which makes 3 out of their last 4 movies very good. Let's all just pretend that the last Matrix was never created.X for X-Treme, This movie has X-Treme action from beginning to end. (I'd like to thank ESPN and all the skaters out there that decided to spell the word extreme with an X. Without that this review would not be possible.) Y for Yippee. Before the movie started we got not only a preview of the new Superman movie but we also got previews for MI3 and X-Men 3. So Yippee the summer block buster season is almost upon us which means no more snow, stuff going on during the weekends, summer festivals and most important softball.Z for Zee, OK see doesn't start with a Z but just imagine that I am using a French accent right now. I would recommend seeing this movie at the theater if not only just to see it because of the sound factor. Seeing a movie like this at home will just not give it justice. Overall I was satisfied with my viewing experience but I wouldn't recommend you putting down whatever you are doing right now to go out and see it but if you have nothing else going on by all means make a trip to the Theater. But then again what do I know?",7,1,3,7 June 2006
