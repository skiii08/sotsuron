Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disapointment
","I am a fan of the Star Wars Saga, I truly am, but please : Jar Jar Binks? There dialogues were awful, the movie could have been a lot less longer. Sure, it's good to see how it all started, but Jake Lloyd wasn't good at all and Liam Neeson phoned in his performance. I thought Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor were good though. Please let episode 2 be better!",6,0,1,22 March 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Worse movie ever!
","Who knew Spielberg could make such horrible movies? Even 1941 is better the this load of dino doo-doo. The only reason this movie was ever made was to cash in on the success of the first one (which wasn't that great to begin with). Sure, the f/x are good, but there's no story coming with this script! And don't even get me started on the ending...! Anyway, don't waste your time or money on this one, even the third one is not as bad...",1,10,34,22 March 2002
