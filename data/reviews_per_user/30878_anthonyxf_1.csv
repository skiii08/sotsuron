Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing? No, Boring? Yes
","Just because this movie is an arty farty movie, doesn't mean it is good. It felt like hours to watch to get to the anticipated 'disturbing' parts and when I got there, they weren't very disturbing at all.  Is it really so shocking?  People who think so must live in a very closed environment. Having said that, the film itself was original and well put together.",5,0,1,22 January 2004
