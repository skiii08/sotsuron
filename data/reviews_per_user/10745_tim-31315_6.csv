Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The 'good North' vs the 'evil vampire South'
","What rubbish ... now it is one thing to make a bad movie, go ahead and burn money ... but to deliberately set it up to take a problematic historical time to falsify actual history so blatantly is shameful. This is not entertaining, not fun to watch, not a horror movie, just rubbish. Do not spend you precious time to watch.",1,1,7,26 May 2019
The Irishman," Terrible- save your money and time!
",Niro lost it ... once a good actor ... now just ridiculous. Should ride into the quiet sunset.,1,3,9,3 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," What Hype ...
","... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the 'endgame' for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a 'transformer' type kid series. So bye, bye for me.",3,28,46,2 May 2019
The Favourite," Save the money
","... good actors don't make for a good movie. A different kind of 'directing', does not make for a more interesting entertainment.",5,2,4,27 January 2020
1917," Save you resources!!!
","Why not drop the message from their plane ... what was a major use for them in WW1? Germans had a planned strategic retreat, you would think they take their guns with them. They were only destroyed when they had no time to take them? All those empty shells? My grandparents were asked to give pots and pans for the war effort! All these single Germans getting drunk and not able to aim properly do not strike me as an organized new front line. He came upon the truck with Brits and did not tell the officer about the new situation but the soldiers? Coming to find the group he wanted to warn, they were in hiding in a forest but singing... yeah right! The whole story is so unbelievable and besides a story line that can be told in one minute, I did not find the cinematography that great.",2,4,9,9 February 2020
Midway," Not better than the old b&w movie
","Good ww2 movie, but nothing especially new, special or moving.",6,0,3,15 December 2019
