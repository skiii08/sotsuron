Kill Bill: Vol. 2," go with it and it's worth the ride
",In many ways this is a cheeky piece of style over substance. But if you can swallow that pill then it's also a masterpiece. And if you've seen the first 'volume' then you shouldn't really expect anything else. The opening black and white church scene is shot in such outrageous contrast you'd be forgiven for thinking the projection room had caught fire. The leap back into colour features what could be the most technicolour mud in north america.Unabashed cliches of dialogue and character will have film nerds giggling like schoolgirls (well that's my excuse). One particular line will have me shaking my head in disbelief for weeks to come. And possibly the cheekiest trick of all: warming up the slasher fetishists with the samurai orgy in volume 1 and then restricting volume 2 to a stifled brawl in a trailer. It's the chop-socky equivalent of showing fourteen year old boys a ten minute blowjob with no money shot. Genius.It's worth saying too that the characters in this film are almost without exception well-written and well-acted. I've seen several reviewers fuming 'fight don't talk'. Bollocks to that: 'talk don't fight'. You want more fighting go and rent Iron Monkey.,Null,0,1,26 April 2004
Closer," Utterly utterly utterly stupid.
","Take four unsympathetic characters and slam them into one other in a series of contrived meetings. Then hop forward a few months at a time to some equally contrived decision points in their relationships. And at each stage make sure that they make absolutely the most unconvincing and ludicrous decision possible.This is without doubt the most infuriatingly unbelievable film I have ever seen. I had to suspend my disbelief less for South Park Uncut. Nothing that any of the characters ever say or do is even remotely plausible.After the first half hour the film becomes risibly predictable because you know that whatever choices the characters are faced with, they will take the most preposterous option. At one point I thought 'if Julia Roberts does X now then this is the worst film I've ever seen' ... I clearly wasn't alone as when she did (inevitably) do X, a neighbour stood up and walked out of the theatre.Oh ... Clive Owen puts in a convincing performance (as the biggest arsehole in a foursome of arseholes). But it's scant consolation for the rest of this nonsense.",1,55,88,24 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Stunningly tedious
",Easily the most tedious film of the year and of the series and of the genre. You'd find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas' shoulders. This kind of dialogue would get you kicked out of film school. Dribbled with strained references to the original series and delivered with the verve of a George W. Bush speech on international trade agreements. The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor's continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness. The 'romantic' leads are like being forced to watch the world's least interesting high-school sweethearts pretending to have a squabble. Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.,1,80,164,29 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," So what did we learn at school today, kids?
","(some elements of this review may be considered spoilers)I hadn't anticipated that the intellectual scope of this film would be quite so broad. It beggars belief that it took a mere two and a half hours to explore those two crucial questions:'do women masturbate?' and,'does everyone on earth want to have sex with Tom Cruise?'.And it is good to see that Kubrick was unafraid to fly in the face of the conventional wisdom of 'yes' and 'seldom after they are twelve years old'. Instead we are presented with the stunning revelations that women dream about men in uniforms and giggle and that, faced with the superhuman charms of Mr Cruise, models will become bisexual, prostitutes will forego their fees and immigrants will sell their adolescent daughters.The only mystery left with this film is how long it will be before the studio lets the cat out of the bag: Kubrick clearly died some time before they'd even started filming. What we are left with is a two hour narcissistic w*nk video for Hollywood's dream couple.So what did we learn at school today? Kubrick, Kidman and Cruise all begin with a 'kuh' and masks just aren't scary any more.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Can a rubber dress save a film?
","This film comes close to being very good indeed. Slick action, ludicrous bad guys, massive special effects, PVC clothing and a cracking piece of french obscenity. Putain, mais c'est un 'winner', non?Non. Unfortunately it seriously lets itself down by forgetting to edit out the dross (with any luck the inevitable director's cut DVD special edition will be about 30 minutes shorter). Main whinges (spoilers potentially):I've been to a good many raves and festivals in my life (admittedly none in a cave that I can remember) - the allegedly hedonistic celebration in this film is more like a beneton advert. With a bit of a coffee commercial spliced in pretending to be a love scene.And between the raves and coffee, I've managed to study some philosophy - what you get here are platitudes delivered with hammy sincerity and age-long dramatic pauses. It's like captain kirk meets the littlest hobo.And where's the cutting edge I was promised? The alien-esque sets looked better in the alien films. The kung fu looked better in ... countless films frankly. And the bullet-time effects looked better in ... well, The Matrix.Still ... Monica Bellucci in rubber. I can hardly ask for my money back, can I?",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
