Despicable Me 2," A certain degree of disappointment
","I totally fell in love with Despicable Me. It's probably going to be on my list of Ten Best Films, so naturally I awaited with eagerness the premiere of Despicable Me 2. I watched all the trailers, teasers and Mini Movies with Minions - loved them all. Then I watched the film in full 3D.Oh dear...I always thought that there might be a problem with transforming Gru from a villain into a good guy, and I was right. Half of the humour in the original film was based on the fact that Gru is not a nice person.Unfortunately, he has now been sanitized, virtually recreated as a good suburban father, albeit with some extremely strange habits.Two of the best protagonists from the original film were ignored: Vector, last seen on the Moon with a polythene helmet on his head, and Dr. Nefario, who vanished for 95% of Despicable Me 2. Even Gru's mother, who had some wonderful cameo appearances in the original, was visible only once.So, continuity from Film 1 to Film 2 - virtually none.One of the great charms of the original film were the incredible inventions: the Farter Blaster thing, the Anti-gravity Serum, the boogie robots... This time there was nothing to take their place.With Vector and Pointy-haired Man from the Bank of Evil Gru had worthy opponents, but the villain of this film was an absolute non-entity - I can't even recall his name without looking it up. All of the tension and interplay between the characters in the first film were missing in this one.Another of the highlights of the first film was the music. Unfortunately, the soundtrack this time was completely forgettable, with the exception of a reprise of one of the songs from the original - Pretty Girls, I think it was called. Something like that... I was a bit busy yawning to note exactly which of the good songs it was. I just made a mental note and then went back to being slightly bored again.Yes, I enjoyed it, for a given value of 'enjoy'. Who could help but enjoy watching those darling little minions? But I left the cinema feeling cheated: Despicable Me deserved a better sequel, better music, a better story line and far better characterisation.I'm wavering between 5/10 and 6/10, but I'll plump for 6/10 because I actually liked the 3D effects. Without them I'd probably plump for 5/10",6,19,28,6 August 2013
Gravity," Sandra Bullock: A One-Woman Show
","I've been a fan of Sandra Bullock for years, but this is the first film in which she has really shown off her considerable acting talent.The film is 90 minutes long and I would estimate that Ms. Bullock was alone for about 65-70 minutes of it, which is no mean feat.My attention was held the whole time by her believable character, the wonderful effects, the slightly loopy physics and the sheer inventiveness of the CGI. And the 3D effects were simply marvellous.At first I thought that the film might run out of steam simply because of the lack of other characters, but the fight for survival was so palpable, so engaging, that I simply didn't even realise that the film was a one-woman show until after I had walked out of the cinema.If you see no other film this year, this is the one to see. And pay for 3D - it's worth every penny.",9,2,4,12 November 2013
Now You See Me," Best of the year so far
","I was intrigued by this film from watching the trailers. Loving magic, I decided that it would be worth seeing - and it was worth every penny for the ticket.Apart from the stunning magic and special effects, the most unusual part of this film is that there is no real lead character: most of the characters seem to take up roughly equal time on the screen, so no particular star seems to be carrying the story.That said, Morgan Freeman's role was very much an enlarged cameo performance, which he played magnificently. But then it's always a pleasure watching Morgan Freeman.The only thing that riled me was that, despite all the wonderful things in it, the story just didn't hang together: it simply didn't make sense, especially the ending. Normally this would drive me mad, but the film as a whole was so mesmerising, that I actually didn't realise that there were a million gaps and logical failures until I got home.I'm giving the film a solid 8/10, which would have been higher if just a little more time had been spent on working the plot through.All in all, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and, judging from the upcoming offerings, it's likely to remain that way until the 2014 releases his the big screen. So allow credulity to take a back seat and go to the cinema to enjoy probably the wildest ride available.",8,0,2,3 August 2013
1408," A one man show designed to make you think about the reality of terror
","First of all, I'd like to point out that this is not a horror film in the conventional sense: it is Stephen King at his most imaginative.John Cusack plays the role of a cynical writer bent on debunking haunted hotel/haunted mansion/haunted anything stories who receives a postcard from a New York hotel, The Dolphin on 45th and Lexington, with a warning not to stay in Room 1408. His interest piqued, he sets out to include this room as a closer for his latest book - 10 Haunted Hotels.Samuel Jackson plays a stunning cameo role as the hotel manager determined to prevent Cusack from staying in the room, even to the extent of giving him a file on all the deaths that have taken place in it. Nevertheless, Cusack won't be swayed.The rest of the film I leave for you to enjoy. It's a visual and directorial masterpiece where the viewer can have no idea what the ending is actually going to be, so I shall not spoil it for you here. Just remember, this film actually feels more like a one-man-show theatre piece than a fully-cast film. Stylistically it's claustrophobic with most of the weight of the plot being borne only by Cusack. Actually, everyone else in the film can really be regarded as having only cameo roles.I've only awarded 7/10 simply because I found the film rather uneven in tone in places and I have a tendency to dislike films where the ending isn't completely resolved. Otherwise I would give John Cusack a 10 for his excellent acting and another 10 for the exquisite decor",7,0,0,19 November 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," You can't beat lemur royalty
","I've been a huge fan of the Penguins of Madagascar series since the first episode and they led me to watch the original Madagascar films.As usual, the animation is perfect, the effects are incredible, but once again, it's the penguins and King Julien who really steal the show.The first scene that had me laughing out loud was the stealthy approach made by the Lion, the Hippo, the Giraffe and the Zebra into Monte Carlo Marina, closely followed by King Julien in a royal yacht with fireworks going off.The penguins and the apes created a marvellous figure of The King of Versailles to play at the gambling tables of the casino and also to buy the circus, which all the characters used as an escape vehicle to reach New York.Animal Control lunatic Mlle. Dubois was an amazing character, whose only interest was in getting a lion's head into her collection.The actual circus scenes, while beautifully executed, rather left me numb: Lack of thumbs is, actually, a problem. Not in Madagascar, however, and the trapeze acts, etc were done as though all the animals concerned had prehensile hands.Definitely worth watching.",10,1,3,26 September 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Absolutely brilliant!
","I never give a 10, ever, but this film is just perfect. I loved the beginning, I loved the entire plot and I loved the ending. I laughed, I rooted for the characters, I got a lovely surprise near the end when one of my favourite actresses appeared for a cameo role... The entire premise of the film is designed to actually make the viewer think. It's a gore-fest, but a gore-fest with meaning, with a message.Nothing is what it appears to be exactly and all the little twists and surprises only add to the sumptuous feeling that the film somehow manages to create.All thumbs up! Now go and watch it",10,3,7,5 November 2012
