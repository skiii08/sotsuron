United 93," Catharsis
","If only the scale went higher than 10. A 10 doesn't really do this film justice.Even though this film left me completely exhausted emotionally, United 93 also let me find peace in the heroism and sacrifice of the passengers who, while perishing in tragedy, were able to avert an even greater disaster. I honor their memory, and I am grateful I'm able to do so, in part, by having seen an amazing film.What made this film so great was its faithfulness to the events and dialogue that have been established as fact. This made the film so compelling because I got to see for myself what happened, what was said, the total humanness of all those involved. Another aspect I appreciated was how the film didn't pull any punches. It didn't gloss over any of the potentially controversial parts of the film. The military's pathetic response, the confusion at the FAA, all of that was laid out bare for all to see, and that only added to the legitimacy of this film.",10,0,2,10 September 2006
