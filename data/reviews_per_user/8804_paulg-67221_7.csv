The Blair Witch Project," A typical dull found footage film
","Before I start going to details I will disclose the fact I am not keen on found footage films (although I do like Chronicle that is not a horror film and I am yet to see Rec). I find them to be lazily made and boring. This film is no exception.The film follows 3 film students (Heather, Mike and Josh) who go out to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. Throughout the film they are tormented by supernatural forces and eventual die one by one. Their footage is found a year after they go missing.The premise sounds promising, however, the actual film is anything but. The vast majority of the film is just footage the 3 arguing and speaking awfully improvised dialogue.The acting is awful. I understand to increase realism they need to get unknowns to 'act'. The problem is all 3 of them cannot pull off a convincing performance nor did I ever care about the characters throughout. The fact that none of the 3 seem to still be acting today only proves my point.The big problem is not much happens throughout the film. The only potentially interesting moments are too few and far between. Considering most of the time the characters are messing about, all scenes that actually matter to the 'plot' could be condensed to about 10 minutes (that would be better but still awful). The film feels dull, I was never scared once throughout the entire film. This film generated a lot of buzz when it came out as did Paranormal Activity. Both films suck, I can't believe the masses gobble them up.The ending is abysmal. It's all built up and no pay off. So after Josh goes missing, Heather and Mike look for him. They look through a house, only for Mike to just look at the corner and Heather to die off screen dropping the camera. It is underwhelming and when the movie ended I thought to myself 'that was it?'.The problem I have with found footage films (especially this one) is that they are made cheaply and any mistake can easily be excused as 'being part of the film' because they require little to no craft whatsoever. This movie cost $60,000 to make. El Mariachi cost $7,000 to make. Not only is El Mariachi actually fun unlike this film, it had effort and planning go into it unlike this excuse of a movie. The Blair Witch Project looks and feels cheaper than it is whereas El Mariachi is amazing considering how limited it was. What does that say about this movie when I can think of a movie that was cheaper to make was made better? Overall, a waste of time and money. If you want good ultra low budget films stick to something like El Mariachi or Nolan's Following. 1/10.",1,4,7,16 May 2016
Zodiac," Good but not great
","I'll admit I do have an interest in unsolved crimes. It fascinates me that the Zodiac killer managed to escape arrest. I also admit that I like David Fincher's films. Having said this I feel this film was a disappointment. While it is good, it is perhaps one of Fincher's worst (Alien 3 and Panic Room being worse than this, both terrible).I'll start with the positive. After watching some behind the scenes footage, it is clear the level of effort that Fincher has put into this film. He recreated the crime scenes as close as he possibly could based on the evidence from the case. This film sparked my interest in the Zodiac killer and led me to find out more for myself.Robert Downey Jr was well cast in his role as was Mark Ruffalo.On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal was a poor choice for the lead. His performance was weak which is surprising considering that he has proved his acting ability in other films.I find it interesting Fincher chose to shoot this film on digital, however, I feel it hampered the film because the aesthetics did not give the film a retro feel. I think this film would have been better off being shot on celluloid in order to create a retro atmosphere.Although this may not put all of this film but all the killings take place within the first half an hour. This leaves 2 hours hunting for the killer. This itself is not a problem for me but there needs to be something to hold my interest which this film didn't do very well. It's just if you show the murders, it should be spread out. If you want an interesting film about hunting a serial killer by Fincher check out Se7en (which is fantastic) or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (not as good as Se7en but still very well done despite its flaws).I feel the ending should have been left open. Considering the Zodiac killer was never caught I think the film should have perhaps ended with a scene of the characters talking about how they may never find out. But this film uses Leigh Allen as a fictional culprit based on Robert Graysmith's assumptions. I admit it is possible but Graysmith was a cartoonist not an investigator so I am sceptical of his claim. Also, many people claim to have solved the case blaming different individuals so anyone could have been chosen as the culprit and it would have made no difference. I know From Hell chose a fictional culprit but From Hell wasn't trying to be historically accurate unlike this film.In the end, this film was better when I re-watched it, however, I believe for the reasons I mentioned above that the film failed to live up to its potential considering it's great cast (minus Gyllenhall's performance) and David Fincher's direction.",6,0,0,24 August 2015
The Hateful Eight," Good but a little over-rated
","This is a Tarantino film so right of the bat, this film has good dialogue and music. Morricone's score is good (not his best but I've heard worse by him). And the cinematography is good (it was shot in 70mm after all).Now, I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to explain why I feel this film is over-rated.The movie is set almost entirely in one location and is mostly people talking to one another. On paper this doesn't sound too bad, Reservoir Dogs was mostly in one location and is mostly people talking to one another. But Reservoir Dogs is more interesting and was a lot shorter. Keeping a film in mainly one location is feasible. 90 - 100 minutes? Yes. 3 hours? No. There's very little to keep interest throughout the movie, Reservoir Dogs solved this problem by using flashbacks regularly at different locations to keep it interesting.It also takes half an hour to get the plot moving. That's a sixth of the film's running time devoted to getting to the location. Here's a better way of doing it: have John Ruth's carriage arrive at the Haberdashery right after the opening credits. There, I got them to the location without wasting half an hour. At most, it should only take 10 minutes to get the plot moving. In that time, I could watch an episode of The Simpsons with a complete, satisfying story.Why was this film shot on 70mm? It looks good but there isn't much justification to use it. It would have better suited Kill Bill (Volume 1 at least), Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained. There is nothing visually that could warrant 70mm. Say what you want about Nolan but his use of 70mm and IMAX is justified because he makes large-scale action films.One particular silly moment was when Michael Madsen's character confessed to poising the coffee very quickly. The film may as well not setting up the mystery if the perpetrator will admit to it so quickly.When Channing Tatum didn't show up and his name was in the credits, I suspected he would show up as a surprise villain. I was right. He was under the floorboards. I also figured out Michael Madsen's character poised the coffee, my logic was wrong but I still got it right. But to Tarantino's credit, I was surprised John Ruth was killed so early on.I gave this film a 7/10 because I do like it and I have to admit that it is well crafted, despite over indulgent.",8,1,4,3 September 2016
Being John Malkovich," Different, well made but loses strength as it goes on
","This film is well made. Great performances, great idea and an exceptional film for a first-time director.The best thing about the movie is that John Malkovich agreed to play a parody of himself. I admire that he was willing to do this film (after a few years of refusing to star in it).The idea: John Cusack's character finds a portal that leads to John Malkovich's mind. This idea is funny and had potential.The performances by the actors are good. John Cusack did a great job as Craig Schwartz. Cameron Diaz did a great job as Craig's wife, Lotte. John Malkovich did a great job as John Malkovich.However, the weakness of the film is that the story gets weaker as it goes on. At the beginning of the film, Craig is presented sympathetically: he is a struggling puppeteer. But by the end of the film, I stopped caring about him (his obsession with his co-worker, Maxine and locking his wife in a cage played a part in this). The same is for Lotte: at the star of the film she is portrayed as a caring person (especially towards her numerous pets) but by the end of the film I stopped caring (her obsession with Craig's co-worker Maxine played a part in this).SPOILERS START: I think the film went a little overboard with the craziness. At first John Cusack discovers the portal behind a filing cabinet. The portal is a small door hidden under a panel. Later in the film it is revealed a group of old people were going to enter the portal at midnight on John Malkovich's 44th birthday. The problem is the portal being a small door was surrealist enough and did not require an addition plot element.I think the film's idea was strong enough not to have additional plot lines like immortality through changing bodies (suppose the 'vessel' they are using dies in an accident or gets a disease - not a secure method and why midnight on the 44th birthday? The human brain stops developing in the 20s - why not then? They'll be in that 'vessel' far longer). The wife's romance with the lady at Craig's workplace (in John Malkovich's body). Craig controlling Malkovich's boy for 8 months (makes him very unlikable as well as caging his wife, also when he leaves Malkovich's body he looks like he would have had he stayed only 15 minutes - considering he was controlling Malkovich after some practice, he is a puppeteer, does that mean he was separate? He must have been as Malkovich was aware that he wasn't in control. Also he would have been reported missing). The rules of the portal are not clearly explained - it allows you to enter John Malkovich's mind for 15 minutes to somehow allowing people to stay longer if they really want to (how silly is that, considering those who enter the portal are willing to pay $200 for the experience?). Maxine was unlikable in the first place and the fact she's manipulative and gets a happy ending bothered me.SPOILERS OVER: Despite my problems, I would still recommend at least a watch to make up your mind. It's still a good film (although I probably won't watch it again). Considering that it's hugely popular and praised, obviously some people enjoy it.",5,2,4,2 May 2016
District 9," Doesn't deserve to be in the Top 250
","This film is completely overrated. Although it has an interesting concept and visuals, what destroys the film is the main character. The main character is annoying and hugely unlikeable. Because of this I do not feel any sympathy for him throughout the film. The story is simplistic but a simple story doesn't affect the film's quality if it is done in an interesting and entertaining way. The film tried to do this by adding interviews in the style a documentary. The film loses points for this because I feel this only works for films to add some realism. Considering the fact this is a science fiction film, this technique doesn't fit in my opinion. The science fiction genre allows the possibility to show the world with visuals rather than being told about it (2001 and Blade Runner are excellent examples of visual storytelling in the sci-fi genre).3/10.",1,2,4,16 July 2015
28 Days Later...," 7.5 is a fair score
","I feel that 7.5 is a fair score for this film (at the time of writing the score is currently 7.6).The story is simple: Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma to find London abandoned and to discover that a blood-borne infection has spread throughout the United Kingdom. It is widely known that Danny Boyle had used standard definition digital cameras to film this. Although this means that the film is perhaps not worth getting on blu-ray (I have only seen this film on DVD so I cannot judge blu-ray quality), I like the look of it. I feel the look fits the film perfectly while giving it an interesting aesthetic. On a personal note, I feel the opening explanation of animal activists releasing rage- infected monkeys was not needed. I personally felt the film was more of a survivor story and do not believe the explanation was needed. This is personal preference and does not affect the overall quality of the film.I feel the film loses quality for two things: the girl's (Hannah) acting and the ending. It is widely known that child actors are usually bad but when objectively reviewing this film, her emotionless delivery of lines impacts the film such as the scene of her father's (Frank) death. That scene was one of the best moments of the film, the music was well used and Brendan Gleason's acting skills are very good. However, the moment when she says 'Dad' took me out of the moment due to being poorly delivered when she should have been highly emotional after losing a father.The ending was out of place. Not only was it obviously shot on film so it was visually out of place but the scene's tone does not match the rest of the film. In it Hannah, Selena and Jim are shown at a cottage where they try to signal a plane to rescue them. The original ending showed Jim dying after being shot and Hannah and Selena leaving to survive on their own. I don't hate happy endings but in the case of this film I thought the original ending was much better, even Danny Boyle believed this to be the superior ending. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and watch it often. The concept is good, I like the aesthetic, the music is excellent and it succeeded at making me care for the characters (something very few horrors do). I highly recommend this film.",8,2,3,15 July 2015
Unbroken," Unbroken is a broken film
","Despite looking great this film is very bland. The film seemed to me that it was trying to be beautiful rather than accurately portray the horrors of war. I feel the film held back, in one scene a American POW is what with a stick by a Japanese guard however, the beating is off-screen. I feel had the beating been on-screen then the film would benefit from showing the brutality of prison camps in WWII.The main Japanese guard was one-dimensional. There were absolutely no redeeming qualities about him. It is very black and white. It shows the evil of the Japanese guards but paints the main character as a saint. At the end of the film it states Louie (the main character) struggled with PTSD and eventually turned to Christianity and forgave his captors. What it doesn't tell you is that he also battled alcoholism and only gave up because his wife threatened to leave him. A film that pops to mind to compare this film to is My Way. While both films are sentimental, My Way had at least the courage to show the brutal side of war and POW camps and show that their are decent and horrible people on both sides of war. At least in My Way the characters eventually learn to respect each other and their relationship develops throughout the film. In this movie, it seems Louie respects the main guard but no reason is given to actually earn any respect.The title is false. The main character is clearly broken. About an hour in when he is first captured, he soon freaks out in his small cell. Coupled with the fact that the movie even states he suffered with depression, war did clearly break him. This movie tries to be so inspirational but it fails to do even that.It's a nice looking film that tries to be inspirational. However, it's holding back and feels dishonest. Yeah, it may be pretty but I would rather have a war film that doesn't hold back like Full Metal Jacket than a film that glosses over war in favour of looking pretty.6/10 (I would rate it lower but the cinematography is good so it would feel unfair to give it a lower rating.)Edit: After some thought, I have concluded that a 5/10 is fairer and more accurate as the cinematography is the only thing going for this film, everything else is sub-par.
