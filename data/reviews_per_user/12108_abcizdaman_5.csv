Ford v Ferrari," Great History Lesson and a Fun Watch!
","This movie was a great documentary of what actually happened, and I learned a lot. I've always loved the Ford GT and Shelby products. I have a 2014 Mustang myself. I like the fact that people were real in this movie.. acted like and looked at things the way they probably did back then. Everybody wants what they want, and some people end up getting burned because of it. This is corporate America. It's not the 2000s when people started getting greedy. They always have been. It's unfortunate how things turned out for Ken Miles. Feel sorry for the guy. All in all a great movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end.",9,2,3,30 January 2020
The New World," Meh..
","Very vivid scenes and great costumes. Other than that.. the story was very long and drawn out. A lot of the time people didn't talk, they just thought. Either that or just some long drawn out scenes with a long music score. The music was nice but went on too long when people could be acting. Sometimes I didn't know whether people were thinking or talking to each other. Good thing I was streaming it, because I had to rewind a lot to figure out what was being said. You have this 5 minute scene of people just standing, looking, or doing something else with no talking/thinking and then all of a sudden things are said and I have to rewind. I used closed caption which was perfect for this one, because otherwise I'd probably be lost. It could've been a great movie. I can understand why I've never heard of this one before. Several well known actors in it too. A lot less silence and people staring at each other and I would've really enjoyed it.",6,0,0,1 February 2020
3:10 to Yuma," Great Western, One of the Better Ones
","Russell Crowe movies are hit and miss sometimes, but that's because of the producers mostly. He's a great actor. So is Christian Bale. I have yet to see the original, but this movie had a great story and definitely an authentic 1800s Western feel. Not that I'd know but I imagine. Anyway there's a lot of human/humane reflection in this movie though there's some bad stuff too. All in all good mainly prevailed, and I can't get enough of this movie.",9,0,0,22 April 2020
The Witch," Good and Not So Good
","At the beginning and until the end the movie had me very interested. Once the dad died I was starting to get annoyed. A lot of questions went unanswered... What's the deal with the witch in the woods? What happened to the twins? Where did the black goat come from? The rest I could pretty much deal with. It was suspenseful and very interesting. Great screenplay and acting, but I was let down in the end. Too many unanswered questions. It felt a lot like The Village, but that movie made more sense in the end. Unless there's a follow-up movie that will explain everything, I didn't much care for this one.",6,0,1,1 January 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Great Old Time Feel Movie!!
","For awhile I saw this in the video stores back when they were a thing but never picked it up. I just didn't know how good it was or what kind of movie it was. Didn't think of looking it up on the net either. Anyway as you all know this is related to the Odyssey. It's a great story, has great old timey music, is very comical, and just a good feel watch. It never gets old to me. I watch it at least twice a year. Give it a watch if you haven't. Unless you hate any of the things I mentioned, you'll love this movie too!",10,1,1,2 May 2020
