The Blair Witch Project," I spent $7.00 on a very bad headache.
","I was very excited about seeing this movie. I read wonderful reviews, and I couldn't wait to see it. I tried to see it for three days, but it was sold out every time I tried to buy tickets.When I went in the theater it was so crowded, I had to sit on the second row jam packed between lots of people. Sitting this close made me very sick due to all the movement of the camera. I am not sure if I would have gotten so sick elsewhere, but I would have still been annoyed. With all the running around the camera is rarely focused, so the movie can be a little confusing and very annoying.I usually get scared very easily, and I hate those stupid gore films. Real horror like the Alfred Hitchcock scares me like crazy. I usually have to wait for horror films to come out on video because I get too scared in the theater. Well this movie did not scare me one time. The only thing near scary was that awful Heather screaming at the top of her lungs over and over.I suppose that Josh and Mike seemed like real people for most of the film, but Heather was being a bad actress. The whole point of the film was to seem realistic, and she was over reacting the whole time. If she had any common sense at all they never would have gotten lost. That character was overdone and very annoying. After awhile all I kept thinking was my god when will she ever die already.I read some of the other comments and someone said if you didn't like the movie you didn't understand it. I payed good attention, and I understood exactly what happened at the end. I was still disappointed with it. I heard many people saying 'Thats the end??' or 'What the hell??' I even heard a bunch of people yelling boo at the end of it.This movie may have been ok on tv, but I wish I didn't pay my money to see it. The friends I saw it with feel the same way. Maybe I will learn not to pay attention to hype. Then maybe I wont rush out to see a stupid movie.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
