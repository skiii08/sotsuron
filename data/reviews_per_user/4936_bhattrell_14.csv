Moneyball," Moneyball (8.5/10) ' Good family film without enough drama'.
","A true tale with great morals. To begin with, I felt the 2hr duration may have been overkill, and feel drawn out and protracted. Throughout the film however, it grew on me like a wall flower, not a fungus.The actors played their part well, with some good names filling the main places on the lineup. You feel the tension well emotionally, and in anticipation.Family relations are heart-warming, and the film creates a great atmosphere for the viewer throughout. Difficult to fault, all-in-all. The plot could perhaps have a couple more twists and turns. Music appeared a little bit of a missed opportunity here too.Overall, a movie well worthy of a watch. I'd recommend certainly.",8,0,0,12 May 2019

'Plot in middle lacked a little adventure'.IntroductionCloverfield is a highly atypical movie series. The first 2008 movie simply called 'Cloverfield' is nothing like the 2016 sequel we review today. These movies surprise and entertain in a way unlike almost any other sci-fi/Horror movie. Today the 2nd Cloverfield movie '10 Cloverfield lane', takes centre stage.StorylineThe storyline is too simple. Yes it details backstories, includes characters well, and surprises with deceit and changing character viewpoints. For me though, it feels slow in the middle and the ending lets it down. The setting is clearly restrictive, which doesn't help it's limited mid-section action.GenreThe surprisingly reliable 'Wikipedia' defines 10 Cloverfield lane as a 'Psychological horror ... with science fiction elements'. This 2016 release I'd define as simply a Thriller/Sci-fi. Thriller, since it tricks the mind, and Sci-fi because of it's dystopian setting.
Whilst it isn't what you'd expect from a standard horror movie, it has a slightly dark theme. Still not really a horror though ...CharactersThe characters are very well played, and they need to be. The one-dimensional setting throughout, means good acting is essential here. In this way, the film doesn't disappoint. With few characters, the diversity is very effective here and helps with the psychological elements.
The characters and behaviour, with heart-felt emotion, are difficult to fault, and keep surprising you.MusicThe music is used effectively to build tension, yet isn't overused. Types include 'Epic high suspense' tracks, and 'Calming everyday tracks'. Silence is used on multiple occasion, with good effectiveness. Additional sound effects throughout, may have increased tension at times, but on the whole, music fits the plot well.SummaryKeeps you questioning character values.

IntroLast weeks horror review was It comes at night. I rated this 2017 American horror film 8/10. Today we review 'IT', a pretty shocking 2017 horror movie.StorylineThe storyline is actually very stimulating. There are plenty of mysterious twists and turns until everything is neatly sewn up at the end. On the whole, IT is difficult to fault (pun intended).The ending could have flown a little quicker, and settings could have been mixed up more for greater variety. Scenes were consistently entertaining though, courtesy of both a well-formulated storyline, great acting, and good visual effects. This made the film a good watch for those eager for mystery and thought while viewing.Storyline was split between characters lives and evil events unfolding, which prevented a theme of just one thread. This meant dull moments were dormant throughout. Unlike evil. Mwah ha ha.GenreHorror is the billed genre, and is certainly the correct classification for this movie. 'IT' wouldn't fit anything else (pun intended), and that is part of it's elegance.CharactersThe film is both poetic and artistic, with costume, colours, and blood patterns, all appearing maximally macabre. Character count is high and group's of individuals all retain individuality throughout. This is despite unity of beliefs, at times, which shows effective script writing and casting.
Relationships are used well, with both testing and loving themes at times. Both strategically employed. Evil is depicted in a variety of ways, preventing boredom during tension building.MusicSound effects and music are used fittingly throughout. Eerie and happy music blends into the captivating watch, that is this entire film. More could have been done near the ending to retain interest though. Light effects complemented the music well.SummaryIneffably macabre, ending a little mediocre.Follow us: Reasea dot org",9,0,0,11 September 2019
Zootopia," 'Exciting, light-humoured action in a Spectacular Kingdom'
","Zootopia film review 'Enticing, exciting, adventure and action in a spectacular virtual world' (9/10)Setting the scene From the word go the visually stimulating Kingdom and characters allowed me to quickly settle into the storyline. The costume and likeness to real relationships especially father- daughter were light-hearted and heart warming. Following the character introduction, action adventure was quickly eased into with help from the music. Defying convention was a quickly woven-in feature of the film with the main characters choices quickly going against the norm. This really acted as a great hook for future endeavours. Main body The storyline was simple and clear. The plot was complex enough however to not unveil too much too early keeping me guessing throughout the film. In parts, the mood was a little predictable yet small flourishes of light-hearted humour, with great effects in the well created virtual world, kept me well entertained. The music continued well and the tempo of the film was fast enough for an enjoyable action, yet not confused by rushing for effect. The balance between happiness and turmoil was just right, avoiding an excessive bout of isolated trouble that some childish films typically suffer from. This made the film enjoyable for family yet not just accessible for all. The variety in the characters, their mode of speech and personality was great and helped transport me into their lives. They each had roles in fictional society and well created costumes to match these. A few well known actors were also involved in assisting their portrayal. Scene changes were dynamic and frequent to assist the films good tempo providing stimulation for the viewer. Relationships were dealt with nicely with only a hint of possible future romance. This was good since it helped the movie tone Remain in keeping with the action genre distracting the viewer or plot goal. Music The music was up-beat with a strong tempo and was great for the start of any happy adventure. Shakira Try everything seemed like a great choice ... As the story unfolded, the music was adjusted accordingly and appeared to fit in well with most of the scenes. The subtlety of the music in darker times made it less memorable yet left the effects no less effective. Ending The ending was quite appropriate for an unpredictable action film. The resolution to the plot issues was not expected and therefore highly entertaining. Summary Overall a clear story with entertaining plot quirks. It has great potential to produce a sequel. It was seriously difficult to find fault with since the created world and characters shouted as much diversity as the dynamic scene and setting locations with their stories. The film captured my imagination, transported me to another world, intellectually stimulated me with light humour and kept me thoroughly entertained with an interesting plot and storyline. Close resemblance in theme likeness to other action films appeared to show perhaps, a slight oversight in creativity. The lack of memorable music for sadder or darker scenes were my only other criticisms.",9,4,6,30 May 2017
Resident Evil," Lacking the tension to accompany enemies' -(5.5/10).
","The Good'Clever plot'.
'Storyline explained quite well'.
'Plot understandable'.
'Good creature design'.
'Varying environments'.The Bad'Mediocre acting'.
'Emotion not believable'.
'Film length too great'.
'Effects very poor'.
'Some necessary information omitted'.
'Music lacking'.
'No unexpected plot turns'.Resident evil is the first, of a long film series of action-horror films. Released: 2002. Having reviewed, I wouldn't recommend though.StorylineThe story was well introduced, so the background could be clearly understood. Often, horror films neglect the setting, so this was positive. It didn't however, go into any detail prior to weird and wonderful creatures appearing. This made the context of some lifeforms, impossible to comprehend. It meant, you couldn't understand where some creatures had emerged from, or how they came into being. Some of the film was rendered tame, because of this.
The storyline involved multiple locations which was good, but this didn't add much enjoyment overall.
The plot was a simple, yet clever, idea. One that should have lead to tense circumstances regularly. It could have been far better used however. The plot, whilst good, in my opinion for the significant film length, had to be epically supported by tension building effects such as strange sounds, changing lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses. Long horror films do rely on such quality, which was sadly absent here.TensionAt moments of attack, things should have been suspenseful. Creatures did allow tension to be created at a few sweet spots, but these were seldom regular. Special camera angles or effects would have helped increase tension. Music was barely used, and the infected creatures didn't make noises effectively enough, to create a tense atmosphere. Lighting wasn't varied enough, and injured struggles weren't prevalent.
I wanted to believe character adrenaline, but I'm still not truly convinced they had any.
CharactersA wide variety of creatures and infected humans were encountered, and some facial expressions were effective. A lack of stress under the circumstances, actually made it unrealistic though. The character make-up and creature movements however, appeared sleek and interesting. Creature body forms seemed well considered and should have been intimidating. Characters seemed fairly well played, with a few stand outs, using facial expressions well to combat fairly unimaginative, camera angles.
There were some close-ups used effectively, albeit very rarely. Enemies weren't unpredictable, and generally attacked as expected. Not helping the fear factor.All settings were well lit, and shadows weren't used. A lack of subtle suggestion then, didn't put you on edge. Certain scenes were horrific and gory, yet didn't elicit a believable horrified reaction, from peers or the viewer. Again, sound effects to accompany gore, just weren't there !SummaryTension building effects such as strange sounds, varying lighting, unpredictable occurrences, and appropriately fearful responses were lacking. They couldn't lift a variety of imaginative characters and creatures, beyond a fairly uninteresting entity.",5,1,3,14 December 2018

The Bad'Intro too long'.
'Horror theme too sparse at beginning'.
'Not enough plot changes'.
'Slow build up to ending'.IntroductionClimax is a 2018, Drama and Horror movie, according to IMDb. It's produced in France, which mandates watching with subtitles on, if indeed you only speak English like me.StorylineFrom the word go, horror and music themes are suggested casually. Voices and temperaments are clearly engaging, from the opening instant. A clever beginning.
Ideas to be taken further, are quickly introduced, giving you a clear sense of the main movie themes. This provides a hook to retain the viewer. Introduction is slightly too long however.
Following this, things retain interest and intensity, but the plot is slow to progress, which after a time makes things appear tiresome.
Following a slightly mediocre centre, the film progresses towards the ending nicely. Themes such as gore were well implemented here, with despair, stress, profound sadness, fear, and anger. Labelling sections with title pages throughout, also adds something. Not many films feature this.GenreThe progression of horror vibes after the opening was too slow. It took far too long for anything shocking to occur. In parts, the film was more Drama or Adventure focused than Horror, sadly.
From the middle though, the genre became more and more of a Horror, until it actually earned it's reputation as a great film. It was very unusual in it's set of themes, but eventually lived up to it's name. It was in fact, difficult to tell exactly when it became a true horror, but once the whole film had elapsed, it almost certainly did.CharactersCharacters quickly differentiated themselves by their responses to questions asked. This allowed the viewer a way into their personalities, which emotionally seemed nicely variable.
The character emotions were tested hugely from middle to end. As the film name suggests, it does build up to a 'Climax'. It's a shame that the beginning half an hour, didn't provide sufficient horror themes, leaving the viewer only partly engaged. Thankfully though, from this point onwards: Pleasure, satisfaction, fear, despair, grief and turmoil, all ensued. Characters were well portrayed throughout, and really sculpted a distinctive signature for the film. It's one you'll struggle to forget.MusicEerie music from the word go, ramping up to more sinister tones. Contrast used well. Music was a central theme throughout, helping its variability.
From middle to end, the music really develops into it's own. Becoming a haunting backdrop for the horror themes that develop. The overall soundtrack is a real triumph, and very cleverly created and selected.Summary'Fabulous conclusion and profoundly unique'.Follow us: Reasea dot orgTags:Comedy, horror, thriller, horror movie review, monster, monster party, 2018 horror review, gory horror, monsters, clowns, clown horror, dungeons, Micky, reaseaorg, benandthegang, Fossafitness, followus, moviefans, reasonedandseasoned, hey Micky, Mickytheclown, adrift, open water, open water 2, no sharks ?, climax, french movies,",9,0,1,11 October 2019
Get Out," Real, honest, emotional and eerie.
",The movie was emotional and heart felt from the outset. Romantic themes are present throughout showing how love can be wrecked by tragedy. The music builds tension well and the characters are distinctive and unique. Control is a key theme throughout which gets transferred regularly. This keeps things engaging and shows how easy it is for sides to change. The plot is anything but heart felt and is certainly sinister enough to warrant the horror genre. All parts seem played well by the cast and the movie doesn't scrimp on effects or acting/ surrounding scene quality. Perhaps it's appeal is how real it seems both emotionally and through strong acting . scenes eliminate the need for gimmicks and gremlins.,8,10,19,5 September 2017
Room," Slow paced and emotional but not a horror
","Room film review (6.5/10) ' Slow paced, emotional, but not a horror'. Room is a film which had good tension at times. It had a brilliant outlook on relationships which slowly grew throughout the film. As for the plot, I can't hide the fact that I was a little disappointed that there weren't enough twists in the tail. It is also a little slow to progress for such a long film. As for any horror, it should have the fear factor and for me this just wasn't there. With the slow pace, things remained on a level and dare I say it, were a little dull. The ending and latter part of the film was far better than the first, due to a more interesting storyline though. Music and effects could have enhanced things aswell as a more varied camera angle. Some cut scenes or other characters would have helped keep things more entertaining for the duration of the film. SummaryOverall barely a horror but a story which does capture the imagination and heart, if you are patient with it.",Null,0,1,5 January 2018
The Mist," ' Great emotions, good effects but a little long and dull at times'. (8/10)
","The Mist film review (8/10) ' Great emotions, good effects but a little long and dull at times'. The Mist is a 2007 sci-fi horror film. In my opinion it is an average horror but better as a sci-fi as it is believable, yet not consistently scary. Plot The plot was a basic concept but well executed to emphasise emotions and feelings, whilst maintaining tension. It was fairly consistent throughout, but enough variation in the setting, was applied to maintain interest throughout most of the movie. Themes such as racism and religion were carefully employed and likened to society of today. The people in their actions seemed to effectively mimic reality, keeping things believable in a surreal scenario. Music Music was absent for most of the movie. The quiet allowed emotive words to have real impact though, and the acting to be carefully observed. It was used well for eerie scenes, and seemingly impossible events were backed up with religious music. Overall the music complemented the themes of the film well. Setting and effects The setting was an everyday mundane location, making the events unfolding unexpected. This acted as a good surprise hook to entice the viewer to keep with the film, following the introduction. As time went on the setting became more consistent yet the strength of characters kept things interesting enough to prevent boredom. The horror was a little too limited at times however, bearing in mind the setting and long movie length. It perhaps needed a little more shock value in places. Particularly around the 1 hour mark, I found this to be the case. The effects for a 2007 film seemed very well done and for some peculiar life forms this did indeed feel as realistic as possible. The setting was used well to play on emotions and relationships. It also gave a sense of tension. It didn't merit the 2-hour movie duration however, which was why certain parts felt a little dull. Emotions were not especially effective when people were busy, and seemed to die off at times. In times of tension however, or greater excitement, the emotions also became more believable. The movie ended in a slightly predictable fashion, although the strength of emotion made this really heart- felt which left me feeling that the film was definitely worth the watch. Summary 
I would recommend watching this film as a mixture of horror, sci-fi, and almost reality drama in a way. For the film however, the duration was too long and the enemies a little sparse. Certain parts needed greater excitement and more emotion. Overall this was exciting though, and capable of keeping an interested viewer throughout.",8,0,1,22 April 2018

The characters moods created tension at times, but more personality would be needed to connect with all the family. The atmosphere shifted well in times of trouble, which was refreshing and invigorating towards the climax. All in all, a good atmosphere for the most part was maintained.MusicThe music was often spritely and happy, encouraging the viewer into the setting. It was a little too refrained during protracted parts though. Towards the end it was used as a true symbol of family, which appeared the intended audience for the film. At this time it was rather appropriate.PlotThe plot was understandable, yet too basic for a whole-family target audience. It had one key idea underpinning the whole film. This idea had good morality, but wasn't developed enough until close to the end. Therefore the plot was insufficient to provide a great film throughout the entirety, yet provided a solid foundation for a good film.The characters were well played, with good expressions and emotions. A lack of character development was apparent for too long though. Too much information was revealed towards the end, which could have made slower parts of the film more enjoyable. At this time though, the plot was interesting, the music and colours were good, and even the story's complexity increased slightly, to a good family audience level. The middle 40 minutes could've benefitted from some of this hugely.GraphicsThe graphics were the highlight. Colour was generously used to draw attention to the beauty of the setting. Colours used, were calm and tranquil, including purples and pinks in the early stages, into a much brighter repertoire, symbolising the excitement in the latter parts of the film.SummaryA greatly colourful film with creative ideas in the latter stages. Some twists and turns before the end, and a clearly understandable plot. Let down by limited character development and a lack of story progression in the middle stages.

The Descent," (8/10)- ' Good storyline, tense at times with okay acting'.
","The Descent 2005 review ' Good storyline, tense at times with okay acting'. (8/10)Quite a pathetic beginning, with a lot of unnecessary details. The main concept was set out clearly though which helped the sense of adventure. It was a long while before the horror seemed to truly build, yet tension was met early on cleverly at a lower level. 
The sort of film which only gets better as time goes on. The lack of music and diverse range of gore, horror and despair worked well to keep the viewer entertained throughout the adventure. Relationships played a key part of the outcome and the film did well in bringing out personalities, and how they differed in traumatic moments. The film gives you a sense of context aswell throughout, keeping you aware of the significance of what is going on. The title is good and reflects enough to describe the themes of the movie, without spoiling the plot. I would have liked a little more music in tense moments and some modern effects in places as well. Cliff hangers were given which provided the opportunity for a sequel. I wouldn't rule out watching it based on this film. While in the opening the acting was a little overplayed, the expressions did get better throughout. The film could have given more tension, and became scarier with better acting. Overall the movie storyline was good, the acting wasn't great, but the tension was built well, with clever use of the camera and setting. I would recommend certainly for those into adventure horror as it is one of the better ones I've seen. For those looking for a truly epic film though, you may wish to look elsewhere.",Null,1,2,20 January 2018

I am now travelling into a magical world in the Pacific. A world unlike anything my senses have ever witnessed. Prepare for THE Kong: Skull island movie review !!!A 2017 Fantasy Sci-fi, with lots of action and massive creatures worth a watch ?You bet son...Yeah, I mean the film was cool. Good music, good characters, good scenery. There were quite a few weaknesses but none that a mountain-sized gorilla couldn't cover up ... See more below:StorylineThe storyline, without giving too much away, was understandable for all the family. It was frustratingly basic for the Uber intelligent though. Yes it had action, pretty good effects and graphics, and a few key events with different settings. Beyond this though, there was something missing. I'm guessing it wasn't a mountain-sized ape, but more likely, stuff which could've happened that wasn't made so predictable.Part of the blame lies with the script here.
For example, If you say:
'When I go to the park, there will be a kid on a swing'.
Then go to the park, and when you get there and Ryan is indeed (on the swing), that discovery isn't particularly dramatic. It doesn't say ...
BOOM !!
like a surprise.
More
'Oh right, yeah'.The rest of the blame, lies with the actual events that happened, not having enough going on. Maybe a few more creatures or natural events would've compensated for this ...Fortunately, the scenery was changed regularly. With characters travelling quite a bit. This was a good touch, and certainly made things more entertaining.
GenreAs for a Sci-fi/fantasy, the film was good. All characters had excellent graphics and effects. The genre was only let down by the number of characters that existed. There certainly could have been quite a lot more. This would have made the fantasy even more fantastic. I would say, this would be better categorised as an action/fantasy rather than Sci-fi, because despite some scientists being involved, there is very little science actually in the film. At least compared to the level of action.
CharactersThe lead roles had good diversity and plenty of character personalities, with ideas coming to light throughout. The interactions were insightful enough to regret characters being harmed, yet were slightly basic.
I'd suggest a few less characters, to improve the emotional connection to their roles.
Despite this ...
The costume variety only enhanced this aspect of the film, and with a few big names, the characters were on the whole well-played.MusicThe music was applied where necessary, to compensate for less action. With restraint at times, where other sounds were more significant to the impact of the scene. This is an area frequently underperformed, but for this film, the balance of when music was played, and it's type, was effectively incorporated.

Warm Bodies," Clever, witty borderline comedy with appeal for horror and romance fans
","When looking for horror this did not look like a good choice. The cover did not feature some creepy mannequin or demon. The film from the word go entices you in with the characters and psychologically tests your preconceptions about zombies and the paranormal. You will be taken on a journey building understanding and empathy for the characters along with a healthy degree of gore and humour. The characters and plot clearly have been well thought out and the main actor and actress are stunning and dramatic in performance. The flow of the movie is great since it is not slow to pick up the story line. The story line is unexpected and interesting and keeps you guessing throughout and changing your own perception of good and bad. I certainly do not regret sitting down and getting thoroughly engrossed.Well planned, well played, should appeal to many",9,0,0,6 March 2017
