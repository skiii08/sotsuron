The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring with some good ideas
","First of all I didn't read any of the books. But I liked the first and the second movie. The plot is really what's holding the movie back. The acting, the scenery and the overall editing are great. The plot is really boring. However there are some great ideas which aren't really elaborated. In my opinion the movie shouldn't have follow the book so strict. It could've taken some liberties and explore the ideas more adequate. Then there are some new characters which aren't really introduces so I didn't feel attached to them. Other characters, I really liked, from the second movie appear only for a couple of minutes and don't add a lot to the overall plot. Although they really seemed important in the second movie. Another thing that bugs me, was that every 10 minutes or so someone started to cry. I get it, it's a tough life but I don't enjoy watching a movie about crying kids. Short: The movie has some good moments but overall it lacks something.",4,23,35,22 November 2014
