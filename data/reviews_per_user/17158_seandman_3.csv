Alien 3," Most suspenseful of the series.
","The first one was the horror flick. The second was the action flick. This one was the suspense/character piece flick. The fourth one was the Hollywood flick.Honestly, I don't see what people miss in this one; maybe people just aren't patient anymore. This is closer to the first than the second, and almost as good, except that Alien was pure psychological horror, with startling moments and Alien 3 was pure suspense as you waited to see where the characters were going and how this crew of this isolated, miserable rock would be able to cope with this unstoppable creature. How people like the first and not the third, I'll never know. One receives praise while the other is knocked for the exact same reasons. For example: They were both slow-paced, they both had one alien, they both centered on the characters, rather than just setting up for the next action scene. I loved Aliens, but that's pretty what it was. What befuddles me even more is how many people claim the fourth one is better. I mean, an Alien film with sight gags? COME ON!! At least this had a serious note and competent writing.",Null,0,3,22 October 2000
Unbreakable," Isn't anyone patient anymore?
","This movie was really good. It moved slowly as to develop the characters, and the ending was out of nowhere. It was, however, a thinking mans surprise. Each actor understood where their character was going. Jackson was the man who was broken both in spirit and body. Willis was the character who's path had always been unclear to him; who's pain was always unnamed until Jackson showed him the way. In ways, it felt like the first part of a larger story, and I've heard there are talks of sequels. If and when they do come out with those, I think this film will be reviewed much better in hindsight. Overall, a 9 out of 10. I really liked it.",Null,0,0,26 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An explanation for those who didn't get it
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based not only on Chinese Mythology, but of Zen as well. Zen is a philosophy that professes that in truth everything is substance, but substance is nothingness, therefore everything is nothingness, and nothingness is everything (This is EXTREMELY basic, but that's the main idea). As such, our goals in this life should be centering the spirit and discovering our nature within the universe. Once we have done this, thus are we enlightened, and we discover how everything before that moment was empty and nothing, and can now move on to purifying the spirit and working towards the next stage of enlightenment. It's a deep and dense philosophy that takes many people a lifetime to understand and master, and I guarantee a bunch of people who read this will think it's stupid because they weren't raised to think beyond themselves. However, if you do understand it, go back to Crouching Tiger, and try watching it one more time. It might make more sense.",Null,0,0,17 February 2001
