10 Cloverfield Lane," A Bad Movie
","I watched this movie in Imax and my verdict was that it was a bad movie in general and definitely not deserving of an Imax ticket. Then i made another mistake of reading the reviews and now im sucked into making another review.First of all, it was predictable. And they added some twists which deviated from the central theme and were distracting and unnecessary. I didn't feel any tension because it was obvious they are just trying to complicate the plot.The acting was good but they didn't make the most out of what its like living in a bunker. The climactic ending was too short and very uncinematic. Low budget and tries to use our own imagination to fill the shortcomings of this film but fails.The movie felt like a lightweight version of 'War of the Worlds'. If some people rate this as a 9 then does that make WOTW a 15? JJ is pretty good at utilizing the reviewers to market his films. There is already too much dishonesty in this world.",3,4,11,11 March 2016
Point Break," Outstanding stunts
","The stunts in this film are one of the best. This alone makes the movie worthwhile to see and indulge. The film also has exceptional cinematography with setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean, Angel falls and the Alps.The story is average but they have something to tell, just listen to the lines and they have some philosophical points and some original ideas. The acting is passable.But most of all this is a fun movie. Parties. Half naked bodies. Cameo by one of the famous DJs, snowboarding, motorbikes, para gliding. Academic people who are cynical of this lifestyle should just stay out and keep their own biases.",9,19,37,25 December 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Skip this movie. You won't miss anything
","Skip this movie. You won't miss anything. Except perhaps the good performance by Luke Evans as Gaston. But still, the bad aspects of this film just overrides any good ones.There were too many distractions in the film that it does not evolve into a movie experience. There are lots of propaganda in this film. If you would like to put racial minority actors, you don't pick 18th century France as your setting. I am a racial minority so I can say this. They also depict that gays as mostly men in drag, weak and the so called gay scenes are not empowering at all but rather tacky. I am gay, so I have a right to say this.The worst distraction and aspect of this film is Emma Watson. She doesn't give justice to the role of Belle. You can see it in her eyes. This actress grew up with everything, having played Hermione. Belle is a sweet, innocent provincial lass. Every time I look at Emma Watson, it seems like I am waiting for her to roll her eyeballs or take out a cellphone and tweet.Dan Stevens looked effeminate and his beast form should have been a bird and not a mammal. Josh Gad looked mechanical, uninspired and unconvincing as gay LeFou. I watched this film because I was afraid I would miss out on something historic or a good film sequence. But sadly there was none. I should have skipped this.",3,75,132,22 March 2017
Wonder Woman," A dull incarnation of Wonder Woman that I did not wish to see.
","Wonder Woman (WW) is another dull addition to the DC universe that is comparable to BvS and Suicide Squad. I love the WW comic book character and I wished this film was not made. A lot of reviewers are giving this film a 10/10 which is quite surprising. I give it a 5 because of the following point deductions.(-1) Uninteresting main villain and supporting characters. Other than WW, there was minimal character development. (-1) Special effects, action sequences and cinematography need something to be desired. (-3) Awful plots and script. Butchered World War 1 history. Dark boring story (again DC?). Several loopholes in the story. Main points of the story doesn't connect.Biased feminists are just grabbing any opportunity that boosts the feminist propaganda. I am leaning toward feminism but this WW film does not help. They turned WW into a goddess. The story was written by Zach Snyder and I can sense the male mind that runs the plot of the story. I would rather see her more down-to-earth and fighting human enemies like the Cheetah and Giganta and not some alien monster or a Greek god. If you want a feminist material that is original and exciting, watch Kill Bill instead.",5,4,14,6 June 2017
