The Avengers," I was fooled by the rating
","The movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did. Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood. Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever. Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.This was not brilliant at all. Perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the Avengers will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common Hollywood's trash.As for now I can only weep for my money.",5,20,43,12 May 2012
Pacific Rim," Ignoring some annoying moments - extremely FUN to watch
","First of all, Pacific Rim is one of a few movies that is worth watching in a movie theater. Special effects were good, both the robots (a.k.a Jaegers) and the monsters (a.k.a Kaiju) were well polished and looked realistic. The action went on and on leaving me squeezing the chair waiting to see how it's going to end. So - special effects: check; action: check. These are most important things that an action movie must have for the viewers to have a good time. However, the biggest problem for me was the whole 3D thing. It just doesn't work for me as well as the old 2D. Just like in the Avengers it was ruining the movie for me to enjoy it at it's fullest. You simply can't notice little details that make the movie so wonderful. I must mention that the acting wasn't so remarkable either. The dialogs were short, but at some parts completely unnecessary. It wasn't very noticeable since it's an action movie so people came to see giant robots fighting giant monsters and how delightful it was for everyone to get what they wanted.I don't know what's wrong with adventure and/or action movie creators, but it seems like they can't leave out cheesy jokes out. And what a big deal they make out of it - the joke scene must be emphasized even if it's very short it can't be a minor. Of course one joke isn't enough, when I saw the first one, I smiled a little thinking - yeah, it was OK, after a while, the second joke was forced in the movie and... I don't know, I just facepalmed. Perhaps I'm just making this too much of a deal, but such little things sting me like a bee.Another small thing that made me frown was that a little bit more thought in underwater sound effects could have been put. I mean come on, creatures that can walk the surface and roar, can't just scream underwater. Also the plot is kind of predictable, but not all of it! At some point I decided to take sip of my drink, apparently it was very bad timing, because at the same moment an unexpected jump scare-like scene started and I spat the drink on my knees. My point is that you know what the characters must do, who lives and who dies, how the movie is going to end, but you don't know how they are going to do it. I hope that sentence made sense. So, Pacific Rim is worth watching in a movie theater simply because it's so beautiful and full of action with no secret puns - just robots vs monsters. Some moments are indeed annoying, but they were nothing compared to the excitement that I felt afterwards.",7,2,7,22 July 2013
