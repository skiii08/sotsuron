Hereditary," Must See
","You get a sense of what the story is about then a twist, then you then get back on track then a twist. Amazing writing and acting by all. Seen it once on DVD and I reckon I'm watching the film again because any film I rate 10 I can rewatch it over and over.",10,2,5,14 October 2018
Interstellar," Fans of Space Should Watch This
","I have seen this film about 4 times, I'm also thinking of buying a special edition of this film because not only an actors masters class, mind melt, theory provoking and an amazing cast. It's a film you need to watch again and again. That's why I gave it 10/10.",10,1,1,2 July 2018
