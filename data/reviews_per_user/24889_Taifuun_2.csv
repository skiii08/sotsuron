Catch Me If You Can," Funny and strange
","I really think that this movie was strange. The mood was somehow really tense in the background, all though I did laugh a lot during it, I felt a bit drained afterwards. The father-son relationship was the holding force in the movie, without it the movie would have been pretty meaningless. I gave the movie 8 stars though, it was entertaining enough.",7,0,1,22 March 2003
Underworld," Me, a vampire freek...
","I liked it.As simple as that. I wasn't expecting much, though, in the first place. The movie came out, here in Finland, only a week or so ago, and I went to see it on it's third day here. I had been reading about it from these sites earlier, so I really didn't expect much from the movie. You lot haven't been singing it's praises. Vampires kick some serious ass. Maybe not in this movie, but usually they do. If you haven't noticed yet, I really dig the whole vampire thing. Blame Anne Rice. I loved the way the movie looked, the atmosphere, and I am seriously going to go see the sequel (hoping there is one coming).That's all for now, see you later ~Marita~",10,1,2,28 November 2003
