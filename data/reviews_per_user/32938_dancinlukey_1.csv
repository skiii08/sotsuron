The Ring," Just plain freaky
",This is the scariest movie since The Blair Witch Project. Filled with simple but VERY effective images and visions that will leave you feeling a little uneasy. Worth checking out if you're a fan of the horror genre... if you scare easily this REALLY isn't the film for you. Remember before you die... you see the ring.,9,0,0,6 November 2002
