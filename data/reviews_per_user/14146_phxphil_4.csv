Source Code," Wow, either love or hate
","I'm glad I didn't read the second page of reviews before going to see this movie or I might have had second thoughts (sorted by BEST). I liked the movie which is very much above average when compared to some of the drivel coming out of Hollywood these days. And Waffle...you figured out the whole movie in the first few scenes and worked on a cross word puzzle during the movie? If you think this makes you sound super smart it does the opposite. Only a fool would stay if that bored. Geeze, it's a SciFi movie, which means it doesn't have to be plausible or real (The Fi stands for FICTION). All of you who had this criticism should stay home and watch reality TV.",Null,1,3,8 May 2011
Child 44," A Very Well Acted Period Piece
","We rented this last evening and did not realize it was over 2 hours long. However we were glued to the screen as the plot unfolded and our attention was held by the great performances involved. While trying to decide what to rent we looked it up on IMDb and saw the low score. But we had recently rented Survivor (5.5) and because of the actors involved we rented it anyway. We ended up enjoying the fast action, suspense and the great performances and we felt Child 44 could be the same situation. And it was. Why anyone would give Child 44 one and two stars is a complete mystery to me. Based on their reviews it seems that some folks fancy themselves as more than a viewer or consumer of entertainment. It seems some see themselves as screen writers, directors, cinematographers, editors and professional critics. I wonder if these are folks who dropped out of film school or many never went but wanted to. This movie seems to have been particularly downgraded by those that read the book and think the screen writer had the responsibility to hold the script details closely to the book's story line. Come on guys, get a life and quit trying to downgrade good movies with your unwarranted low scoring. In any case don't be afraid to download, rent or stream this movie if you like the actors involved, a good murder mystery, a multi faceted story line and a beautifully filmed and costumed period piece.",10,8,13,16 August 2015
The Hunger Games," Good movie even if you haven't read the book
","Jennifer Lawrence is wonderfully attractive throughout, whether she is hunting, running, fighting, in a red dress or in competition clothes. Her husky but feminine voice is enthralling. She carries the movie. Even though she's not a classic beauty she has a certain look that attracts the eye. But there is plenty other talent to entertain as well. Not having read the book I was surprised at who wasn't chosen to go to the competition from her village. But as the story unfolds its understood that it's being set up for a sequel. The sets and the futuristic setting is a nice add to an old story line. Some reviews have said that the story doesn't pay homage to the village starvation that the book spoke to. I think it's pretty evident but it's not dwelling piece in the story. I got the point well enough and don't think it was necessary to emphasize it more. There could have been more character interaction during the training period to set up the bad relations between contestants during the contest. The time does fly and I would have never guessed it was over two hours long although I did have to bow to the Big Gulp in the later half of the movie. Dehydrate before you go.",7,1,5,29 March 2012
Unbroken," Slow and Bad Script
",Unbroken was just okay. I gave it one star lower than mid-range because I fell asleep for a portion and have no desire to see any part of it again to catch up. The film is about a WWII soldier held prisoner by the Japanese and was based on a very long book who many say was excellent. I read that Jolie successfully convinced the studio to let her bring the picture to the screen by selling them on how she capture the heart of the story. She failed. The script spent waaaay too much of the film depicting the character's suffering while floating around the ocean in a raft after their plane crashed. It seemed to take up the entire first half of the film. That time would have been better spent telling the story of how the main character dealt with his trauma after the war. The credits at the end refer to it. Apparently he struggled but finally found some solace through his faith and traveled to Japan to meet his captors who he forgave. Now I'd rather have seen some of that story than watching three men barfing after they tried to eat a seagull.,4,2,6,6 February 2015
