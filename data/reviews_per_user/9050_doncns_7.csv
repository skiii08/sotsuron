The King's Speech," good relationship
","I was surprised that there is a king who does not like a speech in the king of the British Empire. The film depicts the struggle of his. Comedy element is a little, but very interesting. There is trust relationship with the correctional officer and his wife to support him and his. The Figure that the king is trying to overcome suffering with a complex invites sympathy. I would like to send a yell for the king. Face with a feature of Geoffrey Rush is matched to the dubious therapist role unqualified. In the speech scene of George VI, Colin Firth is a great performance indeed. When he is giving a speech, the line of sight of the audience pierce, eyes swimming, breathing becomes shallow, face stiffness, he stuffy more he going to talk well, the following words does not come out. It is a scene that seems to hear the cry of his heart though. Tension of George VI comes through to the people who are watching.",7,0,0,1 October 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," cute alien
","Alien ET visited the earth exploration would be left behind on Earth from one accident, but is saved by boy Elliott introvert. I think pure tenderness with boy, courage and true strength that comes from there is in what you want with all means to the children, this movie is good also to adults who have forgotten it. The work of roughly, that the alien to appear as an enemy of the human race in many cases. However, it is characterized in this film, alien's friendly unusual. ET is pretty like a mascot character though.There are a lot of famous scene in this 'ET'. And music is liven up the scene further. There is a scene in the sky and topped with ET in the basket of the bicycle. The music flows in the moment they took off, and it drawn into the world of fantasy us. The music scene and both, it is a great work which makes us remain in our memory.",7,0,1,1 October 2013
500 Days of Summer," summer
","Tom (Joseph Gordon = Levitt) who works for a greeting card company falls in love with a coworker's summer (Zooey Claire Deschanel) at first sight. One day, they come to get along well through music. And Tom begins to approach summer gradually. Although this movie looks like a love movie apparently, in fact, it is not so. It is also describing Tom's growth. Although we are irritated by her who does not respond to his feeling, this is a highlight of this film. I thought that players ware very attractive. Tom's younger sister's Chloe grace Moret is very lovely. In addition to the fun of the contents of this movie, sound music is very good. The movie scenes play in my head when I hear each song. Since I finished seeing this movie, I got to know that this supervisor was a supervisor of music video before. Music matched the image well.",10,0,0,1 October 2013
Life of Pi," beautiful movie
","Human movie to draw a figure of a boy has become that the cargo ship carrying the family who runs a zoo sank by storm , to drift left behind along with the tiger in the lifeboat . I saw this movie without expecting too much, but it was really great. I worried about how to be or going to expand the story in so few characters because in the notice, only pie and tiger appear on it.However, it was interesting because tale of drifting was so substantial. Although this is supposed story of tragic and very cruel, it is portrayed as a beautiful and delicate story in a manner that does not show so dare. I became obsessed with many of the cut- breathing animal is likely to have heard. There is a tension as if there are wild animals , so I felt both the beauty and natural threats.",6,1,2,1 October 2013
LÃ©on: The Professional," Matilda is cute
","Leon (Jean Reno) who is a professional killer opens the heart little by little to Matilda (Natalie Portman), the girl who aims at a professional killer for the revenge which had the younger brother killed. And Leon comes to have feeling. This movie contains all the elements have scenes with tension, calm scene, and the scene laughable. An action scene is impressive. Camera work is also wonderful. Fusion of showy action and true love calls big impression for the last scene. Even when you dislike an action film, since this work has the contents, I think that it is interesting for everyone. I was very impressed with the figure that Matilda is endure the sadness. Natalie's overwhelming presence of that time 13 years old is wonderful. Leon is good at teaching about how to use a weapon. However, he can't teach the other thing very well. I think this gap is one of a highlight.",10,2,2,1 October 2013
District 9," alien and human
","'District 9' is a SF movie. However, it is not just a movie about Alien.This movie is including elements reminiscent of forced relocation plan of alien, and the alien slum settlements, the social issues that have arisen in human society actually. It is a movie through the alien and human, questioning the nature of human beings. The film depicts the human self-centered, that it is very cruel creature. I think that even if everyone have the spirit of self-sacrifice, people who can be transferred to real action is limited. I think 'discrimination' and 'prejudice' are the theme of this movie. This problem is difficult , and this movie makes you think deeply enough about this problem. I don't like SF movie, but I could enjoy watching to this movie.",6,0,0,1 October 2013
The Social Network," speedy and humorous movie
","The mark (Jasey Eisenberg) of the 19-year-old student who goes to Harvard University begins to make the site for increasing a friend in a university together with best friend Eduard (Andrew Garfield). A site spreads among college students in an instant. By encounter with Sean (Justin Timberlake), the Napster founder, it grows up to be a global huge site finally. This movie is very speedy and a humorous conversation is incorporated. Background from the launch of Facebook to have drawn to this. In addition, risk , enthusiasm and readiness of his on making Facebook is depicted interesting. Mark is a geek and gloomy. He is not good at getting along with people, but I am favor him for some reason. I think I often use the net every day, but people who really ignorant PC cannot understand this movie. I thought it was like a Hollywood movie to realize the American Dream.",8,0,0,1 October 2013
