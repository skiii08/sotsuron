First Man," Falling Flat
","Terribly disappointing. The whole movie falls flat. I would have liked to see the lift off from the moon. I guess I am asking too much. There is so much to be told about Armstrong's life, Spielberg should have made a mini series, not a 2.5 hour movie.",6,0,1,24 July 2019
