The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Filler Fluff For Female Fourteen-year-olds
","IMDb told me to write a review, so here it goes.Breaking Dawn Part 1 was a filler movie if I ever saw one. It brought back all the original minor characters for a brief and often pointless interaction with their more important brethren. It then spent an hour painfully trying to demonstrate vampire sex to tweens. They then leave us with a cliffhanger requiring everyone pay another $12 at the movies to see how the first part ends. If this movie did not already have a following from the previous blah titles in the series, no one would have watched it. Perhaps I will tune in when they remake this movie in 50 years, because this one was so bad the remake would have to be better.",4,3,3,11 May 2015
Nacho Libre," I missed the humor in this
","Tried watching this movie and made it to the end, but it did nothing for me. I didn't laugh once, but I think I was supposed to. At some points, it felt like someone was trying to recreate some of the awesomeness from Napoleon Dynamite. Then I read that the same director was involved in both. Anyhow, the actors do a decent job, I just feel they had nothing to work with. This movie almost ran like a drama rather than a comedy, the story of a priest/monk or whatever that would do whatever he could for the children he looked after.",5,1,1,23 April 2017
Captain America: Civil War," I guess it helps if you were into the comics
","Nothing really stood out for me while watching Civil War. Of course you have your neat action scenes and some enjoyable actors, but I have no interest in ever seeing it again. Maybe if I were into the comics or had watched the prequels it would have helped me with character development.So if you are content to watch one fun and expensive action scene after another, this is probably a good pick. I must be getting old. This is the first I can ever recall Aunt May being hot. Oh man do I miss the forums on here. Please bring them back!",6,0,1,6 April 2017
