Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but disappointing
","By now, anyone who wants to see this has probably seen it.  It's been out on video for over a month.  I saw it in the theater twice, and bought the movie.  But overall, I was disappointed.  This just doesn't stand up to the first three.  Perhaps I'm biased because I love Harrison Ford, but there was just so much wrong here.My complaints are the same as many others'. First of all, I, too, hated Jar Jar.  Matter of fact, the entire Gungan race annoyed me.  They really could've done so much better creating a new race.  And their 'language' was really stupid.  I thought Jake Lloyd's acting was a bit stilted.  Ok, he's just a kid, but HE'S DARTH VADER!  Darth Maul?  Very disappointing as a bad guy.  No real dialogue.  No motivation.  We don't know why he chose the dark side, or anything else about him for that matter.  Then he kills Qui-Gon and is gone before we can get used to him!  In my opinion, the amount of time on screen between Maul and Jar Jar should've been reversed.  Still, it was Star Wars.  I just hope that in Part 2, Jar Jar gets killed.",Null,0,1,16 May 2000
Se7en," Not for the squeamish
","This was a great movie, but I had a very hard time watching it.  It is very sadistic, very bloody, but also very thought provoking.  I found myself thinking about this movie long after I returned the video to blockbuster. 
Great cast.  Especially surprising to me was Spacey, whom I'd just seen on the other side of the law in The Negotiator (which I also loved!)Overall, I would've liked to see this movie done with a lot less gore, and a little more of the violence left to the audiences imagination.",Null,0,0,20 May 2000
Fargo," I don't get it
","I've read so many great comments on this movie, and heard so many good things before I saw it, and I really felt let down.I just didn't get it.  Was it a comedy that wasn't funny?  An action film without action?  I know it was a 'true story' that wasn't true...so I just couldn't figure out what the point was.I really didn't care about any of the characters.  We never knew the wife well enough to care that she was being kidnapped thanks to her good-for-nothing husband.  I never cared about him, since he was such a greedy, stupid, low-life loser.  I cared less about the kidnappers.  I liked Marge and her husband, but we didn't really get to know them.  Our brief glimpse into their life was, for me, very unsatisfying.
The only line that made me even smile was the way everyone agreed that one of the kidnappers was 'funny looking.'  This was a comedy?  A family is torn apart and murdered over money disputes.  This is comical?  A policeman pulls a car over and gets shot in the head by the driver?  Sorry, too close to reality for me to laugh.Having never been anywhere near Fargo, I can't comment on the accents, except to say they were sometimes hard for me to understand. But that's cause I'm a Noo Yawka.Marge's last line really summed it up for me, 'I just don't understand.'",Null,0,0,8 May 2000
Toy Story 2," Wonderful sequel
","This was a truly wonderful movie.  If you liked the original Toy Story, you will surely enjoy this one.  I especially liked the short 'movie' by Pixar -- which was originally done in 1986.  It explains why they have a 'hopping lamp' in their logo.  (Their first short animation in 1986 featured an 'adult' and 'child' lamp.)  Sit back and prepare to be entertained.",9,0,1,2 December 1999
The Green Mile," GREAT movie
","This movie has a bit of everything.  I laughed, I cried, I was awed.  The acting is superb and the plot is inspired.  One piece of advice, if you're watching with a youngster (I have a 12 year old) skip the executions.  They're rough.  This is easier to do with the DVD.",Null,0,1,22 February 2001
