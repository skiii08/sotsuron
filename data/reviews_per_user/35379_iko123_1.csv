Raiders of the Lost Ark," An example of a perfect movie.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of a perfect movie.Quite a bold statement I hear you cry, but I'll do my best to quantify it!Put very simply, this film delivers on everything it promises. The poster and artwork for the movie tell you that it is a 1940s adventure with Nazi villains and a dashing male hero who uses a whip! Not to mention the pursuit of an artifact of 'actual' biblical proportions. There's a girl in there too so a bit of romance as well. It is a perfect realisation of character and story. Every component fits together like a well made suit, from the sweeping soundtrack that elevates your emotions and fills you with awe, to the perfect casting choices. All of the people involved in this film clearly loved both every moment making and working together on it. This film is compelling to watch and carries you from the very first opening scene right through to the end with a rewarding, fitting conclusion to the story. Quite honestly I am really struggling to think of a single criticism. Oh some might say the effects look dated in places, but it simply doesn't matter because you are enjoying the ride too much. Furthermore, It can be watched many times without losing any value. I believe that this is because every component of the film is being steered by people in their prime and at the top of their game. If you're not appreciating the music, then it's the cinematography. If you're not rooting for the very likable characters, then you're noticing the amazing sound design. Every department; stunts, makeup, wardrobe, writing... all of them, they all gave everything and achieved what they set out to create. Thus a perfect film.If for some reason you haven't seen it... then make sure you close the curtains, dim the lights, turn the volume right up... and enjoy every moment of this cinematic delight in its fullest capacity!",10,2,5,5 May 2014
