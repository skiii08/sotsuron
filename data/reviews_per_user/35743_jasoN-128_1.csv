Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yes, it's true...this movie RULES!
","I was fortunate enough to get to the trade screening of this movie.  I won't have any spoilers in this review though.  Let me tell you how cool it was...it was VERY cool!  You knew it was going to be a fun experience when 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...' appeared on the screen and everyone broke into applause.Okay, what can I say without giving anything away...?  The special effects are great (of course).  The score is great. All the characters are great - even the kid who plays Anakin who I heard couldn't act...he wasn't bad at all.  There is plenty of battle-droid action, and jedi's fighting and totally kicking butt.  Darth Maul was killer...villians don't get much cooler.  His battle with Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan was awesome, and the pod-racing scene has to be seen to be believed. Great appearances by Yoda, Jabba, R2D2, and (the nude) See-Threepio.  The applause at the end of the film lasted quite awhile, and for good reason.Every time I see a movie, I see at least one thing that I notice that annoyed me, or I think could have been done differently or better...But while watching this movie, I didn't notice a single thing...I could only watch the movie, transfixed on the screen.  It was really quite magical. I will definitely be back to see it two or three...or four...or five more times...and now I have to wait HOW LONG for the next one?! Noooooooo!!!",9,7,13,6 May 1999
