Alien 3," Dark, gloomy, brutal, but surprisingly good
","This film is like night and day compared to the first two films. It is extremely violent, dark and gloomy. But Sigourney Weaver is awesome, as well as the visual effects. The ending is very compelling and if you were a fan of the first two films then you will like this. Just don't expect to see any resemblance of the original films.",9,0,3,11 January 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Brutal, sad and POWERFUL! BRILLIANT!
","This film should be shown in every high school in America. Is it shocking? Is it brutal? Is it disturbing? Yes yes yes. But there is a powerful lesson to be learned here. Addiction is not a fun thing. The performance by Ellen Burstyn is so exhilirating. As the film begins she could be your aunt, grandmother or mother. That makes it even harder to witness her downfall. She was robbed of an Oscar (no offense, Julia). Her performance is honest, unflinching, sometimes painful to witness. WOW! The film shows us that addiction, no matter what it may be, is life altering. I walked away from the film feeling like I had just seen my family ravaged: the performances are that convincing. It is one of the must-see films of 2000.",10,0,0,25 May 2001
