This movie set in the 80s, brings the same vibe seen in Strangers things that I enjoy.One thing that makes me enjoy this movie is because it reminds me of times myfriends and I wanted to discover things in the summer, always traveling from oneplace to another on bikes. Making me feel I was unstoppable, like the kids at the endof the movie. Also 80s seemed like a cool time to be around as a kid not having asmany restrictions kids nowadays have during that time. One thing that does upset meabout the film is how they weren't able to kill Pennywise in the first movie. Eventhough the 2nd IT film is entertaining, it doesn't compare to the original. Also I thinkthe reason why IT the original is better that the 2nd is because, he captures thescenes with different angles. One thing that makes me not get bored from watchingthis film are the angles used in different scenes. He makes every scene alwayslook different, by using using low angle lighting, high angle shots and tilts high helpsmake the scenes of the kids visioning their fears from pennywise more dramatic.",9,0,0,22 January 2020
