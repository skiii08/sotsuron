The New World," A Very Uncomfortable Movie To Sit Through
","All in all this is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. Problem is I kept waiting for something in this movie to capture my imagination in some positive or negative way. Were my expectations too high? Between the soundtrack...the most depressing score I've ever been captive to. I say captive because I paid my $10.00 bucks and figured something good has got to eventually happen...for me it never did. When I left the theater I felt numb...like I just sat through a 48hr marathon of 'A Clockwork Orange'. Might just as well have bought the cheapest bottle of wine I could find and gone home and watched something good like 'Alexander'.Change is Inevitable, Growth is Optional",3,7,10,10 May 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," Wow, what a sleeper...
",What a sleeper. The first time I checked the ratings on IMDb the movie looked like a weak average at best. So I passed on the box office viewing and went to the big screen to see something with a little higher rating. Just goes to show beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. After a short run on the big screen in the USA market I ran into this movie at my local video store. Popped it into the DVD player and was happily mesmerized from beginning to the end...never left my seat. I hate to keep repeating myself but my goodness what a sleeper! I have paid $15.00 bucks at the box office only to view movies that put me to sleep in less than 20 minutes. Sir Anthony Hopkins once again was the perfect choice to play the main character Burt Munro. If only we could all have the drive and that never give up never give in attitude that Burt Munro shows us. Without giving away any spoilers let me end this comment by saying I dare any person to watch this movie and not be taught a life lesson or at the very least be emotionally moved by the tenacity of Mr.Burt.,8,1,1,9 November 2008
