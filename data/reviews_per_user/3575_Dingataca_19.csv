The Sound of Music," My favourite musical of all time...
","Maria is a young lady studying to be a nun, but is unsure of convent life, as her whole personality, her whole way of living is very different from every other nun in the Abbey. She is sent away to be a governess to seven children, of the Von Trapp family. Their father, Captain Georg Von Trapp, is a widower and very harsh on his children, treating them like he would do to his naval army. When Maria arrives she changes this, and brings music and laughter into the household, but not even Maria can change all the events that are about to come...Many have grown up with this movie, and I am one of them. As a child I loved The Sound Of Music, and I still do. A timeless classic, The Sound Of Music can be watched again and again. It is a universal movie, and there is a squeaky clean plot. No sex, no drugs, and no violence. Perfect for family audiences.This was the second film I saw with Julie Andrews, and I loved her more in this movie than I have with any of her other films. This is my favourite role of hers. She was the perfect Maria - her smile, her kindness, her attitude and confidence, and her angelic and enchanting voice. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry with Christopher Plummer was indeed wonderful. He was a good Captain Von Trapp, though he started off a bit rocky in my opinion. But his performance greatly improved throughout and by the end I could not imagine anyone else in his role. The children, every single one of them, delivered fine performances. They had exceptional singing voices, considering their age, and kudos to their choreographer for their dance sequences, especially in 'Do-Re-Mi' and 'So Long Farewell', which they were brilliant in.I strongly believe the popularity of The Sound Of Music is mainly to the outstanding musical score by Roger and Hammerstein, but there are more factors to consider. For example, the gorgeous scenery, the acting (Julie Andrews owns this film), the universal family appeal, or maybe even the values that the film embraces. They are so decent. The popularity factor could be due of any one of these, however I believe it was the music. Each song is so wonderfully crafted. I cannot choose a favourite out of the songs, but I have always had a soft spot for 'Do-Re-Mi'. I never really liked the song 'Edelweiss' as a child, but now when I listen to it, I love it. It is highly underrated. 'My Favourite Things' is a great song, very catchy, and really exposes Andrews' beautiful singing voice. 'The Lonely Goatherd' also did that, but this time with...brace yourselves...PUPPETS! I remember watching that song over and over again and giggling with my family at the puppets and the yodeling - a lovely memory. I also think 'Something Good', and 'I Have Confidence' are nice songs, and the same goes for 'So Long Farewell', with the children. And I cannot forget the outstanding choreography and singing in 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen', Liesl and Rolf's chemistry in that song was cuter than a cocker spaniel. There are many subplots in The Sound Of Music, like the romance with Liesl and Rolf, the war and escaping, the Baroness's entry into the lives of the Von Trapps, the singing competition, Maria's trouble in the convent...but the main story would be of the family, and their story together. Definitely one of my 'favourite things'!",Null,1,7,27 January 2008
Rang De Basanti," Jai Hind...
","Rang De Basanti is a very inspiring, moving, and interesting look on India today. As well as addressing a very important issue, Rang De Basanti is so incredibly well-made that you can't help loving it.Aamir is starting to grow on me. I am not a fan, but after seeing him here, and then thinking about Jo Jeeta..QSQT, I am starting to like his style of acting. He WAS DJ, and was perfect in his role. Alice Patten also impressed me a lot, she was strangely charming, and brought a fresh, Angrezi vibe to the film. Siddharth as Karan was interesting, he can really act! The ending with him and Aamir was wonderful. Sharman Joshi was adorable in his role, and he was a large contributor to the humour of Rang De Basanti. Kunal Kapoor was a very well casted Aslam, I really like the guy, he's cute too :). Soha Ali Khan was fantastic and her performance got to me straight through - I loved her! Atul Kulkarni was decent enough, and Madhavan was great.Love your country, is a message that I got from this film. I am very protective and passionate about India and this film reinforced my feelings completely. The only problem I really had with Rang De Basanti is the way the movie jumped from light-hearted to very serious. It kills the mood and you find yourself feeling a bit odd. But it is understandable after seeing the film on why it changes so drastically.This is the best music I have heard in a while. I LOVE Roobaroo, and the title track is also pretty great. Luka Chuppi and Tu Bin Bataaye are the slower tracks, and Khalbali and Paathshala are the party type songs. I even liked Khoon Chala. In short, each song is different and well worth a listen.One thing I enjoyed the most was the realistic-ness of the characters, and also how much amazing chemistry each actor had with one another. It seemed real, and a deep friendship. The jokes made between the group will keep you in stitches, and also, feel very close to you. It really reminded me of how I am with my friends. Great for the youth and younger generation of India. I guarantee they will think differently after seeing this movie.The cinematography is excellent, the plot well thought out, screenplay, character development, script...Rang De Basanti is way ahead. Rakeysh Mehra has done a fantastic job, and this is definitely one of the best I have seen.JAI HIND!",Null,0,2,25 December 2007
Madagascar," The funny, the funnier, and the downright HILARIOUS.
","I went to see this with some friends, and they brought their younger brothers and sisters along. We were all impressed by the outcome. We all loved it, and I recommend it to anyone! It has turned into one of my favourites!The story is interesting. It starts off with 4 thoroughly pampered animals, who live in New York Zoo, who, by the nagging and mistake of the escapist zebra, Marty, end up on a ship bound to Africa! With the help of some meddly penguins, the ship turns to an island instead: Madagascar, where the animals are reunited. The story then shows us how the foursome deal with the sudden change to their lives.In a way, the plot reminded me of an old book I read as a kid: Lord Of The Flies. The way that their personalities change just drifted back to that like a bullet.The animation is excellent. Its very colourful, bright and vibrant, and looks very fresh. It all looks real in a way, though also, manages to stay animated and different, which is impressive. It is not 'King Kong' style animation though. The animation stays child-like. Music and effects are also very good.Ben Stiller as Alex was brilliant. His voice suited the role as the spoilt, arrogant, leader of a lion so incredibly well. However, I prefer Stiller in live action than in animated, though he does a good job. Chris Rock as Marty was interesting, he does justice to the role. His voice matched with Marty well, and it was very amusing. Jada Pinkett-Smith does an average job, I personally would have preferred someone like Beyonce to do a role like this, but she did a moderately good job of it. My personal favourite is David Schwimmer as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, he had me in stitches, and although the part wasn't as big as Alex or Marty, he does an amazing job of Melman. There is no one else to do this but David Schwimmer alone. He was fabulous.The penguins add great humour to Madagascar. Sacha Baron Cohen as King Julien was hilarious, you cannot deny laughing at his portrayal of the monkey king. The sweetie, Mort (I don't know what animal he is) has you 'Aww'-ing. And the fossas were good.There is some crude humour, but that disappears after a while. In short, Madagascar is an amazing film, for all the family. I will definitely be watching it again!",Null,2,2,19 September 2007
Finding Nemo," Whether you're 1 to 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please!
","Finding Nemo, Pixar's best yet. Stunning visuals, a great star cast to voice it, an original and heartwarming story, and amazing humour. What more could you want!? Every character plays an important part in Finding Nemo, as opposed to movies that focus on the protagonists. The star cast that voiced this film were purely perfect, e.g. Ellen DeGeneres for Dory! That was absolutely brilliant! She steals the show!Finding Nemo, has what some Pixar/Disney films don't have. And that is morals. They aren't forced into you, they're very subtle, but they are strong enough to keep you thinking and to make an impact on you - which I think is fabulous. The moral is: Loving your kids is great...over-loving them isn't. A moral like this makes sense for the present and I'm sure many young people would understand and relate.The film also defines 'universal'. Many universal films you see have a couple of drops of crude humour, its harmless, as its too little for young kids to understand, but it's still there. Finding Nemo is completely clean, squeaky clean in fact.Whether you're 1 or 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please. This one is definitely a must watch.Watch it! I command you!",Null,1,3,12 October 2007
Chak de! India," Each girl stands out, and in their own way, shine above SRK...
","Chak De! India is a sports film, made by Indians, for Indians, (well, not necessarily!), and is one of the better films of 2007 so far. I was reluctant to see the movie because of hype and criticism, but upon seeing it, I have realised that this movie is fantastic - and nothing can take that away.Shah Rukh Khan - how can I describe this wonderful actor? His role was about undying love for the sport, and undying love for your country - something inspirational, beautiful, and so universal. It is so easy to relate to his character, heck, the guy had been despised, shunned, and loathed by his whole country, forced to leave his home, hated by one and all. He should have been scarred for life! But no, Chak De! India shows that with a little faith, your whole life will come spinning back to you.It was clever to choose hockey, being our national sport - even though majorly overshadowed by cricket - it worked wonders. There were also no song/dance sequences in this movie, something I thought interesting and expertly handled. It takes skill to take the song and dance out of a Hindi movie and still have it being a hit, but Shimit Amin has handled this with great finesse. The hockey scenes were handled with such amazing expertise and know-how, it is close to Hollywood standards. (Note I said close) The real tone and plot of CDI is about proving that women are just as capable as men. However, CDI is not a feminist film. There is talent, brain, beauty, and practicality available in a woman, she should not be taken for granted. And I am glad to say that after seeing this film, she probably won't be! Shimit Amin has made an amazing film. I am very proud to call myself an Indian, this movie is excellent. The ending is extremely predictable, but it was handled very well - there is so much tension building up to it, and each minute you clench your fists and lean forward in your chair, waiting for that goal to be scored.My favourite part: the 16 girls. Each one uniquely has their say in the movie, though the few from further regions of India etc, had lesser to do. Yet they all played their parts and added the one thing CDI needed - grace. The focus was mainly on a few girls, for example Vidya Malvade, Sagarika Ghatge. But I liked the way all the girls worked so well together - they became a real TEAM, which is what CDI is all about. I also admired the way each girl in a way had her own personal storyline behind her, which all added to the tension of winning the World Cup! My personal favourite would be the little one, Chitrashi Rawat as Komal, I thought she showed fabulous potential and her gutsy little performance had me grinning.So move over guys, the girls are here!",Null,5,8,18 October 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl Streep steals the show, in one swift movement...
","I have lost count of how many times I have seen The Devil Wears Prada, and I always seem to enjoy it more and more.Meryl Streep was amazing as Miranda, she never manages to disappoint and I really think this role was made for her, she is flawless and amazing. Anne Hathaway is not far behind with her performance, she too is really good, she is extra pretty in TDWP, and has grown A lot since I saw her in The Princess Diaries. Not just looking-wise, but performance-wise too; this role seemed much more mature and sophisticated. I thought Emily Blunt was also very good as Emily, as the loving worshipper of Miranda. Adrien Grenier, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker make forgettable but important appearances.The way this film has been filmed is noteworthy. Each scene is magnificently done, and very elegant.The Devil Wears Prada is quite a serious movie. It is rated PG-13, but to be honest I don't think many youngsters would enjoy this - despite the rating it is more serious than it looks.",Null,0,0,20 November 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," I've never seen such an impressive action movie in my LIFE
","Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.However it was a very thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it had reached the interval! I don't think I have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. Well done.",Null,153,220,8 December 2007
She's the Man," Everyone has a secret...
","I thoroughly enjoyed She's The Man, though I'll be honest that I thought it would be a terrible, over the top comedy, I was very surprised.Its the best film adaption of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night I have seen. I guarantee that its completely worth it! You will definitely get a laugh! She's The Man uses cheesy lines, and gets away with it, as the comedy gags you.Amanda Bynes really proved herself, she did a fantastic job as Viola/Sebastian. Though she does have her moments, she does a great job. Channing Tatum looks hot, and that's pretty much all he does! He doesn't act, he's what I call a 'stand there and look pretty'. The others get away with decent performances.A brilliant teen rom-com. Watch it!",Null,2,3,3 October 2007
Ratatouille," Could this GET any better?!?
","Disney and Pixar have done it again. They've combined their amusing + universal story, sprinkled on some killer animation, added a dash of perfect voice acting, and sautéed it to make very endearing main character, who will appeal to children and adults alike. The end result has been astounding.Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a small rat with big dreams. Where the other rats have a passion for food, Remy has a passion for COOKING food. He aspires to become like his role model and idol: Gusteau - the best chef in all of Paris. After Remy loses his family, he finds himself face to face with Gusteau's restaurant - which is now slowly losing its 5 Star reputation. Unfortunately for Remy, his hero Gusteau suddenly passed away, leaving Remy pondering on what to do. When Remy bumps into Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage boy, they set out on an adventure together, to discover themselves, to discover secrets, and most importantly, to discover the art of real cooking.The animation is stunning. It is so realistic that it's unbelievable, every little detail has been perfected, and each twist and turn of the story pulls on your heartstrings.Each actor voicing over does a great job, each one is well suited for their role, especially Lou Romano as Linguini - the chemistry between Remy and Linguini was fantastic! Just with the voice, an audience is able to identify with the characters, and view the superb chemistry these two actors, by just listening to their voices. Either way, it really worked for Ratatouille! In conclusion, Disney Pixar have a new bestseller family film on their list, following Toy Story, Shrek, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille will earn a place in your heart.",Null,10,14,29 October 2007
Meet the Fockers," Crude, but very funny
","I haven't seen Meet The Parents, so when I watched the sequel I was quite surprised! It was hilarious.Performances are impeccable, most notably Ben Stiller. I loved him in Madagascar and Along Came Polly, but Meet The Fockers was amazing.The jokes are often vulgar, and 80% of them are sex-related. Nevertheless, it is extremely funny, but I would advise you to be careful if you see this film with kids, especially kids that laugh at immature topics, e.g farts. I was quite surprised at the jokes considering it was a PG13 (12 in UK), and some jokes I would feel uncomfortable to be watching with adults even.Comic timing, plot, directing and acting are all fantastic. I love you Ben Stiller!",Null,0,0,30 September 2007
The Little Mermaid," Disney's best....EVER!
","Ariel is a bright, fiery young mermaid princess, who loves to explore with her friends Flounder, a fish, and Sebastian, a bossy crab, the adviser of her father King Triton. Exploring often gets Ariel into trouble, and she must sneak around on the sly. Ariel is hugely fascinated by the human world - and she secretly visits old shipwrecks and other places, and collects old human possessions. Despite knowing that humans are 'dangerous', Ariel cannot stop herself, and is enchanted by this different world. She ends up saving the life of a Prince named Eric, after his ship as destroyed by a hurricane as she was watching it.After taking Eric to shore, Ariel sings to him with her beautiful voice. As Eric opens his eyes, Ariel flees, as she does not want to be seen, afraid of scaring him. Ariel falls for Eric, and he too, for her, just by her singing. When King Triton finds out Ariel loves a human, he is furious and forbids her anything to do with him, and smashes all her secret human possessions. Hurt, and very angry, Ariel visits the sea witch Ursula, and exchanges her beautiful voice, in return for human legs. Ursula's magic allows Ariel to be human for 3 days, and if Ariel can make the Prince kiss her before the sun sets on the 3rd day, she will be human forever...I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and it has been my favourite Disney movie ever since. It was my first Disney film, and is still my all time favourite. I grew up singing the songs, talking like Ariel, I craved to be a real mermaid for years! The story, direction, animation, and character portrayal in this movie absolutely amazing - I loved every second. The best part I would have to say, is the music. My favourite song is 'Part Of Your World', followed by 'Under The Sea' and 'Kiss The Girl'. All songs are melodious and catchy, and tug at your heartstrings. Even 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' sung by Ursula was great. Even watching today, my opinion is the same. And I still remember all those memories I grew up with, thanks to this one film.One of the best Disney has ever produced. Thank you.",Null,1,1,24 November 2007
The Incredibles," An very 'incredible' movie
","THE INCREDIBLES is truly a film worth watching. It is funny, it is entertaining, it has action, in short, it is magnificent. THE INCREDIBLES somehow seems to combine the suave nature of the Bond films with a touch of family fun, which is pulled off with great style. I also liked the way the colours were used, each one was bright and bold.THE INCREDIBLES is about a family of retired superheroes, who are trying to cope with pretending to be normal human beings, and hide their powers from the world. The family, the Parr's, consists of Bob, the father and head of the family. Helen Parr, his wife, and the mother, and their children, Violet (aka Vi), Dash (short for Dashiell), and Jack Jack, their youngest, who is still a baby. THE INCREDIBLES is their story, and how they triumph together as a family.The animation is the highlight of the movie. Pixar are masters of the animation front. With biggies like Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc, Ratatouille to name a few...they have done it all over again and produced a great film.Another amazing movie by Pixar, a must watch.",Null,0,0,28 December 2007
A Bug's Life," An epic...of miniature proportions!
","A Bug's Life is the story of Flik, an ant, and his colony of ants. The colony has to each year gather food for the grasshoppers, mainly Hopper and his gang. Flik seems to mess up everything unknowingly, in a way that is endearing. And somehow his 'inventions' don't seem to work and the more he tries the more he fails. When Flik upsets the pile of food that the ants have been collecting for Hopper all summer, he realises that he's really done it this time. Hopper arrives, scares them to high heavens, and messes with their minds - he gives them 'one last chance'. The ants, terrified, start collecting food again, this time double the load. As well as double food for Hopper, they need to start collecting for themselves. But it's late summer and there isn't much left to pick, feeling guilty, and coming up with a huge plan, Flik offers to travel to city, round up some tough warrior bugs, return, and fight off Hopper and his crew. The Ant Queen, Princess Atta (for whom Flik has a massive crush) and the other ants all agree to this - but only because they want Flik out of their way! Flik is determined to make a difference and give something back to his colony, but can he do it? Can he redeem himself and save his colony from Hopper? And if he does, how? I thought A Bug's Life addressed bullying, and is the only animated film from Pixar to have done so. Even many Disney films have not addressed bullying so openly and easily. A Bug's Life, though subtle, addresses an issue.The animation is STUNNING. I am a great fan of animated movies, especially by Pixar, and I think this is one of their best. Finding Nemo, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc. to name a few, A Bug's Life still remains as a classic Pixar animation, despite being one of their oldest movies. I thought the animation of the ants was done well, but better than that, was the landscape, and background. Each leaf was perfect, each stem defined and textured.What I like most about A Bug's Life is that it makes you feel as if you know the ants, as they live a similar life to you. They talk, they eat, they shop, they buy drinks and have pubs, this made the movie so enjoyable and I finished watching it with a new-found respect for the bug world!",Null,0,0,21 December 2007
There's Something About Mary," One of the 90's best comedies
","Ted (Ben Stiller) has been in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) since High School, and thirteen years later, he is realising his life is going nowhere because of it. He decides to track her down, using the help of a top-notch private investigator named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), and try to rebuild the relationship they once had. But when the investigator also falls in love with Mary, it isn't easy for Ted to find his lost love, and madness follows, all about Mary.Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller had a very impressive chemistry together, and I always think of this as one of Diaz's best roles. She was a very good Mary, and she made the character very likable with her charming smile. I found there to actually be something about her, but maybe it was just the way they portrayed her. Ben Stiller was mediocre, but does provide some very funny moments and contributes immensely to the film. The way he voiced it over was also a good touch. I thought Matt Dillon as the private detective was a great choice and he was an good villain, though a little too creepy. All the other actors were excellent in their parts, (especially the seven-minute abs guy, who was hilarious).The only problem with this movie, and it is a small one, was how 9/10 of the sequences in the film aren't 'laugh out loud funny'. I found a lot of the film to to be entertaining, and/or sweet, but not a lot of it made me actually laugh my guts out. Another thing I found annoying, how they said the F word in nearly every sentence. I felt they overused it, in some parts of the movie was necessary to curse, but the majority of the time it seemed fake and tacky when the characters swore. I mean, it would have been just as funny without that much swearing.A little raunchy, but very entertaining.",Null,3,6,17 February 2008
The Holiday," A light, feel good rom-com...perfect for a girly night in!
","The Holiday = Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Kate Winslet, and Jude Law. A chocolatey and heartwarming romantic comedy, you will love it. I know I did.One thing I found about this movie is that is it very realistic. The situations are something people would experience in everyday life, though I disagree with the house-exchange part. There isn't much of a chance that most people would go for house exchange in a day (unless they were either drunk, high, or just stupid) Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is the owner of a big company in L.A., that produces and makes film trailers. Living in a great house, with a great career, and a great guy in her life, Amanda's life seems perfect. But not exactly. Iris (Kate Winslet) is an absent-minded, but lovable, young journalist, lives in a small but cosy cottage in Surrey, and finds out the man she has been so in love with for 3 years has no interest in her. After both Amanda and Iris' relationships crumble, they are left with a sheer sense of heartbreak and decide a Christmas holiday is vital. They meet over the internet and decide to go for a house exchange, swapping homes, cars and everything. In a flash, Iris is in L.A., and Amanda is in England. It doesn't take long before Amanda meets the dishy Graham (Jude Law), an attractive man with a charming smile and a slightly dark past, and Iris bumps into the jovial Miles (Jack Black), a gentle, music-lover with a cute smile. But...what happens now.Kate Winslet was very likable in her role, and exuded a charm which endeared her to the audience very much. The gentle nature and innocent charm brought her to you. Cameron Diaz was also very likable, though not in the same way that Kate managed it, but again her character was a lot different than Kate Winslet's. But Miss Diaz certainly showed she has skill. I enjoyed her performance. Jack Black was cute and funny but he seemed a little off. I don't know if it is me, but I don't think rom-com is his genre. I prefer in the all out comedy scene. Jude Law impressed me, and the charming, suave performance I'm sure will get all women weak in their knees. I mean, good looks, a strangely sexy British accent, and a great performance with a soppy smile. He IS Graham Simpkin. Eli Wallach is lovely in the small role that he plays as the elderly Arthur.One of the best things about The Holiday is that each character seems to have a great chemistry with one another. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law just flowed without stopping, it was very sweet. And Jack Black and Kate Winslet also seemed to have a connection, this made each relationship very real and likable.A very enjoyable movie. Forget the haters, The Holiday rocks.",Null,2,3,23 December 2007
Love Actually," Starts off weak but grows on you after a while...
","With one of the biggest star casts I have ever seen, and 8, yes 8, different story lines, I was expecting a rom-com that I would adore. I didn't exactly ADORE Love Actually, but I do admit that it is a very cute movie which I enjoyed a lot.As I said, there are 8 whole different stories. Each one is completely different and I think that some are better than others.Couple #1 - Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson) have been married for many years. Now with 2 growing children and lots of tension from work, Harry is going through a lot of stress, and gets involved with the seductive Mia, his secretary from work. Christmas approaches and Harry buys her an expensive gold necklace, when Karen finds out, she instantly realises he is having an affair. Can their relationship survive?Couple #2- Jamie's (the charming Colin Firth) girlfriend is found to be having an affair with his brother. Heartbroken and upset, he goes to relax in his French cottage to forget it all. Jamie becomes dissolved in his writing, and can think of nothing else, until he meets the sweet Aurélia, a nice Portuguese woman who becomes his housekeeper. Slowly an indescribable bond forms between the both of them. What happens from there?Juliet (played by Kiera Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are a young pair in love. On their wedding day, Peter's best man and best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) videotapes the pretty ceremony. When Juliet sees the professional video of her wedding day she is shocked, as it is disastrous and the colours have gone wrong. Wanting a videotape of her special day, she sweetly asks Mark for his copy, even though she knows he is always cold and angry towards her. When Juliet sees the video Mark had took, she is stunned. They are all close-ups of her, smiling and laughing, and Juliet finds out Mark is secretly in love with her. How will she deal with this is the story of Couple #3.Couple #4 - Sarah (Laura Linney) has been in love for Karl (the cute Rodrigo Santoro), ever since she joined her office, -which we learn is Harry's design company-, which was over 2 years ago, a fact that everyone seems to know. Sarah unfortunately has a brother with a mental illness and she has to regularly mess up her life to support him, as she feels it is her responsibility. Karl and Sarah get together and she is incredibly happy, until her brother seems to ruin her relationship with Karl forever. This is the story of a brother/sister love as well as relationships and one of the best in the film.Judy and John (Joanna Page and Martin Freeman) romance blossoms over the set of an erotic movie, as they are the body doubles. The pair are very comfortable with each other, even though they are working together and there is constant nudity and sexual actions. Their relationship gets stronger over time and they are Couple #5.Couple #6 - Daniel is a widower and is now a single parent, raising his stepson Sam. Sam is miserable over the days and Daniel, trying hard to take over his newly-found responsibility, tries to find out what it is. He finds out Sam is 'in love' with a pretty young girl singer from school, who is co-incidentally named Joanna, which was the name of his late wife. Daniel, still getting over the loss of his love, forgets it for the sake of his stepson and encourages Sam to tell Joanna how he feels towards her. Their lovely journey of a father and son, and also their love lives, is #Couple 6.The newly elected Prime Minister, David (the dashing Hugh Grant), has a soft spot for one of the members of his catering staff, called Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). They pursue a silent relationship, not much apart from some flirting. After a situation with Natalie and the President of USA, David redistributes her, as he is beginning to think his feelings for her are affecting his job. After a Christmas Card fiasco, he realises his love for her and sets out to find her. Together they make up the cute #7th Couple.Lastly, Colin (Kris Marshall) is a wannabe playboy. Failing with almost every girl he meets, he sets off to America to find love, to the amusement of his best friend Tony. He finds 3 sexy girls who let him stay with him...He is #8.It is difficult to choose a favourite storyline because each one is different but very lovable, and for example, David and Aurélia are the funniest couple (with Aurélia being hilarious in her Portuguese dialect), but Mark and Juliet's awkward bond being the most understandable and difficult. Each actor gives a great performance and many scenes will leave you moved. Love Actually is not just a romance, it is a comedy, (though the romance factor takes over the comedy). The humour is very British, so people from other parts of the world may find it weird to understand, but all in all, it is a great movie with lots of fun, that will help you understand love. The ending is particularly moving and the most interesting feature of Love Actually is definitely the way the director has entwined all the stories.A charming Brit movie.",Null,0,1,29 December 2007
The Lion King," Fantastic, definitely one of Disney's best!
","This movie is extremely special to me and close to my heart, and every time I watch it I still get that lump in my throat when Mufasa dies. The Lion King is impossible not to like, with it's stunning animation, the well fitting voice cast, amazing music that will never be forgotten, and universal rating.Simba is a young lion cub, who lives on Pride Rock, and his father is the King, Mufasa, who is respected and loved by all. This makes Simba a prince and next in line to the throne. Simba is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, Mufasa's evil and extremely jealous brother, wants to take over Pride Rock and be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants...Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, respectively, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. But will Simba take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock? Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of young Simba, was very well casted. His voice matches with that of the feisty young cub perfectly. Matthew Broderick, who takes over the part of Simba as an adult, is just as good as his younger counterpart, if not better. I loved the voice of Mufasa, James Earl Jones, his voice is so calming and deep, and sounds wise, perfect for Mufasa, the ageing but immensely respected leader. Jeremy Irons as Scar is so perfectly done, ditto with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa's voice overs were done with great finesse and very tastefully, and the voices and characters are very lovable. I thought Nala's older voice, Moira Kelly was miscast. The young girl who played her younger part was much better though.Heartwrenching and loved by many, The Lion King is one that cannot be missed.",Null,2,2,8 December 2007
Casino Royale," James Bond at his best! *MINOR SPOILERS*
","Casino Royale is a a new take on the 007 series. Here we see Bond for the very first time, and Daniel Craig does such a fantastic job. Craig plays Bond just as he acquires he 007 status, this is the first story of Bond - Bond is a novice. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond was a very raw character who doesn't fit the 007 mould and still has to find his feet, his place, his confidence. Usually Bond's portrayal is more rugged though suave, not raw. I will have to repeat myself over and over until I bore you, about my love for Daniel Craig's performance in this movie. Craig as James Bond is one of the most amazing performances I have seen of 2006 and 2007 put together in Hollywood. Never before has a Bond been so humane, so understandable, so dashing. Craig not only has incredibly gorgeous good looks, but he can act superbly and I cannot stress more how much he fits the character of James Bond! This is undoubtedly his best performance and I sincerely hope he will remain as Bond for a long time and produce more great 007 movies. I LOVE him in this movie...:)The stunts in Casino Royale are another impressive feature. Riveting and thrilling, Casino Royale will glue you to your seat, eagerly waiting for more. Thankfully it doesn't disappoint and gives the audience fantastic scenes throughout. Casino Royale starts and finishes on a good note. A very memorable scene to me personally is the naked, pain-stricken James receiving punishment from Le Chiffre.Vesper Lynd, the new Bond girl, played by Eva Green was also a commendable performance. She is very different compared to any other 'Bond Girl'. Vesper Lynd is an equal to Bond, they have the same sense of humour, the same style, the same way of thinking. After all that, they even have a great chemistry! Vesper is beauty and brains. Craig and Green have a connection on screen, they seem to gel very well and all their scenes together are memorable and great to watch. My favourite scene of them together would be their first meeting in the train, exchanging sarcastic remarks and witty jokes to each other. Eva Green truly is a Bond girl, and a remarkable one at that. She became Vesper Lynd, and had some of the best lines in the whole film.Judi Dench as the irritable M was, as always, fantastic. She is one of the only actresses of her age group that I enjoy watching apart from Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. She is immortalised as M. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre was also a great performer, the cold eyes, the bone-chilling smile, the greasy hair; he does it all and in my opinion is one of the best villains of the decade. Caterina Murino as Solange was also decent enough.What I like best about this film is that James Bond is a very humane character, he has feelings, he fell in love for crying out loud, and he was even willing to give up his job for his love. He is not a agent with a heart of stone, he is a young man finding himself and maturing with time. As the movie progresses, the story gets more serious and the thrilling meter grows higher and higher. The tension I felt before the Poker game was indescribable. One more very interesting point in this movie is how James Bond was so different from every other Bond movie. He was immature, not fully ready for what he was taking on (of course he acquires it all as time goes on). For example, when Bond was asked whether he likes his martini shaken or stirred, he said 'Does it looks like I give a damn'. And honestly, NO Bond worth his pedigree would say that, because Bond ALWAYS likes his martini shaken, not stirred, in every movie of his. This showed Bond had a lot of growing up to do, before becoming what he is - a fantastic secret agent.To sum it up, Casino Royale provides star-studded performances, TERRIFIC stunts that will clench your fists, a story that will stir your soul, and a Bond that you will never forget. This is a masterpiece.The name's Bond. James Bond.",Null,7,12,29 December 2007
Pocahontas," Can YOU paint with all the colours of the wind...?
","I have this on DVD, and watching it again I'm still blown away by the message it gives. Pocohontas is about bringing people together, and that is what makes it different from the other Disney movies of that time. Hunchback was along similar lines, but in a completely different way. The animation was superb. Not so much on the people, but the scenery for sure. The background, such as the trees, river, everything landscape was gorgeous. In a way it was subtle and calm, dreamy blues and greys, and teal and pale green filled the film. As well as other colours, these shades were the main colours, and really gave Pocohontas a style of it's own. The emotions were shown by colour, e.g. red for anger, pink/purple for nature, blue was love. A palette of colours so exquisite still has not replaced Pocohontas in that department.The music was just as beautiful. Colours Of The Wind is still one of my favourite songs and I have it on my iPod even now. It reminded me of the feel-good meaningful music, like 'I Wonder' from Sleeping Beauty, 'Part Of Your World' in The Little Mermaid, 'Circle Of Life' and 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' in The Lion King just to name a few. Even 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin and the fantastic song 'Reflection' from Mulan. Meaningful music like this is rare nowadays.The characters were deep and complex but at the same time easy to read. Like Wiggins was so obviously gay, or at least had a feminine side. Governor Ratcliffe was the villain, and a good one at that, and John Smith was a hard exterior, but soft inside. Each one was portrayed and voiced very well. Especially Pocohontas. Such skill went into defining her character. I thought she was beautiful! Raven black hair, perfect suntanned skin, lips and a long neck to die for. She is a beauty indeed - except her beauty is more subtle and hidden in her eyes, rather than conventional Disney Princesses who are super slim with blonde hair, big eyes, a bust and a cheeky manner. Pocohontas had a beauty pageant to herself, she is stunning.My favourite character is and always has been Chief Powhatan. He has such a presence and wisdom that reminded me so much of Mufasa from The Lion King. His role was not as big but he amazed me. There was a great wise teacher in his being and person, and being able to show that from a Disney film is astounding.The ending was different, the lovers did not end up together, so what? The film is so great, and I strongly believe it should be much higher rated.",Null,2,3,21 December 2007
