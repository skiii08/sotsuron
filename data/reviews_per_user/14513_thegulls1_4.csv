Miracle," Fabulous re-telling of a great event...
","The poor Americans took a real beating in the 70's. During the opening credits and in the early background, we hear reminders of the end of the Vietnam war, the Watergate scandal & the bitter protests. They were due for a break. Along comes Herb Brooks, a visionary Anerican college hockey coach, to coach the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic USA men's hockey team. Can he whip a bunch of green, but talented kids into a competitive team? To prevail, they will have to find a way to vanquish the Soviet Union team, a group that was making monkeys out of the best NHL All-Stars.Outstanding performances by Kurt Russel as Brooks, in a role he was born to play; Noah Emmerich, a clever supporting actor, shines as Assistant Coach Craig Patrick; and veteran Kenneth Welsh is superb as the Team Doc. All the kids playing the U.S. players are excellent, and the hockey footage is terrific. A feel-good movie. (Note: this is the 2nd cinematic re-telling of this event--an early 80's flick with Karl Malden was the first, but it's been so long, I couldn't compare).",9,1,1,5 October 2018
Minority Report," ** He knows- don't go home **
","After years of passing it over, I am almost finished Minority Report on Netflix.. and what a ride! Cruise is excellent in this futuristic look at crime prevention in the year 2054, wherein teams of officers use the 'visions' of human 'pre-cogs' to anticipate & halt muderous actions. The time frame seems tight at the outset, meaning the team may not make it in time, which of course, adds to the suspense. We learn that the murder rate in Washington DC has dropped to zero since inception, but a law enforcement group led by Colin Farrel (under the direction of a highly-placed official) are opposed to the continuation and expansion of the so-called 'pre-cog' tool.Ethical issues are raised, e.g. how can you arrest someone who has the intent to commit a crime, but gets stopped before the actual felony? Can the 'pre-cogs' get it wrong? Cruise, our man in charge, feels the system is just, and foolproof, but soon finds himself 'accused', and fleeing apprehension. Later in his flight, he manages to secure a pre-cog for assistance, who directs his escape with specific instructions, I.e. buy an umbrella, stop here, etc. To a shocked lady passing by, she whispers, He knows-don't go home. This reminds me of the early flight of Neo in the Matrix, when the 'agents' come to arrest him, but he is hearing a narrative-escape plan from Laurence Fishburn, as he runs.Terrific PG (mostly) entry in a sci-fi flick directed by Spielberg way back in 2002, perhaps perilously close to being forgotten in the wake of the high octane Mission Impossible series. Well worth watching.",9,0,0,4 August 2018
Léon: The Professional," Gary Oldman rocks!
","Jean Reno plays a near-illiterate, but skilled 'cleaner', or 'fixer'. That means you will do what he says... or else. Most hitmen aren't so genial..Frankly, a lot of bad language & graphic violence in this entry, but Gary Oldman is worth the price of admission. His performance as a crooked, quirky cop is frightening. He showed his bad guy chops 2 decades ago in 'Fifth Element' & 'Air Force One'. More recently, he portrayed Churchill in 'Darkest Hour', but I marvel at his work as the quiet, honest cop, Gordon, in the Batman entries with Christian Bale. Oldman can play under-stated or over-stated, as the occasion requires. In this one, he's a raving loonie, guaranteed to make the weirdo dating your daughter look like a prize catch.If you read the IMDb trivia, you will learn that Oldman more or less improv'd a couple of scenes in Léon, for effect. He is an immensely unlikable character in this flick-ruthless & heartless-but you can't take your eyes off him anyway.Natalie Portman, in her 12-yr old rookie appearance, shines and Jean Reno, as the 'cleaner'-gunman who becomes obliged to mentor/protect Portman, is outstanding in a role similar to another 90'S flick, Wasabi, in which he played a tough French cop (I didn't say it was a nice cop). 9/10",9,1,1,4 April 2018
No Country for Old Men," Tough film -- great symbolism..
","The story: an uncompromising tale of greed, ruthlessness, and unstoppable foes, with a backdrop illustrating the changes the drug trade has ushered in. Javier Bardem is the most frightening, but personable*, assassin ever caught on film (*that's what makes him so frightening).In my opinion, the USA IS the country symbolized in the title - due to drug trafficking, it has become overrun with narcotics, gangs, weapons, and senseless murders. It is {no longer} a country for old men to live peacefully.Brilliantly shot and directed, with fabulous performances all around. But it won't cheer you up, or make your day. Sorry.",9,2,3,15 December 2016
