Conquest 1453," a complete mis-representation of history
","The intentions of the producers is quite evident. The movie is completely racial and communal. It portrays the Pope and the Emperor Constantine as villains and shows Catholics as murderers and rapists. Although the movie is completely one sided, I did enjoy some of the effects. The sequence was again very dry , but that's probably because of it being so one sided.This movie is a complete mis-representation of history and has obviously been funded by the Oil Rich Muslims to spread a feeling of hatred to the Christians. Its a pity that such a movie is being promoted at a time like this . which can fuel a sense of enmity and hatred",1,24,46,20 September 2012
Incendies," Just the right time for Indians to watch
","I just watched the movie today. And I think more of coincidence or karma as we believe in India - this is just the right moment for a movie like this to be seen. In the last week the entire India has seen mass protests and violent demonstrations against the govt in view of a merciless gang-rape that has left the 23 year old victim battling for life. This incident being one of the 600 odd rapes that have occurred in Delhi - The national capital of India, in this year alone . Of course there is no other resemblance to the movie . Except the fact that rape can be such a inhuman crime and makes us wonder whether the human race is become more like animals with crimes to this extent. I applaud the writer and director for bringing it out in the most shocking form and gives a repulsion which almost makes you want to puke . I know this movie is going to keep me thinking for days ... I hope others in India will also witness THIS movie in the coming days, as our govt decides whether rape requires a captive punishment or the seven year imprisonment will suffice",Null,1,4,26 December 2012
Dark Shadows," One of the best movies ever
","This cannot be classified under any particular genre . A completely different concept even from the usual Tim Burton fantasy movies. This movie is obviously not meant for a lot of people and has left a lot disappointed . And that's NOT cos the movie was bad, but just that the majority viewers prefer watching a stereotype fixed movie and are not ready to venture into something completely new and original. True, I agree the the ending is a tee let down from the Super High Start. and I have given a star less for that. But apart from that - Tim Burton is a genius and can deliver something fresh for 'those' in search of it. And outstanding performance by Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, not to mention the rest of the STAR crew",9,2,4,4 November 2012
