Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very Thin
","The Phantom Menace is really disappointing. It totally lacks the mythic sense of the 'first' three movies. In those films, the special effects rode on the characters' backs. Here, instead, the special effects are meant to awe us and draw us away from the lack of a strong mythos.Instead, we get pod races and an underwater chase which, while good as amusement park rides, don't really advance the storyline. Look at the original Star Wars. These set pieces naturally flowed from the events going on in the film. I got the feeling that they came up with this pod race idea and then fit the story around it.I am not the world's greatest Star Wars fan. I watched and appreciated the first three, but did not learn every line of dialogue. Still, I can see where those films used the idea of myth and archetype very well. Here, the characters are flat.One good point about the movie was seeing the young Obi Wan. It was the most interesting part for me to think about Obi Wan being a young, occassionally unsure jedi knight, instead of the monumental one we saw later. It was touching and done well by Ian Mcgregor.This is, of course, pretty much a 'must see' movie for most filmgoers. I'm sure the DVD/rental release will be amazingly popular. I just wish I had the sense that Lucas had put the care into the story and characters for this one as he had in previous ones. I don't buy that he had to set up a story so that's why this film is so superficial. If that's all he set out to do, then he shouldn't have bothered making the film until he had it all thought out.",Null,1,2,6 November 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," unlikeable
","I think anyone who watches this movie will be very surprised at how utterly unlikeable the three main characters are. They are all kind of miserable people who really lack any desirable features. Bridget is supposed to be this woman that you secretly root for and hope she finds happiness but instead I found her to be selfish, petty and without any kind of concern for others at all really.As for Firth's character, there were two main problems. One, he just has a very constipated demeanor throughout the whole movie. As the movie went on, I began to find it very frustrating to watch him. I understand he is supposed to be a sort of constricted fellow, but he took this to the point of not acting at all.Secondly, his transformation is totally unbelievable. For the first part of the movie, he criticizes Bridget. But then suddenly at a party he just blurts out that he likes her. When did this transformation take place? We never see him showing any kind of interest at all and then this suddenly happens. This is just very ham-handed directing and I was not surprised to see this was this director's first movie.Additionally, Hugh Grant's character was supposed to be the cad. He was supposed to be shown as being a jerk because he slept with another woman. Well, Bridget is the one who falls far too quickly for him, mentions love very suddenly in the relationship. AFAIK, Grant never said anything to lead her on that this was an exclusive relationship. Again, we are supposed to feel for her, but she shows absolutely no intelligence whatsoever in this process.In the end, everyone just wanted something from someone else. I found myself not really caring about who ended up with whom.I know some people will say that you have to be a 30-something single woman to enjoy this movie, that you see something of your own life in it, but I have to say that if you must be somewhat like the main character in a movie to like it, then that movie has failed.",Null,0,0,26 October 2001
