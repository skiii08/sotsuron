The Blair Witch Project," definitely different
",I have heard many reviews and comments on this movie. I have to say I was very disappointed when the movie ended but that was because I did not understand the ending at first.  If you want to understand the ending you have got to pay very close attention to what the people say when the kids are interviewing them. It is a total documentary of the footage of these kids making the film.  The film they  found a year after their disappearance.  The Blair witch web site is very informative on how detailed the investigation got.....which is something you never see in the actual movie.  I would say this is a good movie but if it had the interviews with the kids parents or the cops searching or something other than just a jumpy camera it would have been better.  I do also have to say that the more i think of the movie the scarier it gets ...It gets under your skin and that's when your fears come out.  It is not a gross slasher type of movie...,Null,0,0,9 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Awesome
","I was very impressed with this movie.  I don't know how to describe it. A love story, drama, horror, action,it is all of these wrapped up in one. When i was in the theater people really got into the movie.  People jumped with surprise, laughed , and just everyone there seemed to really enjoy this movie.  I saw this opening night then went 2 days later and saw blair witch. I enjoyed sixth sense 100 percent more than blair witch(which was an 87 min movie and sixth sense was 114 mins of pure enjoyment) I could really relate with the relationship Malcolm and Cole has and how they help each other out. It's not just the doctor helping his patient out but together they bond.  It is a bit graphic of a movie which all in all really makes the movie.  Go see it for yourself...you will not be disappointed .. i say this will be the number one film of the year",10,0,0,9 August 1999
