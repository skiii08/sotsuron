The Ring," Horrible remake!
","Having seen the original Ringu film, I was very happy to rent this it's first week out.  Having heard from friends how it scared them so bad, and how it was a good film, I had to see it.  How disappointed I was with the regular bland american studio produced crap it turned out to be.  With Gore V. directing I should have known, he would sell his mama if the studio's told him to.  This remake is so slow and pointless that it makes the original look so much better.  All of Naomi Watts' character's findings come to her very easily.  Maybe she is Columbo's daughter the way she solves this mystery.In the Ringu version the story unfolds slowly, but realisticly.  The actual video that you watch and will die for, is much more scary in the Jap version.  To much CGI and rip offs make for a bad time.  I guess the ending is what most people talk about.  I felt that the ending in the american version was forced upon us very quickly to the point where it wasn't even scary.  The Ringu version has a great scary ending, that will make you stop breathing (at least for a few seconds).  The biggest difference is the explanation of what's going on.  The Ring confuses people because it is a bad movie, period.There are 3 Ringu movies from Japan.  Ringu 2 is not that good, but decent. I think they used a few things from part 2 in the american Ring.  Ringu 0, which is a prequel might even be better or at least as good as the original Ringu.  Be sure to get ahold of Ringu 0, it is available on Ebay with subtitles.  Ringu has been available as well, even though Dreamworks just released it on Friday, to cash in some more.  Why does this movie have such a high rating?  Let's get with the program people.",4,0,1,8 March 2003
Minority Report," Could have been very good
","The problems with this film are what come up the most.  The only reason John Anderton ran into Crow was because of what he saw.  Then why would the pre-cog have a real vision if the only reason he would kill Crow was if he saw the vision.  Does that make sense?  I enjoyed the slant on Anderton's son, and the emotion Tom Cruise put into the character.  Do we ever have an action hero who is also a dope head?  This is one of Tom Cruise's best performances.The movie should have been darker during the action sequences.  When Colin Farrell's character is chasing Cruise through the apartment building and auto production plant, I just found the music to be happy and Spielberg was trying to be comical.  The movie reaches it's climax about 30 minutes before it ends.  I would have preferred if the movie ended with Anderton actually finding out what happened to his son.  The ending comes on to fast and sets a pace that the rest of the movie had not set.  6/10 Good",6,0,1,27 September 2003
Insomnia," I wanted to like it, but thinking about it caused me not to sleep.
","The good things are the setting, the acting, and Nicky Katt.  Does that Nicky guy rule or what?  The whole internal affairs angle has been done many times.  Why didn't Pacino just shoot Williams when chasing him along the lumber dock?  They tried to use every scene that has been done before.  How many killer movies have come out in the past 10 years that seem the same as this?  I got the feeling I was watching Seven set in the Alaskan wilderness at the beginning.  I hope the original version of this film is not as cliched as this.  Pacino gives a good performance even though I really never felt for him not sleeping.  I give Insomnia a 5/10.  Fair to Good",5,0,1,23 September 2003
We Were Soldiers," A cliched, but good war film
","Let me start with the problem scenes in this film.  There the scene where the white lady says that the local laundromat is for white clothes only. Then the other ladies tell her that it means that only white people can go there.  Was that a joke or was it meant to be serious?  They also try to show war is bad by humanizing the enemy.  Barry Pepper's character throwing down the gun was a crappy scene.The good things were Sam Elliott and Mel Gibson.  I like how Mel just keeps walking around the battle not worrying about getting shot.  Sam Elliott saying he'll kill any mother that calls him grandpa.  I also liked the religious slant on the film.  A good war movie, very graphic.  The end was a cheap way to try to scare you and it sucked.  6/10  but hey, it's Mel Gibson",6,0,1,25 August 2003
Final Destination 2," Great death scenes
","This sequel has great death scenes.  From kids getting crushed, to air bag impalement.  The character development in this film is also good, which is missing from a lot of horror films today.  I cannot say enough about the special effects.  The highway pile-up at the beginning was awesome.  The story was only fair so I give it a 5/10",5,1,2,25 August 2003
City of God," One of the best of 2002
","I enjoyed this all the way through, which doesn't happen very often.  The characters are so real and raw that you forget it is just a movie.  The truth is that things could have been like this at the place and time.  I don't want to get to detailed into this, but it's not your regular rip-off gangster movie that some people call it.  It has a heart and soul all to itself.  The scenes with kids no older than 4 being involved in shootings and getting shot are very powerful.  Check this film out, it's a winner. 8/10 Very Good",8,0,2,2 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not as fun as the first, but still good
","I guess most people take the Lord of the Rings trilogy very serious.  I see this as just a good film.  The acting is fair, and the CGI is some of the best.  There is a lot of walking around and talking in The Two Towers, and it's tough for a three hour movie to still be compelling.  The battle scene in the last hour is very well done.  6/10 Good",6,0,0,28 September 2003
Moulin Rouge!," A perfect 10 out of 10
","I loved this movie since the first time I saw it opening weekend, and it still makes me laugh, cry, sing, and dance.  The perfect use of song is what keeps this movie going.  Just when you think you have seen the best song sequence, another pops up and pleasantly surprises you.  My favorite part would have to be when Satine sings 'I'll Fly Away' followed by many different songs with Christian.  The Roxanne scene near the end is also awesome.  This movie never lets up and is perfectly done all the way through.  I have never felt so happy and honored to watch a film as this. 10/10",10,1,2,13 December 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Chiaki Kuriyama is slammin' as Go Go Yubari
","Chiaki Kuriyama made the biggest impression on me.  She is not only cute, but deadly. Her character Go Go Yubari needs her own movie series. Anyway, the rest of the film has it's ups and downs.  There are a ton of scenes of just The Bride talking or just looking at something.  The slow points had me almost falling asleep in my very comfortable movie chair.  I don't like to compare other films, but Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown never let up or got tedious.  I enjoyed the look of the film and the music.  The 'My name is Buck, and I'm here to f**k' scene was hilarious.  I say check it out. It's better than most crap being put out nowadays.  6/10 Good",6,0,0,10 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," A disappointing sequel
","The one thing that made the first film special is the connection with the characters.  The first film also explained everything that was happening which made it very interesting.  Matrix Reloaded offers nothing new except for special effects.  The f/x were great, but that doesn't make a good film. The bad acting and bad dialog killed this film.  It looks like they just threw it together and counted on the f/x to make the film.  The freeway chase scene was the high point.  4/10",4,0,0,21 August 2003
X2: X-Men United," An enjoyable film, even for a non fan
","I was never a fan of anything dealing with X-Men.  I can't say I even knew anything about it other than a few of the characters, but the first film was good.  I also enjoyed the sequel, as the action and plot were very well done.  I found Hugh Jackman to give the best performance, as he commands the screen as an action hero.  The whole story of Stryker using his own son to have Charles Xavier kill all of the mutants on earth was great.  The film also has it's funny scenes.  6/10 Good",6,0,0,14 August 2003
The Matrix," A good mix of action and emotion
","Of course the action scenes are top notch and really get you going, but the key to this film is the emotions we feel for the characters.  The film takes time to develop the characters and their relationships.  For such a complex story they take the time to tell us every detail of what is going on.  From the time Neo and Trinity go to save Morpheus the film never lets up for a thrilling 45 minute ending.  Not many movies can sustain an action packed ending for a long period of time.  7/10  Good to Very Good",7,0,1,29 September 2003
