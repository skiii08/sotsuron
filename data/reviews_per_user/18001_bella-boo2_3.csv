Requiem for a Dream," I've never experienced so much emotion throughout a film
","This movie had me shaking and in tears when it finished. It was so many nightmares compiled into one, I wasn't sure which hell looked worse. This movie is a must see, but must never watch again. Very heavy and dark, but one that almost motivates you to be better.",10,0,1,22 February 2019
A Star Is Born," Pretty overrated. Started off strong-ended boring
","The first half of this movie had me so intrigued! I enjoy every second of the first half....and then it just started going down hill. There's such confusing flashbacks from them and now, and there is really no climax nor does the second half really even have a story line. Really really overrated. Honestly seemed like an ordinary movie that Netflix would pick up- if it weren't so overrated I could have maybe enjoyed the movie for what it was",3,3,7,11 February 2019
Call Me by Your Name," pretentious
","I am a die hard Timothée chamalet fan...but this was a giant no. First off, it was soo boring. Way too long, so much that was so unnecessary. You don't connect to the characters, they sound like elites sitting around and talking about opera and poetry. Armie Hammer is WAY too old, Timothée looks WAY to young...creepy. This movie wanted to be 'carol' but with a mix of pretty cinematography that felt once again pretentious.
Give credit where its due, titles like 'carol' or 'God's Own Country' deserve this hype. mediocre at best",1,10,41,20 February 2019
