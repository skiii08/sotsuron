Hereditary," Well written story with some scares and great acting
","I fought on whether to give this a 7 or 8 out of 10. After reading the explanation of the movie after watching, it made all that much more sense and decided on 8. It was a smartly written horror with a lot of original ideas which don't come around often in horror movies now a days. The acting was great, especially Toni college. I had lots of questions after it was done but I don't mind that in a movie. If it had a few more true scares in the middle of the movie, I might have thought of a 9/10.",8,1,2,2 September 2018
Mother!," Not horror/thriller, what is it?
","I can't say I actually enjoyed any of the 2hrs so I have to give a low rating. Very strange making it hard to enjoy. The entire time I was just trying to understand what was happening, but maybe it was just me. I hate that it was under horror/thriller genre as it gave me a false idea of what to expect (maybe a drama?, definitely not horror). It only made a bit of sense when I goggled the meaning of the movie. that's when I said 'hey I guess that makes sense'. unfortunately I still didn't find it enjoyable but giving it 4/10 as it was well acted and original.",4,0,0,31 December 2017
