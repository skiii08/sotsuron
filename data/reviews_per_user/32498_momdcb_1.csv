Raiders of the Lost Ark," I LOVE this movie-but...
","I don't know how many times I've watched this movie (1x/yr=40). But I just caught a major error (which should have been caught in production). When they're getting the staff headpiece translated the man says the height is 6 kadam & Sallah says that's about 72'. Then the man says to take back 1 kadam, which would make the correct staff height 60'. They're so excited that the Germans are digging in the wrong place.When Indy goes into the map room, the staff he picks up is a foot taller than him, or about 7ft, when it should be 5ft, or about his shoulder height. So now THEY are digging in the wrong place. I can't believe I never caught that!Still a great movie & storyline.",10,0,1,28 March 2020
