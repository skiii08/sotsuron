Walk the Line," Truly Amazing
","I am 33 years old. I have heard of Johnny Cash.I didn't know one song of his. I've never knowingly heard a Johnny Cash song before this movie.One word to describe this film: PERFECT One of the best films I have seen. I loved the music and the acting is superb. I can't believe Joaquin Phoenix actually sang these songs - they turned out almost better than Cash himself. It think he would be proud.Robert Patrick played an excellent part as Cash's father. I didn't see this movie until after the Oscars. I can't believe that Brokeback Mountain was even close to winning this Oscar. This is the best thing Hollywood has produced in years. It's about time the U.S. has produced a respectable movie instead of the trash of recent years.Now, back to downloading Johnny Cash MP3's :)",10,0,0,6 April 2006
