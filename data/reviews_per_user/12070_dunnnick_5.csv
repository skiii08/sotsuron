Changeling," Clint and Angelina's collaboration is very good
","Clint Eastwood continues to broaden his artistic horizon and with Changeling he again delivers a great feature film of depth and complexity. I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to watch a really interesting, true dramatic story. Though some of the subject matter may be a bit intense for the faint of heart, it needs to be that way in order to convey the horrific events surrounding the case of Christine Collins and her son Walter. Like nearly every Clint Eastwood project, whether acting, directing, or producing, this one will have you thinking about its events long after viewing. A word of mention to Angelina Jolie who is in fine form here. Great film.",Null,1,1,18 December 2018
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a good film to watch late night
",Sleepy Hollow is a good film and the haunting atmosphere and the fantastic production design are the primary reasons for it. Johnny Depp as the milquetoast constable Ichabod Crane is more than competent and frankly I could not have envisioned anyone in this role. Supporting cast are Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien and of course Christopher Walken as the scary headless horseman. The pacing is excellent although I feel this is a niche film and you need to watch it with a certain mindset.,Null,0,0,22 September 2018
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Dino mayhem continued
","The Lost World is a worthy sequel to the awesome Jurassic Park. Spielberg is back at the director's chair- though not many knew at the time he'd never helm a Jurassic film again- and the script is sound. Many criticize the last segment when it becomes a sort of King Kong with Dinosaurs aka a T-Rex loose in the city but I didn't mind it. The effects are great, acting is good though no one really cares about the characters as long as there are dinos chewing people and the direction is sound. The Lost World may not be as good as Jurassic Park but it's a good sequel.",Null,3,27,25 July 2018
Men in Black," Awesome comedy science fiction classic
",": Men in Black works on a few factors- a well plotted storyline and the chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Men in Black are a secret organization which monitor extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. When an alien being starts creating havoc in New York our two leads act to rid of it. Linda Fiorentino is sassy as the sole female presence here and it is strange to see her career fizzle out the way it did. Vincent D O'nofrio is excellent as the human host of the alien. Men in Black is a breezy affair, funny and the kind of film Hollywood should make more often yet does not. The special effects are good such that they assist the story and not just exist to provide pyro technique eye candy.",Null,0,0,6 September 2018
Die Hard," Is this the greatest action film ever made? Maybe
","Die Hard is an incredibly well paced action film with a wisecracking lead we relate to and an awesome bad guy. Directed by John Mctiernan Die Hard is a template for great action movies- It has relentless action, great one liners and suitable pyrotechnics instead of mindless CGI. John Mclane and Hans Gruber have endeared themselves in pop culture. What is incredible about Die Hard is that it has lost none of its edge and still retains every bit of its charm to this day. No matter how many movies Willis makes he shall forever be best known for running around barefoot atop the Nakatomi building.",Null,0,0,15 November 2018
