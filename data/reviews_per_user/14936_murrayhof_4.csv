It," Opening Scene Great than different type of Monster
","The movie starts with a very nicely shot scene that drew me in right from the start (4 stars for that), then well not much to say, in fact the ONLY real monster was played by the character Beverly's dad and the very much implied sexual misconduct he was implied to be having with his daughter. That was awful and ruined the movie. Pennywise is not real but sexual abuse is very much so. +4 for the cinematography and -2 for the dad = a net 2 (barely)",2,1,1,18 January 2018
Dunkirk," WOW, that was Boring!
","Short and Sweet, just watched in 12/25 on Blu-ray, glad I waited. I love War movies especially WWII movies so I was very excited to see this one and I waited about 7 months for it to come out. Boring, dull, bland, vanilla, did I say bad? So much better out there, I am sure it will still win an award or two, for sound maybe? Wait for it to come on TNT in a year or so then you can fast forward to the end.",2,1,1,26 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Just my Opinion
","I will offer NO SPOILERS at all, go see for yourself, but I will give my take on the movie I saw today. I saw the original at age 6 and went on to see it 9 times that summer. I think the problem people are having with the saga now is that we can not see the same story with are child eyes again. Did the dialogue suck, YES, did it also seem like an Empire retread, some what. Just like a good book Star Wars needs to come to an end. Characters will have to be killed off, this is basically a WAR movie and people die in war. Was I disappointed, somewhat was it worth my $6.00 sure. Do I want to see it again, sure on Blu-ray. Do not be afraid of these bad reviews, make your own mind up. 7/10",7,0,0,19 December 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Not bad, What Were You Expecting?
","Everyone always starts, I have seen a lot of bad reviews.......and so with Kong some song, but wait.....What Were You Expecting? I liked all the giant creatures, at a moments notice you could be eaten alive or squashed like a grape, man is no longer the top of the food chain and that is scary to me. This movie would have scared me as a child, you may say a child should not see this until a certain age but my mother took me to see Jaws when I was only 4 and we live very close to the Gulf of Mexico and warm shark water and I still do not go in water I can not see the bottom. OK, back to Kong, really not that bad, some parts were just as good as any Jurassic Park movie, if you like those movies with huge CGI monsters than this will be your cup of tea. I like the fact that they still stuck with the idea that Kong is a good guy and only bad men want to kill me. If you are still a child at heart, not a bad rent at all. 7/10",7,1,2,1 August 2017
