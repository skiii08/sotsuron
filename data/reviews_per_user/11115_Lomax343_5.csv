Ford v Ferrari," Even non-petrolheads will love it.
","I saw this at a mystery screening at my local cinema. When I saw the title card, I was dismayed. First because I have no knowledge of, nor interest in, motor racing. Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.
I'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.
Petrolheads will love it. Non-petrolheads will love it as well.",8,3,6,2 December 2019
Zootopia," Truly a film for everyone
","When it comes to being a parent, part of the deal is to watch kids' films. Sometimes this can be a painful experience - let's just say that my kids and I differ radically in our assessment of Alvin and the $*&^£!*ing Chipmunks. On other occasions, however, the experience can be joyful. I went into this film with low expectations, and unexpectedly had a ball. I honestly found it laugh-out-loud funny, and so did my kids. Moreover, we often laughed at the same scene for different reasons. My kids have never seen the Godfather, for instance, and neither have they (yet) had to deal with a government department whose speed of service would be improved by replacing everyone with sloths - but there were elements in these scenes which worked for them as well as the bits that worked for me. It is very difficult to produce a film that really is for everybody, but this is one of the very best.To be sure, the 'moral lesson' is clichéd and obvious, many of the characters were simple stereotypes, and the plot twists were more than a little predictable. Such things matter little to kids, however; and I can live with them when things are handled with zest and panache. The action is fast-paced, the acting first-class, the animation state-of-the-art - and the sight-gags are both brilliant, and scattered in such profusion that you probably don't have time to catch them all on one viewing. All in all a wonderful film.",9,7,13,27 June 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Winter for Hitler
","It's human nature to deal with horrible events (and people) by laughing at them - and this film does the best job of laughing at the Third Reich since Springtime for Hitler. The comedy is brilliant (who'd've thought you could get laughs out of people saying 'Heil Hitler'?) - but with an undercurrent of both biting satire and warm-heartedness. But it's not just a comedy. When **that** happens, the fact that the audience was completely unprepared for it gives it the impact of a physical blow. A superb performance from young Roman Griffin Davis as a child trying to make sense of a mad world. But is the **law** to include a comedy fat kid?",10,2,5,4 January 2020
Midway," A lesson that's still not been learned.
","Special effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a bad film good.This film has excellent special effects - but nothing else to recommend it.The result is spectacular dullness.",4,2,5,10 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's just a re-boot
","I say this contains spoilers, but anyone who's watched the 1977 original will have seen it all anyway. Some plans (sorry, a part of a map) are hidden in a droid which, after wandering across a desert (check) falls into the hands of the adopted son of a farmer (sorry, a lone female scavenger). At the same time it is hunted by the Galactic Empire (sorry, the First Order), under the command of a bad guy in a mask (sorry - oh no, that was correct, though this time there's a bad gal in a mask as well).Meanwhile the Empire (First Order) has created a terrible weapon called the Death Star (sorry - Death Planet, only in this universe a planet is bigger than a star).So the farmer's boy (female scavenger) and the droid (check) and a former Jedi (sorry - former Stormtrooper who's probably going to turn out to be a Jedi) proceed to a cantina (check) where they meet up with Han Solo and Chewbacca (sorry, this time they meet Han and Chewie THEN go to the cantina).Then the Rebel Alliance launch a daring attack with X-wing fighters (check) which - well, if you can't see it coming by now you have issues.Oh, I forgot - there's a father-son reveal (check).OK. Yes, this is all done with style and pizazz and state-of-the-art effects, and the young persons I saw it with (aged ten and thirteen) were happy to go along for the ride. And it's far better than The Phantom Menace - and it's even a good film in its own right.But part VII? More like a re-make of part IV.",6,13,19,22 December 2015
