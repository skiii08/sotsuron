Marie Antoinette," Lost in Versalles.
","Mixture of music, color, forms and rhythms that underline and stimulate what is told, dazzling movie. However, one thing is to eliminate historical passages and another very different one that devotion to their creatures becomes excessive.",7,1,2,27 November 2018
A Star Is Born," A new Oscar winner is born.
","Lady Gaga is the movie, the rest accompanies, but without it it would be impossible for it to work as it does, since in the rest of the aspects it hobbles and at times it becomes boring.And the oscar goes to... Lady Gaga.",7,0,1,10 October 2018
Darkest Hour," Dunkirk made polity or a Churchill biopic?
","Okay, this review is totally personal and that's why I'm going to talk about this movie from a more 'political' point of view.
Let's go, the film seems that all he wants is to dulcify the figure of Winston Churchill and presents him as someone needed for the world today; I mean, the British prime minister is facing a cowardly political class that is only looking for a peace with Hitler because of the fear of losing what they have in case of defeat (similarities between Trump's victory? where? I do not see them)
In the midst of all this, and with a party that does not support him and has only chosen him to gain time for a favorable peace treaty, or little bad, Churchill appears as the savior of the nation guided by his instincts and the voice of the people, this is so funny because only happens in one scene when there are fifteen minutes left for the end.
Ignoring all that, it's a good movie and especially Gary Oldman.",7,0,3,23 February 2018
Deadpool 2," Like the first, but better.
","Film that follows the path of its predecessor in everything but adding slight nuances that differentiates and improves it.
One of the main improvements is in the guide, humor and tone outputs of the protagonists are more natural in the dialogues.
In the original it was noted that certain gags were forced or simply produced because the script so dictated, however, in the second part this is seen as something that flows in the conversations that are established.
The inclusion of secondary is done in a masterly way and they all look and feel fresh in a universe that does not lack this type of characters.
The rest of the elements that compose the tape are very continuist with the first and for that reason they do not fail in any aspect.
The most negative note can be given in the attempt to add a more serious nuance in certain moments of the movies and that some action scenes are extremely long and slow the narrative rhythm.",8,6,13,29 May 2018
Molly's Game," Poker drama.
","The best: Jessica Chastain is by far one of the best actresses of the last decade, she leaves us another great performance in which she is the movie. The direction of Aaron Sorkin personality to a film that lacks it.
The worst: The plot is extremely predictable and times are poorly measured, do not know when to go fast or when to slow the pace. The supporting actors, except for Michael Cera are extremely flat and lack charisma.",7,1,2,29 May 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman is a teenager.
","Film quite entertaining and more comical compared to what Marvel has done, except for Guardians of the Galaxy. It takes more than half a film to catch pace and once it does it speeds up too much and everything happens in a very short space of time. Spiderman is presented to us as someone overly immature who fights against a villain who has no charisma, but has more background and motivations than Spiderman.
Entertaining movie, and no more.",7,1,2,6 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Best movie of 2017.
","The best: Frances McDormand (this oscar is so obvious), Woody Harrelson andSam Rockwell.His interpretations make this experiment of cotinelity realistic. The direction and script of Martin McDonagh make the film look real and at no time do you have the feeling that nothing is happening on the screen.The worst: The one that is presumed as the main plot is overlapped by the personal relationships of the protagonists. the end ... but this you will have to discover.",9,2,9,8 February 2018
Climax," Kill the dance floor, but do not kill the rhythm.
","No√© concentrates all his author traits, but incorporates enough novel elements to leave us satisfied. Once you start the plot you can not stop looking. We're trapped.The film seduces us with its rhythms and its daring staging through the corporal expression of the actors-dancers. Beautiful and brutal.Technically and artistically it is splendid, it borders on perfection, but, the argument does not go that far. Presents a choral cast and then focus on a single character. We know the motivations and fears of the characters through a brief interview at the beginning of the film and through the psychotropic trip. This leaves us with a film that is more empty than it seems.When he talks about human drama, the plot is great, however, when he leaves this drama, the film falls apart. The last 45 minutes are long, slow and obtuse.",7,14,36,28 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Well done Marvel.
","The best: Close virtually unbeatable for the ten years of the MCU, drink of the best of each Marvel saga. The way to bring all the protagonists together is sublime. The BSO and the CGI are the best that has been in the MCU to date. Unite with such elegance and naturalness the themes that are given in each of the films and none of them is out of place at any time. As for the CGI, what to say, one of Marvel's strengths since this universe began and once again does not disappoint. The brothers Russo direct and most importantly, they mount the film and that's where the difference between this film and a movie of the genre is noticed.
The worst: The script has more holes than a 'Gruyere cheese' they teach a lot and they count little, they leave all the answers for the announced Avengers 4. The times of the film are quite badly taken and the subplot of Thanos and Gamora are left over in the movie .",8,1,2,29 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Everything is pretty.
","We all know the good of this movie, so I'm just going to talk about the bad. 'His perfection has something provocative. As if inviting you to wish her, 'Elio's father says in a moment. This phrase contains more than half a film: its constant incitement to be desired. This is a film about the first love, but it ends up vanishing in the search of the mysterious in the beautiful and in the desire as an update of the Hellenic love. The dialogues between Elio and Oliver are lost in their snobbish and intellectual self-realization, the film seems to want to focus solely on this relationship as if its cultural baggage were the only object of desire among them. But not only is there the perfection that the film tries to show, the story takes place in an idyllic villa in northern Italy, a decoration that seems like a cover of Vogue magazine rather than a teenage love story.
With the exception of this, the film is wonderful, one of the best of the year and will remain in our retinas for many years. From the interpretation of the protagonists to the well-narrated love story.",9,1,3,4 March 2018
The Shape of Water," The best worst movie
","The best: The direction and photography are spectacular, clear favorites to take both Oscars. Michael Shannon plays a sublime role. The BSO is the best thing that has been done in years for the cinema. Show that without great lines of dialogue you can get to have a great story that reaches the bottom of each viewer. The interpretation of the secondary characters.The worst: The film takes time to catch pace. The interpretation Sally Hawkins leaves to be desired. The parts that make up the whole do not quite fit, it feels like different artists who have put together their art, not like a complete movie.",8,11,22,20 February 2018
The Disaster Artist," The best movie about the worst movie.
","The best interpretation of James Franco to this day and, possibly, that of his entire career. His interpretation of Tommy Wiseau is so great that he doubts that he has an interpretation to the director / actor / producer / scriptwriter; speaking of screenwriters, the script of the film is extremely good and has a freshness in everything that poses in the film. The performance of the secondary characters and especially Dave Franco is masterful.
The final comparison between the original 2003 and this one lets us see how extremely worried the latter is in all aspects and all the actors interpret identically in this film than the original.
Definitely, it is a movie taken care of in every way and that pays perfect tribute to the best-worst movie in history.",9,0,0,29 May 2018
American Gangster," Timeless masterpiece.
","The best: Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe and the luxury secondary do it magnificently, none of them out of tune, much of this merit has the costumes and hairdressing. THE, yes in uppercase. The third act changes the rhythm of the film and creates a dynamism that helps the final sprint in a film that can be accused of lack of rhythm in the early stages. The final interrogation between the protagonists is the best possible closure.
The worst: The first two acts are excessively slow and in some tedious moments, personal mark of Ridley Scott.",9,2,4,22 May 2018
13 Hours," Military good, bureaucrats bad.
","Michael Bay only knows how to make a movie. The film focuses on the characters, but they do not feel like real people nor do they have dialogues that are not slogans. They reduce the Libyan situation to good and savior Americans, poor and savage Arabs.",5,3,9,6 July 2018
