The Blair Witch Project," Strange and horrifying
","This movie scared the absolute daylights out of me.  I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but the last two nights of the footage shown and probably the last five minutes of the movie had me and my friends shaking and even crying for a couple of seconds.  The actors were absolutely amazing.  The fear that they conveyed was so real and everything was unscripted allowing them to really be scared, mad, etc.  This was a great movie, although I don't think I would ever see it again being that I didn't sleep more than an hour until the sun came up this morning when I finally fell asleep and the fact that I'm still running the last scene through my mind. It still scared me as much as it did when I was in the theatre. I recommend everyone to go see this movie, but make sure you have someone to sleep next to, or in be the same room as someone else that night...trust me, you won't want to be alone.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
The Green Mile," The best
",All I can say is that this movie was absolutely amazing.  I still think about it every single day since I've seen the movie.   The actors were well chosen and were amazing. The story was just beautifully written.  This is definitely one of the best movies of all times.,10,0,1,2 January 2000
