Come and See," An Exquisite Work of Art
","Nothing compares to the visuals and the direction of this movie.  Even those who do not take interest in World War II will respect the deep meaning and dramatic value of this film.  You leave it with a sense of sorrow and a knowledge of the human condition that you didn't have before.  I felt a bit 'changed.'  More than likely, this movie WILL change you.  Do anything you have to in order to watch it, the new DVD release has spread it all over movie outlets on the Internet, including amazon.com, so there are no more excuses.  It is well worth any price.",10,4,8,14 June 2002
