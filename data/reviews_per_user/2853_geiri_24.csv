The Rock," absolutely splendid action flick!!!!
","This is one of my all time whit none stop action and great actors:Sean Connery (my favorite Bond), Nicolas Cage (Face/Off & Con Air), Ed Harris (The Truman Show,Apollo 13) and also Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Terminator, The Abyss). The plot goes something like this a group of renegade marine commandos seizes a stockpile of chemical weapons and takes over Alcatraz, with 81 tourists as hostages. Their leader, a former highly-decorated U. S. general, demands $100 million to be paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in covert operations and were thereby denied compensation. Otherwise, he is threatening to launch 15 rockets carrying deadly VX nerve gas into the San Francisco Bay area. An elite SEAL team, with support from an FBI chemical warfare expert (Stanley Goodspeed) and a former Alcatraz escapee (John Mason), is assembled to penetrate the terrorists' defenses on Alcatraz and neutralize the rocket threat before time runs out.Michael Bay, the director has done three film and they are all produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and they all ROCK",10,1,1,31 October 1998
The Big Lebowski," A laugh riot!!
","Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a bowler mistaken by a duo of mobsters for Jeff Lebowski, the millionaire. They demand repayment of a loan 'The Dude' knows nothing about. While he tries to explain their mistake, the millionaire's daughter is kidnapped, and the kidnappers send her a severed toe in the mail with a ransom note.From there 'The Dude´s' problems just grow bigger and bigger.It has been a long time since I have seen an actor completely envelop a role such as Jeff Bridges does for The Dude. Steve Buscemi(one of the best actors in the world) is his perfect self in the role of Donny (a nice polar-opposite to his role in 'Fargo.') And John Goodman is great and one of the best character. You just can't stop laughing this is a VERY good movie.:)",Null,1,3,7 November 1998
As Good as It Gets," A comedy from the heart that goes for the throat
","Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in this James L. Brooks hit comedy, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness- along with waitress Carol Connelly- helps put Melvin back in the human race.It's refreshing to see that has faith in the fact that real people in real situations are interesting after all not some empty headed special effects films. Jack Nicholson turns in his best work since Cuckoo's Nest and Helen Hunt is also great.This film is just about as good  as it gets",9,0,0,24 October 1998
The Fifth Element," This one won't fade away
","Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element (played by Milla Jovovich) can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben Dallas (played by Bruce Willis), who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rohd. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary Oldman), who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien Mercenaries. The Fifth Element should be seen by all sci-fi film enthusiasts. It is absolutely loaded with an incredible jumble of eye candy. One amazing spectacle after another leaps onto the screen to thrill us. It is laced with very rich imagery, and demands repeated viewing to take in all the details thanks to great direction by French director Luc Besson. The story is a disaster and I had to watch this film 2 times to appreciate it, and now I love it. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich are superb in their acting and there are only few problems with the film thatare not importent.",8,1,1,13 November 1998
Blade," Above Average
","Wesley Snipes stars as the tortured soul, Blade possessing powers greater than any man or creature of the night. Blade sharpens his lethal skills under the guidance of a professional vampire hunter. When the bloodthirsty Immortals' lord, Deacon Frost, declares war on the human race, Blade is humanity's last hope for survival. It´s a comic/action/horror/thriller/sci-fi movie and it´s captivating, furious and fast. Blade is known as The Daywalker because he can walk in the sunlight but is thirst for blood. Wesley Snipes is excellent as blade and Steven Dorff is OK as the evil Frost bud Kris Kristofferson does not fit in as Abraham Whistler. I did not like Stephen Norrington direction and the blood and gore is enough to fill several movies. The film is a lot like Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn so if you liked it you´ll love this one. I thought is was good and it made a great DVD.",Null,0,1,4 January 1999
L.A. Confidential," No question...brilliant!!!
","Well LA CONFIDENTIAL is a suspense tornado of lies and deceit that revolves around three very different police officer personalities. Officer Bud White is the brutish personality who doesn't feel he is very smart, so he forces the hand of whoever stands in his way. Sgt. Jack Vincennes is all Hollywood. Mr. Showbiz. He doesn't even dress like a police officer. Lastly, there's Sgt. Ed Exley, a clean cut college educated character looking for promotions. Exley understands the politics of police work in Los Angeles. I must say that L.A. Confidential is better than TITANIC(I think it is).If you haven't seen the film, and wonder, is it really that good, the answer is simply YES. This could be the best cop movie ever. Well written, well directed, well acted, and with cinematography and set designs that are simply spectacular.It is quite simply one of the best movies ever made forget Titanic. This is the best picture of the year! BELIEVE ME......",9,1,2,24 October 1998
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," classics comedy
","Stars Robin Williams in the role he was born to play: the irreverent, non-conformist deejay Adrian Cronauer. Imported by the Army for an early a.m. radio show, Cronauer blasts the formerly staid, sanitized airwaves with a constant barrage of rapid-fire humor and the hottest hits from back home.. The GI's love his style but the commanders aren't so thrilled with his comedy. Sidesplitting comic bombshells and studded with hot '60's hits, the film depicts Cronauer's raucous Saigon adventures amid a world gone mad. Williams is brilliant in his portrayal of Adrian as this seems like the part he was meant to play with his quick instincts and non-stop humor. Barry Levinson has done few good films and this is one of them. This is a mix of comedy,drama and war and is a superb entertainment and a classic comedy hit.",Null,1,1,13 November 1998
Armageddon," Underrated Masterpiece
","After a meteorite storm ravages New York City, NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas is speeding toward Earth. With just eighteen days before impact, NASA executive director Dan Truman (BILLY BOB THORNTON) discovers that he has only one viable option -- to drill a hole in the asteroid and then plant and detonate a nuclear bomb hoping that the internal explosion will split the rock into two pieces that will miss Earth. Thus, Truman enlists Harry Stamper (BRUCE WILLIS) and his deep core oil drilling team, known to be the best in the world. Harry's got other problems, however -- most notably trying to keep one of his gung ho workers, A.J. Frost (BEN AFFLECK) ,away from his beautiful adult daughter, Grace (LIV TYLER). Even so, Harry realizes he has to go and save the world and agrees to do what he can. Thus, he and team -- which includes Frost; his best friend, Chick Chapple (WILL PATTON); a squirrelly geologist, Rockhound (STEVE BUSCEMI); big man Max Lennert (KEN CAMPBELL); and an odd assortment of other characters train for their dangerous mission.Blasting off into space aboard two space shuttles, Harry and his team are accompanied by NASA astronauts Colonel Willie Sharp (WILLIAM FICHTNER), co-pilot Jennifer Watts (JESSICA STEEN), and mission specialist Gruber (GRAYSON McCOUCH). There they dock with a Russian space station where cosmonaut Lev Andropov (PETER STORMARE) joins them after a calamitous accident. From that point on, the assembled team races toward the asteroid. Encountering various obstacles and bureaucratic blunders back on Earth, Harry and his team race against time to drill eight hundred feet into the rock, plant the nuke, and blast off before the asteroid plummets into the Earth, completely destroying it in a fiery Armageddon. This is a great film and one of the best that came out this summer with a great mix off action,comedy and drama and much more entertaining than DEEP IMPACT and if you like Michal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer then you will not be disappointed. Well if I´m only gonna say this once THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE.....",10,1,2,3 November 1998

Face_Off," The best action film in a long time..
","In this great John Woo action,adventure FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (Travolta) tries to find a biological weapon placed in Los Angeles by a sadistic terrorist-for-hire and criminal mastermind named Castor Troy (Cage). Archer has hunted Troy for the last 8 years, and is consumed by revenge because Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son. To do this, Archer must 'borrow' Troy's face using a surgical procedure to go undercover as Troy, but things go wrong when Troy assumes the identity of Archer.This is great, big fun from the beginning to end. For fans of John Woo, Face/Off is everything you could want from the legendary action director. Great stunts,explosive action, rapid fire gunplay and some drama.This is the best action movie of 1997 and Travolta & Cage give amazing performances in this must see action film",9,2,3,29 October 1998
Dark City," A Visual Triumph And a Profound, Exciting Look at a Nightmarish World...
","When John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a strange hotel room, he finds that he is wanted for a series of brutal murders. The problem is he can't remember a thing. Pursued by a police detective (William Hurt) and haunted by a group of mysterious people called The Strangers. The Strangers, mysterious beings who possess the ability to stop time and alter reality, he seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity. But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth could be fatal.Dark City is directed by the brilliant and creative Alex Proyas who deserved the credit given him. In Dark City, Proyas surrounds himself with a number of creative thoughts and excellent sets and surroundings. This film belongs in the collection of every science fiction lover - the film is truly out of this world in so many ways. The actors are all great and I really like Kiefer Sutherland as the mad-scientist type. This is a sci/fi cult classic. Thad had little to do with the film's story and the performances by the lead actors, but much to do with its visual effects, cinematography and slam bang editing. This is a treat which you should not miss.",Null,1,2,20 February 1999
The Usual Suspects," Pure Genius
","The most hardened criminals in the world fear no one... except Keyser Soze. When 27 dead bodies are found in Long Beach Harbor with only one dying witness that utters the name Keyser Soze, the U.S. Customs Agent Daniel Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) has got to find the dreaded killer, but only one guy has the clues Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). A small-time crook, Verbal tells Kujan an incredible story of the job of their lives with and Keyser Soze at their backs. But somehow their job of a lifetime did not turn out as they expected and soon the five men, Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Kint himself have to ask themselves: Who is Keyser Soze?The plot and characters in the film are priceless. The amount of great actors in this movie is astounding, not to mention a great story with a surprising and impossible to guess ending. Kevin Spacey is the best of the bunch and flawless in his role as Verbal Kint and the extras are are also great. The movie continually startles with originality and dynamic sequences and make this a thrilling film. Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (Both men worked on Public Access, winner of the 1993 Grand Jury Prize at Sundance) team up well with cinematographer Howard Cummings to create a brilliant and timeless crime story that should eventually be considered a classic of the genre.",Null,0,1,17 February 1999
The Game," Impressive movie
","Nicholas Van Orton, a successful businessman lives a good life until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother destroys it all. Nicholas has been enrolled in a game - 'a profound life experience' that begins quietly but soon erupts in a rush of devastating events. Van Orton has to win this deadly game or lose control of everything in his life. And this time money and power are meaningless. This is a suspense/thriller, that does manage to hold one's attention. The film stars Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Deborah Kara Unger (David Cronenberg's 'Crash') turns in a fine supporting roll as well. Davd Fincher, director of Seven and Aliens 3, continues to set high standards for motion picture making. This lastest entree of Fincher's does not lose a beat in delivering the maximum impact of the story. This movie will get into your head. It will keep you guessing the whole time.

Event Horizon," ItÂ´s the Shining in space
","It's the year 2047 and the 'Event Horizon,' a ship designed to bend the space time continuum, has been found after being lost for seven years. A rescue ship, the 'Lewis & Clark,' helmed by Captain Joe Miller(Laurence Fishburne) and his elite crew and the lost ship's designer (Sam Neill). Their mission: find and salvage the state-of-the-art spacecraft. What they find is state-of-the-art interstellar terror. What they must salvage are their own lives, because someone or something is ready to ensnare them in a new dimension of unimaginable fear. This is a scary psychological thriller and one of the few Sci-Fi movies in the last 10 years to actually almost live up to its hopes. For those of you who think that 'Scream' and other recent horror films are frightening, take my word for it, go see this movie and see what scary really is. Masterfully balancing sci-fi, horror and action, 'Event Horizon' is a superbly made film that feels just like a thrilling amusement park ride. With as many jump scenes as a roller coaster has hills, this film elicits the same visceral response.The film also boasts a great cast with Neill delivering a fine, increasingly deranged role and Fishburne making up for his last action role in the 'OK' film Fled here, he strongly commands the screen and proves to be a superb action figure. Although some plot elements are never fully explored such as what's behind the 'evil' control, and what the deeper back stories are for the characters personal visions/encounters the mystery of these elements only adds to the film's overall uneasy atmosphere. While this is an extremely thrilling, scary film, it's also extremely bloody and hard to watch at some times but that only makes it a better horror film and the best scifi/horror mix for about ten to fifteen years.",7,0,1,2 February 1999

","Every summer thousands of visitors go to a small beach-side town of Amity to get some rest and relaxation in the sun and sand. But one summer, the summer of '75 a new visitor comes to the bech an enormous man-eating great white shark. Brody (ROY SCHEIDER) a former big city cop and now the local sheriff, finds the remains of a college girl and orders the beaches closed. Mayor Vaughan (MURRAY HAMILTON) and other city officials, however, rescind that order for fear of what it will do to the town's tourism. Brody and his wife Ellen (LORRAINE GARY) don't think that was the right thing to do and worry about the safety of their two boys. After several more people are killed by the shark, though, Brody closes the beaches and brings in Hooper (RICHARD DREYFUSS), an oceanographic expert, to help find the shark. In the end, however, they need Quint (ROBERT SHAW), the local, grizzled 'old man of the sea' to hunt down and kill the shark. The three men then head out into open waters and bait, and wait, for their encounter with the dangerous shark. One of the great box-office hits of all time is also one of the best horror films in the last few decades. Spielberg's classic shark story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, kept millions out of the water during the summer of '75. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the great Robert Shaw go shark hunting off the New England coast and find Melvillian adventure. A classic combination of suspense, effects, editing, cinematography, score and bristling characterizations. The movie that was supposed to be 1975's biggest flop, but instead it has become a classic thriller.
