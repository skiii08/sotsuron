Marie Antoinette," Antoinette as seen through Axel Fersen's eyes maybe?
","Everyone either loves it or hates it, and I for one, love it! I believe that Kirsten Dunst is pure magic! This is a movie seen through the eyes of someone who really loves Marie Antoinette, not a detractor. And it should be seen and viewed as such. Since it is narrated by her mother, it may be that she is seen as her mother wished her to be seen.For sure, it is not about a historical event, but rather is a character study. It is like eating cotton candy at the fair! It is all sweetness and light. Nothing of the starving masses...who knows of them anyway as they are just something to do for charity as has been taught so long by the nuns and priests of the church, but in reality, out of sight, out of mind.I love this movie for that reason. It is a study in the Ch√¢teau Du Versailles and its occupants who bring it to life. Sofia did a great job in giving a glimpse of Antoinette as she appears to those who love and cherish her.I recommend it highly...it is fun, charming, sweet, and magical! Beautifully photographed and made my day!",7,1,3,24 October 2006
