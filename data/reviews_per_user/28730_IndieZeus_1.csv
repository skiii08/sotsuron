The Blair Witch Project," Start of an era
","In the late 90's 'The Blair Witch Project' kickstarted the 'found footage' sub genre.Although a brilliant concept I felt the film itself never really lived up to the hype but to be fair, there was so much hype at the time that would have been almost impossible.For movies buffs though it's a really interesting look at the film that brought 'found footage' into the mainstream and will forever have a place in cinematic history.",6,1,1,2 June 2020
