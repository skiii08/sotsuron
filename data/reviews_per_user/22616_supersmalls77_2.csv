The Incredible Hulk," One word, INCREDIBLE
","I just viewed the midnight release of The Incredible Hulk. I was not expecting much after the 2003 version of the Hulk, but what I got was way more than I expected and then some. Edward Norton turns in yet another brilliant performance, and has a pretty decent supporting cast surrounding him. The plot is much better portrayed than in any other Hulk I have seen, showing the Hulk's struggle to fight to find a cure for his gamma radiation. With a good love story in the mix, and action throughout(especially the 26 minute fight scene in the end), the Hulk is sure to keep you on the edge of your seats! I strongly recommend this movie to all the superhero fans out there, and even those who have no interest because I believe it attracts all audiences, old or young, white or black, etc. I hope you found this comment useful.

The Dark Knight," Best AcTion Movie in A loNg time! (look at caps)
","Just saw the midnight release of The Dark Knight and I must say I was more excited to see this movie than any other movie I have ever seen in theaters. Expecting a masterpiece in a comic book movie is crazy, I know, but a masterpiece is exactly what I got.First off, let me just say that the acting was PHENOMENAL! Christian Bale delivers another solid performance as Batman, and we can now comfortably say that he is by far the best actor to ever play the role. At first I was upset Katie Holmes did not come back for this movie but Maggie Gyllenhall does a fine job as Rachel. Caine, Oldman, and Freeman all do a great job as role characters, as they did in the first but the best acting was by two of the new guys.Aaron Eckhart as Two Face makes Tommy Lee Jones a figment of our imagination as he blows his performance out of the water. But the real story of the night was Heath Ledger as The Joker. Sad to see him go, I am glad that he will be remembered not as a cowboy, but as The Joker. Every scene that he was in gave me the chills, as he perfectly portrayed the psychopathic ways of The Joker and really helped you understand why he does the things he does. If he does not win an Oscar for his performance it will be a major disappointment.Last on the list is the Director. Christopher Nolan(Batman Begins, The Prestige), yet again makes a brilliant movie. This movie though, is by far his best, and hopefully, he winds up with an Oscar for it. The only movie I know of that may compete is the new 007 movie, but I personally don't even think it will come close as this movie, like a said before, is truly a MASTERPIECE. Well worth the ridiculous $10 dollars I had to spend to see it and I recommend it to all audiences. 10 out of 10 stars!",10,6,13,18 July 2008
