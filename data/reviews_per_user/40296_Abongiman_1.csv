Saturday Night Fever," Its not cool, its not bad, it's just a 70's movie
","When I was 16 in the 1970's we had a choice. You were either a punk or a seventies disco dancer!!! So I didn't go and see Saturday Night Fever. Fifteen years later I recorded it and I have watched it half a dozen times since. Its not a great movie, but it is a great reflection  of  New york in the Seventies. It could have been directed by any of the  great directors of the time, (Scorcese, De Palma etc)but it is Travolta that makes the movie. The music is fantastic, and althought the story is pretty pedestrian, it is entertaining in a a 70's New York kind of way. it's not great in any intellectual kind of way way but it works, and you're pulled in by the characters in the movie. In a purely movie kind of way, its not great, but as a movie that reflects the time & the place watch it coz it works.I would place it in my top 20 movies of all time. purely because I lived through it, and its good to watch. 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,9 September 2000
