Walk the Line," Magic
","Magic is symbolic of fascination, captivation, charm, enchantment, entrancement, etc.... Houdini could not have faired better.Choose from the above multiple choices to describe your feelings: WALK THE LINE-All of the AboveLet's see..., how many times have I watched it thus far? Wait a minute -- hold on, please, -- I'm still counting...7,8,9,...***Caution*** OVERINDULGENCE IN THIS MOVIE WILL HAVE YOU WHISTLING AS YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET. (My apologizes to my neighbors in the grocery store.)I read the first review and really did not think I could add anything to their well-defined, spectacular comments. But wait... then I realized my error and knowing how I love a good laugh, I thought I would inter-dispose a wee bit of mine. CHEERS!...10, 11, 12, 13, ...as I walk down the street whistling....",10,1,2,18 November 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Hollywood! Get with it...
","Don't kill off the most powerful MEN, however, the most powerful WOMEN are still expendable. Thanks for the redress yet again.Women, do not forget your place! Isn't it time to endeavor beyond the comfortable realm of gender bias? Jean should NOT have been killed off. Even Xavier makes his comeback...(after the credits, guys.) I have never been more disappointed in a movies premise. I concede, however, that Wolverine still delivers megagoosebumps.Moreover, it 'ain't over 'till the fat lady sings'... and I heard nada during the credits. Hollywood, take a chance, make amends for a long overdue due. (not a typo)",5,0,1,28 May 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Bring some Kleenex
","I walked in with high expectations, although I am not a boxing fan, but it didn't matter....the story is eloquently told and masterfully depicted. Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and last but certainly not least...Hillary Swank. I felt like I was ringside; hearing, feeling and impacting each element of the story. It was an education in itself at how moving cinema can be and how much trust it takes to immerse oneself and walk out totally satisfied that movies are still worth the money. Speaking and relaying thoughts without words is incredibly and masterfully done here. And for the viewer, this technique in cinema enables us to be drawn into the action, not just a spectator! THANK YOU - - to everyone involved in this heart crushing but worthy story.",10,4,8,21 February 2005
