The Avengers," A great beginning to the blockbuster season!
","I came into the fanboyhood of Joss Whedon late in my life, realizing I was a fan of his productions unknowingly. I didn't put him and Avengers together until recently, but after that I was rather in anticipation of it since. Very much filmed with the same eye for sci-fi as Firefly, the continuity of the film had a warmth and familiarity to it that was easy to accept.First off, it is a fantastic start to the summer blockbuster movies. With films like Prometheus and Batteship also on the horizon I will be probably more critical of what is to come as opposed to what just set the bar. With a legion of special effects people and filmed for 3D, I believe I did an injustice seeing it in a theater that was doing 2D: Some of the shots just did not come out the way I think it would have if viewed behind the glasses (I saw it in 2D because I am not a huge fan of 3D and all the hype). Technically, it was directed and filmed for 3D, and doing a backward compatibility might not have been the best. However, I do believe that when released as a BluRay disk, most people would not be able to watch it. The production crew may need to tweak it a bit before then.Secondly, a master hand was at the helm shifting the weight of the film skillfully between CGI, Action, Drama and comic relief. Every artist has the right to interpret a story the way they see it. Based on characters the movie-going public have already been introduced to I'm sure helped, but for many, only Iron Man has had the most press. Hulk seems to have failed; Captain America did well at the box office but was oddly out of place; Thor wasn't as well received and his future as well wasn't a forgone conclusion. Natasha, Hawkeye, Nick Fury: If you didn't really read the comics you just wouldn't have guessed at their place in a movie with so many super-ego's in it. Somehow, Joss managed to extrapolate these vague characters and put them into a solid mix that did not always get along to at the gitgo.The story is strong with continuity and weaves a strong relationship between the superhero's without haste. With a strong beginning, the plot is revealed very early but then dwells not so much on the story but the intermixing of the characters to form what the comic book is about: The alliance of superheros as a team called The Avengers. Ever been in a band where all the musicians compete for the spotlight but end up just increasing the gain of their amps? It is not an easy lesson to learn but it was obvious that Iron Man was the primary focus. Meetings, indifference, competition and cooperation, very hard lessons to learn when the world as we know it is at stake but they manage to put aside their egos for the common good and the saving of Manhattan.Damn, why is it New York City is always the focus of monstrous plots? Guess I better not go there.Navigating the story, there were many points where homage was paid to movies that preceded it. Obvious was Independence day, Ghostbusters, Avatar and the likes. You had a mix of Asian, northern euro and American curltures which made for a multifaceted presentation. I had a few problems with future-world design, like the water/air ship which staged the initial disharmony of the superheros. I will also reiterate my comment about 2D and 3D screen presentation.Alan Sylvestri does a stunning soundtrack, which didn't have the usual signature of the initial measure pop as in preceding films. It was appropriate though a solid theme was lacking... or maybe I just could not get a theme figured out while viewing all the action.One of my biggest surprises was the re-write of Bruce Banner/Hulk. Totally unconventional, the taught character of the gamma-altered human was harsh, intellectual and sometimes more unemotional than his counterpart Hulk, who really stood out as a serious contender for a relaunch or maybe a new franchise if Jeremy Renner is open to it. The super-hero team accepted him and knew how to kindle the huge green giant's passion and formed an amazing bond with his peers. I would love to see a new Hulk movie with this reworked character.Joss has weaved together an amazing story with very few holes, and maybe I will see it again, but this time in 3D just to see if my observation of the 2D version is correct. Go see it. Great action, great compassion, great story. Thanks Joss.",9,1,4,4 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Much better than expected.
","I was watching various site ratings on this film since the beginning of the week wondering how it would be received by the critical movie base, and was surprised when it jumped from 40 to 140 reviews that were positive. I did not read them, but it did change my mind about going to see it, and I must admit it certainly helped the franchise dig out of the rut it was in when MIB 2 came out. What a flop that was! That one is NOT in my movie collection.I have to preface this with the usual movie experience. I have stated previously that I am not a huge fan of 3D... most of them remind me of those halo-postcards and knee deep in lackluster. So I bought tickets to the 2D showing. Entering the theater, the sound was that of previews but there was nothing on the screen. Sat down and munched some popcorn and waited. Every now and then there was a flash of light but eventually, one by one, people left the audience to complain. I would normally do this, but seeing the amount of people who left I felt my complaint would have been useless. At last I heard someone down the hall say 'The projector has a burnt out bulb and will take about 10 minutes to replace. For those that would like not to wait, we will let you into the viewing of the 3D showing and give you all the glasses at no charge'. Looks like I would be seeing this in 3D anyways, and as I suspected... putting on the glasses really made things less clear and darker.To start off, there was a real familiarity for the movie. It was all comfortable. Characters we knew; aliens we were familiar with; even the look and feel of the camera and music was all Men In Black (which Bill Pope, from Matrix trilogy, Spiderman fame, Steven Spielberg and Danny Elfman from the original movie), the story started out with new character development that made this sequel at home. Yes, the characters have aged... almost to the point where you want to say 'ENOUGH! PLEASE RETIRE OR DO SOMETHING MORE YOUR AGE'. It is OK though, the movie was crafted around the character ages... cept maybe Will Smith needs to move on from action films. The movie makes it plain that it was already many years since their last screen presentation. It is believable in the fiction it is portrayed in. The wit was there. The characters where there. And the plot was there, so lets continue with the fun.Yes, K and J have gone on in their years. Yes, they keep aliens in their place but it is obvious that there is (as with all convicted criminals, galactic or native) some criminals can not just let things go by without payback. If I say 'time travel', I would be giving away a lot, but we have seen time travel before and it is not new. Star Trek, Time Machine, yadda yadda have all played with this and most times messing around with timelines and parallel dimensions is never a safe thing unless you have really nothing to loose. Right? I mean, what does a criminal have to loose that will never have parole? Specially if that alien lives for enormous lifespans? It gets messy, needless to say, and life as we know it once again becomes a key pin the the events that follow in this movie.Josh Brolin play a young Kay, and he sure did a good study on Tommy Lee's character even down to the inflections of the voice. It was entertaining. Young Kay was more human, sociable and open than his elder counterpart. What happens to make the older Kay and the younger Kay is really what this movie is about. I didn't find the FX all that new. Actually, I felt the 3D portage was lacking and not necessary. I wish I could have seen it in 2D to be honest. With all the banter, action and blocking, this sequel plays more along its original roots as the first movie than the second, plus you will be smiling when you come to the ending scenes. It makes all the difference in the world.I'm glad there were no kids in the audience, but it is tamer than most scifi flicks. You really should plan this viewing as an adult tho, it leaves you free to enjoy it as it should. B",9,5,13,25 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Has it's points, but...
","I have to admit, I really don't know why I went to this. In a venue saturated with CGI and somewhat crappy scripts and story lines, this installment over what was released just 5 years ago seems somewhat nonsensical. On top of that, Louis Leterrier has only directed only 2 films in his carer: Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and The Transporter II. Granted, both films merit a smile and a nod for actually being quite good films, however to hand over $150+ (which is incredible seeing at least almost 1/2 the film is done in CGI) seems also a little nonsensical in this case. It just seems to me that these movies are quickly becoming ordinary and harder to watch unless there are some great innovations in them, or at least a solid story line and a good ending.I like Ed Norton in this role though. At times you could see some striking resemblances to Bill Bixby at moments, and his mannerisms are more in tune with the original Bruce Banner character. I'll state right here that I am not going to do cross platform comparisons with all the various Hulk remakes and episodes, sorry. Liv Tyler seems a bit sappy in her role. I think she gets picked because she knows how to squirt those tears when needed, and on demand, and I didn't know what to make of William Hurt as her estranged father. Try as he might, I just can't see him in a 'tough guy' situation.The CGI is probably what takes this movie into a more plausible realm. In the beginning, you meet Bruce banner, and there is a counter for the important scene changes that tell you how long it's been since his last 'episode'. The director brings in Hulk fairly early, but they leave him in shadows for the most part, only delivering the objects of his rampaging to the audience. This movie really has no start or finish, it is more like we are dropped in as observers into a struggle that aspires to be normal but seems to be a futile objective, and when we finally get Hulk so steamed up to yell the famous 'HULK SMASH', it comes across climactic, but lacks that which should be sending electricity through your body.And that, for me about sums it up: It just didn't give me a charge. It was OK to watch, actually it was much better than the 2003 remake, but as far as being up there with this year Iron Man *cough* (could be the closest thing to a spoiler I can get to) *cough*, but probably by far not the worst movie we will see this year. The audience was quiet throughout the viewing, which also supports my lack of charge contention. Let us hope that they don't remake this one for at least another 20 years. Maybe by then we will go HOLO!",7,4,7,17 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Tom is Ethan
","Things went good. Things went bad. Things went good. Things went bad. Good Bad Good bad good bad goo....There was a lot to like with this movie, there was action, there were villains, there were surprises, there were bombs and explosions and lots of gunfire. The blocking was well paced. There was romance, there was friendships and exotic locations. All the things were there for a great action film, and then some. You do have to somehow get past one thing: Tom Cruise. Once you get past the bias, and a few moment when Tom gets almost pathetically weepy at times, you can enjoy it. Tom is the MIF franchise owner it seems. Make no mistake about it, it's about Tom and his faithful character Ethan Hunt. Yes you have a fabulous villain played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a nefarious supplier of some of the most lethal weapons known to man to anyone who will meet his price. He doesn't like to be screwed with. But you know inevitably it does, and bad things happen. Many reviews have said it better than I have, but I fully agree with the aggregate masses: Don't look for anything deep in this - It's strictly action. You may see some subtle parallels with some scenes, like the statement that if you destroy one bad person, three or more are willing to take that place and your problems grow, but the style, the filming and yes, the acting when all put together make for a pretty damn good Disney Theme park ride. Find a theater that sells good popcorn and beer, I'm sure you won't regret it.",8,0,1,9 May 2006
Source Code," Just when you think you know ...
","Little twist in this movie make you change your mind how it is going to end. Slow to draw you in and almost uninvolving even if you know this is scifie give you ample 'Ah hah!' moments, then put you back in that unsure mode. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter Stevens, an army helicopter pilot that finds himself flashed into the life of some other man riding a Chicago rail. He comes to facing a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him enough to form what could become an intimate relationship. The panic of the first instance is monumental; he was in a rescue mission one minute then on a train with a crowd of people he has no connection to at all. The only problem he confronts though is that 8 minutes later the train explodes. From there is sheerly up to speculation. Personally, I believe that every decision you make changes the future. The creates parallel realities that could exist for any given instance. On this concept alone, this movie creates one alternate reality after another hence my comment on the 'Ah hah' moments; they are quickly challenged. Even at the end you conclude it is over then it doesn't end. This is the way it is with alternate or parallel realities. It is never over, only different. Pleasing, suspenseful, oddly engaging, totally unbelievable you follow this near 2 hour romp into the Twilight Zone with surprise that makes it all worth the price of a ticket and maybe a copy of it for your own home. Granted, once you know the ending a re-watch just won't be a satisfying, but it is exceptionally well directed and produced. Recommended.",9,1,8,1 April 2011
United 93," An emotional experience
","Trying not to give out spoilers for this is hard, seeing that if there isn't one person in America that doesn't know at least 60% of the events that happened that day you must have been either drunk or stoned.You know the inevitable fate of the people on flight 93.They crash and die.But the story must be told. There is no time right or wrong because it is timeless.Have you ever sat down and listened to Ravels symphony Bolero? It starts out with only a whisper of a snare tapping and some cello's laying the foundation by giving you a structured baseline and a key we would call major. At first, there is nothing but base and snare. Then a flute floats through the air with the beginning of the melody. It modulates and takes you into a minor key. Slowly Bolero builds, adding other instruments as it goes along. Each instrument then joins the background as others take the melody. They become harmonies. Then they get loud. By the end, you don't remember so much how it starts, but you are startled when the final crescendo is played and all is quiet again.At that point you are allowed to breath. Slowly your emotions become your own. Most of us know how everything ended, but how this thing built up inside the few hours that it did makes you stop breathing; stop thinking; stop responding until the crescendo is over.The theater was void of sound. Not even the people sitting next to me were breathing. Just enough time goes by to remind you that you need to breathe. Some comments are displayed on the screen. I didn't hear the person next to me breath, but I heard the first tear well up in his eye and a brief rustling of cotton from a sleeve in motion. The person on my left slowly expelled a breath, then choked back a sob. The lights came up, and people started moving. Quietly: As if in a wake.If this film set out to honor the dead, it did so in one of the most deftly defined presentation I have yet to re-experience. I felt no political agenda. I felt numb. A numbness that continued till I was half way home, then I too fell apart.",10,9,20,28 April 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable.
","This was a delightful film. The deep rich color, the contrast, most of the caricature development and voices seem to come together to make a wonderful experience. The story follows the dream of a fat panda and his desire to be trained in the ways of Kung Fu. Laced with a serious overtone, the comedy is on a more mature level, but a level that even a young child can follow and enjoy. Paced well, the movie starts off as well as it ends. A bit predictable once you know all the components in the character constellation, even the anticipation lends its self to the experience.I have to admit, the most enjoyable and laughable scene to this movie revolves around Po (The panda, voiced by a Jack Black) and what is discovered to motivate him to learn the teachings of his master Shifu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu has been left with the task to train Po to become the ultimate warrior, much to the chagrin of his other disciples: A tigress, a snake, a praying mantis, a monkey and a crane, who have studied for years to become the level of Dragon master. Unfortunately, there is also another beast, a previous student of Shifu, that also believes that level belongs to him. In the end, dark forces against that of light must meet.One thing I always find disconcerting is that why, out of all the people in the world, do movies like this need to generate any interest from already famous actors? There is so much talent out there, I would think leaving live acting to live actors. Or how about a radio announcer? Or a person that does audio books? I have a hard time believing that this movie couldn't have used an unknown to be a primary voice and still kill at the box office. Just my opinion.The theater was sparsely populated. I think my wife and I were the only ones there that didn't have young children. The lack of an audience allows for a more pungent viewing, one that isn't caught up in a wave of laughter that usually infects a viewer at a well attended presentation. One very young child tried very hard to understand what was going on through most of the film in a rather loud voice, but this was acceptable. I don't think a child of 3 can truly enjoy this, even as a cartoon. So, as a summer surprise, seeing this was not on my list of movies to see, I was pleasantly surprised.

Gravity," Space is cold, both physically and emotionally.
","To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour. William Blake These words came to mind after my experience with this movie event called Gravity. I've read the spoilers; I read the stories on the making of the film and how in its conception it was not technically possible to achieve; I counted the positive and negative reviews and always came back to my question 'How is it this film only recently came to my attention?'. I followed all the news as Jackson tried to keep the filming of his Lord of the Rings trilogy private with great attention. I knew the stories from numerous readings throughout my life and how blown away I was upon my first viewing of Jackson's interpretations (which unfortunately that excitement didn't spill over with the over-bloated Hobbit installments). Gravity offered just single word that ultimately captures both the scope and plot of the movie so perfectly, it would be hard to make it any simpler or complex.The father and son teaming seems very successful in the sculpting of this story. I became aware of Alfonse during the Harry Potter days. Indeed, The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite piece of the franchise. Then he released the gritty 'Children of Men' with his epic 7+ minute single shot exodus scene twords the end of the film. For me, sitting under water for 7 minutes would seem impossible, but I don't think I dared breath as the fighting raged on during that ending segment. I have also rarely (if ever) seen a movie where the cast of on-screen actors was limited to two for the duration of the film, with only voices being a part of the credit list.As suggested before, this is not so much a plot driven movie as it is a personal account of a chain of events set in an ominously empty environment. You sit in a theater. The lights go out and suddenly you are projected into space. You sit like an astronaut in your seat but instead of a suit and helmet, you are holding your popcorn and observing the focus through a pair of special glasses (we were given the wrong ones). You are immersed in the dark. Action picks up fairly quickly, and as any good story that is based on the laws of Murphy you get bumped around from one catastrophe to another. I found myself actually flinching behind the 3D glasses as shrapnel gets thrown at you from the various wreckages and once again I found myself not breathing. Going into this knowing the length is only 90 minutes long, you are open to all sorts of parallel time lines. At the end, which leaves you back in something more familiar, you take a deep breath of satisfaction and know things are going to be 'All right'. My only comment that could be considered somewhat negative was once the right 3D glasses were obtained, my first impression was 'This is kinda like looking through a ViewMaster'.With enough twist and turns, a solid beginning and a solid end and incredibly produced you wonder how other films that lay in the quagmire of mediocrity stand a chance to even make it to the big screen. Then again you realize that some directors have incredible talent and vision. I read somewhere that James Cameron was involved in the initial development and said it was impossible to do simply because the technology was unavailable. I am happy to say this did not deter Alfonse Cuarón. His vision became an extraordinary reality.I rarely go to an IMAX simply because I'm a cheapskate but I don't regret going to see this one bit. Confining this to a 60' diagonal high definition screen could not possibly give you the scope and 'gravity' of this movie. See it big. See it 3D if you can handle it. See it. -B",10,4,8,8 October 2013
Star Trek," Grinning the whole time
","When I first heard they were going to do yet ANOTHER Star Trek movie, I groaned in pain. I like Star Trek, but I'm not a fanboy. Actually, my action figure collection is varied... from a Sigmund Freud, Muppet character to Mr. Incredible (Thanks to my family). However I did start musing over the idea, wondering if Archer would be in the Captains chair this time or would they resurrect Jean Luc Picard or James T. Kirk; then the rumors started surfacing about a prequel surrounding Starfleet Academy. OK, Kirk.But instead of getting let down and annoyed, short teasers started appeared online and my curiosity was prodded. An odd cast was selected that didn't quite strike me as trekkish until cast pictures in full makeup were available. The teaser clips began to reveal more character development, and action. Good. They looked good. Action is good. Familiarity is good. I began to get more interested. SPOILER: The plot involved time travel and vengeance with some very high-tech sequences and stunts. The Romulan world is destroyed and one Romulan blames a member of the crew of the Enterprise and wants all of the Federation to suffer his loss.That's a pretty tall order, but then again if you have a really big ship (a converted Romulan mining vessel) with some really evil weapons onboard, this no longer is just a fanboy movie, but the making of a good summer blockbuster... and it's going to be a hard one to beat (until Half Blood Prince takes its place). This movie takes its time but it's not slow. The friendships and bonds follow a surprising wayward path yet you know how they end up, the development between Kirk, Bones and Spock being a primary focus. It is amazing how well they honor the original roles and maintain the banter and playfulness of the original series. This release may well allow the franchise to live longer and prosper.I was grinning the entire movie... that's how it affected me. Even though flawed, it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had since Jackson release his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yes I said flawed. Every movie has them in my opinion whether it is there as comic relief or totally wrong twist in the plot. Without spoiling it, I felt the placement of introduction to certain key people weren't as intelligently thought out, some lines dealing with time travel were crossed, some weapons were a little too ill conceived if for a scifi future-world as well as many small incongruous details that just may be too trivial to mention here. As a total package though, it works, and delightfully well I might add. As I said, I was grinning the whole time.I plan to see this again on the big screen which has only happened in a few instances. To truly revive the nearly dead Trek enterprise they will need to continue with this crew and give them something 'trekish' to pursue. I don't think I could take another TV spin off, but an occasional trip to a theater to see what the crew of the Enterprise are up to wouldn't be totally out of the question.",9,0,7,14 May 2009
Iron Man 2," How much cheaper it could have been without the first 90 minutes
","The surprising thing about the initial movie release of Iron Man was that not only was there action, but thought and intrigue. There was almost something in the movie for everyone simply because wading through the scenes you didn't find interesting were blocked well and didn't run on and get you impatient. Not so with this new entry. I was hoping that it would have gone more the way Spider Man II went: More plot for morons, more build to romance, enough head on action to appease the geek. This for me did not happen. Now granted, I don't claim to be an expert in movies. I don't know the intimate histories of all the stars and starlets out there, or the screen writers, nor the directors or producers much more than the average Joe but I'm not all that willing to accept less than what was offered in a preceding film. Even though the same constellation was involved with this production it just didn't quite do it for me. I was disappointed. Here's why: The first 90 minutes of this film were vague and uninvolved. You may argue the fact, but to this reviewer it seemed that the entire movie was during the last 30 minutes when good versus evil clashed in a way we hope it would. I have seen it twice, and the second viewing confirmed what I couldn't pinpoint in my first watch: The movie was boring for the most part. Nick Fury was a 'meh' (though Jackson still is just right for this part); Scarlett at her best was image happy. The whole sequence with her kicking her way through the Hammer corporation I couldn't decide was her stand in, or CGI, or just the actress. I saw this in a DLP theater and the way her hair flew around the screen just didn't look justifiable (even though the leather suit did justice to her makeover); Pepper seemed almost borderline personality disorder - mood-swings were almost menopausal. Even the Iron Man seemed a little over the top even at his worst. The one thing that was almost perfect was Rourke's portrayal of Ivan. He is the perfect ugly bad guy as we have come to expect since his role in Sin City. For the most part to me, the whole thing seemed like it was over acted. Hence, when action commenced, it all seemed to fall in place. Still, there are redeeming graces that occur. The filming and coloration are up to par, the enhanced Iron Man effects appreciated. Thanks to CGI, it was still a great theater experience. I don't know how it will fare on DVD. I think over the coming weeks, the viewing of this movie will drop significantly from opening day, just the opposite of 'How To Train Your Dragon', which is doing really well still. It's not that this movie was a total waste, it is just expectations were not met in this reviewers opinion. Sorry guys.",6,1,4,12 May 2010
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Reds BACK.
","I liked the original Hellboy, which is odd because I only heard about it after it had been ported to DVD. Wishing I could have seen it on the big screen there was little option when I got wind that Del Toro was fashioning a second movie after the red devil with the rock fist. I also liked Pan's Labyrinth, which was released shortly after another favorite of mine was in the theater, Mirrormask. Both dealing with depth of fantasy that were rich and dark, some of this feeling spilled over into the latest Hellboy movie. Del Toro brought much of the feel of Pan's Labyrinth into this movie. As in many movies of today, plot development is simple and age old: Good against Evil. Someone always wants to take over the world for some personal or obscure reason. Given that, the movie has a solid script and some interesting but not all unforeseen surprises. I have to admit, one sequence involving a locker of beer, a Barry Manilow tune and a heightened sense of warm fuzzies had me in stitches. The down side of that was that the Barry Manilow song was retained in my head for DAYS after. The reality of the creatures, the ferocity of the Elves, the constant bombardment of battles and day to day issues just make this movie a great summer popcorn flick, and even worth the price of an evening theater viewing. As a side note, seeing Del Toro will be manning the helm of the next addition of Tolkien movies, I will be watching the boards on the progress he and Jackson do with The Hobbit with great interest.",8,0,1,22 July 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Getting to the end was a bit tedious
","I was transported back to the early sixties during the opening credits to this film. The big band sound saturated you with that Rat Pack sensation where you almost expect Sinatra, Dean and Davis Jr. to walk out into the theater and serenade you with some new material. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen, and if I had a copy of this movie, I would have to play it a second time just to be able to play along with the new establishment of the Rat Pack. I have to interject a side story that seems to have paralleled the filming of this movie, so bear with me because I think it probably helped to guide this movie and probably saved it from some film making pitfalls: The new Rat Pack consist of primarily George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon with charter memberships with Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Bernie Mac (who recently announced his retirement from film - we'll see if that's true eventually). The reports say that during the shooting of the entire filming, they had one huge high steaks poker game going on that the entry fee started at $50,000. Sometimes I wonder if their heads were in the movie or the game. There were more than just the Rat Pack in play here, and most of the cast had it's opportunity to cash in on the game. I guess my problem with this movie was the cohesiveness of the script. Sometimes it just had the Valley Girl mentality to it: 'And then he went:'Whoa', and then the other dude said: '.. but then this guy said this, and everything feel apart', and then the first guy said: 'DUDE! He should have talked to me first' and then.... The timing sequences were OK save the somewhat arbitrary plot tanglers that almost plagued this story like clockwork. BUT!!! The ending is always so much fun, and the final insults of retribution so well planned that you just can't help enjoy yourself to the point where the film almost redeems its self. As usually, it seems that Clooneys' Ocean has ever been calculating all possible angles to this objective that the ending satisfies anyones annoyance at paying taxes. The bad guy (Pacino) gets reamed, that's all that matters. Also, I have always been an Ellen Barkin fan. Even though the use of this woman is extremely limited in this film, does anyone know where I can get a pheromone injection like Damon uses during the latter part of this film? Again, not quite thumbs up, but definitely not thumbs down.",7,1,2,1 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," StarWars is back
","I believed that this film still shows us that George Lucas still has a passion for this epic.  His love and devotion is on course, but it would appear that he sometimes he can't 'see the forest for the trees'. Like many, I found the beginning rather pedantic in it's ability to draw the observer into something emotional, but rather attempted to dazzle us with effects. In my opinion, Lucas has so developed his scope and concept for the films attitude, that he forgot to allow one very special thing to happen: Allow the actors to act. I got teary-eyed at some of the action scenes rather than the development of sympathies and antipathies involving the character development.  There is where the trees go in the way.  The movie consisted of so many trees, that one kind of didn't see the forest till after they had digested the viewing for at least 45 minutes.Movement from one shot to the next was breathless. I also found myself yearning for the days of the little puppet that characterized Yoda rather than the CGI - especially in the fight with Dooku.  A bit much. And even though the antics of C3PO in the assembly line of Droids and his 2-sided part in the arena battle was comical, it lacked coherency with the seriousness of the moment. And yes, I do know what comic relief is.But yet, all in all, it did not really disappoint me like The Phantom Menace. I saw it on a huge screen with a Dolby system that was, in my opinion, the best in the area.  It was a true sensation, and for that I will go see it again, and probably again. And even though it didn't rank up there with 'Return Of The Empire', or had the heart that 'A New Hope' had, it shows that Lucas is still in love with this epic tale of good against evil.",7,0,0,17 May 2002
Oblivion," Good popcorn flick.
","Joseph Kosinski created and co-penned Oblivion 8 years ago, and reported to his opinion his 'debut' movie. Oblivion was is a graphic novel, illustrated by Andrée Wallin. However he got his feet wet at Disney first with the release of Tron Legacy where he proved to be a competent director. However, Disney dumped Joseph. I hope it makes Universal a ton of money.The story boast of a world that can no longer sustain life and is being dismantled for what properties it does have: Water. Nearly 90% of the planet is is radioactive from a war between aliens and man, which resulted in the destruction of the Earths moon. The premise is set around aliens still surviving on the planet that want to interfere with the plans to remove the planets water. Drones are set in place to protect the massive units that are set about the task of sucking up all it can. When a drone is down, a skeletal crew that populate various areas of the inhabitable part of the planet to find and fix the drones. Know this, the drones are not particularly people friendly. Enter Tom Cruise.At 50, Cruise is well preserved, easily pairing up with the beautiful Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. As plots within plots slowly unfold, I found myself thinking 'Whaat?' at times only to answer my own question with 'Eh, OK. I'll roll with that'. Eventually, more people enter the foray and you realize there is more to the planet then was first let on. Enter Morgan Freeman. Thank god he's not narrating the movie! The scope is epic, the feel is lonely, and the color quite gray for the most part. There is a strong storyboard presence throughout, and no doubt Andrée Wallins conceptualizations are the primary influence. Keep your eyes open for tons of sci/fi homage. That in its self made for some moments of 'aha' and a slight grin. Definitely a PG13, but there was thankfully no adult content, just some moments of violence. See it in a good theater. Don't know if I would have seen this at full price but at a little over 2 hours, it was definitely enjoyable for me and company.",8,4,8,20 April 2013
Justice League," Nothing new here
","Maybe I'm suffering from a CGI overdose, or maybe I'm tired to seeing the slow-mo superhero stunts, but for me, this was not a memorable move, nor do I really want to take my wife to see it. I can't spoil this movie, it did it for it's self. It was mildly entertaining. I can see why a gag-order was issued to Rotten Tomatoes. I thought Suicide Squad was lame, but it outshines this one. Oh well. They got me to buy a ticket. I'm good. I'm good.",6,2,4,18 November 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," On target, but unremarkable
","I was a little confused at the onset. I didn't know what to expect, but Yates does not hold much favor in my mind; so that said I will refrain from bashing on him. The story continues, but in a much more honest, sincere measure.I felt the acting was much more polished, the emotional content much improved and the bond between the three primary characters solid in so many more ways than portrayed in earlier movies. You could feel that after a decade of working together, growing together, almost living together that their profession in acting has also grown similarly. I found my experience being drawn in to their drama, their pain and their bonding to all that they are connected. After a while you really didn't care who they chose to play what in this movie, but there were enough returning cast to put you back in that comfort zone that the Potter legacy will hold on to for generations to come.I got to hand it to them: They kept the group together for over 10 years. That alone is an amazing accomplishment.I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a hugely over involved CGI epic. It had its moments, and it was obvious at the first sight of Dobbie that life characteristics in a computer generated character have made them a bit more believable rather than just cartoonish. I didn't actually agree with the choice for Lovegood, it seems that a portly, stout or even fat person would have been more suited for this role, but again it was acceptable.Again, much of this first part was acceptable, but not great. Some reviewer said this was a great prolonged trailer. I agree in many senses of that. There was a lot that could have happened in a shorter time. I felt the dialog, action, sequences were deliberately retarded to stretch and get as much out of this as possible. I'm not trying to be mean. I found the movie kept me engaged in a positive way. But when you can count 10 seconds between responsive dialog, I felt the stretch. The tragedy scenes were much better. The younger guy sitting in the seat next to me was balling his eyes out at the death of Dobbie (though it could have been to impress the pretty lady he was sitting next to.... OOH! Low Blow!). Yeah, I got misty eyed at a couple of spots. The handling of the finding of the sword and the reunion was exceptionally well conceived and filmed. The thing is, the film got most of the right things in at the right time with an acceptable amount of scenes cut out. Overall, people that groan and moan about this one are too calloused. On the other hand, those who praise it as a top notch film have probably been so used to being disappointed with Yates' productions that this one was his defining moment. It probably was, but that is not saying much.",7,2,4,21 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," how to review... hrmmm.
","Chick Flick alert.This is an interesting and humoresque film. Co-directed between first-time big screen directors Jonathan Dayton and Valery Faris, the truth about dysfunctional families comes into full boom as a family pursue the ambitious dream of their youngest family member to a totally surprising end to the movie. Both incredibly annoying and entertaining, Little Miss Sunshine takes you to realms that some women will find hilarious, but for their male escorts, may be ready to chew on their leather belts for their desire to shoot everyone in the cast within the first 30 minutes of the film.The one line description of the plot goes as such: A young girl slides by chance into a competition that takes her family into an emotional romp that is both disparaging and sympathetic at the same time. The characters take you into realms that we all know are purely fictional, yet at the same time reminding you of people in your past (if you are old enough yet to have that line of memory) that just make you want to slap due to lack or reality to begin with. I have to admit, I was ready to plug myself into my MP3 phone and totally diss the movie because of all the associations I have had with people just like these portrayed in this movie... YET! You persevere and see what happens next. I really didn't want to go some places.The story opens with a tragedy. The brother of the wife in this instance has done something that the state frowns on and end up in a hospital. Unfortunately, insurance isn't going to cover everything, so this bud has to go. So, lets move him in with a boy that has Nietzke emblazoned on his wall and has taken an oath of silence until his dream comes true. The father is a lost soul trying to put together a 'Steps' program from motivation but is having a hard time promoting it. It is embarrassingly obvious from the start why it's not flying. And all this time there is a grandpa that is helping a hopeful youngster fulfill her dreams of becoming a beauty queen by developing a special talent.All and everything get thrown into a yellow mid-60's VW Micro-bus that is just as dysfunctional as it's passengers, and they make the trip from New Mexico to Los Angeles to attend and compete in the title pageant.What could POSSIBLY GO WRONG!! That is for you to find out. All I can say is you will be in for a totally psychologically emotional ride that just make you laugh and spit at the same time. The totally incompetent father, the teenage son living in total denial and anger; the addiction of the grandfather, the angst of the wife's brother in his personal relationships make you feel at times there is no hope for the male element for any purpose on earth. That is contrasted deeply by the optimism of the little sunshine queen, which seems to end up making the most outrageous contribution to the pageant... enough to get her ejected from the passion all together if it wasn't for the shining knights in white armor that charge in and rescue her in her hour of need. The only person that seems to be centered and in the center is the mother, and she just seems to be dragged behind everywhere the family horse ends up going.There are lots of twists and turns, surprises that are and aren't welcome at times. There is a lot packed into this film.. but then again, it's a comedy, a situational comedy that you just have to expect that things will be rushed and compacted. However, it's funny, witty and nostalgic in a contemporary sense.In light of this, I have to give it a thumbs up, but I don't think I could take this movie a second time!!! I'm a guy! SPARE ME!!!",9,1,4,26 September 2006
Spider-Man," Would you like to swing from the sky?
","I was never one to read comics when I was young.. or old for that matter, however, I could enjoy the way this interpretation of Spiderman thoroughly enjoying. I had a few complaints, but only once really sticks in my mind that really is becoming more prevalent in today's movies and more specifically blockbuster moves:  Lack of acting.Maybe it's the actor or actress.  Maybe it's the director holding on too much, but the only actor which really outshined everyone else's character was the editor, Jamison. He barked, he glared, he sneered, he punned, he was ANIMATED in a way only a HAM can animate a character.  I really, truly felt that if Sam Ramie had allowed that to perpetrate all his characters, I would have considered myself fully entertained.But this first blockbuster of the year is really setting a hopeful precedence on this year.",9,0,0,17 May 2002
Ratatouille," Phenomenal
","This is an interesting film for a subject. First off, its a Brad Bird film, which is hard to compete with. Secondly, it's a Pixar flick. Third, it's rated G! How many films this year so far have this rating that all genres actually can find positive comments about? The crew that produced this is enormous. The money that went into this would probably is phenomenal (but I can't find a price on the total yet). Disney and Pixar know a cash cow when they see one.However, something strange happened to me during my first viewing of this film: I found myself detached from it in some strange way. The color work was excellent, the texture and feel was superior, the characterization impeccable. So what was it? The movie works on all levels, but there is a subjective aspect that I think interferres with the total immersion in this instance: 1. Not many people have an affinity for wild rats (except Willard), and 2. A geek (with an American dialect) that ends up being a totally incompetent heir of a famous French chef. Sometimes it felt like Brad was attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole.Not that its a bad thing, this is definitely a treat for all ages. The plot is simple: Sewer rat with his higher olfactory abilities applies it to garnishing food to achieve top honors with local critics. The pace doesn't leave you wanting; the continuity doesn't leave you wondering; the beauty of the animation doesn't leave you skeptical. Really, I can't recommend this enough for anyone with or without a family. I just can't put my finger on it though... it just leaves me curious.Another thing... I alway like to comment on the audience reaction to it in the viewing audience: Even with all the kids, they were engaged and didn't squawk throughout the movie, but also there was a lack of genuine surprise or laughter at the more poignant comic events, which makes me feel I'm not alone in my thinking here. Rats. Food. Restaurants. Somehow, that just doesn't mix for me.",9,3,5,2 July 2007
Quantum of Solace," It's Bond, but not at his greatest.
","Quantum of Solace would leave some fans of the last addition, Casino Royal somewhat disappointed. Quantum picks up shortly after where Casino ends, and if you like explosives and chase scenes you will not be disappointed. They have car chases, boat chases, plane chases, foot chases... WHEW!! I was out of breath after the opening sequences. For me, it was akin to Shoot Em Up, but without the humor that Shoot Em Up carried. All in all, it was a fabulous midway ride, but for me it just lacked something.The all new Bond (Daniel Craig) slowly brings you to the bad guy's focus way into the movie, but it's not really the plot. The plot is that there is a need for closure from the death of Vesper that he wants to deny almost to the closing. Otherwise, there are a lot of politics and environmental observations that play out like a Washington video game. Mathieu Amalric makes his English debut (Mathieu is a veteran French actor with scored of film to his credit) as the arch villain. He brings a certain charm that sometimes makes the Bond character look stoneish. The 'Bond Girl' Olga Kurylenko who also comes from French cinema and TV via the Ukraine, made her English debut in Hit-man and more recently Max Payne.I did have problems with this film though. I couldn't give it a thumbs up for two faults I found in it's production and modeling: 1. The action sequences are edited in such short clips I found these segments hard to watch. Had the director (Marc Forster, an interesting choice seeing he has mainly done tamer films such as Kite Runner and Stranger Than Fiction) restrained the quickly formatted segments to allow for a little more devoted seconds, it could be easier to watch. I am not criticizing the scenes; contrary. I thought they were excellent. I would have just liked a little bit more time to be able to digest the action sequences so I could remember them better. The second problem I had was Bond himself. I know he was hurting and in denial, but for the most part he was just too stony. I had a hard time developing much sympathy for him.But the film was well worth the price of admission. I went to see it once and then took my wife to see it again, so that in its self is a testimony to the production. The crowd was uncommonly quiet for a theater usually filled only to about 2/3rds capacity. We had to glare at some local spectators to get them to shut up, but eventually the movie took hold and you were flying down the rails of a cool roller coaster. -B",7,0,1,16 November 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," You have to watch, even though you don't want to.
","There were some real positive aspects about the hobbit, BUT nothing we have not already seen before. You can't go into this movie with a lot of high expectations, and it is impossible to discuss this film without pointing out scenes that are full of spoilers.For the most part, if you have seen Lord of the Rings, you will feel comfortable with this prequel. There is so much familiarity that middle earth should live like someplace you can drive in a couple hours time. Music is carried over with very few new themes; the set and locations have all been recreated meticulously; the original frodo and bilbo open the movie and it just feels like a continuation of the end of Return of the King. There is a lot more primary CGI/Action Capture in this, which again sits in a comfort zone in its self. Lighting, filters, camera, action.... it just seems like more of the same.It is a slower moving movie, and at 48fps in 2D didn't really make that much of a difference. Jackson added new material which I found annoying, and many of the action sequences seemed plagiarized from the preceding trilogy. For example, the rocky path through the stone giants can't be broken free from the pass of Caradhras, and I'm sorry it was just a bit overplayed. Jackson focuses his attention on a small selection of sequences that are in the book but sometimes not all that important, however the goblin king, trolls (yet a little over the top) and riddles in the dark work out very well.For all involved, this movie could have been extremely short and still hold true to the book. The curse of making it three movies is that no one really wants to wait 2 years to see this culminated or to see 8 plus hours of fill for a 280 page book (the Lord of The Rings was 1137 in its entirety). I curse you, Peter Jackson, because I too will be seeing what you do with the rest of your treatment of this story just like many other followers, but don't expect me to like it.",7,1,5,28 December 2012
Cars," Hard for kids with ants in their pants syndrome
","OK, it's a horrible association, but I wonder why Chevron didn't sue Lassiter for copying the ideas of their cars... but who cares now? I'm sure this new addition from the Pixar pen (Digital, I'm sure) will make it's costs and then some. But before I get into actually reviewing this film, I want to part my observation from the spectator side. I realized this was going to have lots of kids seeing it is actually for kids, but for a kids movie, there was a lot of restlessness in the seats. It wasn't engaging them as a cartoon should engage a kid. Either ADHD is at an all time epidemic level, or maybe they were bored with the first part of the film. One mother actually took their 5 year old to the side isle and let them run up and down the steps. A parent behind me tried desperately to 'shhhsssh' their 1st grader into submission. It didn't work. Even during the latter third of the movie, the conversations amongst the kids seemed more about everyday things that the movie. So, what was the target audience of this film? NASCAR enthusiast? Chevron toy car collectors? Pixar CGI enthusiast (I grimly raise my hand)? A little bit of everything, but not enough on one thing in particular. The one thing that went against this cartoon was it's running time. At 4 minutes less than 2 hours, no kid should be expected to sit through something like this. The apparent nature in kids is to move around and be active. So, this is testing even the most committed parent with a 3 - 6 year old. However, cars is still Pixar, and charming in it's own way. I have to admit, I gaped in awe as McQueen speeds through the mountain tunnel to reveal the waterfall on the other side. Particularly realistic, it could match anything Yosemite Park has to offer, and to think it took down entire computer server when they tried to render the shot in real time, you know they were jammin those bytes by the millions. The sheer magnitude of the study of reflection, color and texture warrants applaud all by it's self. It was a simple plot: Car gets lost, car meets girl... err, chick-car umm, future soccer mom... (whatever) , car ends up making lots of new best friends and setting up shop in depressed town of Radiator Springs. Mater (Larry, The Cable Guy) really pitches his voices to create a great beat up buck toothed tow truck, even managing to slip in a 'get 'er done' near the end of the movie. Funny thing about this film: it really has no villain, no promoter of evil... all there is is competitive egos. Man, sometimes that can be enough too! I didn't mind the corny name droppings, but the pace of this film is uneven, and even drags for quite a while. Happily, it picks up pace though in the final third, and the action resumes to what one expects of Pixar. If you see it, stay for the credits: They didn't do out-takes, but seems to snip in some funny stuff that one could have imagined the characters doing in the side lines... especially the car versions of previous Pixar films. I would recommend you not take any kids under 5 or 6 simply because some people may be really involved with the film, and a young kid not engaged in a movie enough to shut them up would make a bad viewing for some. Not me, of course!",8,0,0,11 June 2006
Stardust," Fairy Tales can come true, it could happen to you....
","One of the hats I have worn in my life was a kindergarten teaching hat. No, the hat didn't have Barney on it, but it was an intense year, where I prepped for hours just to make something 'simple'. One thing that made life easy though were the abundance of material to be gleaned from fairy tales, be them Hans Christian Anderson, or the collective works of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm. Not only did I get a chance to relive a time that was less complex, it was full of great inspiration and images for stories of my own.Well, it seems it has also inspired Neil Gaiman, who has really made his mark in the world of film as a writer of fantastic stories. Neil announced his presence with MirrorMask, an absolutely absorbing visual journey into the abstracts that were dominated by geniuses like Lewis Caroll, George McDonald and C.S. Lewis in the previous couple of centuries. He has also scripted the screenplay for the upcoming production of Robert Zemeckis' 'Beowulf', which I await the screening of with great anticipation. Original fantasy has taken a back seat until recently, and I am deeply heartened by the release of 'Stardust'.This movie has all the attitude and atmosphere of a deep, rich fairy tale. It's full of magic, spells, witches, pirates, mortals and immortals. And, a fallen star. It is peculiar that the plot isn't really about the fallen star, but a story about power. It is infested with side stories, but unlike many other movies, the side stories all fall into place and enhance the film without substituting it with sacrificial flashbacks or projections into the future. No, this film keeps a steady pace, laced with humor and some great twists. There is a dependency on CGI, but for the most part, the CGI never intrudes on the live action in ways that would detract it from it's fairy tale roots. The plot, seeing it is bound by the premise of power, firmly revolves around a dying king and his 7 sons and who will get to wear the crown after the king has departed. However, there are sub plots: Seems a mortal wants to marry the prettiest girl in town, promising to bring her a shooting star that has landed in a mysterious plot of land on the other side of a 'protected' wall. There is also a witch and her sisters that wants to be immortal, young and beautiful again. Whatever the case may be, all the subplots are all bound to a beautiful 'Star'.The theater experience was pretty damn good. It wasn't overcrowded, and there was a good mix of ages. But the one thing I will say is that even the kids that came to watch this film were held captive from almost the opening scene. There was little talk, and I think only two people got up throughout the entire 126 minutes that this film required to complete. Its just enough time to remember you still have popcorn left in your bag and finish it and your super-size Coke. I recommend this for children over the age of 8.For the child in you that reveled in the wake of imagination and fairy tales, you really need to see this film. On the big screen. Soon before it goes away. Its opening weekend box office was a disappointment. It deserved more. I could find very little wrong here.",10,0,0,14 August 2007
The Bourne Legacy," For some films, there will always be an opening for a continuation.
","We're on vacation. School has started so we flipped a coin: Expendables II or Bourne Legacy. We wanted action. We got it.Legacy has a very thick, foggy start. You can't really tell whats coming until it's almost in your face. You got pills that seem really important. You got someone that seems to be running from something in a heavily snowed in mountain range. You meet people you have never seen before that have no history. In light of that, it's best to watch without weighing in on how it fits into the Bourne series. But slowly daylight grows and the plot becomes clear: Treadstone has mutated into splinter factions and the technology is still growing. In many ways similar to Ridley Scotts last adventure Prometheus, we find ourselves in a alternate time line where one story overlaps another. With a few well place cameo's the director (Tony Gilroy who penned the previous Bourne blockbusters) runs a parallel story about chemically altered soldiers and their fate when Tredstone is under the magnifying glass. There are many elaborate action sequences, and the editing should cause ones nervous systems to collapse and convulse. Granted, the supersoldiers are enhanced to limit pain receptors, but nothing should outrun death so many times in such a short time frame. Paul Greengrass would have been proud of the editor,but thankfully we did not have to endure the shaky cam. I would go as far as to say it was a good popcorn movie, however the popcorn sold at this venue was stale with the texture of styrofoam. My verdict is that it is a weak story with competitive action sequences. I would also say a bit overwhelming for kids under the age of 10, but seeing we saw this on the first day of school we did not have to contend with this. Theater was up to snuff: the digital media for both audio and sound were excellent - which always adds to an experience. -B",7,6,9,28 August 2012
The Illusionist," A Pallet of magic and intrigue.
","An intriguing and beguiling movie, deep and rich with a Rembrandt like pallet for film texture, The Illusionist was another enjoyable summer surprise. The casting constellation well chosen, Paul Giamatti, Edward Norton and Jessica Biel led the average Joe Schmoe movie viewer through a wonderful maze where you fell into pits, hit dead ends and locked doors, and were willing to believe the more obvious but expect the suspect: A love story that piloted the events through a tangled web of preverifications between truth and deceit.But it is magic.The movie was well named. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, who from childhood chance meetings with a magician becomes enamored with not just slight of hand, also falls in love with the beautiful Sophie (Jessica Biel). The relationship is doomed for the start. She is a duchess and he the son of a cabinet maker. It is, after all, an age old story, but this one draws you in because I believe everyone loves a magician... even if it is just to expose the tricks they perform. And then there is the Chief Inspector, Played extremely well by Paul Giamatti, who is given the task to filter out the visual illusions from the truth. Both Giamatti and Norton seem to get equal attention in the film, and it is refreshingly well paced. I did not feel it was too long or too short. The story just fit perfectly in the 110 minutes it used.I would like to go back to the film texture. Like many sci-fi films that are shot like looking through collored lenses (like the Matrix and Underworld), this one chose sepia and higher contrasts to its presentation. Like so many masters that used the browns in an under-painting and then added color on top, the visual world is enhanced in a richness and warmth, yet enshrouded in a mystery of it's own. The film is totally wrapped in it own luster that you are coaxed in to the lives and thinkings of the primary characters.It is magic.And I'm spoiling the film no more. Go see it. It has more depth than you realize.",9,0,2,28 August 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not quite the comic book I would read
","The curtain goes up, you get your precursor to the story, the camera finally comes to the stars of the show. I had a flag of warning at that moment: Thing's rocky shell seemed somehow less weighted, he moved far to easy in it unlike he did in the previous installment; Sue was.. well... there was way too much hair spray; Johnny and Reed were just too clean. I'm sorry, but that seems to go against the trend to make things more believable in this decade. Batman Begins was almost perfect. Life for the Bat to be was dirty, violent and full of misery. You could at least feel some of his pain. The relationship between Susan and Reed were almost Barbie-ish. I was pleased to see Alicia (Kerry Washington) return - at least thing had some intimacy to balance his clobbering ability.While the movie had many weaknesses, as a story it was good. The Silver Surfer was undaunted in his focus, preparing the earth to be consumed by his master Galactus. For the most part, if I was between the ages of 12 and 21, I might have enjoyed it more... especially if I had read the graphic novels of the Fantastic Four (Then again, maybe not - specially if I was a purist). But reluctantly, as an old fat, I could watch the film and be critical of it simply because there really wasn't much there in the offering plate for me to munch on with a pleasant demeanor. The CGI, though good in some spots (the Galactus cloud creature as it starts to penetrate the Earths atmosphere was quite well done, and the Silver Surfer reminiscent of the T-1000 in Judgment Day), there were many other uses that just didn't seem to rise to the polish expected in a live action/CGI film.Aside from being almost short in it's running time (92 minutes), the story sometimes confused children, which was evident in the amount of chatter going on around me and my friends. There was one adult that took calls all the way through the film, and a carpool of kids behind us were eating something that required removal from a crackling cellophane that just got extremely annoying after the first 20 minutes. Parent bringing their 3 to 6 year old kids to this thing are just totally oblivious to the sensibility of raising children. They probably couldn't get a baby sitter, so they just allowed their kids to wanter the rows of seats and play on the outside isle steps. For a viewing audience, especially for this grumpy old turd, it just did nothing but aggravate the review of this movie to almost a negative experience.Mom? Dad? If your little kiddie seems to not really be interested in the film or is totally confused by it, it may mean the tyke is not ready for this stuff at this time in his/her development. Maybe your should wait for the DVD and pass up the theater experience. OK???? Thanks!",7,9,19,1 July 2007
The Dark Knight," The book you couldn't put down until it was finished.
","This movie has some bigger than life aspects too it. Not only do we get stellar performances from the late Heath Ledger and Christian Bale, but the supporting cast all blend together to make this experience tense, dark and sometimes binding in the sense being held captive. If you have ever picked up a 500+ page book and lost sleep and days of work because you couldn't put it down, this is the experience I walked away with.It is difficult to encapsulate the behavior of someone that is so wrought with such malcontent as Heaths portrayal of the Joker, but suffice it to say throughout the movie, you never get the sense he wants anything in life but to cause anarchy to the world around him. Every story he tells you about how he came to be is different and within short time you have been cornered into not being able to second guess him. Pitting this Joker against the Bat ... well, I'm sorry Jack, you gave Joker a shot but you have been out staged. Bale looks pale in comparison, though it seems he spends a lot of his time thinking in this sequel and by the time he realizes that the Joker just doesn't give a damn about anything, it is almost the end of him. Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart provides us with a remarkable transformation when he too realizes that he no longer has anything to live for, and in an amazing turn of events his passion for good turns to revenge. All the dots slowly reconnect back to the Joker.Hot and cold, fast and slow, good and evil, love and hate all seem to have strong influences. This is not, however a symmetrical script: Good only wins out barely in the end. The city is left in ruins. The impression of terrorism has affected every life in Gotham, and the Batman is left to run.There are moments in the film that allow the audience to breath thankfully as they responded to the puns with a few snorts of laughter. I was impressed that I didn't see any young children attending (but then again I went to a workday matinée). Rated at PG-13, I guess an adolescent would be able to separate their personal hormone-driven angst from the intensity of the movie. However, at nearly 2.5 hours, an adult can take the entire book in one sitting. Once it starts there will be no going to the bathroom, not getting popcorn or candy, you won't be able to put the book down.",10,3,7,22 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A must see, but not a must praise.
","Harry Potter films traditionally need to have a thumbs up - even if they don't really deserve them. I say this simply because the movies are just chapters in the entirety of the Harry Potter franchise. So far, having seen 5 of the 7 books, one starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel, the actual culmination to the series. I can't say this is my favorite however; the whole movie lacked something. It seemed oddly disjointed and 'fuzzy'. From a book that portrayed Harry as being continuously angry throughout most of it, I didn't get that sense of anger. Sure, there were moments, but at most I felt the biting edge had been dumbed down at points where it almost left you behind emotionally detached (which you only realize when you are suddenly and temporarily drawn back into the world). Most of the problems I have with this film tend to lead back to the movies director, David Yates, who was a curious selection to begin with. He has no real experience, and in my opinion, is apparent in this films visualization.This film felt more like an interim movie, but still necessary. In some ways this was a real turning point for Harry where he starts to take some personal investment in the future and his karma with Voldermort. We learn a little history about the formation of the Order and some insight into Padfoots (Sirius Black) background, but the main focus revolves around the creation of Dumbledores Army. This all happens when students, after experiencing a couple of exciting of practical defensive use of the dark arts turn into a nightmare under the tutelage of a micromanaging professor Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton who was a genius in this role) who absolutely dominates the screen. As the weeks roll by at Hogwarts, an abundance of rules put a stranglehold on the institution to the point where no one wants to be there. Dumbledore ends up in the line of fire, faculty loose their jobs, and everyone in the school live in fear. When the needs of the students don't get met, a secret society blossoms (Dumbledores Army), where Harry is prevailed upon to teach them how to defend themselves against Death Eaters, Dementors and a possible confrontation with Voldermort himself. During the final battle this training comes in handy for the group. I will no longer go into the story, you need to see it.Things that annoyed me was the lack of consistency with the previous movies. You get to see a new Dementor in this episode, and it doesn't look anything like the previous Dementors. What a pity. I loved the sinister graphical nature of the ones used in Prisoner of Azkaban (Directed by Alfonso Cuarón). Another thing was the cameo appearances of major characters at Hogwarts. There was a lot of dependency on the students to carry this film, and I feel that the support from the faculty and staff at the school just didn't seem to be there. Even Dumbledore seemed to take a back seat except for an amazing appearance in a fight scene near the end. In general, the CGI lacked luster. However, there were some good things to note as well: The magical world and the gritty nature of the real world seem to knit together in a way that appeared more congruous. Buildings were no longer portrayed in pristine condition, and during those moments when you were drawn in with the action of the film, you could find yourself squirting a few tears without knowing it.These are all signs of a production that did not have a strong captain at the helm, in my opinion. With such an incredible cast, they were capable of so much more if the support was there. I am not encouraged by this, and am almost anxious that Mr. Yates is already signed on as director of the next very crucial book. We can always hope for a miracle... or better yet, Magic.",9,0,0,13 July 2007
Alice in Wonderland," Usual Tim Burton, but even that gets old eventually
","First off, I was perplexed at the onset of this film as to why Burton decided to use the expensive 3D architecture to produce this film. Honestly, it could have worked fine in 2D seeing very little of the film took advantage of the technology. Most film by Burton can be classified dark, but with a bit of jocularity that keeps the film entertaining. I was disappointed that there really wasn't much levity in this film. The overall fingerprint of the plot was war: Why does one got to war? To what ends will it inevitably bring? A crown? Loyal subjects? Money? Power? Okay, one queen had secret weapons, and the other queen is waiting for their savior. Wonder who is coming to dinner? Burton arranges for his favorite players once again, but there are some fresh faces as well, such as the relatively unknown Mia Wasikowska - who by the way, plays an excellent older Alice. Depp is given his freedom to develop his cast character even to the initial painting he did of the character he played. Helena plays a wonderful queen, but her cheek is not all that unfamiliar when comparing it to her role in the Potter films. I felt even though the cast played on favorites, they worked well in this stylized edition of Lewis Carrol's books. Technically, as I already mentioned, this film could have been done with a lot less money had Burton omitted the 3D cameras. Putting on the glasses after having been completely immersed in Camerons beautiful Pandoran environment just didn't satisfy the desire to have a presentation of something new. Being one of the first CGI films that Burton has produces (Being a staunch supporter of stop-action camera techniques over computer generated animation), he wasted no time extrapolating and exaggerating his cast characters into solid cartoon format. The color is dark, the shading is deep and rich; but I just don't know if it is enough to keep people coming back after the DVD is released to watch it more that a couple more times before it ends up on CraigsList. I'm sad to say I would be fine watching this on my home theater had I the option of paying $10 to see a matinée which included a $3 disposable 3D glass charge (I am slowly obtaining an impressive collection of fat, black plastic 3D movie glasses). It was fun, but it just wasn't quite 'There'. Don't get me wrong... I like Burton's work and haven't really missed anything he's directed big or small. I just can't go the distance with this, although I truly wish I could have. -B",6,3,8,7 March 2010
Avatar," Top of the world.
","This is not a movie of great depth. The story is preachy and old. We heard it with the Egyptians, Romans... exploitation and political. But empty your heads mates for it is visually stunning. Cameron likes his films slightly blue and he likes to blow things up, so in that aspect there is nothing different in this. However, what is obvious is how WETA has firmly planted its self as the CGI hero of the film industry; without WETA, this film wouldn't make it to screen - Cameron or no. As we have seen in Lord Of The Rings with its ground-breaking modeling of Gollum, Avatar focuses on bringing an entire alien race to a world of love, hate, hurt, pleasure, shock and bewilderment with expression and content. Story aside, watching Sams Jake experience legs and touch a new world was like watching a baby take its first steps. The luscious foliage and odd fauna suggest a lot of what we already know is disappearing all over the world, so it goes without saying it is all a part of building the usual sympathy as one would hear the slaughter of the native Americans and the last of the buffalo. History does have a way of repeating its self. That much we know. And it is sad.Aside from the obvious plot-holes, only a few have really done a wtf on the vision of the music for this movie, and it has left me pondering if maybe an investment in Howard Shore would have been a better bet than the traditional sticking to what you are comfortable with. I love James Horner's music and what he did with Titanic will always be at the top of one of the best music scores written. But as someone already stated, the song 'I See You' had all the musical measure of a automatic garage door opener; it just plain sucked. The other thing is that Shore and Williams have become known for 'Themed' music that has a habit of sticking in your brain for days like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. When I walk away from numerous viewings I still can't remember any of the music, and with the ending song I say: 'Thank GOD!!' Cameron shows us he spares no personal expense with this movie; you can see his finger in just about every minute detail like the 3D bugs that are depth focusable, to the ugly machines of man used in war and control (unfortunately his models for military transportation is sadly lacking in comparison with the movies extreme technology). I am not sad I have watched a couple of times before I wrote this review. All said, I had a wonderful time at the movies.",9,1,3,27 December 2009
Up," Delightful
","The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.The last time I went to see an '3D' film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those 'Cross your heart' promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the 'too young to even enjoy Dr Suess' generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done.",8,8,15,1 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Oddly paced action flick
","First off, no thanks to the theater, the aspect ratio was off, and the sound wasn't tweaked for a good viewing. Spielberg wastes no time getting to the point, and introduces the hostile takeover with all the speed of a meteor. However, where many of his films allowed you to take a breath every now and then, this one seemed to go in and out of hyperventilation and asthma and at odd times. For a first time viewing, I left a little bewildered, not so much by the ending and the cheesy dialog, but I left thinking that if I had all that money to spend on a flick like this, I may have chosen a different pattern to it's telling. A worthy release, but not quite Metropolis.",6,1,5,4 July 2005
Hancock," Where did this film get derailed???
","When I saw the first previews of this, I truly thought it was going to be the sleeper blockbuster of the summer. It looked slick, salty and witty. Will looked on top of his comic game; the expressions he impaled his drunken character is something every college animal house inhabitant has probably experienced more than one (I know I did). The special effects people didn't make him out to be at home being a super hero. Lift-offs, flight and landings were the kind of crash and burn a kid would feel when first learning to walk. All the editing of the trailers looked just soooo.... so promising! Then my wife and I went to it and my delight turned to concern after the first 30 minutes. Realize, the running length of this is shorter than WALL-E, and if they had someone that could have paced this film better and drive it using the comic abilities of it's primary star, it would have just been a perfect amount of time.However, director, writer, producers left the reservation on this and turned a potential gold mind into a mucky slur of attempted fictional drama adorned with some very clever comic lines. Hancock is about a down and out superhero that just lost his ability to give a crap outside what he is suppose to do. If they had just followed that to where self realization and respect direction could have lead Hancock, it could have been a delightful movie.BUT... NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo. They had to throw some totally obnoxious twists into it that almost breaks the sprockets that turn the wheels of this movie. I just CAN'T say much,(SPOILER!!!) but it seems Hancock was left for dead once by a woman that was suppose to be his wife. After that, the muddy soup just gets icky.This said, the laughter in the theater nearly ended after 20 minutes. Leave it to Hollywood to mess up a perfectly promising movie with a perfectly silly plot. Not that it's a drag... you can watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, its just not something you will commit to memory like Jurassic Park or ET. -BDP",6,1,4,7 July 2008
Inception," Which reality are you experiencing?
","Have you ever managed to remember the beginning of a dream? Somethings stated in this film were small but true statements. The bizarre things that happen in a dream only appear weird when you wake up. The mind is constantly justifying your mental image with reality.In so saying, Christopher Nolan's 10 years in the making idea offers true science fiction with an all star ensemble cast which in my opinion is noteworthy in its self (I've always been of the opinion that you put too many stars in one movie it usually saturates it with personality conflicts that ooze onto the big screen and lessen the experience). The scope, both in depth and presentation show that it was loved and nursed from concept with just enough technology to create a world that would comfortably accommodated one foot in cold reality and one foot in womb of dream. The good thing is that you can appreciate the movie without intimately following the plot, the bad thing is that you can get very lost if you need to use the facilities. The use of dreams is not a new idea as a vehicle to present a story, I guess the closest thing that would compare to it for me would be 'The Matrix'. What Matrix misses though is, and rightfully so is humanity. Where Matrix is program driven, Inception is almost completely driven by primal needs and the vehicle that fuels it was developed by none other than the military. Once the tools to define and control the dream life of a human being fall into the hands of a special 'underground' group of people, then we start seeing the dangers of manipulating the fabric of time and space. For DiCaprio's portrayal of Cobb with a dark secret and the mission/job he has been offered that would allow this dark secret to be at peace, the focus is set (and mind you, pay attention because it is easy to loose your perspective through the multiplicity of the story).I am a baby boomer, and as such a person who see's retirement within reach have memories of shows like the original Mission Impossible. Inception follows the Mission Impossible time line closely: 1. You have a potential customer that has an interest in your product and you let him sample it. Out of this, he hires you to do a specific job. However, it goes further than you normally go - which is you are not just getting information willingly out of a target, but also implanting an idea so he believes in the end it is his own. the game is a-foot. 2. You assemble your team. You find an architect, an apothecary, a forger, weapons master... etc. 3. You find your best option for deploying your plan. 4. You initiate your plan. 5. You improvise as needs fit in adverse conditions. 6. You accomplish your goal. 7. You all depart with slight nods and smiles as you move on to bigger and better things.I have seen this now twice, which for me was necessary; some things just didn't make sense to me at the start but came clear during a second sitting (2.5 hours long too... so don't drink all your water or eat all your popcorn in the first 30 minutes, or use the facilities during the movie). The only teaser I will part is that the ending justifies the job. Please, don't take children to this movie. It is dark, the music is repetitive and builds throughout the movie (reminded me almost of a 007 theme), there are lots of surprise explosions that are loud - I say this because some stupid 30 year old man bought an 8 month old infant to the theater and sat in the second row from the screen. My opinion he should have been locked up for his arrogant selfishness. This movie is also offered with D-Box motion seat signal which is kind of entertaining. We sat in the row in front of the D-Box section and the floor was constantly vibrating during loud sequences. The experience of this film for me was a 10. The plot was a 10. The acting was a 9 as was the music. The FX were seamless and a 9.Another must see in the theater A-list. Enjoy. -B",10,7,15,19 July 2010
WALL·E," Amazing new sci-fi
","When you are young and innocent, the world is usually a beautiful thing. OK, that would depend on your environment, but I hope children still have a little time to immerse themselves in the beauty of the world that they have been brought into. Old Disney films for intents and purposes were pristine, squeaky clean, beautiful. From day one, with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, even dirty working environments looked clean; mud looked clean in Jungle book; even in the last release of Pixars 'Cars', the rusty vehicles were touchable.This has all changed in (If I have my numbers straight here) the 9th full length feature to come out of the chute at Pixars. Instead of beauty, they have given us gritty and ugly... and it's totally acceptable. Beautiful colors, deep and contrasting and charming characters fill this 103 minute film with pure delight. WALL-E has been left on Earth to do one thing: Clean up after humanity has desolated its resources. The science of this film tends to be a bit preachy at times, but the writers have actually created a somewhat believable future. In its desolation, we find WALL-E alone until some event brings a probe back to check on the clean-up progress. Without giving away too much, our little mechanical droid is not void of emotion, and what develops between the droid and the probe pave the way for the salvation of the planet.As usual, the movie is laced with some great puns, but the vastness of the universe is ever present in the way Pixar defines it: Beautiful. Unfortunately, this movie should have special showings that don't allow children at all. True, it is rated G, but that only enforces that this movie is so multi-platformed for various generations, the addition of very young children can cause the experience from being truly appreciated. I don't know what the circumstances were for the man and his two young children were (2 girls, probably 3 and 5), but he got up and left them unattended to do who knows what. This action was disastrous: The three year old started howling for her dad three minutes after he left, making me want to move seats. Unfortunately it was a crowded theater and that really wasn't an inviting option. So I endured. Another observation was that this movie dragged at times, making the movie seem longer than it was. For children under 7, it was quite obvious it couldn't endure the test of time, and there was an increase in levels of impatiens by those children that were truly ready to start running up and down the stadium steps.For those wanting to see this that are in their 20-something or better years, pay the full price and see it at night. Hopefully parents won't be silly enough to take children under 7 with them.",9,1,3,28 June 2008

Iron Man," A great start to a promising movie viewing season
","Seriously, this was a surprise. I went in thinking this was an action film and find it is an action enhanced drama. A bit preachy at times but only in light the of current state of a world in chaos, the movie works through its plot at a steady pace slowly building towards the eventual showdown between good and evil. For a plot, you discover that our hero builds and sells 'bad' things that hurt people and destroy countries until he is thrust into a situation where he comes face to face with his own creations. Stocks start tumbling and the government begins to panic when his conversion takes him to a place where he wants to save the world instead of control it through fear.The mechanics of this movie are fun, even for non-geeks. Not that we haven't seen some of this action before: The Human Torch in Fantastic 4 and of course the sequences of conversion used in Transformers were a little on the obvious side. However, the one thing that was injected into Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Stark was a live sense of human trial and error. The development of the power source was a little hard to believe, seeing his first prototype was assembled in a cave with very little technology to help him; but once he starts putting the armor in place his obsession swings into overdrive. If a movie pulls you into an experience that the current character is witness to, I call that a successful filming.I have no problem with the idea of kids watching this, though for both kid and the rest of the audiences enjoyment an adult should be with them if they are under 12. It's tame on any intimacy, and though it is there, it briskly moves on mainly to emphasize the developing characters. It's fun. It's bold. It has some cool action scenes that are highly geeked out. It is a movie where the CGI and gadgets support the script instead of the other way around (A failing many movies make).This is a great start to what is looking like a great blockbuster season. -BPS: You need to sit through the credits for a surprise.",9,1,3,3 May 2008
Beowulf," To CGI or Not to CGI, that is the question?
","I have read Beowulf a couple of times. It's great northern European mythology, and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion (Along with Norse, Greek and Roman Mythology as well). And though the movie wants to re-write some of the epic, you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works. Being a work of CGI, you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work. Very stylized and beautifully colored, it is an epic adventure that elevated Zemeckis' previous work 'The Polar Express' to a new level. Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical. Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:Why didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?With the capabilities of dropping in CGI into real life action, this telling of the story could have had so much more of an impact if the expressions were more poignant. Look what he did with 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'? Zemeckis is fully capable of it. Also, to add to this, when you have CGI characters like Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to compare notes with, the modeling here just isn't up to snuff. I felt the entire movie came off like a gigantic 'cut-scene' to a video game than a full featured animated project. I can only give this a little better than a good, hence the exclamation. I do this sadly. You really should see this in a theater, bigger than life. The dragon is excellent, the ugly v/s the beautiful is wild, the sequencing is uneven, though at the end it takes you on a great ride. Oh, and for you people that want to go see Angela Jolie nekkid? IT'S CGI!!! I've seen harder stuff on Fox networks! Seeing my wife and I saw this as a matinée, the crowd was on the sparse side and there was literally no kids present. I couldn't get a solid feeling from the audience though most people as they left seemed genuinely happy with their experience. I'm sure it was PG13'd because of the sequences with Angela, otherwise it would be a solid PG. I wouldn't suggest this for a kid under 8.",7,99,155,21 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Kaaboooooom.
","Sometimes you get a little tired of the 'Follow The Money' good guy/bad guy theme. Movies are riddled with them lately. But you must be aware that movies like the Die Hard franchise will always be around. In the 60's when my television viewing started taking on a wider scope that expanded beyond Saturday morning cartoons, movies were a great way to pass the time, and you had pretty much the same things then as you do now: Westerns with bad guys, good guys, horses and guns; Space movies with good guys, bad guys, space ships and ray guns; War movies with good guys, bad guys, tanks and guns; Cop movies... yeah, you can guess the rest.And Live Free or Die Hard is no exception. Good guy, bad guys, cars and jets and motorcycles and semi trucks and guns. When put that way, it doesn't sound like something worth going to see, but if you like fast moving over the top stunts, at this moment there is none better. Bruce Willis resurrects his role as John McClane, and I don't use resurrect lightly: He's old, he looks tired. He's destitute pretty much with a divorce and kids that don't want to have anything to do with him. So, seeing where we left off with Die Hard with a Vengeance, it seems McClane had just about done everything to screw up anything that would be considered a social life. So what else is there for him to do but save the world. Johns not nearly as self-mumbling in this movie as in previous movies, and in light of that, much of the levity that he usually brings to the screen is subtle and the tone gets pretty serious. The bad guy he is pitted against starts out like he just wants to 'upset' the US Government off, but in the end, and I'm sorry if it spoils it for you, all comes down to money again.The story is predictable in the sense you know something in the way of some incredible stunt are coming, but the stunts themselves are pretty damn cool. Not quite as gross as a zombie tearing your limbs off, but still, McClane slowly chips away at the bad guys resources until there is nothing left but to ... Well, I'll stop there.I still like this for what it is: And Action Movie. And just like many of its older counterparts, they are merely there to entertain. So, on entertainment alone, I give this a thumbs up.",9,0,2,1 July 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Simplicity and innocence
","Wes Anderson has put together a piece of pie that is exquisitely prepared and uniquely sliced, a signature piece that he seems to be dishing out a personality all of its own. Charming and stylish, laced with humor and irony, populated with archetypal characters that in the end break their mold and become in some ways reborn, this film cannot be watched with any preconceived perceptions of the story. And if you do go for a viewing, these preconceptions will be a waste of time.The film exhibits more as a stage show with an incredibly elaborate set than an on-site filming; location is just an added bonus (amazing wilderness of Rhode Island). The simplicity of the filming is its strong point, void of the special effects that have dominated the summer blockbuster season, even the disaster sequences though cheesy are enjoyable almost in the same vain as Godzilla. You have to overlook the flaws in order to get to the wonderful story.First and foremost, this is a love story. We could say it might be a coming of age, but when you have been immersed in the film you realize no one is really acting their age, which I found hilarious. The movie pokes fun at the establishment, then ports it to a time when hypocrisy and fundamental truth lay in the same bed.Set on an island that is being monitored by a meteorologist, you have small town residents, a camp of scouts, local law, big government and ageless innocence, the cast is literally a sky of super and newly discovered stars. Bruce Willis is the local law (surprised?), Edward Norton a cigarette smoking whiskey drinking troop leader, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand play parents; then we have a legion of relatively unknown newcomers that play the scouts. The focus of the movie surrounds two typically (by today's standards) alienated children (Brilliantly played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward), who have pledged their love for each other by meeting in a field and running off together.There is not a huge effort to play up emotional content, but it does focus on bonding, devotion and individual freedom that was prevalent in 1965. MPAA rated this PG13 for a simple underwear scene, but I guess some over-reactive parent would probably agree it was not suitable. Wes penned the story, teaming up with his friend from The Darjeeling Limited Roman Coppola. It is paced well and though I can't guarantee it, should keep your attention. You need to pay attention. There is much to gain from it.The wrap-up was not all that surprising. It is more similar to putting out the lights just before you go to bed. It will influence your sleep. It should make you smile. The local theater was to capacity, and just like a meal that was carefully prepared, people savored the delicate flavors silently with a few grunts of approval. When the ending credits started to roll, it was met with nearly a standing ovation.Having taught kindergarten for a while, I found that I would spend hours working something complex into a completely simple presentation. If done correctly everyone is pulled into the moment. This was one of those moments.",9,4,6,8 July 2012
Looper," Twisted
","Looper is a smart, intelligent, mind bending conceptual movie from a fairly unknown director Rian Johnson. This fact alone should inspire many unpublished wannabes to never give up hope. Even though I too had problems navigating the parallel dimensions in this film, 2 viewings did eventually help.30 years. That marks the end of a loop for a looper. 30 years. However even early on we learn that can go wrong. OK, that was a spoiler I admit, but nothing bends correctly until the end.Things I had trouble with: Joseph Gordon-Levitt I'm sorry even with tons of make up does not really look like Bruce Willis. The transition between old and new Joe are not so apparent so it confuses the audience. Timelines get confused between what Joe wants to believe and what actually happens. If you have to analyze a film too hard it is frustrating. You really don't want to pay to see it multiple times to figure things out.Things I really liked: No matter what later time you are living, it is all dependent on the past. If you loose an arm... it is gone in the future. Current time is not forgiving. If you screw up, you are always susceptible of a reprimand that might not be so attractive. Reality verses what you want can be altered in any given moment. Try as much as you can to make the right choice in the present doesn't always work out in the future.For some reason this felt more akin to BladeRunner for me in tone and execution than many of it's wannabes. No kid will understand it, so don't bother taking them. This is purely an intellectual film that is meant for scifi addicts. I should know. I'm not a true scifi addict. I didn't understand it first time around either. -B",10,0,6,5 October 2012
The Martian," Riddley Scott picks a winner.
","Every good story has 3 major components: A beginning, a duration and an end, somethings many Hollywood writers are afraid to do anymore. Studios have their fingers in so much of the creative/artistic development of a project, it certainly explains why so many movies are considered critical flops. However, the public speaks, and box offices like making money.This being said, The Martian certainly seems to please most people, even the critical. I don't think I'd be spoiling anything by saying the plot of the movie is about an astronaut left for dead as the crew evacuates from the planet surface of Mars only to find out the crew member didn't die. You have the story from a bureaucratic side, a scientific side, a social media side and engineering side all interwoven around the subject's story; the guy they left behind.I personally don't think many people outside the enthusiast would know the difference between Mars and Wadi Rum in Jordan where the principal filming took place, and seeing even my understanding of the terrain is limited it was quite convincing. You get comfortable with the associations pretty quickly when you add all the environmental supplements that add to location that dispel the earth atmospheric conditions. I think most people have accepted the way Hollywood deals with space and give it a great deal of flexibility, so space travel is somewhat forgiving, but mixing the tech that got the various crafts into the air and the ship its self 'Hermes' (Check your Greek mythology – very appropriate name) builds this story into one congruous epic. Obviously, the whole story revolves around Mark Whatney, a botanist who is left for dead and between his skills and ego are able to survive the elements until he is rescued. One of the nicer things about the story is that unlike other Ridley films, is that it isn't one emergency after another. The strong point to the screen play is that it breathes so well when mixed with the various sub-stories that the movie never gets tedious or overly long.Using the word 'Mix' is a very appropriate term to describe this epic scifi movie. An experienced recording engineer know when to emphasize a specific instrument when doing the final edit to enhance the focus and listeners experience. Harry Gregson-Williams score is not intrusive but well integrated (Credits include Shrek, Man on Fire and Cowboys and Aliens); Dariusz Wolski cinematography translates Ridleys vision to screen, and all the various departments all seem to come together to culminate in a perfect 'Mix' for this compelling story. This movie has a great beginning, an absorbing duration, and satisfying ending.So, I give this a full 10 our of 10 for experience. The audience was totally engrossed in the film, fully responding to the humor and horrors, empathetically sensing the singularity of being stranded but ultimately making the best of a bad situation. As the alien in John Carpenters 'Starman' quote on being human: 'You are at your best when you are at your worst'. -B",10,17,37,7 October 2015
