United 93," UNITED 93 - a belated wake-up call?
","When is it the 'right' time to make a movie about 9/11? Five years? Ten? Never? If the terrorists had attacked say, an underground mine of 2000 workers and killed them all with an explosion, would there have been all the media hype? Probably not.Despite what Americans think about terrorists, calling them 'evil' and 'callous', they forget one important fact: terrorists are extremely intelligent and will outwit the best of our best every step of the way. They also have unlimited funds. Add the fact that fanatics have no qualms about dying for their beliefs and you have an undefeatable power. They don't care what we think of them.The Twin Towers were attacked for one reason only; visual impact.The WTC was a famous US landmark and targeting it drew the necessary news coverage. Add the attempts on the White House and Pentagon, both also US icons, and you have a nation terrified out of its wits. This basis of terrorism is of course, terror. Considering how the US treats Arab countries, expecting non-retaliation is sheer arrogance.The unexpected downing of the Twin Towers was an added bonus for the terrorists. They must have squealed with glee as they watched their targets collapsing. It is extremely difficult to 'aim' a large airliner at such small targets (relatively speaking) and the pilots had considerable skills to do so (pilots trained in the US). No doubt the Towers falling spoiled the terrorists' 'fun'. Once the towers were gone, so was the visual impact. All that remained was smoke. The light show was over.We cannot imagine the insufferable losses of 9/11, but police officers and fireman will tell the same story; they were merely doing their jobs. They did not know that the Towers would fall, but the shortsightedness of this is remarkable. Consider two, 300+ tonne commercial airliners, laden with highly flammable jet fuel slamming into buildings at over 400 miles per hour. Is it not feasible that the building's superstructures would become compromised? Even so, what were we to do? Leave the buildings' occupants to fend for themselves? It was a lose-lose situation.Many emergency personnel knew that once they entered those buildings there was a chance they would not return. This is true of any emergency rescue. These folks are not heroes in the way we have glorified them. They are simply brave souls willingly to face extreme adversity in the execution of their duties. Many of the souls lost on that day would baulk at the idea of being 'heroes'. They would claim they were simply doing their jobs.Whatever your beliefs, we cannot deny the incomparable bravery and spirit of those personnel. We do not know the facts of UNITED 93 other than vague radio messages and telephone calls made by passengers. Dialogue had to be created. The situation was well-handled and the dialogue believable, however much artistic license was used. UNITED 93 attempts to show an objective view of what may have happened aboard the stricken aircraft. It makes no claim to accuracy.Even though we knew the inevitable outcome, I still found myself rooting for the passengers. Yes, the jerky hand-held camera action is annoying and there was too much time given to the hijackers praying and not enough character building of the passengers. But it did show terrorist fanaticism. I doubt there was the hesitation shown by the hijackers in the movie. Fanatics do not falter. Their minds work on 'autopilot', believing firmly that what they are doing is required by them of their Gods. Who are we to argue?Whatever your thoughts, UNITED 93 is an acceptable and believable account of events, however inaccurate. It does a very good job of portraying the confusion by both NORAD and the FAA. Scenes aboard the aircraft will keep you glued to your seat. Anyone who has ever been in a crisis situation will know that there is first disbelief, then chaos, followed by arguing as it then all goes to pieces and those involved realize that they are ill-prepared to cope with the situation. Communication always breaks down. Incredibly, it is only since 9/11 that the US' security services have begun exchanging information.The 9/11 attack was just the tip of the terrorist iceberg. As long as the US continues to invade other lands and insult their leaders, they will be under threat from organizations far more powerful that they can ever hope to defeat. Praying just will not do.Terrorists have infinite patience and funding and I they want to bring us to our knees, they can and will do so with ease. Inevitable future attacks will be better organized and funded and will result in the loss of tens of thousands, possibly millions of Americans. Targets are shopping malls, cinemas and any critical US installation. Imagine 200 planes hijacked at the same time, or the orchestrated blowing up of packed shopping malls at Christmas time.We need better leaders to help defend our own borders, not interfere in the lives and beliefs of other countries; an act that has gained the US international notoriety. Bush's war mongering adds fuel to the fire and his arrogance at thinking he can defeat these terrorists continues to threaten Americans. He needs to put down his club and listen. Bush's ideas and actions are little different than those he calls the 'evil ones'. Murder is murder. In any God's name. Iraq is a prime example. Examine life in the US very closely. How much freedom do we really have?The world's opinion of America and is not very high and that 'superpower' arrogance will one day be removed. Whatever it takes and whatever the human cost. See the movie and form your own opinion. UNITED 93 is not professing to be the whole or any truth. It is well handled and very watchable. Decide for yourself.",Null,2,6,27 August 2006
Madagascar," One of the best Movies of 2005
","I honestly don't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie so much!I don't know how they do it, but there is not a single wasted frame in this entire production! The script is great, the voices are perfect and the animation is a joy to watch. I suggest watching it more than once as there is so much going on in the background of many scenes that you're bound to miss many of them! Tons of fun for the whole family and the soundtrack perfectly matches the mood of the film. Get your family together, settle the kids in, pop the corn and prepare yourselves for an eye-feast of fun, frivolity and a trip to Madagascar with Alex and his 'Droogs'. Wonderful, clean and entertaining fun for everyone! Let's hope they make more of these amazing animations. See how many movie excerpts you can spot. One is *very* subtle indeed and I had to think where I saw it. It's the one about the menu. Have fun watching and looking for it! And now, I'm off to watch this again . . .",8,2,2,6 October 2006
Silent Hill," Slash, Gore, Blah, Blah - *yawn*. NEXT!
","Apparently this movie derives from a computer game. So? For those of use who don't fritter away time in fantasy video games, we're none the wiser. Comparing movies to books/video games is pointless as it comes to us as one or the other. Making comparisons is senseless. No movie can ever be made the same as a book, by definition. So, moving on ... Silent Hill. Hmm, another gore/slash mock horror flick. I wonder if this type of movie will ever go away and people will get a grip on reality. Probably not, as the vast majority lives in one fantasy or another, i.e. living in the past, or wishing they were someone/some place else. People are addicted to escapism. Probably because the planet sucks as it is - war, famine, politicians etc is enough to make us all seek escapism. But why gore and horror? Why not tropical paradises or happy-ending love stories? This flick (and it is just a flick) is yet another blood spill for die-hards to add to their collection. You can count on one hand the number of these flicks that are actually worth anything or can be called good movie-making. Name one. This one is no different and had me yawning from the start. Radha Mitchell looks like a shagged out Charlize Theron on bad crack. Nice though to see B-rated British TV extra, Sean Bean has done so well for himself in the US. He pops up all over the place these days. Good on ya, mate! Within 30 Min's of this movie you'll see every tired horror movie cliché in the book, and find yourself with a finger on the 'Fast Forward' button, just to skip the director's tedious 'artistic' attempt at suspense, i.e. holding shots for 5 seconds too long. Ho-hum, wherever this story came from, it's just another platform for movie makers to exercise their malnourished imaginations and splash gore on the screen. I gave Silent Hill a 2/10 as some of the FX were pretty good, to a point, then it's all just so much droll repetition. The story (what there is of it), drops us in at the deep-end and from here it's a case of figure-it-out-as-you-watch, which rapidly becomes boring. One just has to try and imagine ANY of the content of this movie in modern day America as feasible, i.e. helpful cops and a town full of bodies no-one noticed, an unbelievable past that nobody investigates, blah, blah. One line is 'We can't have civilians wandering around on their own'. Huh? All 'civilians' now require a police escort? I must have missed the memo. As you watch this flick you'll be tutting and rolling your eyes every few seconds as it stumbles along, trying desperately to incorporate clichés and the lame storyline. Stick with it though; it's interesting to see what happens next, i.e. new characters with no introduction, erratic scene hopping, annoying camera work (reverse panning and vertical climbs), etc. Thirty eight minutes in, my finger was hovering over the DELETE button, but, as I was waiting for a call from Tokyo, I left it running. If the town is so bad, why is there still a sign pointing towards it on the main highway, huh, huh? Silly. Like not one of the 500 million or so casual travelers will explore the town? By the end of the first hour, the script has gone the way of the town itself; disintegrated, and you find yourself realizing that the flick is indeed taken from a PC game, where it should have stayed, safely away from the general public. Alice Krige as Christabella is clearly a fan of Katherine Hepburn and tries her best to emulate her, even down to the hair-do! The zombie nurse scene will have you laughing, i.e. they all have a 36C chest. There's also an annoying 10 Min's of colorized/grainy film where they attempt to tell the story. It merely gave me a headache. The 'theme' is your archetypal, tired old demon and witches, goodness/evil, etc ploy, which is ALWAYS bizarre, inaccurate and wholly unbelievable. Two burly men, repeatedly beating a woman on the floor with lengths of 2' water pipe are likely to kill her, yes? Not so here. She escapes with a facial abrasion. PlayDoh pipes, maybe? Anyone figure out the volcanic fallout? Was Silent Hill filmed near Pompeii? How many times have you seen the old animated barbed wire/tree branch effect? Brace yourself, they play it to death here (pun intended). You're going to love the closing scene. When someone figures it out, how about enlightening us all? My interpretation is that the camera man fell asleep and the camera drifted. Seriously, if you've nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon and feel like killing time, Silent Hill is ideal. Just check your brain at the door, you won't need it.",2,1,4,9 August 2006
World Trade Center," And it all comes tumbling down
","Anyone who lives in the US is aware that Americans are extremely good at ripping off their own; from the White House to the local gas station, they're all out to screw you with deception, misleading commercials, inflated prices, etc. Why? Because the American way of life revolves around one thing and one thing only: MONEY. If you have it, you're OK, if not, you're nothing and no-one. This is often called the 'American Dream'. Americans don't care who they harm or hurt in pursuit of the 'mighty dollar'. Watch any US cable TV for examples. US movies are not exempt from this practice and this movie, WORLD TRADE CENTER, in particular, is a prime example of yet another great rip-off, i.e. dwelling on the public's still-raw emotions of 9/11 and cobbling together a generic disaster movie, knowing full well that it WILL make it at the box office simply because of the title! Every American will probably see this movie eventually. Had this movie been entitled anything else such as 'Buried Alive!' or 'Three Days in Hell', it would flop en route to the box office. WTC, directed by Oliver Stone (who really should know better and rise above cheap box office money tricks) is actually NOT about the 9/11 attacks and events at all, but merely about a few select individuals who happened to be involved in the attacks, as were TENS OF THOUSANDS of other people. This should have been a gripping, riveting movie that kept us glued to our seats for two hours and which wracked us with a gamut emotions. Instead, it's another generic mish-mosh of some 9/11 scenes and a 'Day-In-The-Life of...' humdrum disaster flick script. Remember the 'Airport' movies and 'Earthquake'? Same thing, different color. Remove Nicholas Cage from the movie and you've got . . . squat. For such a powerful theme, i.e. 9/11, this flick sure does disappoint and I found myself bored to tears through most it as it was so predictable with all the schmaltzy script and cheesy acting. I guess Oliver Stone too has fallen prey to the 'buck', forsaking content, information and entertainment value; the entire POINT of a movie. Any movie. I sincerely hope that one day a good movie IS made about the events of 9/11, even if it is 4 hours long. This one sure ain't it. I suspect that anyone who DID lose someone in the attacks will not be impressed that their loved ones are given the briefest mention in this two-hour 'infomentary'. This flick could have taken place anywhere in the world, in any building at any time. Picking the 'Twin Towers' as the 'theme' was simply deceptive. My condolences to the victims of 9/11, I wish this movie had offered an explanation or perhaps closure for some. I have a 14-month old daughter. I wonder if one day I will be able to let her watch a movie that accurately portrays the events of 9/11. So far, it seems not. Overall rating? Simply pooh and an embarrassment to the film industry at large.",1,7,15,21 August 2006
Saw," Gripping Psychological Thriller
","The title, 'Saw' about says it all, though not in the way you may think. This is a thinking man's psychological thriller. The plot is rock-solid, the story powerful and well written, and the acting perfectly matches the mood of the movie. Although macabre in places, this is necessary to emphasize the intentions of the main character - and the intention is very clear - value the life you have, or forfeit it.The pace is fast and intense and you find yourself wincing at some of the scenes, but unable to look away from the screen. An excellent soundtrack and sound effects work to keep your heart thumping while these poor souls attempt to free themselves from the predicaments in which they find themselves. Not for the squeamish, but for those of us who like hunter/hunted thrillers, SAW is manna from Heaven. The second episode, SAW II is as good, if not better than the first, as the story unfolds and all becomes clear. Just when you thought you had it all worked out, think again!",8,0,1,7 March 2006
