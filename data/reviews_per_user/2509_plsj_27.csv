Casablanca," Didn't care for it
","This movie is overrated in my opinion and I'm also not one of those teenagers who has a short attention span. A movie does not have to be loaded with sex or violence for me to enjoy it. Now to the movie. I guess I'm missing something here, I mean the first half of this movie took place in Rick's Bar with people talking and constantly asking for drinks. In fact I've never seen a movie with so many drinks ordered in my life, not that thats bad. After that, I was extremely bored. Surprisingly, I did enjoy Gone With the Wind.My Rating 4/10",4,8,19,15 July 2002
Citizen Kane," One of the Five Best Movies ever made
","Citizen Kane is definitely one of the best movies  ever made, but it should not be #1.  The Godfather is the best movie ever made in my opinion. Anyway, Citizen Kane is still a very moving film with excellent cinematography and acting. The first 20-25 minutes of this film are kinda boring, but after that its very good entertainment. Orson Welle's masterpiece by far. 9/10   The Five Best Movies Ever Made are... 1.The Godfather 2. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 3. The Godfather Part II 4. Citizen Kane 5. Rain Man",9,0,1,25 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," A Horror Classic
","Sleepy Hollow is one of the best horror films and a true classic. Johnny Depp is very good as Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci is also very good as his girlfriend. The cinematography is excellent, which makes the decapitations very realistic and very chilling. A great horror classic! Overall 9/10",9,0,0,19 July 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Good Movie, but far from the best war movie ever
","I don't think its even the best Vietnam Movie( Platoon is), but nonetheless, its still a good movie. R.Lee Ermey gives an oustanding performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. His performance is what carries the first half of this movie. The boot camp scenes are excellent. The Tet Offensive part is the weakest, but Matthew Modine turns in a good performance. The sniper scene at the end was very good. (SPOILERS) I never would have expected the sniper to be a young girl. Overall a good movie, it just ran kinda slow in some places. 7/10",7,6,9,15 July 2002
The Godfather: Part II," The Best Sequel there is!
","This film is the best sequel ever. The acting is great, especially Al Pacino as Michael(he was also brilliant in the first one), and Robert De Niro as young Don Vito. Everything is just right this great movie. If you loved the first one(I surely did) I guarantee you, you'll like this one too!!!",10,0,0,10 July 2000
U-571," Quite possibly the greatest sub movie ever made
","U-571 was very intense, on the edge of your seat thriller. Full of action and suspense,few sub movies compare. The movie is about an American sub posing as a German trying to get an Enigma code machine from another german sub that is disabled.This is a must see for action/adventure fans.10/10",10,0,8,22 October 2000
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's Second Best Movie
","This film is Francis Ford Coppola's second best movie(behind the Godfather) and arguably the best film made on the subject of Vietnam, with Platoon and the Deer Hunter close behind. The excellent cinematography and the excellent direction by Coppola manage to capture the realism and the atmosphere of the Vietnam War. An all around great war movie!! Overall 8/10",10,0,0,15 July 2000
Pearl Harbor," This movie sucked....
","One reviewer on here is absolutely right......did Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay think they were making the 'Platoon' of WWII with this awful movie. The scenes where the Japanese were attacking Pearl Harbor were great, but it seems that the god awful love story was thrown in just to make it 3 hours long. BORING. The battle scenes lasted for about 35-40 minutes, so that means around 140 minutes of this movie were about the guys falling in love with the same woman.        Rating: 2/10",2,0,1,12 June 2002
Die Hard 2," Not as good as the original Die Hard
","Die Hard 2 does not match up to the original, but it is still a very enjoyable, thrill-packed action movie. Bruce Willis turns in another great performance as the wise-cracking hero. Die Hard 2 is probably the weakest in the trilogy, but if you liked the first a lot, you'll definitely enjoy this one. An overall fun action flick. 8/10",8,0,1,21 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," The Greatest War Film Ever Made
","Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and the best war film ever made, with Paths of Glory, Platoon, Glory,and Apocalypse Now not far behind. The opening 20 minute D-Day sequence is the most realistic piece of combat action ever put on film. After watching it, you feel so bad for the men who had to suffer through all that. That really shows you that combat is hell on earth. Tom Hanks should have gotten an oscar for heroic performance and all of the supporting actors should have gotten oscars too. This film should have gotten the Best Picture of 1998 oscar, instead of Shakespear In Love. Saving Private Ryan is far more moving and has a better storyline. This film can also get very emotional especially toward the end. Absolutely Brilliant War Picture. 10/10",10,0,0,23 July 2000
Rules of Engagement," Good but not Great
","Rules of Engagement was a good movie, but could have been better. There could have been more action, suspense, and drama. The movie was very predictable. If you have ever read a review before watching it, you already knew what was going to happen even before you walked into the theater. Courtroom dramas that are a lot better are A Few Good Men and Paths of Glory. Both are excellent dramas.This was a  Good Movie nonetheless. 6/10",6,0,1,25 July 2000
Dumb and Dumber," One of the Funniest Comedies ever made!
","Dumb and Dumber is absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give their best and funniest performances. I have seen this movie 7 or 8 times and it is just as funny the 8th time as it was the first time. I have seen Jim Carrey's other movies, but this one is his funniest ever!!! Overall: 10/10",10,0,2,13 July 2000
The Mummy Returns," Decent Action Film
","This is by no means a intelligent or thought-provoking film, so if you're into those type of movies, then stay far away from this. Mummy Returns is not as good as the first one, but enjoyable nonetheless with plenty of action. Those are the pros, now the cons: some very stupid and lame jokes, special effects could've been better, and (SPOILERS) there was a scene in which Rachel Weiss's character dies and then comes back to life later in the film. THAT IS SO STUPID. 6/10",6,0,0,15 June 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Dark and very weird masterpiece
","I first saw this film about a week ago and I putted off seeing it for so long because (this sounds stupid) I was a little scared to watch it. I was 13 at the time, well, 3 years later I finally decided to rent it.2 Hours and 37 minutes later, I was completely numb. This movie did an excellent job of getting its point across with an exceptional performance from Malcolm MacDowell. I read in some movie reviews that people were appalled at all the violence, nudity, and rape this movie had, but I believe Kubrick put it in to get his point across. Kubrick also had guts to make this movie. 9/10",9,0,0,14 July 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Good Crime Thriller
","I putted off seeing this movie for the longest time because I thought Pulp Fiction was absolute garbage. I tried watching it again, but I fell asleep right in the middle of it. My friends, though, kept telling me to rent this movie. So about a week ago, I rented Reservoir Dogs with the lowest expectations. After the movie was over I was pretty surprised. It had a good story line, good plot, and good acting. In my opinion, this is 100x better than Pulp Fiction.8/10",8,0,1,26 June 2002
Titanic," One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
","This movie was boring and a complete waste of time. Instead of spending more time about the ship, they wasted the movie with some stupid, dumb, love story. This movie was pointless, dull, and a waste of 3 hours and 14 minutes of my life. This is for everyone who hasen't seen yet- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Overall 1/10",1,4,9,13 July 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Overall, I enjoyed it but.............
","there are two problems with this movie and its the same two most everyone here has mentioned. I was hoping Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen would reprise his role, and Sofia Coppola, despite being very beautiful, gives an extremely poor performance. She would not have had the chance to play in this movie if it was made 3 or 4 years after the 2nd one. The ending was very dramatic. 8/10",8,0,1,17 July 2002
Die Hard," texas
","Die Hard is probabley the mother of all action movies. It has everything: great action sequences, thrill-packed suspense, and great acting. Bruce Willis gives his most his most heroish, funny, and electrofying performance of his career. If you are a action buff and you have not seen this movies yet, you're missing out on one of the best actioners ever made. The best in the Die Hard trilogy. Overall 10/10",10,0,1,20 July 2000
Psycho," Classic Horror Film
","I'm can't say that this is Hitchcock's best film because I have yet to see his other classics (Rear Window, Vertigo, North By Northwest). This is considered by many to be the best horror film ever and I can see why, it contains an excellent blend of horror and suspense. Plus an standout performance by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. 10/10",10,1,1,16 July 2002
All Quiet on the Western Front," greatest war film ever made.
","All Quiet On The Western Front, in my opinion is the greatest war film ever made.The battle scenes are great, I think they are sometimes up to todays standards.Lewis Ayres plays Paul Baumer and Louis Wolheim plays Kat short for Katczinsky.If you want to see a really great war film I strongly recommend this one.10/10",10,2,3,6 December 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," An Excellent Masterpiece
","One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is one of the all-time great films, and should be higher than #20 on AFI's 100 best movies list. Jack Nicholson and Louis Fletcher give the performances of their career. Christopher Lloyd(in his first movie)gives a great performance and Danny De Vito and the rest of the cast. A flat-out outstanding movie. Overall 10/10",10,1,2,15 July 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Better than the 2nd one
","Die Hard with a Vengeance is better than the 2nd one, but this one and the first one are in a tie for the best of the trilogy. If this one was like the first two, it would be a disappointment, but thankfully it isn't. The 3rd installment has explosive action, great one-liners, and great acting especially by Jeremy Irons. The part where McClane and Zeus where riding through Central Park in the taxi cab was so exciting that I was still catching my breath when the scene was over. Although the plot is a little weak the action makes up for it. Great action film. 9/10",9,0,0,24 July 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," A very touching and wonderfully told story
",A marvelous film that reaches in and touches your heart like no other movie has done before. After I watched this movie I was so moved by it that I sat there and stared at the screen after the credits rolled up. That is how excellent this movie is. This is a movie that everyone in the universe should see. An absolutely incredible film. An easy 10/10,10,0,0,22 October 2000
Platoon," The Most Powerful Vietnam War movie ever made
","Platoon is an emotionally charged movie, especially at the end when Chris Taylor says we fought ourselves instead of the enemy. Some scenes were very hard to watch, and the first time I saw it I really didn't like it, but I viewed it a second time and I realized how powerful a war film this was. This film really makes you think about the young men who had to suffer through this and the pain they had to endure. Oliver Stone's best. 9/10",9,1,1,27 July 2000
Paths of Glory," Kirk Douglas's best movie
",This is my second favorite war movie behind all quiet on the western front. This I think is Stanley Kubrick's best movie. Kirk Douglas is excellent as colonel Dax.I think this should have gotten the academy award for best picture in 1957.Overall 10/10,10,0,1,8 July 2000
Goodfellas," Easily the best film of the 90s A TRUE MASTERPIECE
","Goodfellas is the best film of the 90s, the only movies that come close are the Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List. I guess theres nothing to say that hasn't already been said. The only problem I have is that its only #94 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies.10/10 Excellent Film",10,0,1,26 June 2002
The Godfather," A truly great film!
","This movie is the best mafia movie ever made, and quite possibly the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando was brilliant as was the rest of the cast. I recently saw Citizen Kane(which is a very good movie) but I would have to say that the Godfather is far superior. Overall 11/10 Absolutely Brillant Film!!!",10,0,1,9 July 2000
