The Blair Witch Project," Great idea totally wasted.
","I never saw this movie at the cinema, wasn't around for the hype and hopefully was able to approach it with an open mind. What I want to know is how anyone can be scared by this movie ? The concept is clever, lot of potential but none of it realized. It takes more than wicker handicrafts and a bit of goo to convince me of authentic witchcraft. I know it's all supposed to happen in the imagination of the viewer and I like those kinds of movies, but I would like to have something beleivable to get my imagination working in the first place. The psychology of the girl with the camera and her pathological need to film everything (and justify the concept) is not made convincing enough. The brats in the film look too amateurish to care about in the slightest and it would have been nice to have a more complicated display of emotions that just the perpetual use of swear words, or perhaps, being in my 20's, I'm just too old for this kind of movie. The bigest problem for me was that I just didn't get the feeling that the film makers had really constructed much of a story outside of what's on the screen and concequently instead of having my imagination going into overdrive from all the subtlties that were absent I instead just couldn't make the leap to taking the film seriously. The sequel is supposed to be awful so that should say something about the film makers.",Null,0,1,25 October 2002
