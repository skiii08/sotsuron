National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Man - I'm gonna ruin it for the Sheeple out there...
","Okay- So I have a problem with the entire premise. First off- If you want a treasure to remain hidden, why give all the 'cryptic' clues? Secondly, who left the clues anyway if no one remembered where the treasure is hence the hundreds of years to find it again?Then - how come over the years clues were added, again, to a treasure no one knows the location of?And how can you make a clue if you're not privy to the other clues or other stories and references that Gates (Cage) later somehow connected?Lastly, you'd think there would be some decoy or false clues as well.Since the Masons left clues in a bunch of old monuments, all you have to do is walk around and dig behind every Mason symbol you find with a pocket knife.Now, for other problems: (oh, where to start?)Okay - the chase scene - You have this ancient piece of wood clue and you trust a traffic cam to pick up a picture of it in high zoom-able resolution. I wouldn't. Then you expect the kid to hack right into their system.Speaking of that, how the heck does this kid hack into the most secure systems in the world using a crappy Mac notebook and some wires taped to tiles?How do they instantly get detailed schematics and blueprints to every building they need to get into? Why would they post those details somewhere on their sites anyway?The Oval Office - again - one of the most secure locations on this planet and they get some White House flunky to take them in there- THEN - He doesn't think looking for an earring all around the room is ridiculous. You'd think she'd lost it earlier. How does a earring fly across the room and under a desk? Then the magic box desk - The flunky doesn't seem to hear all the locks and tumblers snapping up and down? Oh, that's right, because he was getting kissed by the girl which didn't seem to arouse any suspicion in itself (maybe something else though).I won't even go into the Kidnap the President part - I was slapping my forehead at that point.The clues - Geez - so vague but then Gates just steps away for a second and figures it all out correctly. I mean, you can look at anything a thousand different ways. How do you even know you had all the clues? Where is/was the chief clue keeper tracker anyway?You can't make a sensible clue based treasure hunt without one.Again- if all these people from different walks and times have clues to offer, then wouldn't that prove somebody or somebodies, knew where the treasure was? So why is it lost? How did the kid fly that helicopter like that without looking half the time? Also, of course the copter had a high def camera on board as well. How did he get the helicopter in the first place? Wal-Mart in France? Yes, I know you have to go to a higher end R/C store than that. But still. Guess they took it on the plane with them.How come the President can not only pardon all the federal offenses that occurred, they also didn't have to answer to any of the destruction they caused everywhere else either?The last points are just for measure. I could have sat here all day but I didn't take notes while watching all the ridiculous 'plot' pieces. There are too many to recall.",1,16,25,14 January 2008
