The Blair Witch Project," I can't believe how BAD this film really was !!!!
","Well, never before have I gone to the cinema and disliked a film as much as this one ('Batman and Robin' came very close).What I liked; a/ Heather Donahue - she was very convincing and I would imagine pretty good in a NORMAL film !b/ The filming - for about 5 mins, the camera stuff might have worked but it went on way TOO long.
What I disliked; a/ EVERYTHING ALMOST !!!!b/ No soundtrack - this is always bad for a film, they may have wanted it to be realistic but it had no depth to it.c/ The horror factor - Horror, Scary ??? - what are people on about when they say this is a scary film. It's truly depressing and disturbing, but why would anybody want to go to the cinema for those emotions, for a good fright, yes. But depression and disturbance is something we want NOTHING of in our lives.d/ The language and dialogue - This is REALLY were the film screwed up, I have no problem with the 'F' word when used infrequent and for the right reasons, but the use in this film was appaling. At no point was the rest of the dialogue clever.e/ The filming - Good for about all of 5 minutes and then it just got clearly boring and messy.f/ The plot - Um... didn't have much of one really. The ideal of going into the woods for a project was 'different' but the rest a What was the nonsense about a witch anyway, more likely it was just Josh fooling around with the kids, maybe they didn't even get killed. Maybe they just got lost and died of hunger in the end.Sorry, but this is THE worst film I have seen in a long, long time and I had to get this off my chest after returning from the cinema. Don't think I was the only one either, the cinema viewers seemed appaled that they had spent money on it.MORAL: Do not follow the hype, read about the film first, see if you REALLY think you will enjoy it, then go to the cinema. Well I've seen 1 film every week this year (that's about 47!!!) and this is the PITS of the entire lot !I'll add another 1/10 to the long-growing amount !!Cheers, Andy-Ydna",1,2,3,31 October 1999
