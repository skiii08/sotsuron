Insidious: Chapter 2," The first one's better.
","The sequel to the hit horror film by James Wan was somewhat not what I expected. Of course you would have expected less because James Wan isn't directing this one but still, the first one was bad-ass. The actors are still great. Patrick Wilson, okay. The story was also great. I like how they explore Josh's past and how they connect this film to the happenings on the first one. Exploring the ghost's past was also good. I only complain about one thing---It lacked the cheap-but-effective-way of scaring you that made the first one awesome. There is no WTF moments on this film. Still, it's a watchable film and good for those people who are still hungry for more after watching the first film. Plus, there's a hint for a next chapter before the credits roll.",7,0,1,1 October 2013
Suicide Squad," Great first half, so-so 3rd act...
","Suicide Squad is a film about a group of villains forced to work for the government on suicide mission hence, the name 'SUICIDE SQUAD' a.k.a. Task Force X. And these are group of actual villains---not outlaws or some anti-hero---that came from the rouges gallery of some superheroes like Batman and Flash. Among these 'villains', the standout performance is Deadshot played by Will Smith. Watching the trailer, I was worried that he would not do the character justice. But Will Smith's Will Smith. Margot Robbie is as good as you expect her to be as Harley even without the quirky Harley voice from the cartoons and video games. She's a good and beautiful actress, so no worries there. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is powerful and scary--in a good way, that is. And as for Mister J: well, he has a few scenes and Jared Leto's Joker is scary and very unpredictable. Imagine having a friend treating you to a diner and the next thing he'll do is hit your head with the plate just for laughs. That's how this Joker is. But this Joker is more comic book-y than the previous incarnations. And I'm very interested on how this Joker would go toe-to-toe with Ben Affleck's bad-ass Batman. As for the plot, it's a little predictable. You know, generic super villains with generic henchmen that pose no threat at all but it does not bother me that much. The problem is the characters or how they are given importance. Some are very important, some are just there and others are just disposable. The studio should that this is the first live- action incarnation of these characters on film. Yes, you may know Captain Boomerang as villain of Flash and Killer Croc as Batman's villain but do you know who the eff is Slipknot or Katana? But seeing as they are part of Task Force X, anybody could die any minute but it is still no excuse to not give these character importance. So, is it watchable? Yes. Very. Soundtrack alone is worth the admission. This is the third film in the DCEU following Man of Steel and BvS and is the most lighthearted in terms of tone amongst the three. Humors are spot on on this film. This film is a small step expanding the DC universe where Batman and Superman exist but it could have been a great leap. As for a DC comic reader, watching these characters on the big screen is a real treat and so many easter eggs. It may have a generic and predictable plot but it is still good and even better and awesome soundtrack.",7,0,1,15 August 2016
Man of Steel," An epic reboot of the most popular comic book superhero...
","Movie Review: 'Man of Steel' While a superhero movie, Man Of Steel is also a sci-fi drama about an alien sent to Earth and trying to live among us. Unlike the 1978 Superman, it tackles the emotions of Clark Kent a.k.a. Kal-El a.k.a Superman, as we all knew him. The visual effects was awesome and it gives us an out-of-this-world look of planet Krypton and the chaos in Metropolis was way better than that of the Avengers and Iron Man 3 combined. The standouts were Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Amy Adams' Lois Lane is just not your usual damsel in distress and Michael Shanon's Zod was also good. The most surprising of all is FAORA, General Zod's disciple. Henry Cavill's Superman fits the Superman of the 21st Century but needs more sense of humor. They say it's ZACK SNYDER's best movie to date but I say it's the BEST Superman movie to date!Man of Steel is the Dark Knight version of Superman but much less darker and full of emotions.",9,81,150,12 June 2013
The Lego Movie," Is this Toy Story 4?
","Now, don,t get met wrong on my summary for it is a positive one. A movie about a toy product? Some would say it would be ridiculous, but if it is, this one is ridiculously awesome!!!Like the what the theme song in the trailer said, everything here is awesome: the animation, the characters, the theme, and the twist.The animation here is very good. I don't really know if it's stop-motion or computer-generated, but it's pleasing to the eyes. It looks like the came zoomed in on lego toys. And you can see different locations made out of lego---the Wild West, the Middle Zealand, the city, the place in the cloud which I forgot what its name was. With everything made of Lego (even the waters are made of it, not kidding), the whole movie looks like a giant exhibit on Legoland.The main character in the movie is Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt, who is just a regular guy wanting to be special. He's the scene-stealer because you really feel for him. Of course, there's also other characters voiced by famous actors like Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, and many more. But the side character I like the most is the Bad Cop (not Batman coz he's a dick in this movie). Voiced by Liam Neeson, he a cop with two sides: good and bad. He's bad but he's also good and hey, it's pleasing to hear Liam's voice in an animated movie.The cameos of different lego characters is where I laughed the most. I'm not gonna spoil for it you but there's superheroes, athletes, space dude whose partner is a hairy creature, poet, president, etc.What's most important in this movie is the theme. It's centered on the product and for the people who owns legos and other toys--specially the older ones. Also not gonna say it. You have to watched to movie to find out. I didn't expect that this movie would have an emotional kick in the final act. The last 20 minutes left me with teary eyes like just like what the ending of Toy Story 3 did to me. And going home, I felt like I just wanna play with my toys.Overall, this is a must-watch for kids and adults and I will tell you this: Everything in this movie is awesome.",9,1,5,8 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 'I am fire...'
","Let me start by saying that this is far better than the first film. Unlike the first, which is all talk and more talk, Desolation of Smaug is a fun movie with visually stunning environment, great action sequences, engaging story, bad-ass elves(I'm talking about Legolas and Tauriel, of course, dwarfs, a hobbit, a wizard, and an awesome dragon.Ian McKellen still stands out as Gandalf. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is now starting to feel the effects of the One Ring and Thorin (Armitage) is now showing his selfish nature. The surprise of all is Smaug who is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's Sherlock, Star Trek Into Darkness). Even though he only provides the voice, Cumberbatch makes Smaug awesome. And if you have seen the trailer, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Smaug is one the best (or probably the best) dragons on film. There also cool action sequences. What I like the most is the one with the barrels in the river. Trailer showed as just a walk in the park, but wait 'til you see the movie.I really haven't read the book, but I am a fan of the LOTR Trilogy and this movie convinced me to read the book of The Hobbit. It's because I really want more after I saw the film. The only downside, for me, with this movie is the growing relationship between Kili and Tauriel. I really don't buy it.Overall, this movie is in the same level, or in a bit lower level, with the LOTR Trilogy and I can't wait for the last film: There and Back Again.",10,1,6,27 December 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," There and Back Again...
","Battle of Five Armies is the conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy - the book that should've been a single movie. The movie starts just after the events of the second film, Smaug heading to Laketown. Overall, the film is just OK. Not awesome. What kills the film for me is that it relies too much on CGI. Yes, the Battle is great but would've been awesome if is not CGI-heavy. Upside? The acting of course. They may have change the title to 'BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES' due to marketing purpose, but the story still centers around Bilbo, played again wonderfully by Martin Freeman. He is the heart and soul of the film. Thorin is also wonderfully acted. As for other like Gandalf? Well, he's just there.It may not be the best send-off, but it still did justice to the book. Some part in the book may been left out, but I'm hoping that it would be in the extended edition. Hail, Tolkien fans.",8,2,7,14 December 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not the best DC movie, but still enjoyable
","Imagine creating a play list with different genres of music from different periods and play it in shuffle. A mess, right? Yes. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a mess. Too many subplots with no cohesion. About two-thirds of this movie, the first ones, is confusing and dull. But enough with that and let's get to the good things. First off, the opening sequence. One of the best opening sequence of a movie that I have ever seen and man, that score is haunting. Yes, we've seen it before but this one's on a whole new level. Then, we are introduce to Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman and I gotta say, the best live- action adaptation of Batman ever. Ben Affleck nailed it. Though some moral personality of the character's kinda lost. But as a DC fan, I can honestly say they anything Batman-related in this film is great. This also includes Jeremy Iron's Alfred. I love the interaction between the two. You really feel that this two have known each other for a long time now. Henry Cavill's Superman is still good as he was in Man of Steel. Amy Adams is OK. All of the cast did great except I think for Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Maybe it's the script or something but, for me, was just OK. He went from socially awkward to really really insane. On the other hand, the fight sequences are great. This is a good looking film and it's expected from director Zack Snyder. The titular fight between the two heroes was awesome and also that battle with Doomsday. Though, if you have watched that one trailer, then you really have watched the whole film. But that Wonderwoman intro was insane. It was a crowd pleaser and I definitely love Gal Gadot's portrayal already and makes me excited for her solo film. Definitely added her to crush list. Yep. Added. That soundtrack for her also was great. It has Mad Max feel to it. This film has a great soundtrack. It's thanks to Hans Zimmer who returns after composing the MOS's score and Junkie XL from Mad Max: Fury Road.Overall, the film is great looking, has a great fight sequences, great visual effects, well acted and awesome soundtrack. Even has the most bad-ass portrayal of Batman on screen ever. But the first two-thirds of the film is a mess and suffers from non-cohesion of subplots. As a DC fan, I still enjoy it though and will be looking forward to all DC films in the future.",7,2,4,26 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force is strong with this one
","Episode VII picked up where Episode VI left off (pretty obvious :D) and it is like 20-30 years ago after the original trilogy. I was surprised that this movie did not rely much on CGI, but instead JJ Abrams relied mostly on practical effects which is awesome. Now to the characters: the original characters have returned like Leia, Han, and Chewbacca. Among them, Han pretty much changed. He is still cocky, yes, but he has matured since the original trilogy. Leia, well, she is a general now ha! (Not a surprised though) And Chewie is still the same. The characters are also good. John Boyega's Finn is likable and there is also Daisy Ridley's Rey. The two have great chemistry despite the fact that they are both unknown actors. Then there comes Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. He is like the best big brother you never had. Kylo Ren is the most bad-ass of the cast and he is the villain. Wew. Judging the from the trailers alone, it looked like he was gonna be another Vader but surprised to say that he is not. He is more human than you think. And then there the dick space Nazi and other characters that I'm not gonna reveal because SPOILERS! The soundtrack and the sound effects will give you goosebumps because it's too nostalgic! grin emoticon The only gripe I have about this movie is the story and some elements of it. This film feels exactly like the original which is a plus and not.There are scenes that you know will happen because I feel it was copied from the original. Just wait and listen to Han's joke about the Death Star- like system.",8,3,15,23 December 2015
