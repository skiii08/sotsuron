The King's Speech," A real masterpiece!
","A superb production! Outstanding performances of Colin Firth as King George VI, Geoffrey Rush as the Australian therapist Lionel Logue, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth and even Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII. The first wartime speech of King George VI heard at the sound of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5, Op. 73 ('Emperor'), is simply one of the most glorious moments of the so called seventh art in all times. No doubt, The King's Speech is the best film I have ever seen during the last ten years. I think this film deserved all Oscars he won and it tells us a wonderful and inspiring story which delivers the triumph of the most important values we need to preserve in our lives.",Null,0,1,18 September 2011
Bridge of Spies," Brilliant and amazing entertainment!
","Brilliant and amazing film! Forget films based on John Le Carr√©'s novels. It is a different approach about stories related to spies. Totally different, indeed! In the height of the Cold War, the inspiring and true story of the man who kept his commitment with the Law and the Democracy - precisely the political regime based on the Law - , even with risks for his career, his own life and the lives of his whole family, in his own country. The sequel of the Hanks' character during his speech to the Supreme Court is simply memorable! It reminds me Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck's performance) and the Lt Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino's performance). In my opinion, this film deserves at least the Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Screenplay (Charman add Coen Bros.), Best Film, Best Director (Spielberg), Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Supporting Actor (Rylance). A high level entertainment! A fair tribute to the seventh art and to the politics we wish see prevail.",10,3,8,2 November 2015
