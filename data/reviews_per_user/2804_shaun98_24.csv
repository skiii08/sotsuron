Alien 3," The critics need to take another look
","*minor spoilers*'Alien 3' has proven to be the most hotly debated entry in the legendary science fiction series. When it was first released, the response from both critics and the public was hostile--the film killed off the remaining survivors from the previous film ('Aliens'), leaving Ripley, the series' female protagonist, on her own again. After its action-packed predecessor, viewers were also disappointed to find that this new film went back to the basics; instead of an action movie it was a gothic, existentialist drama. To boot, it was a dark, gloomy film where absolutely nothing went right for any of the characters. It's somber and sober throughout, with barely a ray of hope to be seen. Creatively, the film had a troubled production history, with various writers and directors being attached to the project, but quitting. Finally, music video director David Fincher (known for his work with Madonna) was hired, but his efforts were hampered by studio interference; the frequent rewrites and subsequent postproduction edits made for an uneven film. Yet, looking back on it after a good decade, I find that most people were much too hard on it. It has numerous flaws, but its dramatic and artistic qualities still deserve to be acknowledged.As Ripley, Sigourney Weaver has proven to be the true backbone of the Alien trilogy. Here, she accepts her fate and even looks forward to her inevitable end. Her eventual demise is absolutely logical in the context of the series; cloning her in the next film was nothing more than an act of shameless commercialism in a movie that will never have the durability of its predecessors. Here, she allows her character to express the emotional toll the aliens have inflicted on her for what seems like an eternity. She loses everyone she has ever cared about, and her grief is so genuine it scarcely feels like acting. She shines in one powerful, brutal scene where Newt (see the previous film) is dead and autopsied--it is so painful some viewers will wish to turn away.While many of the supporting characters are not very well-defined, there are still some standouts. As the leader of the prisoners, Charles S. Dutton is the most complex supporting character, one who has discovered his faith and become a new person, even after the terrible crimes he's committed in the past. I liked Charles Dance as the out-of-luck doctor who befriends Ripley, though is character is killed off a bit too early--their chemistry could have helped the film a bit more. Brian Glover does well as the bitter warden who refuses to believe what is happening around him, until he discovers the truth all too late. Ralph Brown is sympathetic as the slow-headed but well-meaning administrative assistant, one of the few characters who don't immediately emote hostility towards Ripley. There is not a single bad performance, despite the characterization problems.I admit I have been inconsistent in my own views of 'Alien 3.' The first time I watched it, I felt let down, but upon subsequent viewings, its merits have become more clear to me. Visually, the film is nothing less than stunning at times. Set on a nearly abandoned prison colony, the film creates an atmosphere of despair and decay. The dominant color scheme consists of rust browns and oranges. The cinematography is stylish; the most immediately apparent visual trick is the alien POV shots. There is a brilliantly directed funeral scene, intercut with the newly gestated alien. The effect is simultaneously melancholy, disturbing and moving. David Fincher's direction helps sustain the film despite its formulaic structure, creating memorable images and shot compositions. The set designers have spared no expense at making the film look as authentic as possible; so convincing is their work that one finds it difficult to believe that it was filmed right here on earth. In fact, this may point out one of the biggest problems people had with the film: it could never truly qualify as escapism. This is not a film to be watched casually--it is genuinely depressing at times, enough to generate a pang of sorrow in the heart. As a science fiction film, this is as close to realistic plausibility as the genre ever comes. Like Ridley Scott's original, 'Alien 3' takes place in the actual universe we inhabit. In the coming years, it will hopefully earn the respect it deserves, despite its flaws.*** (out of ****)Released by Twentieth Century Fox",7,2,4,4 January 2003
Training Day," Denzel's great!
","[possible spoiler]
If you ever ask yourself if one performance can make a film, all you need to do is take a look at 'Training Day.' Denzel Washington delivers one of his very best acting jobs ever, as what must be the most corrupt law enforcement officer portrayed by a leading actor. The character is not unlike Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle; at first he walks a *very* narrow line between sanity and madness, and to his credit he does a fairly good job (up to a point) in barely keeping himself on the right side. We may not like him, or approve of his actions, but we accept him as he is, as well as the fact that he has reasons for what he does that seem perfectly logical and sensible to him.Some critics have been hard on Ethan Hawke, probably because Washington outshines him. That's missing the point. The Hawke character's purpose in the film is to provide a foil, a contrast to his partner's insanity. They are complete opposites, and it's interesting to notice that while Hawke is more idealistic and 'upright,' he's also a bit naive, and tends to see things in black and white. Washington, on the other hand, perceives the world in shades of gray. While that's probably the more accurate and balanced outlook, he simply goes too far, and pays the price.Is the ending a bit overdone? Yes, it is, but no one will deny it's effective. It was inevitable that his actions would backfire on him. As the film proceeds, he descends further and further into his self-created morass. There is a point in the film where it is immediately apparent that he has finally reached critical mass, and there's no turning back. I was reminded of the Biblical proverb, 'He who lives by the sword dies by the sword.' The wisdom of that statement is all too apparent when applied to the character.*** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",7,1,11,26 April 2002
Fight Club," Well...
","It's been over two months since I went to see it, and my feelings towards the film are still somewhat mixed. Part of me feels repelled by the graphic violence (I winced several times), but another part wishes I'd directed it myself.The film has been compared to 'A Clockwork Orange'. Granted, it's not quite as good, but it sure sticks in your mind, I'll give it that. Certainly one of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate, although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable performance (his best since '12 Monkeys'), and Edward Norton is simply superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY difficult balance to pull off.Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and miscontent in today's society.",9,0,1,2 March 2000
The Others," Solid effort
","'The Others' is an old-fashioned ghost story in every sense of the word. It does not rely on graphic violence, but on atmosphere. Notice that for the duration of the film, the setting is always foggy and dreary, one of the time-honored spook staples. While there are some creepy scenes every now and then, none of it is showy or special effects-laden. It's surprisingly minimalist for a modern horror film, taking the 'less-is-more' approach. When something otherworldly happens, it's usually off-camera; giving us the eerie feeling of unknowable things happening just around the corner or above our heads. Have you ever been alone in a dark house at night, and had the feeling that unseen, scary things were around you? That is the feeling that 'The Others' tries to evoke; while the viewer rarely sees anything, the power of imagination goes a long way. There is an interesting deviation from convention: darkness is a friend, light is the enemy. If we are honest with ourselves, we will agree that--in a way--we feel the same way when watching a horror film; dark, gloomy scenes are just more interesting than bright settings. Nicole Kidman gives the best performance, needless to say. She successfully runs the gamut of emotions, from love to anger, faith to doubt, calm to panicky; all these emotional transitions are accomplished without ever striking a false note. The best supporting performance comes from Fionnula Flanagan, whose quite strength and grace provides an effective counterbalance to Kidman's hysteria. Alakina Mann also comes off well as the independently-spirited daughter. The remainder of the cast turns in decent work. I doubt that 'The Others' would have been financially successful, at least to the degree that it was, without the presence of Nicole Kidman. However, it's not just a 'star vehicle.' It's an honest, legitimate ghost story that just happens to have a name actress; quite frankly, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Much has been made of the twist ending; I won't reveal it here, but in retrospect, it was inevitable. As a whole, the film does a solid job in achieving its stated goal. It isn't one of the horror greats, but it works.*** (out of ****)Released by Dimension Films",Null,0,0,11 June 2002
The Terminator," Exciting early Cameron
","This is, without a doubt, Arnie's best film. Other actors can portray other terminators, it is true-but only he can play THE Terminator! Granted, he's not the most accomplished actor in the world, but here he makes an imposing presence as an unstoppable killing machine. This is, of course, the one that made him a big star.Likewise, it put James Cameron on the map, representing a fresh start after the universally despised 'Piranha 2', which is, as of this writing, unseen by me, and likely to remain that way for  a long time, which is probably for the best.It's interesting to notice that 'Terminator' cost only $6.4 million, yet Cameron wound up making the most expensive movie ever made-you know what I'm talking about! (Otherwise, where have you been the past 100 years?)Putting all that aside, this is sci-fi action in its purest form, never letting up, moving inexorably to a terrifying conclusion! This grim picture is deeply permeated with a feel of impending doom. Watching it, you wonder if the resistance will succeed, or if humanity is destined to be wiped out by the very machines it built.Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)108min/Released by Hemdale through Orion Pictures",8,1,2,8 February 2000
Taxi Driver," Important psychological study
","*Major spoilers*No matter how down you're feeling, chances are your life is nowhere near as pathetic as Travis Bickle's. He is one of the classic cinematic antiheroes. He can never fit in the modern world. From the start of 'Taxi Driver,' all his attempts at human communication are destined to fail. At one point he attempts to strike up a relationship with a woman, but he blows it by taking her to a porno theater on the first date. Seldom has so promising an opportunity with a woman been so utterly squandered. One is hard pressed to imagine that anyone could be so unimaginably foolish. The only possible explanation is that he is subconsciously sabotaging himself. This memorable scene strikes home the extent to how out of touch he is with reality, and his inability to fit in society as well. He does not seem to be part of the world, but a traveler from a strange land, observing all. He doesn't even fit in too well with his coworkers, although they do manage to be civil. In the meantime, his frustrations build up...and something will give sooner or later...Robert DeNiro was robbed of an Oscar for his chilling, multilayered portrayal of Travis. His character could easily have descended into parody, but he strikes the right note in every scene, resulting in an uncomfortably believable portrait of urban alienation. Even at his worst, we are allowed to sympathize with the character; he is not an evil person, but a sick person whose troubles have exceeded his ability to cope. Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader refuse to judge any of their characters, not even Travis. Chances are, he was once a much more well-adjusted person before going to war, at times this other side of him can be glimpsed, fighting to get out. Travis does try to do good, but his mental illness invariably drag him down further and further. He is in the grip of forces beyond his control. Even his failed attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is another desperate attempt to break out of his condition. The film also boasts a pair of fine supporting performances. Jodie Foster (as Iris) pulls off the difficult part of a teenage prostitute with more skill than some adults would have demonstrated in similar roles. Her rapport with DeNiro is believable, never taking a misstep. They are two kindred spirits, adrift in a hostile world, and it is only natural that they would get along so well. Indeed, she seems to have coaxed out Travis last trace of humanity before his descent into madness. Harvey Keitel plays her pimp, stealing every scene he's in, and one can only wish he had a bit more screen time. He gives the character a degree of moral ambiguity--is he using Iris, or does he genuinely care for her? No easy answers are provided. I am not a big fan of Sybill Shepherd, but she turns in an adequate performance as the subject of Travis' unrequited love. Albert Brooks gets the most thankless role, as Shepherd's nerdy coworker; their scenes together are the only ones that don't quite work, but thankfully the whole business is dispensed with fairly early on. Leonard Harris is solid as a naive politician. Finally, there are memorable cameos from Joe Spinell and Scorsese himself.The director creates a portrait of New York City as a desolate, hostile world of its own. He establishes a grimy, gritty atmosphere, thanks in part to Bernard Herrmann's haunting, melancholy jazz score. His visual style is much more subtle than his more recent work, but after repeated viewings the film grows on the viewer. I admit I didn't quite get into it at first, yet I kept watching it again...and again...and again...***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Columbia Pictures",8,0,1,23 August 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's Vietnam Opus
","This is the first time I've commented on a Kubrick film on the IMDb. So much has been written about his work, I don't know what I can possibly add, but I'll give it a shot.Of course, the first segment is the best. You get pure, unfiltered boot camp brutality that glues your eyes to the screen. Those scenes are absolutely wonderful. They make you squirm in your seats the same way 'A Clockwork Orange' did. R. Lee Armey is excellent as the merciless drill sergeant. He deserved an Oscar for his riveting performance.Surprisingly, the rest of the film, set in Vietnam, is more conventional, not what you'd expect from Kubrick. It seems a bit too long and disjointed, with an unnecessarily drawn out ending. Still, there are some good combat scenes, with some especially potent violence later on.It's interesting to notice that Roger Ebert gave it only 2 1/2 stars, but the late Gene Siskel gave it four. I think this is a film that, like most of Kubrick's, really depends on your personal perceptions.Overall, not a masterpiece, but still a worthy effort.Rating: *** (out of ****)116 min/Released by Warner Bros.",7,0,0,17 February 2000
Cast Away," Two-thirds of a good movie (major spoilers)
","In my opinion, it's Tom Hanks' performance that makes the film work, at least up until the third act. When we first see him, he is a modern, civilized man. He is concerned with doing his job smoothly and on time. He romances the woman he loves. In other words, he is much like any normal person.However, that one fateful night changes his life forever. A storm downs his plane in the ocean. The only survivor of the disaster, he must learn to adapt to solitary life on a small island. Tom Hanks does an excellent job in making the transition believable. Before seeing it, I was worried about how the scenes with 'Wilson' the volleyball would turn out. However, I now realize that given the circumstances, it was about all that he could do to prevent his own insanity. (It's not like he had to worry about how others would perceive him)With this in mind, the first two acts are often effective. However, just when I was getting into it, 'Cast Away' takes a wrong turn and descends into predictable melodrama. Helen Hunt does a decent acting job, but alas, most of her scenes should have been written out of the script. In fact, it would've been better to end the film with a long shot of Chuck adrift on his raft, which would've lent it an air of ambiguity.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Dreamworks Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox",6,0,1,13 April 2002
The Thing," One of Carpenter's best thrillers
","**definite spoilers**Next to 'Halloween,' 'The Thing' is perhaps John Carpenter's best film. Although it was a critical and commercial flop when first released, it has since gained its own cult following--not as large as the former, but large enough to convince horror fans to reevaluate it. Set near the South Pole, the film concerns a deadly space creature that infiltrates a scientific outpost. This being can absorb any living organism and duplicate its characteristics with chilling precision. If left unchecked, it may wipe out the human race. After a good twenty years, it still holds up for the most part. It is a simply-plotted but well-crafted effort, generating an eerie, desolate atmosphere, not unlike that of Ridley Scott's influential 'Alien.' Filmed in Alaska, the bleak cinematography makes it seem like it really was filmed in Antarctica. There is an acute feeling of isolation, the sense that we are thousands of miles away from any other human being. It is just them...and it.'The Thing' is a more explicitly violent film than 'Halloween,' but delivers just as much in terms of good, honest shocks. There are moments that still compel the viewer to jump, moments that are genuinely creepy. The special effects work used to bring the alien to life are still very good--nice and gooey, and the fact that the creature makes its presence known when we least expect it only adds to the terror. Inevitably, it attempts to infiltrate this unfortunate group of people. The screenplay cleverly second-guesses the audience's attempts to devise the identity of the creature. Just when we think we've guessed who it is, the film surprises us. The paranoia and claustrophobia is nearly unbearable at times. The creepy music adds more to the atmosphere.In some ways, this is arguably a better film than 'Halloween;' Carpenter's pacing is more assured, and the shocks more intense. Yet, the characterizations prove to be the film's major weakness. Aside from Kurt Russell, most of the characters tend to be fairly interchangeable, unfortunately hampering the effectiveness of the material to some degree. It's still a well-made thriller that is obligory viewing for genre fans. I will not compare it to the 1951 original, unseen by myself. The remake is good enough to stand on its own merits, and many have argued that it is actually a superior film. Whatever its flaws, it delivers.*** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",7,0,1,2 February 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Hasta la vista baby!
","This flick has some of my favorite movie memories of all time.  I am especially fond of the part where both terminators meet for the first time. Awesome!! It was really cool when they duked it out hand-to-hand. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. Nothing I say could do it justice.And don't forget the chase scene involving a minibike, a motorcyle, and a semi-too cool for words! Arnie is, of course, perfect as the Terminator. Linda Hamilton is utterly convincing as Sarah Conner. Edward Furlong, in his exciting film debut, is fine as her son John. Joe Morton adds great support as scientist Miles Dyson. (I'm writing on the assumption you've seen it-and who hasn't?)Other highlights: the opening credits, the pacing leading up to the aforementioned first meeting, Brad Fiedel's spine-tingling score, the blue-tinged cinematography, and so forth. I salute Robert Patrick, excellent as the T-1000! I can't tell you how cool he is. I'll just say you'll be gasping for breath.Despite all this, I don't think it's a perfect movie-it runs too long, and the last third is a bit mechanical. However, the the first part is just wonderful, representing James Cameron's best work as director. Be sure to rent the Special Edition (154 min). It's even longer, but it fleshes out Hamilton's character.Rating: *** out of (****) Released by Carolco through TriStar Pictures",8,0,0,30 January 2000
American History X," terrific (major spoilers)
","One overriding them of 'American History X' is that redemption is possible for even the worst if us. When we see Derek Vinyard as a skinhead, he seems like the most despicable type of human being, as he blames people of color for all our societal ills. His statements are so hateful and incendiary, I suspect even some racists would regard them as too extreme. He is taken under the wing of Cameron Alexander, a notorious distributor of hate literature. He is prone to fits of violent anger. As a matter of fact, even he admits his own lack of self control. All this anger, hatred, and rage explodes during that one fateful night, when he murders a black man for breaking into his car. At that point it seems he is among the damned.However, prison life forces him to change his outlook. He is no longer in control of the situation. He is at the mercy of vengeful, unstable fellow inmates. One of the most chilling scenes in the film is when he is gang-raped in the shower. During that scene we are presented with the unthinkable: the viewer actually feels sorry for the character and wishes him to find a way out of his situation. Thankfully, he has a chance to do so, and is horrified to see his younger brother follow in his footsteps.In some scenes we see him working in the laundry room with a black inmate. He finds himself opening up to him, even making small talk about sports. By the time he his released, so complete is his change that he seems like a new person. For all intents and purposes that does seem to be the case. Edward Norton's performance makes the film completely believable.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",8,0,0,12 April 2002
Gone with the Wind," Good, not great *possible spoilers?*
","The immortal 'Gone With the Wind' is regarded as a classic in many quarters, both with film historians and the general public. However, labeling it as such might be stretching the truth somewhat. It may have been the most financially successful film in the history of motion pictures, but box-office receipts do not automatically translate into quality. The film has many strong points, but it also has its share of weaknesses; being completely uncritical towards it, as many have been, is a closed-minded attitude. It went through several different directors and writers, most of whom have not received credit for their efforts, which may explain its unevenness. The true 'author' of the film is legendary producer David O. Selznick, to whom the movie was his pride and joy.The first half is undeniably the strongest, containing most of the scenes that have cemented it into film legend. One of the most memorable shots is of the camera pulling back to reveal hundreds of dead and wounded soldiers on the streets of Atlanta. The sequence showing much of the city being burned is dramatically potent and visually compelling. A genuinely moving scene depicts the townspeople eagerly awaiting word of their loved ones' fates on the front, and their reactions to the inevitable bad news. The epic sweep of the Civil War is staggering, and for once the story is being told from the 'other side's' perspective. The cinematography and set design is of uniformly high quality. However, the remainder of the movie, while still well-done, is overlong and redundant at times. At this point, most of the story has already been told, so chunks of it could easily have been omitted without harming the narrative. It threatens to become a soap opera, but the stars' chemistry help somewhat.The best performance comes from Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett O' Hara. I admit to disliking her character at first, since she initially came off as a spoiled brat. However, as the film went on, the character grew on me. It was interesting to see how she adapts to new situations; she grows from a privileged, dainty young woman to a survivor, forced to salvage a meager existence from what is left of her estate. Leigh herself is consistently compelling, regardless of O' Hara's shortcomings. Though Clark Gable is first billed, his Rhett Butler character is actually a supporting player; he nonetheless gets some of the best material, and has great chemistry with Leigh. There are also solid supporting performances from Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland. However, Butterfly McQueen is simply irritating as a servant girl.Hattie McDaniel has been noted as the first black person to win an Oscar, and she does a fine job of transcending what could have been a gross stereotype. 'Gone With the Wind' may not be politically correct by today's standards, but it's not nearly as racist as I'd been led to believe. Nonetheless, the depiction of the Old South is still too romanticized. In fact, this aspect of the film is what dates it the most. Its downplaying of issues such as slavery or racism seems (at best) naive today. The fact that viewers continue to cherish it after more than sixty years does say something about its lasting appeal though. Despite these more complex and cynical times, its romantic allure is still, at least for some people, just as strong as ever.*** (out of ****)Released by MGM",7,4,10,26 November 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," A guilty pleasure...
","To put it mildly, this movie isn't for everyone. It's full of graphic violence, strong language, and topless women. With all that in mind, I find it a real hoot!The important thing is, do not, under any circumstances, take it seriously. Just sit back, relax, and have fun with it. Show it at a party, perhaps. Make sure you're in the right mood. I cannot overemphasize how awesome the cast is. Tarantino isn't much of an actor, but he's great fun here. My favorite scene is when he's hallucinating that Juliette Lewis' character is coming on to him, saying something unprintable here-how I wish I could type it! George Clooney and Harvey Keitel come off best. They play their roles as seriously as possible, as a hilarious counterbalance to the pervading goofiness. And you know what? They actually make us care what happens to them!Overall: pretty cool, although even I thought it was a bit much in parts-but that's an intended effect. Movie Fun Fact: Cheech Marin plays three roles.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's Best-A Visionary Masterpiece!
","A profound achievement in film art, where form and content are inseparable. All traditional conventions are thrown out the window, in favor of something that is felt as a piece of pure cinema.Also an outstanding technical accomplishment, displaying that, whatever the critics may say, special effects are merely a  filmmaking tool with perfectly legitimate uses.A thematically complex work, exploring evolution, violence, and rebirth, '2001' is a profound work of art that demands repeated viewings. One could weep at the sheer beauty of it.Looking at it, it's amazing it was backed and distributed by a major studio. Today, such a project would be even more difficult to get off the ground (look at today's effects-driven crowd-pleasers).Not a film for the Micheal Bay crowd, but a cinematic jewel, a gem for the ages.NOTE: For a in-depth look at Kubrick's body of work, I would also recommend Alexander Walker's book 'Stanley Kubrick, Director'.Rating: **** (out of ****)139 min/Released by MGM",10,1,3,19 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," My favorite movie!
","I will never forget the first time I watched this one. I felt quite numb afterwards. This is, after all, Kubrick's most controversial film, originally rated X for its candid, uncompromising scenes of rape and violence. The part that stands out the most is the infamous 'Singin' in the Rain' bit. Yes, THAT scene. I had to rewind the tape to make sure I actually saw THAT!!! I also love the scene with the 'cat lady'. An extremely powerful, nightmarish setpiece, it lingers in your mind forever afterward. The opening shot is one of the best in cinematic history, effectively establishing an eerie, menacing tone for what follows. Malcolm McDowell is great here. This is the one he'll be remembered for decades from now. He deserved an Oscar, but the people who give these awards are just too timid. If I were in charge, I'd give it Best Picture, Director, etc. Come to think of it, it's surprising it was nominated for anything at all. (On the other hand, those New York critics were remarkably forward-thinking!)Even after nearly thirty years, its power has not diminished. Believe me, I know. Judging from the comments posted, even some 21st-century viewers will still condemn the film the same way conservatives did in the 1970's. To be honest, it took me a while to decide this is my favorite, and it's not a decision I came to lightly. Rating: **** (out of ****)137 min/Released by Warner Bros.",10,1,2,24 February 2000
Rosemary's Baby," Doesn't live up to reputation
","*spoilers!!!*Well crafted but ponderous and overlong, Roman Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' is one of the most overpraised films ever, in my opinion. Although intelligent and very well acted, it just drags on at times, especially in the midsection. I realize that the filmmakers wanted to establish a setting that was as ordinary as possible, so that the intrusion of the forces of darkness will have a greater impact on the audience. Still, I wish they had spiced things up with some more interesting bits, or at least made some judicious trims here and there. It's not an unreasonable expectation when the plot involves the devil himself raping a woman. I had a similar problem with 'The Exorcist,' but upon reflection, the latter film is a more assured work. William Friedkin's film had done a much better job setting up the story, was more evenly paced, and boasted a much more satisfying payoff.Speaking of which, the final third of 'Rosemary's Baby' is still intriguing and reasonably suspenseful. Polanski does a good job in creating a degree of ambiguity; is this poor woman really carrying Satan's child, or is she out of her mind? Of course, the former turns out to be the correct answer, but it adds a good psychological layer to the material. The dream sequence, where the dark lord imposes his will on the heroine, is genuinely disturbing. The final stalk sequence leading to the denouncement is actually quite gripping. However, I hesitate to state that these high points are worth sitting through the whole film for, especially in light of today's notoriously jaded audience. And I realize this may sound petty, but I was irritated by the vocals in the opening credits; they were so redundant.As I have previously indicated, the performers usually outshine the often turgid material. Mia Farrow is highly sympathetic as the unfortunate target of hell's minions; we always root for her. John Cassavetes adds excellent support as her husband, who may or may not have an agenda of his own. Ruth Gordon turns in the funniest performance as the next-door neighbor whose motives are much more sinister than we could imagine. Her 'eccentric' approach throws the audience off balance; surely this silly old lady can't hurt anyone...or can she? Sydney Blackmer does fine has her co-conspiring husband, whose facade of goodwill masks the darkest of intentions.In the end, this may be one of these films where you need to be on some sort of 'special wavelength' to enjoy. Many people regard this as one of the finest genre films ever made. I would like to count myself among them. Alas, I cannot. Although I am willing to admit that I just might be wrong about the whole thing, I am reluctant to ever rent it again. Not for a long time anyway. I might be off on this one, but that's a mistake I can easily live with.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",6,3,10,21 October 2002
The Green Mile," Good, but...
","After Darabont's excellent 'Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Green Mile' is somewhat of a mixed blessing. It's a good film, but falls short of the high expectations many people had for it. While comparisons are inevitable, it's best not to worry too much about the issue. They're just different stories with similar settings. Still, one must wonder if Darabont is destined to be typecast as a director of Stephen King-related prison movies.Putting all that aside, it's a good story, to be sure, one that affirms 'Shawshank's' theme of hope being found under the most difficult circumstances. At times, the film does hit the mark perfectly, be it in a manner that is wrenching, touching, or even magical. The botched execution scene is as terrifying as anything in a traditional horror movie. On the other end of the spectrum, the miracle scenes are a joy to behold. Duncan's performance as a wrongfully accused man with a gift is nothing short of heartbreaking at times. Hanks, Morse, and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances.I just wish it was a tighter film. The midsection does tend to drag at times, with some characters taking up too much unnecessary screen time. This is especially true of the William Wharton character, one of the most hateful ever to appear in any movie I've seen. However, the final hour is nearly perfect; classic Stephen King.*** (out of ****)Released by Castle Rock through Warner Bros.",7,1,3,3 April 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Wonderful
","While a successful writer, Stephen King has a bad reputation when it comes to the film versions of his work. 'Children of the Corn' and 'Maximum Overdrive' are some of the most frequently cited examples of how difficult his stories are to translate to film. Granted, there have been exceptions, such as 'Misery' and 'The Green Mile,' that have won critical and commercial acclaim, but these are relatively few and far in-between. As a rule, his non-horror writings tend to work better on celluloid. Still, no one, not even King himself, could have predicted the overwhelming praise bestowed upon 'The Shawshank Redemption,' helmed by a then-unknown director.If you're looking for cheap thrills and 'boo' moments, you won't find them here. Unlike Darabont's 'Green Mile,' there are not even any elements of the supernatural. The focus is on the relationship between a man wrongfully imprisoned, and the inmate he befriends. In later scenes, the story takes some intriguing twists and turns, in classic Stephen King fashion. What happens I will not reveal, but the screenplay is clever at making everything come together in the end. Despite the grimness of prison life, all is not lost. In fact, one marvels at how Andy did such a good job in making the best of his situation.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver subtle but effective performances, making everything absolutely believable. Kudos, also, to the fine supporting performances of Bob Gunton and William Sadler.So far, this is the best Stephen King film I've seen.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Castle Rock through Columbia Pictures",8,1,3,13 April 2002
Platoon," Excellent
","*** CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS ***Unlike much of the director's work, Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' is not politically orientated, at least not to the extent that his later films were. Oh, there's the occasional mention of politics and class division, but for the most part, his film is simply a time capsule of the Vietnam War.It does not claim to hold all the answers to the social, political, or moral issues raised since then. It is nothing more than a record of what it was like there, and that's all it needs to be. I must note that it's more restrained than most of Stone's body of work; it's not that subtle a film on its own, but at least he editorializes less than he usually does.As a combat veteran, he must have realized that the subject matter is best left without excessive embellishments or overdramatization.One way that Stone breaks from convention is his portrayal of the day-to-day drudgery of Vietnam. Much of the protagonist's experiences consist of long, hard marches. He is frequently besieged not by enemy troops, but by exhaustion, humidity, and insect bites. He is given the cold shoulder by the more experienced troops, who adhere to the unwritten rule that the worth of one's life is directly proportional to the length of his stay thus far. As he comes to realize, many of his conflicts will not be with the Viet Cong, but with some of his own comrades...and himself, as well. The conflict has divided American society to such a degree that even our own troops are always at each other's throats. How can we effectively organize a combat unit whose members dislike and mistrust one another, even the commanding officers? This situation will eventually be taken to its worst extremes in later scenes.The internal discord of the infantry is best illustrated by Platoon's most chilling sequence, as the troops run across a village hoarding weapons and food for the enemy. Their leader insists that they are being forced to do so by the Viet Cong, but that does not alleviate the suspicion that they are in league with their foes. The viewer believes him, but that's easy to do when your life is not at stake. The situation deteriorates, almost turning into another My Lai-style massacre, as the leader's wife is coldly put to death on the spot. Right after that, we see a weapon being put to the head of a child, bringing us to the realization of the dehumanizing, demoralizing nature of war. Anyone acting in that manner has lost a vital part of himself, a tragedy in its own way.The film takes the effort to give us realistic, well-defined characters. Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe evoke our sympathy as kindred spirits; Sheen as the green recruit, Dafoe as the three-year veteran; both as decent people trying to make the best of a bad situation. Tom Berenger is chilling as their moral foil, a man who's seen too much and experienced too much, to the point where he can no longer distinguish between right and wrong.The supporting cast members all deliver solid performances. 'Platoon's' only serious flaw is that the voice-over narration seems intrusive at times. Much of the information given is already conveyed--whether explicitly or not--through what's shown onscreen.Towards the very end, there's one odd bit of heavy-handed symbolism that doesn't quite ring true, though I could see what Stone was trying to get across there. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the film is a valuable historical document, a vital record of a much-debated chapter in American history.",8,0,1,20 May 2002
Halloween," Good fright flick
","For the past twenty years, the horror genre has been in a quagmire of extreme disrepute. Since the early 1980's, there have been a seemingly endless number of slasher movies, the vast majority of which were nearly unwatchable exercises in nihilistic gore. It seemed as if the directors have forgotten what a good scare truly is, or have never known it. Nonetheless, there are a handful of good efforts that stand out from the mire. One of them is John Carpenter's 'Halloween.' It's a rare animal indeed, one of the few horror films to receive positive reviews from professional film critics. Time has been kind to it; 'Halloween' still holds up nearly a quarter-century later. The basic plot is nothing special; in terms of structure, it's very much the same as any other slasher. What makes it different? Simply put, the level of skill that was invested in it elevates the material. This movie's no hack job; it's clear that for once, the filmmakers actually put some time and effort into crafting a good, scary movie. The object of the film is not to show an excessive quantity of gore, but to frighten the viewer. The film succeeds in doing just that, establishing an atmosphere of dread. Even when it's light out, you are keenly aware that no one is truly safe. The gore factor is practically nonexistent, but the human imagination is capable of imagining things that are much worse than can be visibly portrayed. The director usually acts as composer for most of his films; this project has yielded his best work in that area. The 'Halloween theme' is simple, yet elegant and chilling, resonating in the mind long after the credits have rolled.Another noticeable quality is the fact that its teenage characters are not nearly as annoying as they came to be in most of its clones. They may not be model citizens, but they come across as realistic human beings for once. The solid performance of Jamie Lee Curtis helps to make the proceedings more credible, its effect is to put the audience in her shoes instead of making us root for the killer.Do I consider 'Halloween' a masterpiece? No, I personally feel that the film is somewhat overrated by horror fans. However, no one can dispute that it is one of the most influential genre films ever. Donald Pleasance does a fine job in the lead, lending a gravity and reality to the situation that it otherwise may not have had. When he says that Michael Myers is not quite human, we believe him. Subsequent installments may have linked him to the occult, but even without a supernatural explanation, we just *know* there's something otherworldly about him.*** (out of ****)Released by Compass International Pictures",7,0,0,13 May 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Excellent thriller/drama **some spoilers!**
","In some ways, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is what pure horror is made of. It does not have the excessive gore of some slasher movies, but taps into human fears in a way few films can ever hope to accomplish. Fears such as being trapped in a dark basement, being stalked by a madman, skinnings, and rotting corpses; all are incorporated into the narrative in one coherent package. This is not a cheesy horror movie; it's a dark, gloomy thriller--somber and eerie to the core, with stark, painful images. There is almost no humor or sunshine; few horror films actually succeed at being serious, but this one does, making it one of a select few along with 'Alien,' 'Hellraiser,' and 'The Exorcist.' Director Jonathan Demme (for whom this film may be the one he is most associated with) keeps this moving at a steady pace, with the suspense being nearly unbearable at times. There are few shock moments, but the taut direction makes them truly effective without resorting to cheap 'splatter movie' tactics. Like other standouts in the genre, much of the horror is psychological.The real meat of the story comes from the symbiotic relationship between the protagonist, FBI trainee Clairice Starling, and the imprisoned madman Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector. In the role of the latter, Anthony Hopkins is one of the most memorable psychopaths in film, delivering a performance that effectively conveys the essence of evil. Like Dracula or 'Hellraiser's' Pinhead, he is not a mindless beast, but an articulate, intelligent creature, making him much more dangerous. However, the film is really Starling's story. Screenwriter Ted Tally and star Jodie Foster work to create a multilayered, complex heroine, struggling to overcome her unhappy childhood. Lector finds her intriguing, since she may be the only true intellectual equal he has encountered in many years. She wishes her assistance in tracking down the serial killer Buffalo Bill; he tests her, tantalizing her with subtle clues to challenge her emerging intellect (there is an interesting theme of deception running throughout the film, as every major character lies to or misleads one another to some degree). Foster's character directly defies the admittedly sexist portrayals in many other horror movies.There are solid supporting performances as well; Scott Glenn is rock-solid as Starling's supervising officer--and a father figure as well. He studied with a real detective to prepare for his role, and the effort paid off; he seems more like a real law enforcement officer than an actor. Anthony Heald plays a pompous asylum head, and he does so well enough. Ted Levine is really creepy as Buffalo Bill, the type of person you'd only expect to see in a nightmare. Unlike Lector, he's not especially intelligent or articulate--he's not even a very good liar, as it turns out--but he is truly the master of his own little domain. His character is truly nuts, and I suspect the filmmakers were thinking of Leatherface from 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'It's difficult to believe 'Silence of the Lambs' one Best Picture; some reactionary Academy Award members must have seen this as a slasher movie. Given the subject matter, it's certainly not for the faint-hearted; there are moments that practically define horror--such as Starling being trapped in that dungeon-like basement. It's not perfect either; certain details of how Bill is finally tracked down might be confusing without paying close attention. Nonetheless, for years to come, it has been regarded as one of the cornerstones of modern horror, and Hannibal Lector is destined to be a cult figure for the rest of time.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Orion Pictures",8,0,0,6 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," Will disappoint Stone fans
","The best way for me to express my views on 'Any Given Sunday' is to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review. Whenever I watch a film with Oliver Stone at the helm, I am acutely aware that he has a great deal to say about the subject matter, and that he is desperate to convey as much of it as possible before the credits roll. This is not the case for his most recent work, which is one of his few misfires. We never thought it could happen, but the man has actually made a film with little to say about a hot topic. He does little more than rehash ancient sports clichés, with the usual about teamwork, loyalty, and last-minute saves. We've seen it all before, often in much better movies. It's still watchable, but also shallow and empty, no matter how forcibly Stone tries to convince us of any deep meaning.Stone employs his traditional cinematic flourishes; rapid editing, filters, interchanging film stocks, and so fourth, but to little avail. The final result is little more than a three-hour rock video. His films have often been accused of favoring style over substance, and for once, his critics speak correctly. 'JFK,' 'Natural Born Killers,' and 'Nixon' made use of the same techniques, but with a purpose; they skillfully combined form and content, giving the films a novelistic complexity. In fact, at times it was an absolute necessity. Not here; in 'Any Given Sunday,' it seems like an attempt to distract us from the tired plot.Is the film entirely devoid of merit? No, but it's still a major letdown from a director of Stone's caliber. Nonetheless, from a strictly technical perspective, one can admire the editing and cinematography. The performances are adequate (with Diaz coming off best), and Pacino's heart-to-heart talk with Foxx, intercut with footage from 'Ben-Hur,' is admittedly impressive. Overall, though, it's clear that the director expended a mere fraction of his creative powers upon this project. Let me end this review with another of Ebert's observations: if the film had been trimmed by the studio, it might actually have been an improvement.** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",6,0,0,15 May 2002
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Solid horror outing (possible spoiler?)
","'A Nightmare on Elm Street' made Robert Englund a new horror star. His portrayal of the sinister Freddy Kreuger has haunted many a real-life nightmare. Although his screentime is limited, his scenes are among the most memorable in the film. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the character.Heather Langenkamp has not met with success as an actress, but she does a solid job here. She makes Nancy a sympathetic character who just might be going crazy. However, my favorite was Johnny Depp, in his film debut. At a young age he already has the charm and quirkiness that has been his trademark since.The nightmares themselves are viscerally compelling. Tina's death scene has not lost any of its terror over the last sixteen years. How audiences responded to it upon its initial release is something I'd love to see.'Nightmare' is not a great film. The plot development is fairly routine, and it sometimes seems a bit protracted, despite its short running time. Still, it's one of the few films to stand out from among the 80's drek.*** (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",7,0,0,3 April 2002
Windtalkers," Serviceable war film
","Plot: During World War II, a Marine Sergeant (Nicholas Cage) is assigned to guard a Navajo Indian (Adam Beach), who's entrusted with a secret code never broken by the enemy. Critique: A decent war film, certainly watchable, but it's pretty much like every other movie like it. The whole angle with the Navajo Indians is interesting, but it isn't explored enough. I think it was Roger Ebert who pointed out that it's more or less a gimmick for a standard war movie. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, and the only female supporting player is entirely forgotten by the last third (leaving me to suspect most of her scenes were excised altogether). These are my gripes, so what's good? If you're looking for pyrotechnics, there's plenty of that. The combat scenes are well done, with plenty of gunplay and explosions. It doesn't quite have the artistry of 'Saving Private Ryan,' but it's still an impressive spectacle--undoubtedly even more so on a big screen. I did appreciate some of the more subtle touches, such as the Navajo soldier playing the flute. The acting is decent enough, overall. I'd give it a qualified recommendation to fans of the genre.Rating: 6/10 or (**1/2)Released by MGM",6,2,4,5 November 2004
