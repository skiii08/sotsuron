Avengers: Endgame," Did not work for me
","The way they defeated thanos did not feel like 1 in 14,000,605. How did they get their hands on the mind stone is completely missing. How did Iron Man get the stones out of Thanos's hand, it was such a cleache.",6,1,4,1 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Pointless movie
","This movie basically is a waste of time and talent. There is no story or should i say the story has nothing to tell. The sum of all parts here is zero. The characters are inchorent and so are the events. I wish i had known, i would have saved my time and money.",1,4,11,23 August 2019

Artistic, gritty, brilliant.
Oscar for Todd and Joaquin.",10,62,128,9 October 2019
Joker," What is with the metascore for this movie?
","This movie packs some of the best performances we have seen in years. The script is great, dialogues, sound, cinematography and what not, all just outstanding. But i am surprised to see such a low metascore. Why are the critics not happy with it? I heard it somewhere that the critics are not happy with the violence in the movie. Well this movie has less than 10% voilence in the last Tarintino movie which was completly pointless as far as the story goes. But yet 'Once Upon a Time in Holywood' scored so well in metascore. Compared to that, this movie should have scored an above 85 in metascore. Are the critics sold to Disney to sabotage any DC/WB based movie?",10,5,10,12 October 2019
