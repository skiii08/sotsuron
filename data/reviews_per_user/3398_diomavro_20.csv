Captain Phillips," Advertisement for the US military?
","Now I did not dislike this movie. I'm a good movie watcher, I don't go in with any knowledge/trailers or any of that and just absorb what is given to me. So at first I was very immersed by the style, I quite enjoyed the perspective of the captain on a big ship and enjoyed the atmosphere in the first part of the movie.However the movie lost me as soon as the pirates boarded the ship, I had no context of why the captain stayed on the deck, why a ship of such size has no guns, why they were the only ship that was not next to the other ones. The other pirate ships played no role(regardless of how the real story unraveled, I am judging this as a movie and not on its accuracy), pretty much all the characters were bland. There was a point in the movie where I thought it would go in an interesting direction(again, I had no idea it was a true story) where he might go back to Somalia and see what the pirates live like(that's why I thought there was some movement in understanding the pirate perspective at some point). But the movie just turned into some overblown sensationalist retelling of how great the US military is... I am not really easy to sway, but I got the impression they wanted people to walk out thinking something like 'what heroes the seals are!'. This military loving is something which should perhaps be evaluated with a more sober eye.",6,0,2,13 November 2013
Hereditary," Poorly established
","The movie does a very poor job of linking its elements together. Indeed you can't even tell what is real and what is imagined because of the way they set everything up (the protagonist is mental issues). It seems to imply that the daughter was possessed but we are not given any clue about this during the movie. It isn't clear if the apparitions we see in the beginning play ANY role in the story or if they are just imagined. Does burning the little book imply you get burned? If so why was it that when she throws the book in the fire the first time she gets burned but the second time the husband gets burned? Where is the logic? Is this explained? Was there a link to the pigeon and human decapitation? Why did the grandma's corpse need to be kidnapped? I thought the mothers job would play some role... but nope. They put a weird emphasis on one of the guys classmates, some blonde who is clever, or whatever but nothing ever becomes of that character, completely ignored. Anyway it all seems like completely disconnected elements.On the plus side the acting and filming aren't too bad.Honestly this movie just seems arbitrary, horror movies don't have to answer WHY the rules are what they are but they do have to answer WHY the rules changed within the movie.",6,5,8,7 December 2019
The Irishman," Surprisingly boring
","Honestly this movie was just boring. No story no suspense just sequential events in history. I'm surprised so many people told me to watch this. It's like a nostalgia fest with sprinkled historical references.The shots are boring, the acting is okay. Like 2 hours in my sister asks me 'what is this movie about?' And I can't even answer it 'just some mobsters friendship with some union dude'. There is no structure to the movie, they keep introducing new characters 2 hours into the movie, felt serialized, we beat one guy then the next guy comes along, then another etc.The way they do the music it feels like the whole movie is just one long montage. Not recommended.",5,5,9,17 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," The alternative reservoir dogs!
","This movie feels quite similar to reservoir dogs but is just different enough not to feel like recycled material. While the focus of Reservoir dogs was more character centered, the hateful 8 is more culturally focused. The characters are a product of their time instead of just simply badasses and the plot seems to have literary value. edit: some clarification why it is like reservoir dogs. It is a finite set of characters locked in a setting with some of them trying to kill others. In reservoir dogs the cop was the prisoner and the snitch was trying to save him. In the hateful 8 the woman is the prisoner and the gang was undercover to save her. Difference is that in reservoir dogs the picking of the snitch was done by gut instinct and character while here it was done by induction(which is less interesting).If there's nothing reminiscent about a southerner and a northerner uniting up against foreigners, a fake farmer and some rednecks then somebody hasn't brushed up on their American history. I especially liked the fake Abe Lincoln letter, something Samuel's character, Marquis claims he needs to get respect, and at the end, the southerner crumples it as a symbol that Marquis doesn't need it anymore. Overall, this is a great movie with solid camera work, a fun script, and doesn't hold back on gore so I highly recommend it. This is probably the best movie Tarantino has released since Kill Bill. I don't quite love it as much as reservoir dogs but it comes down to personal taste.",8,1,11,7 January 2016
Interstellar," One of Nolan's best.
","This movie was one that was totally under the radar for me and honestly I didn't think Nolan would be the one to make a good space movie. Characters: This is likely the weakest link of the movie. Probably the weakest character in my view is Matthew McConaughey, I don't know if he does it on purpose or not but his usual oddball accent is here, its sometimes fun and sometimes it kills me to try and decipher what he is saying into English, and when you parallel this with physics talk at some point its like playing acrobatic board games with drunk people. Apart from the acting his character mostly seems to be static with barely any character progression, mostly just moving through scenery. Nolan was never really the best at making dynamic characters, even Murph just seems to only get a bit smarter without really changing her approach to life in any way(her brother neither). Plot: I thought the story was well paced and engrossing. I was convinced as to why things were progressing as they did, the situation on earth did seem rather dire, though space being the only solution did seem a bit odd and it wasn't explained why alternatives were not viable. Once in space the movie does a great job of balancing the sound to reflect the emptiness of space with the drama that is associated with the mission. Cinematography: I have nothing bad to say about this, I thought the camera work was perfect to capture the scale and the insignificance of human beings in the universe. The planets were well done and the shots down on earth were good fun. Special category, physics: Most of the physics in this movie were accurate though perhaps for non-physics nerds there was a lot left untold about how relativity works. A few nit-pickings, we might not know exactly what happens when you go into a black hole but before you ever get deep into one, you will be collapse into yourself as the force is much more powerful than any organic being can survive, indeed the whole jet-packing out of the black hole is probably not possible. The first planet they went to had very shallow water or at least very strong gravity, either of which would indicate that tsunami's are highly unlikely. Probably the biggest made up aspect is the dimension(going into a 5d world) trip, especially coming out of it as his normal self in the end. Last but not least on the physics front I don't think wormholes exist in anything but concept so perhaps a little more light shedding on why it was there and a bit more excitement in what it could mean would have been nice. Overall a must watch for the sci-fi dudes/gals out there though this is quite a different breed than the space films before it.",8,1,8,18 November 2014
American Sniper," One of the better biographical movies out there
","Now I quite enjoyed this movie I would have given it an 8 but I thought the fact that Clint Eastwood used very obvious fake babies was too much, completely ruined the immersion for me, though this is not the only reason.Plot: I don't spoil movies for myself so I had no idea about the buzz that you see in the media which spoils it for you. That said the presentation of the Al Qaeda make it all too obvious who would be taken out, it would have been much more interesting to have a briefing about 10-12 Al Qaeda leaders and then show some of them being taken out. I thought there were some pacing issues, too much back and forth between home and Iraq, some of it would have been better off if it was blended because there is a little bit too much repetition this way. It is an emotional issue but a director with a little bit more rigor would have shown us the last scene(instead of just texting it to us), that had potential for groovy empty feeling. Directing: Clint Eastwood can't get off the wide shots sometimes, there are many cases where he sets up a good wide angle and then just leaves it at that which doesn't help the viewer associate with the characters. Smarter camera work would have helped us feel the casualties as a greater loss. Acting: All around okay, nothing noticeably terrible I think but nothing off the charts either. I don't know what people are so riled up about, this movie isn't about politics, its about a guy, I thought as far as telling the story well they did right by their politics. I'm sure plenty of pro war people watch the anti war films and love them but now that there's a more pro war movie it seems leftists don't show the same open mindedness.",6,6,20,28 February 2015
Incendies," Absolutely fantastic! One step away from being a true masterpiece!
","Note: I don't know how true this story is, I am only judging it as a movie. I think this movie is one of the best pure drama movies I have ever seen.Acting: Top Notch all around, extra shout out for Mélissa Désormeaux- Poulin whom I thought was totally brilliant, so much so that I won't remember her real name in a few hours. Characters: Well this is a drama so there isn't much variation but there is something to be said for realism. On paper the twins seem to go through a deeply involving emotional journey even though they come to terms with it relatively quickly its still well done. The beginning was relatively slow and we don't really seem to understand Jeanne very well, there is some sort of brilliant but subtle hinting with math(Euler's identity seems to be metaphorical) but its insufficient to understand the characters, only in hindsight, though this is excusable with Jeanne as she seems to be introvert. A little more on the relationship of the twins would have also been nice, as far as I am concerned they didn't need to be two different characters. Plot: Since the movie was rather realistic its just a little bit disengaging if you take the discovery process of their mothers future to be so conveniently laid out in a progressive manner so at to leave the big shock for the end. This is the main reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, I believe some more thought on the timeline elements would have made this movie a true work of art. Directing: Great and crispy camera work with some very good shots. At times the character moves about too fast, such as the orphanage, the scene were she visits the ravaged orphanage is a bit too quick and a little more camera work to help the viewer understand the extent of the war/hate would have been better. random twist comparison: I keep drifting to Old Boy and trying to compare the use of the the same plot twist. I think its more excusable to reveal it in the end of Old boy because the plot causes the twist and the information about the twist is centrally controlled by the villain. Conclusion: Great movie, probably not for the soft of heart though I don't find it particularly graphic but conceptually it can affect some people. Probably a good movie for starting controversial conversation topics afterwards.",9,2,5,3 September 2014
Nightcrawler," Prospecting cinematographic history!
","I loved Nightcrawler, probably my movie of the year(tagged with Interstellar), that said, I feel like with just some tiny changes it could have been something much more. This is a character driven movie, indeed its also a performance driven one and Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job bringing the character to life. Its almost like the theme of the movie is evoked in the way we feel about Bloom, we are disgusted by him but can't help but wonder what he will do next. Seeing protagonists who are this complex and sadistic is a fresh of breath air among the linear and goody two shoes we see on screen. Acting is great all around and the characters are all interesting, developing in interesting ways, more or less every major character has an adaptive role. Plot starts out a bit random, seemingly Bloom is stealing and selling but its not very clear if he is also a murderer or just commits battery(he attacks a police officer in the beginning and we don't see what happens). He then randomly stumbles upon a scene where he finds his calling. However once the plot picks up, it holds a good pace, with him upgrading his equipment and archiving his achievements. He has a truly one track mind and the way the story evolves is perfect for showing this. There could have also been a little more done to link the ending to our world, while its interesting that its subtle, perhaps a more chilling reminder of the ruthlessness of such people rather than just a quick showing of their rise through the ranks would have helped me take this movie home with me.The shooting in this movie on one hand does a great job at making us feel close to Bloom but there are some missed opportunities with the way his deeds are shot. Especially Ricks last scene, it was possible to pull off a much more wide angle with Bloom and Rick fully in the picture to better capture the manipulation. In general giving the viewer a few more distant shots would help us better feel the distance Bloom feels from other people. Despite some lost opportunities, this is a great movie depicting the vicarious nature of news, highly recommended.",9,0,2,22 November 2014
Bird Box," Very poor story choices
","The thesis of this movie had great potential, it is just a shame how they ended up structuring the story. I mean the fact that the movie starts with a woman and the two kids and has flashbacks to the house with other survivors is insane as a choice, it basically gives away that everyone but the woman will die, so there is basically no suspense, you never fear for her life.The mechanics of the enemy are also a bit arbitrary, they make a rule for themselves that the creature cannot go inside houses (which is pretty stupid), bland then are stuck without a story to tell so for some reason some undisclosed reason some people don't instantly kill themselves but kill others... i repeat, no reason is given. It seems if you don't look at the enemy they can't really do anything but make you hear voices of long dead people...so without the evil humans it is lackluster.Anyway it doesn't really cost the maker anything to just give us a nice creature to look at at the end. I guess the point is to tease but it's really just annoying.",6,0,1,25 August 2019
Frozen," Anti-feminist
","I'm writing a review because I discussed this movie with a friend of mine last night who claimed this movie was very feminist. So here's why I disagree: Its not empowering women to encourage young girls to have role models which have literally no concept of hard work and only one of innate gifts or birth rights? Sorry to say but its unrealistic some palace raised rich girl is able to save a guy whose lived in the wild all his life 3-4 times within the first 5 minutes of encountering him, if you want to get rid of the damsel in distress trope, make a damsel that has worked hard to get to where she is. If you want a good role model as a female protagonist character in a cartoon movie, one of self sacrifice, heroism and hard work, try Mulan.Other things about the movie: I like the songs in this movie, though they seem few in number(because the majority of them are in the first half hour). If the above complaint is fixed(aka, make good characters) I feel like we could go back to a Disney classics era with this direction. There are a few witty moments and fun memes(like the snowman wanting to enjoy summer).Plot: A good plot in most movies is mainly about the emotional impact and the unpredictability of events unfolding.The songs help pull you into the plot but after the 35 minute mark the songs are fewer in number and the story lacks any moments with real impact. The ending feels very artificial with some very odd coincidences(like turning into ice the same second you are hit by a blade) and placements.The story is mostly predictable with the exception of the prince being evil which was a cool twist(since it isn't the first time a totally bland prince ends up as the romance interest).Overall: Even though I have my share of complaints, I quite enjoyed the movie overall so I recommend it.",7,3,7,15 July 2014
I Am Legend," Grows on you
","I watched this movie in Cinemas when it came out, I wasn't blow away by it. Every few years I would come to watch it again, but it was a bit of an unconscious thing, I would be out sitting in a café and I would suddenly get this urge to watch this movie again.The movie is so simple, has so few characters, it is so clear, so beautiful visuals that I just watch it and relax. The way in which it gradually reveals the information is seamless and elegant. The zombies/vampires are probably the most interesting of any movie in the genre.I will probably keep watching this every so often but there are some shortcomings, the movie is too short, the last half hour is weirdly paced. I would either make the movie last another day with the new characters after the end of the movie OR I would just end movie with the scene of him becoming suicidal by including another 4-5 scenes before that.",9,1,1,17 April 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I am so frustrated by this movie!
","One one hand I want to say this is the best spider-man movie ever. That is because I feel like it get's the Spiderman feel better than any other movie. The previous (non-amazing) Spiderman movies were a little bit of a disappointment to me because it really didn't feel like Spiderman was anything special as a super hero as his main feat was web shooting and strength, whilst in the new spiderman movies you really do feel his agility coming through, he seems to really rely more on his senses which makes for a much more fluid spiderman experience in my view.On the other hand I am frustrated with how terrible other aspects of this movie are, if development is to be done on the protagonists family it should be done in the first movie because at this point we have lost interest in the past and we look more to the future. I think the acting was all around bad, except for Garfield who is the better Spiderman. The plots going around were a little bit pointless, such as aunt may working at the hospital to pay for his college tuition... but there was no conclusion to that at all, we don't even know if he is going to college, at some point he was going to run to England to be do his spidey thing there but that was cancelled, and there is no resolution at the end whether they have problems any more.Back on the positive side I must say that the story didn't progress in the exact form I thought it would, mostly because I imagined the villains would be more challenging but more importantly, I did not see Gwen's death coming which is always nice, one of my main marks of a good story is its unpredictability(regardless of knowing how it will end).The villain, I thought electrode obviously had psychological issues but perhaps a little more screen time on him before he became electrode would have made his madness abit clearer since it can just seem like he is randomly loving and hating spider-man. The green goblin stuff was a little rushed but its probably just because they are setting up for the next movie. The non-spidey script could have been better and the camera work could also have been a little less random...Overall though because of how great the spidey scenes are(not necessarily the special/visual effects) I still think this is a good movie.",6,0,2,2 August 2014
The Dark Knight," A new and Intense take on the Joker
","Although i say this with considerable bias as i have loved Batman lore since i was 3-4 years old, watching dark knight was one of the best movie experiences i have ever had. I consider myself to be a batman expert of sorts, watched every animated/real movie and every animated/real series. In addition i have also read quite a few comics. Not do demote Heath Ledgers spectacular performance, but the Joker is not what i would expect, he sort of ruins the dichotomy between Joker and Batman. Although Mark Hammil is still my favourite joker, I think Heath's is superior to Nicholson's. However Nicholson's joker was a much more pure and wholehearted Joker, and perhaps Heath would have not performed such a joker as well as Jack. Back to the movie, there seems to be a very strong Chaotic theme, and backed with great effects. The jokers who is well portrayed as a mad dog keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, I kept wondering what will go wrong next. Although Nolan's direction gives me a headache sometimes, especially since you have to decipher how the combat is going from the hints the camera gives you(too much random shakiness), I have to say that it's improved from since Batman Begins. I recommend this to everyone!",9,1,3,28 April 2011
Avatar," Good effects?
","I really went in the Cinema hoping to see something worthwhile, i imagined the story would be horrid and the acting mediocre, but i never dreamed even the action would suck. I'm a big time Disney classics fan, I've probably seen them all a few dozen times, so i think i picked up that it was a derivative of Pocahontas in the first 30 minutes. But somehow they managed to turn such a beautiful story upside down and up its own ass with hippy environmental junk spewing out its mouth. Having good Effects is insufficient, in 30 years, all movies will have that, and this movie will just be a bad memory. The acting is horrid, if that... The best part about the action, is the build up to the action, its like listening to Carmina Burana and just halting it when its about to go to the epic choir.",5,4,7,8 May 2011
Thor," Good fun
","I have to admit I went in with high expectations hoping for better movie than all the recent marvel releases so far. As a superhero movie it was great, with lots of subtle little comic references. Though it did make Thor seem a little overpowered compared to the other heroes. In fact he is such in good shape that I he seems to make captain America redundant. To my surprise there wasn't much action at all, but Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins give spectacular performances that keep the suspense going. I thought this superhero movie especially appeals to those who are always complaining that superhero movies always end the same, guy gets girl and beats bad guy(thor is little different). The only bad segment in my head was the involvement of Natalie Portman, aside from the fact that she can't act, Thor and Jane bonding felt a little too rushed. It would have been better to either give them more time or just have a general 'falling in love with people concept' to replace it. Overall its a fun movie, that I would probably recommend.",7,0,2,6 May 2011
It Chapter Two," Very memorable
","I am under the impression that there are enough scare scenes in this movie for like 20 horror movies, that is a good thing. What makes them work is that apart from like 1 or 2 of the characters, most of them don't seem absolutely fundamental to the story. As such most scare scenes are credible in the fact that if the character does not escape them, they can actually die.It's fun to see the adults come back together again, it borders between the ridiculous and a kind of 'isn't it sad that adults never get back together again when older?'. Admittedly I didn't quite understand the 'believe' thing in the end... it seemed like they had to all turn into bullies?Anyway, one of the better horror movies to come out, the last few years but it's also an unusual one, it doesn't follow the traditional tropes.",8,1,1,19 April 2020
Inception," Good idea, bad development
","Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie, however its not done as creatively as something like 'eternal sunshine of a spotless mind'. Looking past that there was good potential for character development, but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one. I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion. In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end. On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time passes,their real value diminishes.This movie deserves a 6-7 and nothing more.",6,5,8,3 December 2010
Before Sunrise," One of the Purest romance movies out there
","I think the theme of this movie is something to do with soul mates, as its two people with very different lives, cultures, beliefs maybe, who are still finding themselves, coincidentally meeting and instantaneously getting along better than most couples ever will. Where Nights of Cabiria shows the darkness of purity of heart in our world, Before Sunrise shows the light. Julie Delpy is wonderful and really overshadows Ethan Hawke as an actor, you really feel her performance, i'm not much for watching interviews but if i had to guess, i'd say that her personality matches her character in this movie. It's a nice sweet movie, probably one of the most romantic i have ever seen, a movie about taking a chance and a hope, a movie about being alive, a movie about young people finding what they have been looking for... unfortunately the movie does end ambiguously about whether they are able grasp it too. This movie has altered what i look for in a girl, and i'd recommend it to all but the short term attention span kids, not because its inappropriate, but because movies that focus on character development are rarely enjoyable for them.",8,1,2,28 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Terrible Start
","While Star wars has always has its fair share of coincidences/conveniences, this movie uses them at every turning point, completely ruining immersion as far as coherent story telling is concerned, some that stand out to me are: why is the starkiller base unguarded to such an extent that 3 people, without the use of any force powers can get in, why are there less than a dozen Stormtroopers around when literally 5 minutes earlier they had been ordered to scour the base for Ray, why did Finn happen to land within walking distance of Ray on the planet, why was Poe nowhere in sight when his jacket was close to the ship and Finn had landed so close to it(did he land there, and not bother to look for Finn?), how did Han Solo happen to be in the same system, and why did it so happen that the mercenaries showed up RIGHT on time so that Solo would be forced to leave with the protagonists? How did it happen that Ray can pilot, when that is uncorrelated with any of her scavenging activities? Why did the earth split exactly between Ray and Kylo, just on time to save Kylo? Why did R2 wake up just as they got blew up the new deathstar? Why was Luke's Lightsaber conveniently in some random cantina with a character we have never seen before? While the old star wars also shares some these, notice that the outcome of the scene doesn't change drastically in the old SW, while on this one the story depends on it. Regardless of how terrible the development of the plot is, Star wars has always been about the characters, unfortunately it is equally lacking in this domain.Ray is unfortunately too overpowered, she is a great mechanic, she is skilled with a lightsaber/rod, she is an amazing pilot, she speaks many languages and she can use the force better than Kylo Ren within 20 minutes of learning what it is. She is able to use jedi mind trick when she has no idea the force can even do that. Ray is superhuman, in fact it's so ridiculous that it's impossible to relate to her. The movie's only hint at her goals/aspirations is to wait for her family on the starting planet, and after insisting that she must go back she changes her mind after one line of dialogue by Solo and never mentions it again. I can't help but feel that this character is corrupted by feminism, they refuse to let a woman be even slightly dominated by an other character in this movie.The second most disappointing character is Kylo Ren. The initial setup scene for the character is great, and actually already differentiates him from Darth Vader. Most notably when he is being shot at he doesn't make the slow powerful movement you would expect from Vader but does an agile turnaround that freezes the lazer in midair, this agility is already quite a contrast with Vader and shows a sort of impatience and vigor that is unique to this character. He has a domineering presence that is of a different form than Vader. Later scenes showcase this impatience and lack of control through his temper tantrums and conversations with his master, which are all quite interesting. So it was DEEPLY disappointing when all the initial setup was replaced with a reduction of the villain to a whiny goofy kid who has daddy issues and can barely defeat a dude with no Force powers and no lightsaber experience (he only does so after getting hit), not to mention actually getting defeated by Ray. Taking the mask off should only have happened once in the whole film, probably his encounter with Solo, instead most of his footage ends up being maskless, which reduces the character's presence. It is utterly ridiculous that the villain is setup as the underdog, he is beaten by somebody with no training, and he never even tries to use the force on Ray. Yes he was injured but it is shown earlier than Ray is a quick runner, probably due to her lifestyle, and yet Kylo Ren is able to get to the Millennium Falcon quicker than she is, this would imply his wound is not that inhibiting and there is no reason why it should inhibit his force powers. Kylo Ren is such an underdog that it almost seems meant for us to root for him, the only way this setup makes sense is that that Ray will turn evil and Kylo will turn to the light side and defeat her(highly unlikely), this seems the only way to make this setup make sense, either that or have Ray get killed in the next movie and Finn (an actual underdog) avenging her in the third.Quick words on some other characters: Finn at the outset seems like a fun character. It's unclear why Finn decides to escape with a girl he just met before he learns she can pilot but perhaps, having just escaped the horror of the first order he gets attached the first person he finds. But then in the next scene he decides he wants to leave her, coincidentally, the empire strikes just as be is about to leave and he ends up changing his mind, because he happens to see her get carried by Kylo Ren, which is also highly convenient. Probably the least developed character is Poe but he is also the character with the most organic exposition, he quickly establishes himself as a young Solo, and his escape interaction with Finn is probably the best dialogue in the whole movie, which isn't actually saying that much. BB8 is a fun character, though what made R2 work was his interactions with somebody who speaks English. This is one of those movies Star Wars fans have to see but for everybody else, don't watch it.",5,7,9,26 December 2015
Warcraft," Great portrait of orcs. And solid launchpad for future films.
","Let me preface this by saying that I am probably in the 0.1% when it comes to the lore of Warcraft. I have read at least 6 of the books, played all the strategy games and quite a bit of the world of Warcraft content. Contrary to what I've mostly been hearing, this is NOT a World of Warcraft movie. The story line of Warcraft progresses linearly, WarcraftWarcraft 2Warcraft 3 The frozen throneWorld of WarcraftExpansions. This movie ONLY includes story line content from the first Warcraft, indeed none of the characters should be recognizable to a WOW fan (except the baby, if you know who that is). Warcraft has always been a very character centered story, indeed nothing happens without a character leading the action, there is no such thing as X race doing Y. Instead it is character Z leading a portion of race X to do Y. As such the movie should be judged on how well it developed its characters. On the positive side I thought the orcs were very well developed, not only do we empathize with Durotan but we also get a sense of the cultural attitudes that the orcs have, with many chieftains and constant fighting between the clans. As such the orcs are successfully portrayed as an honor culture instead of just purely barbaric, to me this is a great success and something that has never been done on screen before. Warcraft to me has established a universe that has much more potential than the Lord of the Rings if only because of the empathy one feels for both sides. On the negative side I thought the humans were a little rushed. Khadgar, the young apprentice mage had rather unnatural dialogue and the actor playing him felt a bit off at times. Lothar was also slightly underdeveloped, perhaps a little more on his relationships should have been done, especially with his son. Visual effects wise I thought the movie was amazing, the spells are truly epic and there is a real sense of scale to be felt. This is not the fantastic movie I was hoping for but it has no large overarching faults, and within the time limit it probably achieves as much as it could have, it is only a shame that it wasn't longer so that it can properly hit all on the tonal cords. However with the universe established, there is much less world building to be done for the sequels and I am craving for the legendary characters to emerge.",7,8,14,29 May 2016
