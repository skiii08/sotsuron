Hereditary," 'Hereditary' is sort of like two films in one.
","Half of the time it is being what I expected it to be, which is a horror movie. The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode.The only plus point is so good acting as most of this film is a slow drawn out family drama.It started off strong and I was super hopeful. It dragged a bit through the middle, but the story seemed like it was going somewhere. The first hour and a half was okay and then BAM! a whole lotta wtf.I'm so sick and tired of 'artsy' movies. Don't tell me I 'didn't get it.' I got it and it was stupid. If you want to love the movie, leave 15 minutes before it's over and just make up an ending in your mind. You'll feel much more satisfied.5/10",5,1,2,10 September 2018
