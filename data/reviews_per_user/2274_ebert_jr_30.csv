The Blair Witch Project," Way way way overhyped!!
","There were a LOT of unsatisfied people leaving this film.  Especially since getting BWP tickets in Manhattan was damn difficult over the last week (most shows being sold out way in advance).First though, I have to give the makers credit, it's a fairly original premise that has very believable characters who play their parts well.  And I agree this is a refreshingly different angle on the horror movie genre which is not a big budgeted dumbed down horror story with gobs of special effects.  Yes, all that's cool....But the best horror movie ever?  C'mon!!  This movie was in no way, shape or form the best horror movie ever.  Scary?  Eh, here and there, but I never, never once felt really terrified.  This film is totally overhyped.  I laughed while leaving this film as I thought about all the folks who said 'ooh, I'll never be able to go walking in the woods at night again, or 'gee, that's the last time I go camping'.  What a joke!!  I think the biggest lesson here is to hold on to your map, or bring a second.The very end was fairly good, especially compared to the rest of the movie. Despite that, most of the audience seemed to let  out a 'that's what I was supposed to get scared out of my boots about?!' groan when it was over. 
What a dismal summer for movies this is turning out to be.  Just when I thought BWP would be the shining jewel among a lot of duds this summer, it really just didn't amount to much.  Wait for the video release is my advice.",Null,0,1,25 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weak on story, strong on hard core FX
","An orgy of over-the-top special effects is the only reason to see this film if you're over the age of thirteen.  Every other element in the film left me disappointed.  The juvenile comedy, confusing story, poorly developed characters, and just plain goofiness (e.g. I kept waiting for Sam Jackson to go into some Pulp Fiction inspired lecture about the tyranny of men) really left me stunned.  The much talked about Jar Jar character was as annoying and silly as any adult can possibly imagine.This film simply didn't have the magic and wonder of the first Star Wars, or even the second or third.  I truly hope Mr. Lucas will take note for the follow ups and give the adults in the audience something to really get excited about, besides the special effects.",8,0,1,24 May 1999
Deja Vu," More Candy Coated Bruckheimer Glam
","This Bruckheimer gem quickly dispels with the necessary and gratuitous distillation of cracker jack movie physics to explain things to us (how many times are we going to get the folded up piece of paper demo for how to travel thru time?). It's basically soda pop scifi to enable yet another formulaic Denzel-chasing-the-bad-guys movie. Once Denzel becomes suspicious of the incredible technology, the experts (who look like rejects from the cast of Rent) give him the standard 30 second Hollywood distillation of how the technology works. Denzel gets this news of the century, and somehow it doesn't phase him at all (maybe because he can't believe it either). Granted, he's wrapped up in solving a terrorist plot, but still, one has to wonder how that somehow would not cause at least a wee bit of shock and awe. Some other things observed:-Denzel very quickly piecing together the underlying secrets of the technology he's witnessing-Denzel figuring out that shining a laser pen pointer into the projector screen actually gets sent to the past.-Denzel actually carrying a laser pointer around in his front pocket. Is this SOP for an ATF agent? I dunno, maybe it is.-Light from Denzel's laser pointer can go through a display/screen yet anything else has to go through a separate huge machine, including Denzel, who throws himself at this task without pause.-Said time machine / teleporter would constitute an earth shattering news (let alone being able to see a real-time feed of the past).-This huge machine existing somewhere in the New Orleans area yet nobody has found it (despite huge electrical power grid failures due to it and scores of army personnel hanging around)-A doughy, pudgy faced Val Kilmer having a short, meaningless, throw away role in this film, essentially there to collect a paycheck.-The 'bad guy' seems to have some knowledge of a conspiracy involving the government and its technology to affect or alter the past/future, yet neither this or the character are really developed.-The female victim somehow falls in love with Denzel in a NY minute, I guess for thanks and payback for rescuing her.I'm starting to think that all Denzel's roles of late are the same guy. Great talent, but it's like everything he does is a variation on the same theme, sort of like Tommy Lee Jones spat of films where he's chasing someone, somewhere.The last 15 minutes of this film are good. It's just too bad the rest couldn't be. Then again, it's Bruckheimer folks, and that unfortunately says it all.",6,5,10,25 November 2006
Fight Club," I'll never look at soap quite the same way again.
","Fight Club is a truly bizarre trip through the mind of a disturbed young man.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what this film was about, but I did enjoy it.  I enjoyed every crazy twist and turn, every freakish little humourous moment and the clever directing and sharp acting.The violence was a bit excessive though and I kept wondering how Fight Club might influence younger viewers.  Thinking back on the film, I do believe it would have seemed to drag a bit if the violent scenes (i.e. the fight scenes) had not been added.  I hope this wasn't the main reason they were put into the film.",Null,0,1,30 October 1999
The 13th Warrior," Not that bad, really.
","Guilty as charged: I sort of enjoyed the 13th warrior.  It wasn't a perfect picture but provided me with just the sort of fantasy escape I hadn't seen for a while.  Admittedly, I had a hard time trying not to smirk while watching Antonio Banderas paraded around in that silly costume pretending to be somebody from the middle east.  But I enjoyed the epic style of the story, the northern lands that are explored and the evil warriors that must be defeated.  There was good cinematography and some decent action.  Almost a blend of a cowboys and indians western with a psuedo nordic epic tale. Entertaining if not taken seriously.",Null,0,0,11 September 1999
Hostel," Predictable, nothing new
","Obviously catering to the younger audiences, Hostile has some teaser scenes that appear to be over-the-top but are nothing. The plot, you see coming a mile away, and you know exactly who is going to survive and who is going to help who escape. Sets look just like any number of recent horror movies, e.g. Saw (which is in a different league than this movie). One or two gratuitous, non sexy sex scenes with some decent looking women, a couple of suggestive torture scenes and a whole lot of redundant boiler plate plot in between.This was a big disappointment. I would have thought something with QT's name on it would have been better, but this one simply doesn't measure up.",6,0,1,29 July 2006
The Mummy," Indiana Jones meets Scooby Doo
","The worth of this film can be summed up almost entirely in its special effects, which are fantastic.  Yeah, it was a pseudo comedy/adventure, but it's the kind of comedy that appeals mostly to young children.  There have been comparisons to a watered down 'Indiana Jones' (characters, not special effects)  and for the most part, I agree with this.Overall, I'd have to admit though, it's good campy fun and yet another good primer for the real summer blockbusters to come.",Null,0,0,10 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Dark and captivating artistic masterpiece
","Deftly Captures the spirit of the original tale.  The visuals are simply incredible; the old homes, the costumes, and the fantastic music in the film combined to really set the mood.  Both Depp and Ricci are very good, especially Depp with his  Ichabod Crane.Burton deserves a lot of credit for maintaining a constant feeling of atmosphere in the film and for some really incredible imagery.A very tasteful, artistic adaptation.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
Silent Hill," Disgusting and excessively violent
","If I had to judge of sfx alone, I'd say the film was great, but the level of gore towards the latter half of the movie was a huge turn off. I thought the film could have achieved its story/plot without these scenes. The 'butch' female cop character...weird and distracting. What was that all about? Did the film break any new ground in the horror genre? I don't think so, it's not original, I've seen the basic premise countless times. The ending was a let down, as was the trip to see the 'dark one', or whatever. Pretty looking film, great sets and visuals, but just gross, and not worth the time. The FAQ for this film, posted elsewhere, is so bloated with self importance, its funny. Ooh, they didn't die, but they aren't exactly alive...oh, OK. Psssst.",6,0,1,6 November 2006
The Beach," Unconvincing, sluggish farce with good scenery
","What a dissapointment.  Even after hearing the poor reviews, I was hoping for the best.  What we have here is a movie that has a fantasy island soap opera type story centering around neo flower children and anti establishment hippy types, born to surf and smoke dope, where nobody can find them.  Plot continues with a pretentious romp through the jungles of said 'secret' island by a few daringly foolish kids.  Character development is weak; the film uses the ploy of introducing characters by very staged and phony scenes, where one by one, the characters mumble a few lines about themselves, sort of reminiscent of Armageddon and Drop Dead Gorgeous, and move on.I never really identified or felt sympathy with most of the characters. I didn't enjoy the films little hat tip to its scenes vaguely similar to Apocalypse Now.The best thing about the movie is the scenery, but even that did not seem to be captured very well, as many scenes seemed dark and blurry or unfocused and poorly lit, I guess in an attempt to develop mood.This movie had great potential, but in retrospect, it just tried to",Null,9,16,20 February 2000
Lost in Translation," Overrated Gen-X 'Art Film'
","What is the viewer supposed to feel? Ok, two people that are lonely because they're in a 'strange' place and culture with no common frame of reference - except each others loneliness. And we feel sympathy for them, we understand why 'Yale grad' Johannson can't relate to a ditzy blonde American actress her husband introduces her to, why she feels isolated from her husband-photographer who seems to care more about his work and who he shoots than in his wife, we understand Murray is in a mid-life crisis of sorts, alienated from his home life, past his prime acting days and finding himself doing Japanese TV commercials about Whisky, directed by guys who he barely understands. Two strangers, in the night, at a bar, not even trying for stimulating conversation but just recognizing the common denominators in their sadness. They bond, go out, they dance, sing, and drink for a night or two.  They come home. Look out, things are getting deep, or are they? Sounds like a story that happens all the time actually.  And of course, this being an intellectual relationship, there ain't gonna be no sex here!  Oh no, that'd be too low-brow, and what the heck, Murray's nobody's idea of a hunk anyway and too old for Johannson by any stretch of the imagination (none).Ok, maybe I don't 'get it'...hopefully it's not another one of those 'you have to get it' type movies, because usually the folks who 'get it' can't even agree on why they do get it (but there's always safety in numbers I suppose) or can't put it into words. I have to admit, the ending was emotional, but it's not enough in my opinion to rocket this film up into 'top 100' films of all times, or whatever some might be suggesting. It's just not that deep, sorry. In fact, the only thing that saved film this film from being an exercise in boredom is the talented and beautiful Scarlett Johansson, and the backdrop of the hustle and bustle of Japanese city life, which is cool to watch on its own.  And I do give Murray a lot of credit for involving himself in films like this, and encouraging younger film producers, directors, etc, to do their own stuff.  Overall this film is worth seeing if, like me, you like watching interesting movie set locations, or if you're a fan of Scarlett Johannson.",Null,0,0,10 October 2003
Notting Hill," Well acted but sappy love story
","Ho Hum.  This movie just didn't do a lot for me.  I think the true stars of the film were the supporting cast of actors.This film definitely reminded me of some type of spin or role reversal on 'Pretty Woman', yet at the same time, gave Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts an artistic platform to express how their own lives have be pounced on and, at least in Mr.Grants case, dragged through the mud in the public spotlight.There were some warm moments and several funny episodes, but nothing spectacular.  Much of the humor was served up British style.  Best viewed with a date.",Null,0,0,1 June 1999
Léon: The Professional," Great film
","Forget the naysayers, this is a very entertaining movie featuring interesting characters, interesting bad guys and a well executed story/premise.  I guess I just don't get what's so hard to understand about young Natalie Portman's character clinging to the anti-hero hitman after watching her whole family get executed and realizing she is utterly alone in the world, with nobody to count on.  You'd cling to a hitman too - especially one who was kind enough to let you hide out in his apt. I don't recall seeing a single scene that suggested anything untoward was going on between Portman's character and the adult hitman (apart from the kid roleplaying as an adult woman).  Some people need to seriously lighten up.",Null,0,1,11 March 2003
Pitch Black," How long should a tri solar eclipse last, anyway?
","Apparently, longer than it takes to finish a movie.  This movie tries hard to rise above the cookie cutter alien clone genre of sci-fi films, and to a certain degree it succeeds.  It does succeed thanks to its beautiful artistic vision and artistic direction.  But, its artistic merits rest atop a script that relies too much on some very traditional and tiresome sci-fi plots.The acting, especially the transported criminal played by Van Diesel (who has a great voice for the part) is above average.  The special effects have some novel and quite interesting approaches to portraying an alien world with three suns.  Artistic direction gets very high marks, several scenes seemed to be almost framed and contain a certain attention to detail that is rare today.  The aliens themselves are also very interesting, if a bit derivative from Aliens.  Although, we never do get a real clear look at them, but this ends up working well since it lets the imagination of the viewer fill in the details.Overall, a very good attempt a making a worthy derivation of the classic aliens genre.",7,0,0,20 February 2000
American Beauty," A great movie of our times.
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged father whose role in life had been eroded at home and at work.  Times have changed and have passed him by.  His solution?  Simply let go of responsibility and live out the dreams and desires of his youth. He may be older but he's got the money to do it and nothing to lose.  Or so he thinks.  Burnhams wife (Annette Benning) is too high on her own career aspirations to take notice of her husbands midlife crisis of sorts.  Having totally embraced her role as a nineties woman exploring the limits of gender equality while actually undergoing a role reversal as the main bread winner of the family, she is essentially blind to her husband's dilemma.  The few glimpses she does get she matches with threats of divorce, to which her husband reminds her just how much her present career has been leveraged by his own self sacrifice.  And of course, stuck in the middle is the daughter who considers her father's recent behavior changes as downright creepy, especially since her teenage girlfriend is ground zero for his youthful fantasies.But what makes the story truly fascinating is the character of Ricky Fitts, the Burnhams teenage neighbor whose interest in filming the world around him extends into the private world of the Burnhams.  He alone is in a position to understand, in his own unique way, the problems of the Burnhams.  His video recorder is like a key that allows him to capture what is missed by many: the hidden beauty in nature and people, just waiting to be shared and absorbed by the voyeur. Similar to Mrs. Burnham, Ricky's dad has also been a victim to his career (as an ex marine colonel). Yet like Mr. Burnham, he has been left behind by changing times: his utter contempt for his homosexual neighbors, who the film wonderfully portrays as really the only truly happy and normal people in the local neighborhood, despite how society may view their sexuality.Mrs Fitts is just the opposite of Mrs. Burnham, she has been frozen in time, probably a time more familiar to the fifties, and is totally subservient to her husband's world. She is basically a zombie, with none of Mrs. Burnhams dreams or goals, but like Mrs Burnham she is without the essential emotions to understand what is happening in the world because she is locked up in hers.The film doesn't offer the viewer any new insight into life, only confirms what we probably feel or have felt.  But it does so in a manner that's very fresh.  It doesn't preach to us the way things should be, rather it puts a cross section of life under the microscope to be dissected and analyzed. American Beauty could have been a little shorter I think, and some parts seemed to drag out the message a little too long, but the acting, especially Spacey is very good.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
Spider-Man," Comic Hero Spider Man, Fully Realized. *****
","Can Sam Raimi do no wrong?  I left the theatre thinking that.  Spiderman is a stunning adaptation of the classic Spiderman comic series I remember as a kid (who collected them).  There's a lot of moving, human interaction and feeling here.  The dialogue isn't complex but it doesn't have to be.  This is the world of the comic book, the touch of camp, the surreal lighting, and the very human (flawed) side of Spiderman that runs parallel with his greatness.  The dual hero-boy innocence comes through in every scene and it really works.  This is a very well made movie and not pure summer blockbuster eye-candy with a story sandwiched in between (somewhere).",9,0,0,4 May 2002
Hellboy," Surprisingly good
","Had no idea what this movie was about, never read the comic series and wasn't aware of who the director was. I was pleasantly surprised though at how well made and entertaining this film is. The Nazi-paranormal linkup premise is great fun, and there is still plenty of life left in that premise even with the various movies and video games that have already capitalized on it. The special effects are stunning but controlled - the film doesn't hit you over the head with them at every turn. When they are unleashed, the sfx are just beautiful, and the set designs very meticulously crafted and lighting is exceptional. There are many scenes that use a kind of yellowish filter for effect and in the beginning sequence during WWII is shot will a a silvery-green look, somewhat like Saving Private Ryan, but with added unique coloration. The acting is actually engaging and the Hell Boy character humorously written. Overall, a really nice surprising gem.",Null,0,1,3 September 2004
Black Hawk Down," Bad Intel + Poor Policy = Dead American Soldiers
","Blackhawk Down exploits the tragic events of Somalia for use as a platform to unleash some of the best extended fighting scenes of any war movie. The scenes, at times incredibly life-like, are shot with outrageous depth and scale; missiles seem to come right out at you from the background, shots of helicopters feel so close you almost feel you're there, inside, and of course, a whole lot of bloody injuries, gunshot wounds, and lost limbs to bring it all home.The reasons for why the US found itself there are presented in terse fashion, the historical component being largely set up in the opening few minutes of the film, including on-screen comments explaining the situation leading up to the loss of American lives.  After this point though, what we get is a highly stylized 'get to know the characters' session, with a lot of male bonding and competitive angst between Army Rangers and Delta Force team members.  After thirty or fourty minutes, I feared the worst for 'Blackhawk Down', it was looking like, despite Ridley Scott's involvement, it might seriously fall victim to the typical Bruckheimer shlock element seen in Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, etc.  I just didn't need the fluff, the male bonding-Top Gun testosterone crap.  What would have been good is a serious treatment of the political blunders and foreign policy conundrum that led up to the events.  But then, just when I let out a sigh, the fighting scenes kicked in and, almost as if the makers of BlackHawk Down knew it was precisely the right time to shift gears, I get swept up in the action.  If you've seen Private Ryan, you have some idea of what level of graphic violence Blackhawk down presents.  This film banks on its audience desiring action over answers, death of documentary, and it delivers.  Scott's direction, as usual, is fantastic.  But again, this is a film that serves as a catalyst for a war movie, the sad truth is that it really didn't matter what the historical reasons are that created the context for Blackhawk Down. Blackhawk down's war scenes could have been from any of a number of wars past and present.  Obviously, it does bring back into focus the tragedy that befell our American troops in Somalia a decade ago.  And the timing, of course, couldn't have been better.  But we really don't learn much about the real behind the scenes story of what went on back in DC, and the aftermath of the tragedy.  Now that I've seen the bloody but stylized battles of 'Blackhawk Down', I'm hoping to see a quality documentary on this tragedy.",Null,21,38,20 January 2002
The Insider," Overblown,overdone pretentiousness
","Here's what we learn in about two and a half hours:Big Tobacco companies are bad, Lowell Bergman is good.Mike Wallace is a bumbling, eccentric fool, who finally sees the light after having it flashed in front of his face about a dozen times.A tobacco company whistle blower, Jeffrey Wigand got royally screwed for breaking his confidentiality agreement and speaking out on the negative health impacts of smoking.Predictably, his wife will abandon him when times get tough. ...and, we're all at the mercy of big corporations, which are all in bed with each other anyway.If you're thinking that this story could have been compressed into about half the time (or less!), it was, when it originally aired in the form of a sixty minutes episode.  Of course, that episode didn't have the stylish directing talents of Michael Mann, a suave Al Pacino strolling on a dimly lit beach screaching 'I fought for you and I STILL fight for you...', and other tantalizing little moments which Mann attempts to inject at every twist and turn in order to keep things moving.  Indeed, Mann is a director who knows how to stretch a film out for 2+ hours and not make the viewer look at his watch.I guess I could have just done with less cloak and dagger stuff and more documentary style details, like one might find on a PBS Frontline episode. As a matter of fact, that's precisely where Lowell Bergman ended up after leaving CBS over this fiasco.For all Mann's stylish directing talents (who doesn't like those city skyline shots that Mann seems to use so much) and Pacino's shouting and posturing, this film just ends up being an slickly produced, over dramatized hollywood version of events that by now are well known to most.",Null,0,0,6 November 1999
The Red Violin," A stunning, hauntingly beautiful story.
","What a beautiful and elegant story.  So full of emotion, 'The Red Violin' weaves tragedy and music, art and science into something so very magical. Deeply moving and touching, I really felt swept away by the journey of this very special red violin.  Sam Jackson was just fantastic in this role. 
The movie makes an amazing connection between love, birth and rebirth of man and his passion for music and love of life.  What an incredibly touching film.",10,0,1,24 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Complex psychosexual drama a la Kubrik
","This film is definitely worth a look and from a stylistic standpoint is trademark Kubrik.  However, I doubt this film will be viewed as another Kubrik masterpiece or some cult film.  For all its style I don't think it has the substance for that.  On the other hand, this film is so lavishly filmed that it would be a shame to simply try to rate it on a basic star or number scale.In any case, this was a hard movie for me to review.  It's very well done; the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the filming locations, the extravagant architecture, the lighting, the mood, the list goes on and on. However, I think the plot is to some degree open to interpretation.Basically the story depicts infidelity experienced within the context of dreams, or perhaps drug induced hallucinations, which allow the characters to walk a line between fantasy and reality. What we the viewer are seeing in the majority of the film, except for the beginning and ending, aren't happening in reality.  Instead, it's the sexual fantasy induced by the two getting high which acts as sort of a catalyst.  This dream or nightmare like state is stylistically and conceptually reminiscent of the eerie scene in 'The Shining' where Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, is alone in the bar and later has visions of murder.For all its media hype, the nudity is just, well, just really no big deal. I don't know how much editing was done to obstruct some of the scenes, but after viewing it I'm certain it was probably a knee jerk reaction by the part of the movie rating system folks.",8,0,0,18 July 1999
The Descent," Light weight chic horror escapade
","A cut above the usual formulaic horror yarn, but not that far removed from its plot. This film failed to fascinate through hackneyed 'psychological' tension between catty PMS'ing rock chicks who seem to be wearing an 'easy kill' sign on their heads from the moment a line is dropped into the cave. 'The Descent' also failed to deliver seriously scary moments, even though it threw quite a few number of cheap false scare moments into the mix. This is mostly a 'girls night out fright date' film, the 'let's stay up and bake muffins, and watch Descent! Yay! kinda film'.'The Descent' also begs the question, if you had a 'beef' with a cheating friend and both of you were fleeing flesh eating, cave dwelling humanoids, and your chances of survival were hanging in the balance, would you stop to have it out, or would you help each other to escape, then have it out? Apparently the female mind rules the day here. It's not wonder the film, therefore, has no happy ending.On the plus side, credit goes to the creature's creators, set design and other technical merits (probably all created by males). 'The Descent' isn't total garbage, there's some things to like about it, including the Filipina chic playing tough-girl 'Juno', but it's fairly forgettable.",6,0,1,17 July 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Suffocating under the weight of its own self importance.
","I break the film down like this - extremely simple minded plot supported by essentially two or three key special effects scenes, one being the incredible highway chase scene, and a whole lot of metaphysical mumbo jumbo B.S. filler.  Sprinkled in with this is every martial arts move from the original exploited to the nth degree to the point of absurdity, and way past the cheese point of no return.  And what of Keanu's love interest, Trinity? She looks old enough to be his mom, or eldest sister.  This guy is 'the one', and could have any virtual, or real, nookie he could dream of.  Yet, he's got to settle for an old butchy looking, leather clad lady who should 'download' the boob-job program.So yeah, this was not the Matrix II I had been expecting.  While I would not go as far as saying Matrix Unloaded was totally boring, it dragged in many parts, and  was generally inferior in almost every way, save special effects, to the first film.  And all the mumbling and rambling about fate and choice was overkill. Fate, fate, fate, and more discussions of fate. Why don't they just call the film 'The Fate-ridden Matrix'?  And who knew that Zion could be so utterly uninteresting? Though you gotta love the dancing scenes in the caves of Zion - it looked like MTV Spring Break Zion.",Null,0,0,7 June 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Well made but boring and drawn out.
","To help offset the obvious problems with making a two hour movie about two legendary snipers spending untold amounts of time just waiting to surprise the other, the film tries tie it together with a love story, which actually ends up weakening the whole sniper vs sniper, 'my muzzle is bigger than your muzzle' macho plot.  I also found the film confusing in certain areas where it wasn't clear whether friends of the Russian sniper were stabbing him in the back or actually helping him.While the idea seemed catchy: two skilled WWII snipers, trying to hunt each other down, I quickly discovered that I cared more about what was happening in the background, and around these two snipers than which one would nail the other first.  Ed Harris looked miscast as the Nazi sniper; he just came off looking out of place.  His acting was fine but he just did't bring a menacing enough presence to the character.  All in all a worthy effort with some cool sfx, especially the scene with the german fighter planes strafing the boats, and a simple scene where the map of europe is shown (in a cartoon format) to indicate the breadth of the nazi power - I love when they use that old school stuff.  It just could have been shortened, with somebody a little meaner to play Ed Harris' role, and less of the love affair sub plot.7/10.",Null,0,0,18 March 2001
War of the Worlds," Original is way better
","You've seen plenty of movies featuring lots of action but little character development and dialogue. This is just the other side of the coin: plenty of focus on characters while the alien invasion is a background task. Great special effects are a diversion from a Spielbergian soap opera about a divorced part-time father and his kids, especially the son (who looks almost as old as dad) who rediscover their love for one another while giant metal alien guided machines emerge from the earth and sizzle people with death rays and poop out human blood. Despite a strong focus on the son and his apparent desperation to become a man by throwing himself into harms way, little is really served by the father-son angst, nor does the viewer care really at any level. Cruise's acting in this one goes from great, to mediocre to overacting and back to great, sometimes all within minutes.The best part about this film, apart from its obviously expectations-met sfx, is Tim Robbins brief role as a mental case hiding out in his basement. Robbins is just great in anything he does, and this one is no exception. In fact, I wanted to see and learn more about Robbins character than the aliens outside, scooping up people and pooping out their blood.The original film version had so much more character and heartfelt drama. I think Spielberg's come a long, long way in his career and unfortunately, I think I like his older stuff much better.One last thing, I'm tired of today's generation of action movies where any scene using sfx features a gloomy, or dimly lit background, whether outdoors or inside.",7,5,10,3 July 2005
Man on Fire," Intense!
","Violence that might seem exploitive in other films just seemed so right in this picture. And, there's just so much to like about 'Man on Fire', that I think its weaknesses are easily forgotten. It's strengths, like the acting by Washington and Dakota, are superb. For a young child, Dakota comes across with an amazingly mature and intelligent screen presence well beyond her years. Even her voice seems to belong to a older actress. It's actually a bit bizarre on second thought. Denzel is just great in this. He doesn't have a lot of lines it seems but does connect the story with the viewer in almost every scene, often with just his expression.At first, I wasn't sure I liked the directive style by Scott, which in parts reminded me of the way music videos are shot. But the film grew on me until I actually started making mental notes about certain scenes and some nice artistic touches. Some scenes give certain sequences a sort of hazy air about them, where time passes quickly (even for movie time) resulting in an overlapping of sequences where one seems to fade out while the next comes into view, hanging around longer. This interesting technique just underscores the internal struggle Denzel's character goes through. He is the textbook textbook antihero I think, he drinks, he coldly murders 'the bad guys' (and there are plenty of them in Mexico it would seem) after wringing information out of them. There is rarely mercy shown, and his acts would make Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry blush. There were moments when I felt Washington just seemed too nice and looked to handsome for any of this to be believable, not even a scowl on his face as he pulls triggers left and right. In the end, what he brings to the picture is allowing the audience to get inside his character's head to make a connection or bond. Understanding what he's trying to accomplish is easy, together these helps propel viewers through the violence, and we relish, maybe squint, but believe it deserved. The ending was a bit Hollywood, but who cares, he's a 'man on fire'.",Null,1,2,1 January 2005
Bring It On," 'Cheerleaders are dancers that have gone retarded'
","'Bring it On' takes itself seriously enough to allow for a modicum of interest in its characters - something you might not expect in a film built around cheerleading.  But do we really care about what happens to these cheerleaders, whether they win their competition, whether they can pull together as a team?  I don't think I could possibly care less.
Now that I've seen it, I've decided to lay off the cheerleading films for a while.   As a genre, it just doesn't work for me - I didn't care about cheerleaders, cheerleading or 'school spirit' when I was in school, so I'm not about to start caring now.",Null,0,0,5 March 2001
The Sixth Sense," Enjoyable and thankfully scary enough.
","The young Osment's character is extremely convincing as the isolated and withdrawn child with the ability to see the dead. Not a minute went by when I didn't marvel at his ability to really get into the character.  Bruce Willis also shows just how diversified his acting range really is.   There is no doubt in my mind after viewing this film that Bruce Willis deserves more attention as a serious dramatic actor.Despite a unfortunate degree of predictability about this movie, I definitely recommend it based on its acting (by Willis and the incredibly young and talented Osment) and story which could be compared to the films 'Ghost' and 'Jacobs Ladder' yet neither of these were as scary.  Unlike the recent 'Blair Witch Project', 'The Haunting' and some others, this film did spook me silly in several scenes.  I do not scare easily and was pleasantly surprised when I jumped back out of my seat.",8,0,0,13 August 1999
The Matrix," One of the best sci-fi movies in years. 9/10
","Knowing that I'd be on pins and needles until I see Star Wars Episode I this May, I needed some good sci-fi to get me pumped up for the big event. 'The Matrix' was that film.   The Matrix was everything I wanted 'Dark City' to be and more.  While watching this movie I couldn't help but think how this would certainly raise the bar for science fiction flicks to come.On the surface, the Matrix is a thought provoking sci-fi story about a post apocalyptic earth.'The Matrix' does have its faults however.  The ending seemed rushed (despite the length of the movie) and the story seemed to get a little thinned out from what was earlier in the film a very richly textured story. Also, the much heralded special effects (which were, without a doubt, awesome) have been used in television commercials within the last year (did somebody mention 'The Gap' commercial?). Lastly, the movie seems like it could have made better use of a sound track (except of course at the end where we hear Rage Against The Machine at full ear shattering decibel levels.)But there is no doubt this is a very well put together movie, complete with good acting (particularly by Fishburn) and beautifully integrated with state of the art special effects .  Go see it.",9,0,0,3 April 1999
Gladiator," high on style, low on substance
","The first half of this movie you can throw in the garbage, it's slow moving and well, flat out boring.  It's the second half where the interesting stuff starts to happpen.  Even the acting gets noticeably better the farther into the film we go; it's almost as if the cast is getting better as they go along - although, russel crowe was good throughout (but you'd expect that much.)  Basically, the core components at work in this film are its _fight_ scenes, which range from ok to pretty good, but the direction often gets on ones nerves - the camera never really holds on to any one image for more than a split second and instead switches or flashes all over the places and what we get are dozens of little stabs and jabs, flipped quickly in front of us like cheap cartoons drawn on a deck of cards.  The overall plot was also very predictable.  You could see things coming at you a mile away and then cringed when the characters acted so surprised to learn the news.  As I say, the last half is the films saving grace and even that could be stripped down to a much shorter version of the key gladiator fight scenes.The best thing I can say about this film is its cinematography and the Roman backdrops are very cool.  Otherwise, the film is an overhyped, predictable soap opera, with some good fight scenes filled in with a whole lot of pretty filler.",Null,0,0,14 May 2000
