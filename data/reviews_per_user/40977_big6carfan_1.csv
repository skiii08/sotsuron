E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still the jewel in Spielberg's Crown
","I was fortunate to see the sneak preview tonight of the 20th anniversary edition of this film and it still remains the brightest jewel in Steven Spielberg's crown.  Over the years we have been blessed to bear witness to one masterpiece after another, but this one stands out above all others. Mr. Spielberg has certainly made more mature, better looking films, but there is nothing that can replace the touching moments found between Elliot and E.T.  Going into tonight, I accused the director of committing a gross case of historical revision by attempting to make the film more politically correct, but I will admit that I am wrong.  The changes he has made went virtually undetected and the digital enhancement blends in flawlessly (with the exception of one occasion).I have been reminded of what a treasure this film really is and seeing it with a theatre of children reminded me how I felt when the film came out in 1982.  This film is for everyone and deserves to be cherished by all. . .",9,1,2,19 March 2002
