The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best teenage drama films in recent times
","Even if you may not know most of the cast before sitting down to watch this film, all of them will stay with you long after the credits roll. Any movie which makes you think after-wards about it is a movie worth watching, and this one will not just make you think but also make you feel. The acting is superb, especially of the three lead actors. Logan Lerman of the Three Musketeers is incredible as the quiet shy and troubled teen. He shows his anxiety and nervousness with ease. Ezra Miller is one of the stars. His role as Patrick is one of the most memorable ones. Emma Watson, in her first major role post harry potter acts so convincingly that she manages to make everyone forget that she used to play a harry potter character...something which Daniel Radcliffe has not been able to successfully pull off yet.Maybe this film shows what can happen if the author of the book which inspired it is also the director. Stephen Chbosky's semi autobiographical book of the same name is lovingly adapted in this film and in some places it feels as if you are reading a good book. The story is really touching and for many high-schoolers and college students they will relate to it. The music runs smoothly with the film and elevates or depresses the mood very effectively when required. The rest of the cast gives a good performance and despite this being a high school movie, it does not succumb to clichés. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a refreshing and heart touching film about love, loss and feeling infinite. See it if you want to see a drama which works on many levels.",9,0,0,18 July 2014
Léon: The Professional," One of the most under appreciated films of all time
","Luc Besson (Transporter, Taken, The Fifth Element) directs the intense visceral and compelling action/drama of Leon, released in the USA as The Professional. It could be called as a karate kid film...except with guns and assassins. I was left wondering to myself at the end why wasn't this film given even one nomination in direction or acting. Now it is considered as one of the best films ever made and is currently at the time of writing this review sitting at #25 in IMDb's top 250 list. At the very least it is one of the finest cinematic experience of the 1990's. Leon is a 'cleaner' or a hit-man living in Little Italy. He has learned to suppress emotions and feelings and lives his life in a little apartment working for Tony, a mob boss. His life is turned around when 12 year old Mathilda who lives on the same floor and has been recently orphaned comes to him for help. Leon grudgingly helps her at first but soon discovers his own inner child. All the scenes are shot beautifully and the action sequences are well planned. The score works well with the film. The acting is superb especially from Natalie Portman who played young Mathilda in her debut film at just the age of 13. She displays her emotions well with her body behavior and immaculate expressions. She was born with the talent. Jean Reno (Pink Panther, The Da Vinci Code) does a good role as Leon, the mentally slow and emotionally dumb hit-man for whom you start to feel. Making someone feel for a hit-man is certainly not easy. Danny Aiello as Tony also gives a good performance and delivers as required.Gary Oldman does such an intense, quirky, interesting and terrifying role as the corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination. He gives an absolutely electrifying performance and the fact that he improvised one of the best scenes in the film proves his acting chops. The film is not for the fainthearted and the action never feels to be artificial or deliberate. The story, while basic, incorporates all the elements for an interesting 2 hours. It's a cinematic success about innocence destroyed and innocence reborn. The cast show that there is no substitute for good acting and you don't need special effects to make a good action film. While the accolades are missing, Leon-the professional is definitely a cult classic.",9,2,3,19 July 2014
The Pianist," One of the best holocaust films made
","The Pianist stars Adrien Brody as the titular character Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist living in Warsaw, Poland, during the second world war. While it has standard holocaust fare about the Jews being mistreated, you can't help but feel anger and sorrow at the sights of children being shot and piled up in the streets. The story revolves around how Wladyslaw tried to survive in the war torn city by hiding behind cupboards, living in the ruins of bombed houses or in apartments in which he was not allowed to make a single noise for fear of giving himself away.Roman Polanski is in another world in this film. He himself was a victim of the German Nazi mistreatment and harassment as he lived during the war and he makes us feel as if we are too. He deserved the Academy Award which he received for this film. Only he could convey all the intense feelings of fear and depression of the Jews. The scenes were stark and violent at times and at others would bring a smile to your face. There is a marvelous scene in which Wladyslaw is in an apartment secretly and cannot make a single sound as the Germans will then hear him. He sees a piano in the same room and sits down to play it. We see his shoulders and head moving to music and hands moving as if he was playing and we even hear the music in the air. As we start to think that they will surely hear and start to fear, the camera shows that his hands are merely moving above the piano keys and we realize with relief and regret that he is not in reality making any sound, as the music is all in his head. Adrien Brody is simply superb in this true story, playing a man who spends most of his screen time being quiet and not making a sound. His body language and facial expressions convey enough emotions to carry the entire film. He rightfully deserved the Academy Award, which he won at the age of 29 making him the youngest actor till date to win the award. He touches your heart and stays there. His role is definitely one i wouldn't be able to forget for a long time. While the film is about the atrocities on the Jews, and for most of the part shows the inhumane and degrading conditions in which the Nazis make the Jews live in, the film doesn't make one want to run home and turn on Inglorious Basterds while throwing darts at a dartboard with a Hitler portrait on it. This effect was deliberate as it shows that not all who serve under the devil are demons. Roman Polanksi must be lauded for this open minded view considering that he himself was treated deplorably by the Nazis. The story is simple yet will capture you and is one of the most classic true stories and the cinematography is memorable. Its the score that really stands out, especially the parts of the piano. The music is haunting and expertly performed. The acting of the rest of the cast, while it doesn't really stand out, is acceptable. The film is high on emotions and if you haven't seen any holocaust film before then is the right place to start. Watch it for one of the most legendary roles in the form of the pianist and for the unforgettable piece of world war 2 history.",9,0,0,21 July 2014
City of God," If you run, the beast will get you. If you stay, the beast will eat you.
","If you cant stomach extremely realistic, gritty and dark shades in a film throughout its 130 minute run-time, its best you don''t watch this film. As there are some movies which showcase only the sunny side of life and dancing among the tall grass and pretty flowers, this one shows exactly the opposite. It presents the true story of a few boys during three decades, the 60's the 70's and the 80's in the most infamous slum of Rio De Janiero - Cidade De Deus (City Of God).Rocket is the narrator and is a boy who wants nothing to do with crime and instead wants to be a photographer. Li'l Dice/Li'l Z wants to do nothing but crime and wants to be the ruler of the city. The film is mainly about these two opposite individuals and how their paths cross in the city of god where god forgets about you. Whatever you do, you will always get pulled back into the dark circles of crime.The palette of characters is extremely colorful and includes Benny, Li'l Dice's only friend and the nicest gangster in Rio; Carrot, The drug kingpin who goes up against Li'l Z in an all out war; Mane Galinha or Knockout Ned, who is an expert marksman and becomes a hero and a villain of the city. The Score is incredible and infuses the Brazilian spirit and also gives us the rush during action sequences. The direction is brilliant, Fernando Meirelles was nominated in the 2004 academy awards for best direction rightly. He can be said to be inspired by Quentin Tarantino. The film is like Pulp Fiction or The Goodfellas but with a unique Brazilian taste which makes it more interesting. The acting is perfect from every actor, even including the bit-part players. The child actors act older for their age, as they have to, and when the older actors come on the screen, you would think that they used the real deal for the true-to-life characters. The Cinematography also deserves special mention and doesn't let us go into a false sense of Brazil's beauty as the scenes of wondrously mesmerizing beaches are shot along with the dark and poverty stricken crowded slums.The film tells us a story as much as dissects the reason for crime without doing so obviously. The main reason for the crimes and the drug kingdoms seems to be over crowding and ignorance by the government. In this area of Rio, having a gun at the age of 6 is supposed to be normal and crime isn't a vocation but an occupation. It is seldom that films choose to tell such a tale of ugly crime and celebrated evil. The film does have its feel good moments but doesn't try to hide the fact that The Damned live in The City of God. Not for the oversensitive or easily repulsed, this film is truly one of the best foreign language films I have ever seen.",9,0,2,20 July 2014
