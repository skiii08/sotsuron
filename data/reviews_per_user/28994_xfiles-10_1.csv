It," Excellent Remake
",Not a lot of remakes are well made but this movie was very well made and creepy as hell and I don't scare easy. The characters and story gripped me and pulled me in and I cared what happened to these kids. Excellent movie and hope to see a prequel or sequel.,10,1,1,22 December 2017
