Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 1999's Best Movie
","This was the best movie of 1999.  It has everything a movie should have, a great story told through visuals.  This is only a tip of the iceberg as to where the next two Star Wars movies are to carry us.  It is one of the few science fiction movies which has a brighter more humorous side.  The Phantom Menace is actually an old fashion space mystery told with modern special effects.  There are more amazingly realistic creatures in this film than in all of the original trilogy.  It is a must see.  The more you see it the more you understand and see things you did not notice before.  This movie pays homage to all the great science fiction movie hits of the past.  To date, I have seen it six times and never get bored with seeing it.  I just can't wait to get it on video.",10,8,10,17 December 1999
Cast Away," Best Picture of 2000
","By far this is the best film of 2000.  Tom Hanks ranks up there with the classic actors of yesteryear.  Just when you thought he could not top his last film, Tom does it again.  This time Tom pretty much has the entire film on his shoulders.  This thought provoking film is incredible, it makes you feel as though you are alone on the island, you only have the knowledge in your head to survive, and a will or reason to live.  Cast Away is a bit lengthy but you never realize it.  Also the movie is filmed beautifully in both Russia and the Fiji Islands.  I would like to see the survivors on Survivor the tv show live out a life like what is portrayed in this movie. This is true survivorship.  Not even the Swiss Family Robinson or Gilligan's Island had it this rough.  This is a must see movie for anyone.",10,0,0,22 December 2000
