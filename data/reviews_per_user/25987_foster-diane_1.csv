The King's Speech," Superb Film in Every Way!
","'The King's Speech' is the story of the speech impediment that King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of the present day Queen Elizabeth II, struggled with his entire life. George dreaded any form of public speaking, and because he was second in line to the throne, he did not have to worry about becoming King. However, when his brother abdicates, he must assume the throne and begin giving speeches on the radio. George has engaged the help of an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Logue doesn't have a medical degree, but he has worked in the theater and with shell-shocked soldiers after World War I. Using unorthodox techniques and hard work, George learns to speak through his stammering to deliver a flawless speech heard by millions of people around the world.(My Comment) Everyone knows someone who has a speech impediment, and how we try to help them when they struggle to get their words out. We feel their pain, and that is why this is one of those stories that we want to end well. Since the movie is based on a true story, we know it did, and we can root for the little guy who became a hero and his friend. Geoffrey Rush's amazing and outstanding performance as the speech therapist was brilliant. Colin Firth's astounding performance as the stuttering King George VI was just right and wonderful. This is a powerful and deeply moving story that moved me deeply.",10,0,1,18 March 2012
