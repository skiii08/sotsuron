Requiem for a Dream," bitter and twisted
","i havent seen a move as twisted as this  since david lynch's 'eraserhead'... a very good movie it was(both of them are for that matter) and it somewhat shadows other drug or reality enduced movie's, its been a while since a movie came out that actually made you think you were too exposed to too much reality in one sitting .its a very apt movie to what it stands for, other movie's that have achieved this status are in my opinion: fight club ,clockwork orange and donnie darko to name just a few.. requiem has a great cast and some great turns for some under appreciated actors also(marlon wayans and jared leto) aronofsky seems to nail everytime first with 'pi' and from that simple but affective procution to the cleverly edited and suberbly directed requiem for a dream.... top class movie 5/5",Null,0,1,27 January 2004
Fight Club," no doubt!!!!
","now you have to realise the true potential of the underdog. this film does and doesnt demand that you look for the deeper meaning, it has such a versitile appeal that if you lack in brain power there is still something there that will blow your mind .. i am a matrix fan also but you sometimes find yourself digging and clutching onto the idea that someone has finally nailed it, but fight club puts a deck of a mixture of aces and jokers and its up to you to take your pick on the different angles global and local (inside and out) of the mind and more of what seems to be extreme in the world..it has a specific black comedy side but by no means lightens the views and goals of this genius movie...",10,0,1,1 December 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," catching some Z's
","i don't know if it was just me but did anyone seem to think that this movie was just plain and mediocre. it was so lazy and unimaginative, all of these types of movies just seem to think that throwing a clich√©d battle climax in at the end redeems its totally boring 2 hours or so before it.. i fell asleep at the complete mechanical approach to this movie..just what i immediately thought of it, it was about only 30% to Kong.i think it was a bad idea making this after lord of the rings which was over the top enough.its a dime a dozen..just my opinion is all!",Null,1,2,21 December 2005
