The Avengers," Great movie, but proves that 3D sucks!
","I was skeptic about The Avengers. Very few heroes movies have deserved good critics, but I must admit the film is great. Great action, amazing special effects and a script that goes straight to what we expect: action and fights, the kind of things we expect from super heroes. While Transformers really sucked because of spending a lot of time on stupid romancing and forced jokes, The Avengers succeed on providing intelligent, funny scenes even in the middle of war. That being said: I've seen some comparisons between Avengers and Dark Knight. Sorry to say, but Dark Knight is miles away (and that being said by a guy who just liked Marvel comics).Now, the bad part:this movie has confirmed my feelings-3D definitely adds nothing but a discomfort to the movies. I've gone to the iMax 3D just to be sure my issue with 3D weren't the theater. No good: you can't barely notice 3D. I've seen Inception on iMax 2D: it was amazing. After leaving the Avengers, I really desired I had seen the 2D version.After all, the fact that 3d sucks so much doesn't reduce the fact that if you're looking for fun, The Avengers will provide you a lot.",8,1,4,30 April 2012
Iron Man 3," Worst Marvel movies (YEAH! Even worse than Daredevil)
","Please, give my two hours of life back! Iron Man 3 is poorly directed  and with a absolutely ridiculous script. This is the worst spent budget  on a movie since Transformers 3 (any trends with 3rd episode?? -  Spiderman 3 also sucked). Iron Man 3 has not been able to capture  attention or provide a decent action sequence. It's all a bunch of  scenes with no sense and messed up.  The Villain? Oh God... suddenly, the guy can cut steel as butter, from  nothing.  Tony Stark barely uses any armor. During the whole movie, he uses some  kind of replacement armor.  What about the holes? Man, he could have called the robots MUCH  before!!!  Another very annoying thing from Marvel is the scene after credits. You  have to remain sited watching unending credits just to watch 3 seconds  of bullshit.  Man, avoid if you can.",1,54,106,27 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Awful! Complete waste of time
","OK, Brad Pitt did kind of a funny acting as a gay gym teacher. George Clooney also had a couple of good times in his rule. In the overall, the film is boring, not funny. The script is very weak. Stories cross in an artificial way and you can't tell it's a comedy until the film ends and you start to think: 'Well, a drama it's not and I'm pretty sure not an action or triller film either. So, it must have been a comedy! But why the heck didn't I laugh, then?'. It's very disappointing when you go to see a movie from Cohen Brothers, with such a cast (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich) and it still is a bad movie. You gotta work hard to do this. Has been done later, though (remember Ocean's 12?). My advice is to not go watch the movie for its cast. It's hard to believe the actors accepted to work on it.",1,11,24,5 December 2008
