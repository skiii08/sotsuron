Million Dollar Arm," Great Movie, Incredible Story
","First, let me say I LOVE sports movies. Second, it is rare that I give any movie higher than a rating of 8. This movie has it all--and it's not really a 'sports' movie.To begin with, there is a great story. The characters are well developed and the scenes in India provide just the right background for what these young men must have gone through in their transformation. There was more that one heart-jerking moment without ever being maudlin. I was prepared to give this a lower score because I was sure the love-interest story was contrived just for the movie, but it turns out to be true.Be sure to stay for the credits, which has many 'real-life' photos as well as more scenes from India, and updates on most of the characters. I was disappointed to see there wasn't a follow-up on Aash who provided the initial inspiration for the concept, but I'm guessing he/that WAS created for movie.While sports movies usually follow a tried-and-true formula, and this one hones pretty close to that formula, it is still refreshing nonetheless and quite enlightening. I was not at all familiar with this story, and am interested in finding out more.And lastly, how refreshing it is to see a good movie (set in professional sports, no less) that has NO obscene language. Other filmmakers, take a look at how successful and enjoyable this movie is without a profanity laced (or drenched) script.",10,47,62,22 May 2014
The Monuments Men," Good, TRUE Story
","I really knew nothing about this band of rag-tag soldiers before going to this movie, and it certainly piqued my curiosity to read the book and do a little more research. So anything like this that has more of just an 'entertainment value' is a good thing. I'll admit, I was drawn to it because of Clooney, and was not disappointed. It was also refreshing to see Goodman and Murray in dramatic roles.No, it's NOT supposed to be a comedy, nor a WW2 'Ocean's 11.' For those who criticize that there is TOO much comedy, I disagree. The comedic relief comes primarily from one-liners, and who among us is serious all the time? Funny people often find themselves in serious situations and it would be difficult to believe that soldiers do not enjoy--and need--to laugh and be smart-alecks occasionally.And a BIG thumbs up for the lack of the f-word and other profanity. I am getting so tired of nearly all movies peppering (and usually overdosing) their scripts with profanity. Sure, these soldiers probably used colorful language, but it wouldn't have added anything to the film to include it, and really, we need to show young people that you can communicate (more) effectively without profanity.",7,8,13,20 February 2014
John Wick," Why?
","What is the point of this film? This is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. Although other movies show more blood and gore, this is pretty much non-stop, with no real story. I wasn't surprised to read it is a video game because that's all it seems to be--shoot, shoot, shoot, with some punches and an occasional knife.Despite all the action/violence, I nearly fell asleep. I only stuck it out because I was hoping there would be a point to it. There wasn't.The site says I need to say more in order to have this review printed--seems silly, but OK--I DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. IT IS POINTLESS. IT IS VIOLENT. IT IS COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE.My advice--if you are a kid who plays video games, you might like this movie.",3,40,86,24 October 2014
This Is the End," Pretty Bad
","An original idea, but that's about it. If these people talk this way on film, I'd hate to have a conversation with them off camera. A few funny moments that were not drawn from low-class (crass) comedy, but repetitive and relied too much on 'd**k' humor. It was about twice as long as necessary, but I'm not sure why a film like this is necessary. It seems these actors just wanted to party and somehow got a studio to pay for them to be self-indulgent and see how many offensive words and ideas they could cram into their film. I suppose if you live and talk this way, you might enjoy this movie, but I just wanted to go home and take a shower.",1,7,19,27 June 2013
Little Boy," Should become a classic
","This is an absolutely wonderful movie. At times I was reminded of 'Stand by Me' and 'A Christmas Story.' This film belongs with those classics. Although it specifically will appeal to baby boomers, its overall appeal should be relevant to everyone. Children may need a little history on WW2 before seeing it, but the theme is universal.It's a period piece, so that there are no African Americans is somewhat understandable, and one wonders why the single Japanese resident chooses to stay in O'Hare, but the main message transcends all time.I hadn't done much research on this film in advance and was pleasantly surprised. 'Shocked' might even be appropriate to describe my reaction when I saw that it is a Roma Downey/Mark Burnett film. It is not preachy at all.I think I would have preferred a different actor than Kevin James (too familiar) in the role of Dr. Fox, but he provided levity along with MANY other moments in the film, which is part of what makes it so unique and special. I HOPE this film becomes a classic (and a money-maker) because it certainly deserves to.Go see it--and take a hankie.",9,0,4,6 May 2015
Don Jon," Tasteless, degrading
","While the plot summary of this movie warned me that it was about a guy addicted to porn, I didn't realize the movie would be porn.My review could be taken with a grain of salt, because I left after about 10 minutes. There were only a handful of people in the theater with me, and one woman left after about 5 minutes. I was offended right from the start, but hoped that was for 'shock' value and waited to see if it would go in a different direction, and maybe it eventually does, but the constant vulgar language, together with the near-porn filming makes this a most degrading movie for women, and for men who value women for anything other than their sexual indulgences.I suppose there are people out there who talk and behave like this, but really, do we need to promote such language and behavior as entertainment?",1,9,24,9 October 2013
The Prestige," Do We Like These People?
","The answer to that question is 'no.' Although I found the story quite fascinating and overall, the film well done--another great performance by Michael Caine--in order for it to really work, the audience has to be rooting for someone. As the movie progresses, we find each of the 2 magicians and the women less and less likeable. A look at illusions and magic 'backstage' was educational, and I certainly was not bored. However, the conclusion that one magician used cloning was a disappointment as it is impossible, at least in the way it was done in the film. But the worst pill to swallow: although I haven't read ALL the reviews here, I haven't found anyone who addressed the callousness of a twin sacrificing his brother's life as one of them did in the story. And do we REALLY know which one survived?",7,3,5,30 January 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Thin Plot, Lots of Action
","About a third of the way through this movie (a bit confusing if you're new to the intersecting story lines), after THOUSANDS of rounds of ammo had been used by supposed expert marksmen, with little or no injuries, I began to wonder--is this part of the mindset of those people, mostly young ones, who wreak havoc on our schools, a shopping mall, a Jewish Community Center? I don't want to use this as a forum to be preachy, but I go to movies to be entertained and/or educated, and the amount of mayhem in this movie is disturbing, especially given such a thin plot. There are a few twists and more than one time I was jolted by a sudden visual effect, but after a while it becomes tiresome--ran about 30 minutes too long. Even the man sitting a few seats away from me, who was obviously delighted with the first few battles, apparently became weary of the incessant fight scenes.I am SO surprised Robert Redford agreed to do this, and we all know that while Samuel L. Jackson is a fine actor, he will do just about anything for a buck. No one is going to get any acting nods for this. Keep that in mind if you go, and be prepared for a LOT of violence.",5,6,14,15 April 2014
Interstellar," Much Ado about Not Much
","First, I did NOT see this in IMAX.If the director's goal was to make us (me, at least) feel ignorant because all the mumbo-jumbo is over our heads, he succeeded. Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's 'Gravity' and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully.The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters.And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die.This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix.",5,20,39,7 November 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," E Ticket All the Way
","If you don't know what an 'E Ticket Ride' refers to, you might not enjoy this movie QUITE as much as some of us old folks who spent Sunday evenings watching 'Mission: Impossible' on TV.This latest installment has all the plot twists you'd expect, and then some, good acting, great camera work and a minimum of special effects. It's nice to watch a movie where the thrills and spills aren't CGI.Cruise shows he's still got it, yet doesn't steal the show. It's a team, as always.No profanity AT ALL also shows that blockbuster action movies can be written with real dialogue, proving that the f-word isn't needed to sell tickets.For 2 hours, I was taken to exotic locales with fascinating characters, while my mind was spinning and my heart sometimes skipped a beat. Sheer entertainment. THAT'S how to make a movie!",9,3,6,2 August 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delightful!
","Prepare to be treated to another wildly, wonderful creation by Wes Anderson. More than a movie, this is an 'experience' where you will smile, giggle, occasionally laugh out loud, as well as gasp and maybe even shed a tear.Visually stunning, with many subtle touches, the 'plot' is secondary to the adventure and the characters involved, with a touch of history thrown in for good measure. The young Zero is a pure delight--let's hope we see a lot more of him in upcoming productions.Anderson is a genius, creatively-speaking, and his films never disappoint. They are unique, at times madcap, and make us nostalgic for the great films of the past. Who will take up the torch in the future? Well, for now, I will just enjoy Anderson's films as much as possible.",8,0,5,27 April 2014
It Follows," Confusing
","While this movie has some good 'shock' moments, it jumped around a bit too much. There was not a lot of character development, except perhaps for Paul. The film's primary purpose seemed to be to pose the (mostly) females in skimpy underwear--or less.The main redeeming feature--for me, especially if you have followed my previous posts--was the lack of much profanity, proving that good--and bad, as in this case--movies can be made without resorting to some form of the f-word in every other sentence.I couldn't determine what the setting was--everything points to the 70's or 80's except the kindle-type 'compact' Kelly has. I never understood the mom's presence or absence, or how Paul and Kelly got to take so much time off work.Just too jumbled, but you might enjoy the shock values (and the nudity) if you just take a lot for granted.",4,14,85,16 April 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Busy as a Bee--oh a Spider
","While this movie is enjoyable as an action film, with some sentimentality thrown in for good measure, it just seemed to me to be trying TOO hard. There are too many plots that are loosely interwoven, and waaaay too many coincidences.I was offended that Jamie Foxx, the only main black character--SPOILER--was portrayed first as a social misfit and then as supremely evil. Maybe I am seeing too much into this, but it reminded me of old movies, black vs white, evil vs good.The acting, when the cast is allowed to act, is quite good. Is anyone else getting tired of the transformers in so many of these films?",6,7,15,7 May 2014
Prisoners," Nearly Perfect Suspense Movie
","Buckle up and hang on tight as this movie make you feel as if you are on the roller coaster of emotions along with the families--and the cop--in this movie. Starting slowly, but not too slow, this story sucks us in and weaves a very believable but every-parent's-nightmare scenario. Plot twists and turns keep you guessing as you become drawn to and/or repulsed by the characters in the movie, and how their lives and personalities evolve over the course of a week. Excellent performances by all.My only (slight) criticism is that I would have liked to see the older siblings' characters developed more deeply, but that does not take away from the film at all.DO NOT read anything with 'spoilers' or discuss the movie with anyone unless you have ALL seen it.",9,4,8,19 November 2013
Everest," Riveting
","OK, I didn't see the IMAX version, but now I think I would like to. I was a nervous wreck from the moment the movie started, being familiar with the story (Into Thin Air), but this was so more about the MOUNTAIN.The acting is excellent and although the film does not delve much into the characters' personal lives, it is clear from the start that 'Everest' is in charge--no one 'coquers Everest. There is compromise, sacrifice, and sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. I will never understand the need to climb this peak, but I respect those who try and those who make it possible.I would have liked to see a little more about the Sherpas, and maybe even the politics and environmental impact the hundreds of climbers have had on the mountain. But all in all, this is an epic movie. It was fascinating to read (on another site) about the filming.I will never make it to Everest, so this film is as close as I will come--and it is spectacular and deserving of all the respect it deserves--the movie and the MOUNTAIN.",8,0,1,29 September 2015
Elysium," Entertaining but predictable
","Best thing about this movie--Jodie Foster's calves.No real explanation of how we humans messed up Earth so royally--guess we are just supposed to assume it's the result of our evil ways of life in 2013.Whether it was me, or the sound system in the theater, or the movie itself--and I suspect the latter--I found much of the dialogue difficult to understand. There were subtitles for some non-English conversations, but others were just too muffled/mumbled/spoken to fast/too much background noise/whatever. It didn't really matter as the plot line was very predictable, but still suspenseful.I had to come to this site to see who played 'Young Max'--was surprised to see he is NOT related to Matt Damon. Great physical match-up. That part of the story reminded me of 'Slum Dog Millionaire.' Special effects were good, shooting and fight scenes predictably unrealistic. Why are these guys in the movies almost always such bad shots? As for social commentary, I did not read much into that.",7,2,6,13 August 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Mixed Bag
","First, DeCaprio is magnificent and it was nice to see Rob Reiner again, in a 'meaty' role (no pun intended). Not knowing much about Belfort before the film, it was educational and at the same time quite unbelievable, but then these people are genuinely larger than life.I soon became quite tired of the constant use of the 'f-word'--not surprised to read in the Trivia section that this movie ranks second for the most use of that word. That, along with so much nudity and fornication (NONE of it was 'making love') was a real distraction from the story.There is also a lot of drug use, and I CAN believe that went on, but I was uncomfortable that so many people in the theater laughed throughout the segment when Jordan and Donnie get dangerously high. I don't think Sorcese's intent was comedy at that point, but I could be wrong.I think this could have been an excellent movie with a little more depth and a lot less f---ing. Women are portrayed poorly, and we see very little of the damage done to personal relationships in the wake of the greedy climb to the top. Leo deserves an Oscar nod but the film itself needs to go under the (editing) knife.",7,3,7,3 January 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Waiting for Birdman
","Like many of the movies that don't grab my interest (and there are not too many), I stayed only because I was waiting for the plot to fall together, for at least one of the characters to have an epiphany, or SOMETHING. I waited in vain.After a little more than an hour, I kept checking the time, not believing how slowly this was moving.The acting was, overall, quite good, but was really wasted in this rambling story. Once again, profanity is used in the place of meaningful dialogue.I guess I am just not artsy enough to appreciate this movie. Be prepared.",3,42,94,7 December 2014
Godzilla," Bor-ing (say in a sing-song voice)
","I am not fan of these types of movies but I was expecting some decent special effects. This movie is disappointing on every level. The 'hero' has nearly more coincidences than there are Chinese restaurants in San Francisco.The first 15-20 minutes were promising and then everything began to drag, and I mean EVERYTHING. Pointless sub-plots. One-dimensional characters. A mother who appears to love her absent (and possibly dead) husband more than her very young son.The only exciting character (and I am including Godzilla here) is the bus driver--and of course, HE'S BLACK!! Such hype. What a snooze.",4,1,5,25 May 2014
Spectre," Drab
","OK, I'm OLD. Ihave seen the early Bond movies many times but have missed the last few. So yeah, the plethora of characters confused me. I love that the opening sticks to the original formula, big action sequence and then the opening credits. After that, I struggled to stay awake.Spy films usually take us to faraway, and often exotic, locations, While Bond does jet set, everywhere looks the same--brown, dusty, dry.I saw none of the suave Bond, no humor, no sexy banter with Moneypenny. The fight on the train is not only unworthy of 007 but totally unbelievable--is there no one else on this train? Even in the kitchen at dinner time? The romance falls flat as well. There is absolutely no chemistry with this latest Bond girl, who makes me think she was cast because she resembles Taylor Swift. The only redeeming character and performance is Q, and we see far too little of him.A tiresome action movie, a confusing plot, drab backdrop and unconvincing love story. My '5' is generous",5,2,6,2 December 2015
Draft Day," Good Movie That's MORE than Football
","I like sports, but I really love the athletes(or anyone who makes a living in 'human performance')and coaches and managers. What separates the good from the great? Where does fierce competitiveness come from that turns a mildly talented athlete into a superstar? And coaches and managers--without STRATEGY, even the most talented athletes can't win, whether it's one-on-one in a boxing ring or an entire team on a playing field (and on the bench). I'm one of those people that DOES like the 'up close and personal' bits during the Olympics. I like to read articles in SI about high schoolers and college kids and follow them in later years.Kevin Costner is superb in this role, but like some other reviewers, I could have done with a little less soap opera. I really didn't know that much about the NFL draft, but this was almost a nail biter. the director and actors make you feel the tension, the anguish, the joy, and at the end, most of all the HOPE. This doesn't wrap up nicely with the Browns going to the Super Bowl--after all, it's not about the game, it's about the DAY.It would be nice to think that there are more GM's out there like Cistner's character, Sonny Weaver. I have know many, but I have known many more of the other ilk, as we probably all have. And Sonny's no angel--he has his strengths and weaknesses, just like the athletes he is considering and everyone else around him.The photography of the stadiums is stunning and the editing keeps you engaged throughout. Don't think TOO hard about this being a football movie and enjoy it for what it is, a day, a REALLY IMPORTANT DAY, but just a day nonetheless in the lives of those connected somehow, in many different ways, to the NFL Draft.",8,3,6,21 April 2014
