Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Challenging comedy at its best
","By switching personality from 'Da Ali G' to 'Borat', Sacha Baron Cohen shows that he is a comic genius with a great diversity.His witty style with challenging satire does not always go along well with all people. But everyone with a sense of humour, self irony and capacity to laugh at the absurd has the capacity to appreciate it.Nobody featured in this movie can escape from the sarcastic absurdities - Jews, Muslims, deeply religious Christians, white guys who think they are cool but just embarrassing, black people, driving instructors, new yorkers, conservative Texas politicians... the list goes on.The delicate timing is admirable. Needless to say, this movie gave me lots of good laughs.",9,1,6,29 June 2007
