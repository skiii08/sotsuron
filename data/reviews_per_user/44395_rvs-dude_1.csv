The Avengers," The best movie of all time....
","I avoided to write the review of this movie because i thought there were many reviews of this one.In the end i had to write it because i was not able to resist the temptation of this flick. I have seen thousands of movies but there was no one like this.As a child and till i saw avengers i always dreamed of watching all the super heroes together.When i heard about the avengers i always thought the director won't be able to do justice to so many characters.But this movie changed my thought.From the moment the movie starts you are lost in it.Every scene is just about perfect.All the super heroes look great.You will be surprised by the amount of comedy in this movie because you expect it to be a complete action one.I can assure you that you will watch this as many times as you want but you will feel the same that you felt first time.And surely you will want to be an Avenger no matter what your age is. I have been dreaming this movie since i saw it.Why to watch:- The best movie of all time,Super Action,Awesome Comedy, Some classical acting,Thor,Iron Man,Captain America,Hulk,Hawkeye,Black widow and 3D qualityWhy not to Watch:- Watch it otherwise you will be missing a revolution.",10,7,15,11 May 2012
