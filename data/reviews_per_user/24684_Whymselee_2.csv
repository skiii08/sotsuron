The Blair Witch Project," Not a bad idea for a film school project, but
","it should never have been released as a major motion picture.
It was a small, albeit creative, idea that through hype and manipulation was unleashed on an unsuspecting public. This film isn't masterful for its horror or suspense, but for its manipulation of the public at large. It's important for its 'scam' effect.The most that can be said of this movie is that it is a boring, obscenity laden, story of 3 nitwits lost in the woods. That's it! And it was never truly scary, although it did have a creepy moment or two in it.
The characters were completely unlikable and unsympathetic, and I kept hoping the witch would get them sooner, rather then later.
For masterful suspense, try Hitchcock. If you want to feel ripped-off and a victim of a great hype machine, see this film instead.",1,2,3,19 November 1999
The Matrix," The Matrix must be seen in theaters to be appreciated!
","This stylish, hip film is a must see for anyone who loves movies. The Wachowski brothers deliver a tour-de-force of slick appeal which pays homage to everything from 'Alice in Wonderland' to 'The Terminator.' Keanu Reeves delivers a fine performance along the lines of his work in 'Speed.' Carrie-Anne Moss makes the perfect freedom fighter alongside him, and no-one is cooler then Laurence Fishburne. The special effects are PHENOMENAL, the soundtrack loud, but useful, and the amazing fight sequences are not to be missed.",10,0,0,7 April 1999
