Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a half-bad movie
","It was not the best thing to come our way during the year, but then again, in my opinion, Star Wars really wasn't that great in the first place. The movie was clearly aimed too young for its core fan base, and it spent too much time focused on the pod race and Jar Jar's antics, but on the whole it offered enough excitement to be enjoyable. Every time someone switched on a lightsaber things picked up, especially the open battle and the final duel. However, I know I've seen Trainspotting a few too many times after I started wondering when Begbie would jump in and pummel Obi Wan for hanging out with a loser like Jar Jar.",7,0,0,19 January 2000
Unbreakable," Cool Beans
","I thought this was a great movie. Comparisons to Sixth Sense are inevitable but pointless. I think this movie stands on its own and has its own unique charm.The film enjoys showing us without cramming it down our throats. Many points of the story are told without dialogue, and often with simple actions that speak volumes about what is left unshown. The movie is slow, mute, and moody. The elements of supernaturality are taken very slowly and believably. There are no pyrotechnics at all. This is a first-rate movie that has respect for the intelligence of its audience and a genuine interest in its characters and story.",Null,0,0,25 November 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Icky
","Man, they had some really cool elements in this movie. The art design and cinematography were great, and the idea of pitting a rag-tag crew of space-pirates against the Aliens has a comic-booky appeal. However, either this crazy French director or the revising screenwriters got WAY too obsessed with the bizarre and the disgusting. The botched-clone room was TOTALLY unnecessary and the ending was down-right awful. They also killed off one of my favorite unknown actors way too early. They had a good thing going, but they screwed it up along the way.",6,0,0,12 January 2000
The 13th Warrior," Not ashamed to say I enjoyed it
","I can't understand why people were so down on this movie. It found its way onto more than a few Worst of the Year lists and was generally ignored by the public.I enjoyed Crichton's book and the movie was quite faithful to it. Some parts regarding the eaters of the dead were a little silly, but hey, no more so than most of the stuff we're expected to buy from any other movie.
On the whole, it was genuinely funny and the sword-fighting action quality was a treat after countless Hercules cheese-fests. I was also totally satisfied with the way the movie handled the language problem. Although I wondered how Antonio learned the viking word for 'grape,' once again, a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way. This isn't a historical drama here, folks, but it is a satisfying two hours.",8,0,0,12 January 2000
The Fifth Element," Sit back and enjoy (spoilers)
","Very stylish and visually appealing, with a silly, tongue-in-cheek humor, and some good old-fashion over-the-top action. Why bother getting worked up over the details? The earth is doomed by some big giant evil? What evil? Who cares, its big and bad. The main hero just happens to be a super-duper gunfighter with so many medals and honors the list spills onto the floor? Sure, why not? The fifth element turns out to be a french super-model who spends most of the movie taking off her scant costume? I'm all for it! The hero's sidekick is the most prissy, effeminate fop ever put onto film? You bet! Gary Oldman's bizarre southern accent, a 7 1/2 foot tall President of the World, a remote-controlled cockroach, the list goes on. If you don't like the action, like the visuals. Don't like the visuals? Listen to the music. Don't like music? Like the humor. Don't like the humor? Ogle Milla. Don't like Milla? Ogle Bruce. There's something for everyone I tell ya.",9,0,1,18 January 2000
Blade," Could have been more interesting
","Although Blade was far superior to Vampires, which came out around the same time, it was lacking in some areas. Blade is clearly a comic-book super-hero movie, fixating almost totally on Blade's inner struggle and total supremacy over his enemies. You can only watch so many Faceless Guys in Black Jackets and Knit-Caps get pummeled before it gets tedious. The action is clearly in the 'Boss Man stands on a table and bad guys throw themselves at him to be killed one at a time' which I've always found inferior to more realistic, down-and-dirty action. I kinda wanted the camera to move over a few feet to reveal the Nameless Baddie Geneterator that spews out the cannon fodder. I would have liked to see the Vampires get a little more personality. Instead we have the Wise-Cracking Vampire, the Sexy Vampire, and a whole bunch of Stoic Vampires.However, Blade has some pretty good choreography, and Wesley Snipes knows his stuff, though I thought it was more than a little homo-erotic the way the camera focuses so lovingly on his massive pecs. All in all, Blade does have a generous amount of moments that make you say 'Hey, that's pretty cool,' so its worth a viewing.",7,0,1,23 January 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," Response to criticism
","I'm not too surprised someone could not like this movie, since it is very violent and features characters with questionable morals. I'd like to respond to them. Leon: Yes he's an assassin. Is he a 'good' man? The thing with Leon seems to be that he really a child. He does his job with such detached efficiency that the viewer has to doubt whether he really understand what he is doing. His paternal affection for a plant and his love of old cinema hint at an innocence that is somehow protected from his violent acts, and could in some strange way be the cause of his unnatural skill in his job. While Gary Oldman snarls and dances as he kills, Reno is just pulling a trigger. Are we supposed to like him? Is he a hero? Leon is what we call an Antihero. That is, a main character of the story with flaws or questionable morals. The movie challenges us to accept the enigma that is Leon, not necessary like him. Matilda: Contrasting Leon in almost every way, there is Matilda. A young girl who is wise to the ways of the world, she wants to kill. Leon is the real child, an innocent, and the one with the power to kill. Matilda is also just coming into puberty. Don't tell me that when young boys hit puberty they don't want to look at dirty little pictures of adult women. Why would girl's infatuation be different? Her infatuation is more than a crush, she lusts his power to kill as well. Her blase reaction to Leon's preffsion 'Cool' is not a battlecry for young middle-schoolers to start taking sharp-shooting classes in anticipation of a future career in contract killing, it is a jarring reminder that Matilda's life has been tainted with violence, that she now craves it and wants to be able to inflict it.Leon's tutalege isn't moral. Leon is trying to be a parental figure, but killing is the only thing he knows. Its a twisted father-daughter relationship, founded on the promise of violence and complicated by sexual tension. Anyone who claims there is no sexual tension between the two is lying or blind. Is this crush glorified as cool and hip? Heck no. The clerk reacts in surprise and disgust, and Leon clearly sees himself as a father figure. Despite all of this baggage, a bond developes between the two, perhaps because they are two halves of a whole person. Together they are one. Well anyway, this is all just my reaction to the movie. If you look a little closer, I'm sure you'll realize that this movie is not trumpeting 'Have sex with older men with big sniper rifles!'",10,0,2,24 January 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," this should never have been made
","Tarantino must have been really bored one weekend when he wrote this trash. Unfortunately he later realized that anything he stuck his name to would make some money, so he dug it out and let people make it.
Bad bad bad!Before the vampires pop up the movie is like a cheap rehash of Reservoir Dogs with gun violence, a dark torture-death, and witty banter. Then it seems Tarantino squatted behind some bushes and used the remaining script pages as Charmins, because the the next two thirds of the movie felt like a group of wild monkeys throwing their own feces onto the screen.",2,2,5,1 March 2000
Titanic," Yuck!
","I can't understand why this movie is so big. Was the American public asking itself 'Well I love cliched tragic love stories, and I love cliched stories with lots of WATER in them, why can't they combine the cliches of tragic love and water into one bloated, overblown blockbuster?'I myself never pondered this question, and thus I did not enjoy Titanic.",1,3,12,11 January 2000
Braveheart," How could this not be your favorite movie?
","Quite simply this movie has everything one could ever want in a movie. It is my all time favorite. The battle scenes and the score are too high-points, but still don't overshadow the many other themes. It also has the added bonus of making you think in a Scottish accent after watching it the whole way through.",10,2,4,9 January 2000
