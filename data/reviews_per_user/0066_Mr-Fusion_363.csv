The Rock," Kinda wish I saw this in the Summer of '96
","Michael Bay is not my cup of tea. Not to disparage the man, he just doesn't usually make my kind of movie. But 'The Rock' is fortified with such an ironclad cast and an abnormally (for Bay movies) decent script that the usual Bay idiosyncrasies (the histrionic 360 degree slow pan, the larger-than-life low angles, etc) didn't kill my overall enjoyment of the piece.Connery, Cage and especially Harris were exceptionally cast, along with a list of supporting players that's nothing to sneeze at. And the script keeps us moving through one huge set piece after another (mercifully spending minimal time on a lousy romance).Aside from a car chase that was better left deleted (a dizzying frenzy of whip pans with no sense of geography is no way to cut a chase scene), it's certainly Bay's most substantive contribution to the action genre.Also, I have to admit: Connery's 'Welcome to The Rock' moment was pretty badass.7/10",7,3,4,30 March 2012
The Blair Witch Project," Don't feel bad if you root for the witch. I didn't
","Give 'The Blair Witch Project' credit for its proto-viral marketing, but that's about it. This is a lousy horror movie. Actually, I take that back, this movie *is* its the marketing campaign; a crafty PR pitch involving eyesore camera-work and incessant screaming. I mean, without the mystique of that urban legend, there's nothing here. It's beyond me what exactly blew me away in the theater, but that obnoxious cast is torture. Maybe it's just an easy target for the found footage genre it helped ignite (a genre I can do without), but as an adult, all I really wanted to do was wring these kids' necks. That's never good.4/10",4,1,2,13 November 2017
Despicable Me 2," Genuinely lovable; a worthy sequel, consistent jokes and that same sense of humor from the first movie
","Despite the great voice talent involved, DESPICABLE ME 2 is really about the minions. The lion's share of the film's laughs come from them, and they are its comedic muscle. It's not hard to see that the little yellow Twinkies are the franchise's marketing bread and butter, but they're so shot up with personality and Three Stooges violence, that that's not at all a bad thing. And the laughs haven't diminished with each subsequent viewing. The movie has me in stitches at every turn, and it does feature one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema ('Bee-do bee-do bee-do). Not to mention the singularly most infectious pop song in 30 years ('Happy'), and the 21 Fart Gun Salute, which I can only hope to arrange for my funeral. Regardless of where they go for the next movie (straight-up sequel or a full-on Minions movie), I say bring it on. I love this series, and DESPICABLE ME 2 does not disappoint.8/10",8,0,1,17 August 2014
Saturday Night Fever," Disco: The Movie!
","There is surprisingly more to 'Saturday Night Fever' than just John Travolta in the white suit rocking out to the Bee Gees (you see some iconic images over time, they sort of symbolize the movie, what can I say?). We can all identify with these youthful fears of a dead-end job, a go-nowhere life, and that came through extremely well. And I love his meathead line delivery. But the scenes with Travolta and his friends, their woman hating (it's ugly), that all lost me. And it makes up a substantial part of the running time.So, 'Saturday Night Fever' . . . well, it kinda is all about the dancing. That's what it does best. The energetic dancefloor scenes, awesome soundtrack - it's flashy, calculated fun.A star-making movie if ever there was one. And talk about that opening credits strut; he owned those streets. 7/10",7,0,1,16 August 2015
The Avengers," It's an unlikely movie, but they pulled it off
","Tying all of the various Marvel movie threads together is a tall order, and 'The Avengers' does a pretty fine job of that. Chief among the movie's strengths is that everyone who headlined their own movies gets some time in the sun, and that's . . . well, that's just impressive. And despite the dull NYC 'big finale', there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room. When the egos and styles clash, Whedon's rhythms and sense of humor blossom.But it does its job admirably, and lends itself to serious popcorn-munching.7/10",7,3,7,6 May 2015
Blade Runner 2049," A worthy entry indeed
","I guess the big question here is, 'Does Blade Runner 2049 live up to the massive hype?' Yeah, it does. In more ways than one. More important than the question of why this exists in the first place are those of a more specific nature: the whereabouts of Rick Deckard, and what happened to Rachael? And part of the reason why I love this movie is because it very purposefully answers those questions. The other reason is that it isn't short on mood and atmosphere, something the first movie is explicitly known for. This is a another nightmarish futurescape; the environment's haywire, humanity scrapes out a living, and it's usually just ghastly. Yet it's stylish enough get sucked in and admire the visuals. Ignore the orange-and-teal action movie of the marketing campaign; this is every bit a methodical Blade Runner film. And that running time is justified; the pacing is perfect for this story. It's well-constructed and surprisingly thoughtful. As acting goes, the cast is ideal (even Jared Leto), and you've gotta hand it to Robin Wright for making the most of a thankless role. But Harrison Ford is in another league entirely. You can feel the character's bitterness and resentment, and I think it's some of the best work in his later years.If I have one gripe, it's the music. You can easily tell where Hans Zimmer comes in, and it feels like a sledgehammer taken to the soundscape they were trying to create. But I'll take it. I've seen this movie twice in the last week, and I'd like to do it again. Even with the callbacks, this rises above fan service. Factoring in the bit parts with characters from the first movie (pleasant surprises), they really went out of their way to address what happened in 2019 while creating a brand new 2049. It's a great movie.8/10",8,2,7,31 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Revenge gets complicated
","'Kill Bill Vol. 2' has a lot of explaining to do, and it makes sense that it's the Western half of Tarantino's opus. It feels sprawled out, taking its sweet time in getting to The Bride's backstory. Boring? God, no, but the tempo is more leisurely. Less bloody than the first half, this is certainly the more vicious of the two. It's here that we get to see Beatrix's brutal training at the hands of Pai Mei, the love story that develops between herself and Bill, and the even more gruesome hurdles that stand between her and sweet revenge. The big surprise is that it's not all violence; there's a sweetness at the center of all of this.It's not as flashy and exciting as Vol. 1, but it gives substance to her bloodthirst and really does stand as a worthy payoff.8/10",8,1,2,16 February 2017
Scarface," Lays it on pretty thick
","Walking away from 'Scarface', I can't shake the feeling this is an operatic comment on the American dream, by way of a gangster movie at least; that an immigrant can climb his way from societal dreg to drug kingpin and get the girl on the way. That's powerful cinematic stuff, and I can appreciate that. I guess my problem is in the execution; Pacino's cartoonish performance, the drawn-out narrative, the unbelievably overbearing score. It's got a good cast and the personnel behind the camera is accomplished, but subtlety and nuance are not its virtues. Which I guess is the point, but it gets old after a while.'Scarface' has quite the influential legacy (particularly 'Miami Vice' and Rockstar Games), and for that I'm grateful. But this is not for me.5/10",5,12,21,4 August 2013
Frost_Nixon," Who knows how accurate it is, but entertaining all the same
","'Frost/Nixon' was a curiosity for me; for one, I wanted to see Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, and the other reason is just to see how they'd distilled so many hours of interviews into a two-hour running time. I've never seen the original footage, so I can't speak to the film's accuracy, but it makes for great Hollywood dramatization nonetheless. Ron Howard frames it as a boxing match; an inexperienced journalist facing a veteran who knows how to run rungs around his opponent. Langella comes alive when he taps into Nixon's ferocity, and the movie really gets interesting when Michael Sheen stops soft-balling and goes on the attack. If you're going into this for two great performances, it excels on that basis alone.7/10",7,1,1,20 October 2016
Alien 3," A bad idea; this is a downer that's hard to shake off
","By this point, Ripley's pretty much clinched the Can't-Catch-An-Effing-Break award. Terrorized in two different movies, misses out on motherhood, gets blamed for trashing company equipment, loses an adoptive daughter in a meaningless death . . . Thus begins 'Alien³', for better or worse. I will say the killing off of Newt and Hicks - callous though it certainly was, regardless of script necessity - was a ballsy move. Takes cojones to spit on previous work like that. But in any case, all I'm able to see here is how much better the preceding movies are. Nevermind the plot hole with how the egg got onto the Sulaco in the first place, this is just an unbelievably dull movie. The drab color palette doesn't help, and Sigourney Weaver just sleepwalks through the entire thing. Fincher throws in some style with the camera angles, but with that thing growing inside our heroine, this movie's got nihilist written all over it. And not the fun kind. It's just a bad story and flies in the face of the series, thus far. This is awful.4/10",4,0,4,1 February 2015
Gremlins," An effects marvel and good wholesome holiday carnage
","Y'ask me, we need more gleefully violent movies like GREMLINS to offset the cloying schmaltz we usually get. I like that this movie is like a sadistic version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE'S small-town atmosphere, lending some mean-spiritedness to the mischievous antics. But it's all in good dark fun, especially when Mrs. Deagle gets her comeuppance. It's a good time watching the gremlins wreak havoc; those ugly bastards are surprisingly entertaining (the bar scene in particular). On a technical level, this movie's pretty impressive; they pack some real personality into Gizmo. And credit Zack Galligan for giving a chainsaw fight with a puppet a sense of urgency.Great movie all-around.8/10",8,1,2,20 December 2014
Miracle," Killer sports movie
","Not the kind of hockey movie I was expecting, especially a Disney one. 'Miracle' is a laboring trek to the first game, full of self-doubt and brooding (personified by Kurt Russell, who owns this movie, hands down). The geopolitics hang heavy over all of this, but at least it doesn't devolve into jingoism. But once we get into the Olympic games, it's an energized movie indeed. the payoff isn't USA beating the Soviets (we know the history), it's in the team finally coming together. Really electrifies that final game. Even still, you'd have to be dead inside not to smile when Eruzione pulls the team ahead 4-3. And just try not to get misty during Russell's end narration. A sentimental hay-maker, that one.8/10",8,1,1,25 March 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Business as usual
","Though it's a step up from the last one, 'Mission Impossible III' relies on deception and the series' trademarks the most out of these movies; to middling effect. Cruise is surrounded by able players and the story does bend over backward to strike at the heart of Ethan Hunt's domestic bliss, but plot doesn't really matter so much as teasing us with whatever crazy stunt Cruise will do next (indeed, the unthinkable heist is this franchise's bread and butter). But in the end, everything else takes a backseat to the impossible feats and breakneck speed (Abrams' coked-up camera-work and cutting seem well-suited for this sort of dizzying spectacle). One you regain your senses, it's not bad, but also not the best of the lot.Although, this is the best that this particular writing team has ever done. I suppose that's something.6/10",6,0,0,5 August 2016
Lucky Number Slevin," Awful marketing aside, it's the uneven tone that does a real disservice
","I remember the trailer for 'Lucky Number Slevin', some sort of hit-man movie with some 'Ocean's Eleven' style and humor thrown in. The real shocker is that it's absolutely nothing like that. There are hit men involved as well as some humor sprinkled here and there (primarily in the beginning) but it's much more of a gangster/crime movie. The kind of story that keeps you guessing (although, for anyone paying attention, the twist is pretty evident early on).What's disappointing is how seriously it plays the subject matter. For all of the eccentric characters introduced, and the humorous dialog in the first act, it really needed that levity maintained throughout. Once that comic tone disappears, it's a lot less interesting.To its credit, the late-hour twists don't feel cheap like I was expecting them to. But I feel like I've seen this story before. And a great deal of it is oddly lifeless.5/10",5,0,2,3 January 2017
Captain Phillips," Look in the dictionary under intense, and there it is: 'Captain Phillips'.
","Or at least it should be. It's not just the hijacked boat movie the advertising made it out to be; the action moves from ship to tight- quartered lifeboat and even into the roiling waters. And the general sense of foreboding from the very beginning gives way to heart-pumping action - and the tension just never lets up (Greengrass is a master at this). Tom Hanks is reliably terrific in the title role and embodies the no-nonsense Captain. The real surprise comes with Barkhad Abdi, who ably plays a worthy opponent; wily and unpredictable, he's the nothing-to-lose pirate who's got the stones to take a ship and hold off the Navy while he makes his escape. I teared up right there with the Captain in the final moments as the medic checked him over and it was clear the ordeal was finally at an end. That's what kind of movie this is and the kind of narrative power it holds. The tension never lets up. 'Captain Phillips' is a genuine nail-biter. Possibly one for the ages.8/10",8,0,1,6 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every saga has a beginning, even if it's a rocky one.
","Fifteen years can do wonders in smoothing over disappointment, but 'The Phantom Menace' will always be a puzzling entry in the Star Wars series. This is clearly aimed at a very young audience but it's also steeped in politics and trade talks, which is dry material any way you slice it. It's a very odd combination. On the plus side, it's got Liam Neeson, who seemed to evade Lucas' awkward direction. His is a sage and commanding presence and he comes off as a wholly professional performer. But the movie needed much more in the bad guy department. I was as stoked as anyone to see Darth Maul's dual-bladed saber, but it's such a one(none?)-note character. He's a wasted opportunity.Mostly this movie varies from amusing to hard to watch, right back to amusing. But it's a kids movie, and I've got no problem with that. It's just not for me. But this is as good as the prequels get, which is a real bummer.5/10",5,1,3,18 February 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Well, at least it's not found footage
","I've never seen the original 'Cloverfield', but it was the cover image of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead that sold me on the sequel. At the time, that seemed like a can't-lose. Ehhhh . . .I will say, first and foremost, that the movie suffers from having to tie in to the original. That last 15 minutes or so does its best to wreck this movie and any suspense that's preceded it. Awful ending.As for the rest of the movie, yeah, it's a thriller, but only if you accept that subtlety has no place here. It's a young woman being held captive in an underground bunker (either by fallout overhead or her imbalanced captor), and I did want her to escape and gain closure in the end. But it's the journey thereto that wasn't very fun. I really wanted to like this because I really do like the two leads - and, credit where it's due, Goodman's casting was a stroke of genius here - but you can start to see the twists coming before they actually do, and that does get old. It's not a good script. I would recommend this if you like claustrophobic movie-making and eye candy (this does well on both counts) but it'll leave a sour aftertaste.5/10",5,2,4,21 July 2016
3:10 to Yuma," An earnest modern Hollywood western; we can all be thankful for that
","When '3:10 to Yuma' first came out, I remember hoping it would reignite the genre, make westerns happen again. If a movie with 2 big stars couldn't do that, I dunno what could. Alas, what we've gotten since are 'True Grit' . . . and 'Jonah Hex'. Mixed results to be sure.On its own, the movie plays out fairly conventionally, but for its two leads. Russell Crowe breezes through with star looks and charm (except for the final scene, which complicates his character . . . actually, the whole movie really comes alive in these final 10 minutes). For his part, Christian Bale's inborn intensity ably conveys his character's burdens, mostly in holding onto his land, but also in his desperation to do the right thing. There are plenty of shootouts in this movie and it's fortified with a solid cast (notably Peter Fonda and crazyass Ben Foster), but it all rides on the two leading men.7/10",7,0,0,21 April 2015
Source Code," Top-notch thriller
","A story like 'Source Code', something that feels petty damn close to hard science fiction, feel like a breath of fresh air. To me, anyway. When you peel away the mind-bending technology/fantasy of the script, it's really just a guy trying to do something heroic and change history. That's appealing any way you slice it. Even the inherent 'Groundhog Day' comparison is a favorable one.Superficially speaking, I just enjoyed gazing at Vera Farmiga ad Michelle Monaghan for 90 minutes (two different flavors of winsome). But more importantly, Gyllenhaal is a great choice for he lead. And it's beautifully edited - the pacing is breakneck.Good movie all-around.7/10",7,1,3,29 August 2015
Skyfall," Washes out the disappointing taste of 'Quantum of Solace' quite nicely.
","Seen simply as a spy movie, 'Skyfall' is plenty exciting, bursting at the seams with the juiced-up action of the Daniel Craig era. That cold-open is gobsmacking, dramatic not just in its stunts, but in setting off down a suitably dark road; one that leaves Bond's exterior shaken, injured and off his game. There's good story material to be mined here, fleshing out the nasty side of double-O work. Not to mention questioning MI6's old ways in a new world. Bardem certainly leaves his mark as the tortured villain, and the rapport between Craig and Dench's grand ball-buster is wicked.But it's the little touches here and there that I really love about this movie. There's certainly globe-hopping, but it all leads back to London, which is nice for this series. And between the final scene and the Aston Martin, I love that they bring the 2006 reboot full-circle with classic Bond legend. Q and Moneypenny are in place, we're back, and I can't wait for 'Spectre'.8/10",8,2,4,10 April 2015
Iron Man 3," The new armor's top-heavy
","Let me just say right now that I love what they did with the Mandarin in this movie. We'd been wanting to see the 'big bad' since 2008, we're finally getting our wish (retooled as a middle eastern terrorist, but so is everything nowadays) . . . and it's just Ben Kingsley on a pirate broadcast. No real Mandy. That sort of subversion is ballsy (and I can understand the feathers it ruffled), but I love it. Kingsley steals the movie, by the way.But IRON MAN 3 ultimately tries to pack too much in - and without the grace of its predecessor, it's a meandering mess. There's just too much happening. And I'm a Guy Pearce fan, but Aldrich Killian and the whole Extremis thing were pretty lame. And that final battle was one unabashed toy commercial. I wholeheartedly admit that Shane Black's involvement got my hopes up for this thing, but it's too bloated for its own good.6/10",6,1,4,5 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The stuff of legends
","At this point, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has so many imitators, but none of them come close to matching this thing's level of craft. Hell, even its entertainment value. And you can throw around all manner of high praise for this movie (each one being apt), but really this is everything I go to the movies for: great script, well-drawn characters, spectacle, and a wonderfully wry sense of humor. The set pieces - orchestrated like amusement park rides - are just piled on one after another.But the guy that makes this all work is the character himself. Indiana Jones is Ford's best-suited role, hands down. And between the script, direction and Ford's little touches, he's just such a memorable character.10/10",10,1,2,19 May 2015
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," More than a hit film, it's an experience
","'E.T.' was the movie that introduced us to Steven Spielberg as the supreme sentimentalist. Facing the big-guns roster of Summer 1982, it seemed like a little movie, in every aspect. And this movie swept the competition and went on to redefine that movie season as 'The Summer of 'E.T.' Spielberg's ultimate fairy tale (from a script by Melissa Mathison) has a left-behind alien seeking refuge in the backyard of a suburban home. It's a broken home, inhabited by a single mother (Dee Wallace) and her three children as they try to maintain some semblance of family after Dad ran off to Mexico (with another woman). Elliott (Hentry Thomas) is the first of the household to discover the life form (whom he names 'E.T.') and the two lost souls find themselves inexplicably linked. And that link (as well as the rest of the family) will be tested when the scientists come looking for their creature from outer space.Spielberg wanted his audience eating out of his hand, and he accomplishes just that. The film is shot from waist-high (the eye-line of a child) so that we experience the events of the film through the eyes of childhood innocence. And when the government guys show up in their space suits, they're legitimately scary. Spielberg also shot 'E.T.' in chronological scene order, wringing the maximum emotional reactions from his child actors. Spielberg's a master manipulator; he knows exactly what he's doing, (he's done this prior with 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'). But it extends beyond just his cast and into the setting for the film. Spielberg's subdivision is clearly located in California (Elliott even point to California on the map), but the movie's setting becomes an almost-otherworldly place. There's a corn field in Elliott's backyard, complete with nighttime fog, and he's a BMX-ride away from a very Redwoods-esque forest.The relationship between Elliott and E.T. is completely authentic, thanks in no small part to Thomas' ability to make us forget that he's reacting to an inanimate puppet. He sells it, no question. And speaking of which, E.T. is not an attractive alien. That the cast (and director) can make us laugh at, and cry over a character so hideous is nothing short of astounding. None of these actors are lightweights. Dee Wallace is terrific at playing the put-upon mom who's doing her best to keep the family together, and Drew Barrymore is the essence of childhood innocence as the youngest of the family. This is a movie that isn't lacking in emotional punch, in any sense of the definition. Spielberg (with the help of John Williams' magnificent score) expertly tugs at the heartstrings of his audience, and makes it look easy. 'E.T.' is the ultimate in family feel-good movies, and it's truly a portrait of a man at the top of his game in Hollywood entertainment. The heroes are so good, and the message so pure, that it's scientifically impossible for a human being to walk out of this movie with dry eyes (or at least it should be).It lacks the replay value of most of my all-time favorite movies (which I think is good, as I revisit 'E.T.' every few years and it never loses its emotional punch), but it always delivers. Always.9.5/10",9,2,3,16 August 2012
Casablanca," One of the true greats
","Bogart's played some tough characters in his time, but the man's working on a whole different level in 'Casablanca'. He goes from comic detachment to crushingly broken-hearted . . . and comes out the other end with a steely resolve. And not many can make smoking look cool like he does.He's got a unique movie star quality to match Ingrid Bergman's stunning beauty (luminous is a good word to describe it, same as she was in Notorious; now there's a double-bill).To me, this stands right up there Citizen Kane as an important Hollywood movie, but it's more accessible. The love story is universal while the characters are memorable and the dialog drips like honey. It's certainly one of the most quotable films of all time, but also one of the very best romances.It's an incredible movie.",9,1,2,10 April 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Often imitated, has yet to be equaled
","I watched 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' so often growing up, and few movies from that age still maintain this level of (re)watchability. It's so well-worn, yet still entertains on a surprising level.And really, what's not to like about this movie? It's imaginative, colorful and a little bit insane; like stepping into an alternate reality. That mix of a beautifully-realized 1947 Los Angeles and manic toon world is well handled and makes this a great place to spend 100 minutes in. The animation is first-rate; luminous and mingles believably with the human world (and vice versa). It's a technical marvel, but really, the key to all of this actually working is Bob Hoskins. He does the legwork and makes you believe that he's really talking to a toon (and not a placeholder for ink-n-paint to be added later).To this day, this is still one of my favorite movies, and one of the very best I've seen from Disney. The craft that's on display here is highly polished, and treats like this do not come along often.Especially these days.10/10",10,1,1,30 June 2015
Minority Report," Cruise + Spielberg + 'The Fugitive' = Win
","You gotta admire the creativity on this thing. The original Philip K. Dick short story was barely even that; really, just an idea. And what we get with 'Minority Report' is a clever big Summer sci-fi, part on-the-run, part murder mystery. It's a credible future, especially with the surveillance aspect, not to mention the personalized advertising (played for chuckles here, but prescient nonetheless). But it's the police state ramifications of Pre-Crime that really make this scary. That said, it's all packaged in an entertaining Tom Cruise actioner with skilled direction. The chase scenes are exciting, the trappings inventive and it's engrossing for the most part. Things become a bit overwrought towards the end, but it isn't enough to kill the rest of the party.7/10",7,0,0,19 June 2015
Training Day," An Oscar-winning performance, but a mediocre flick.
","'Training Day' is Denzel Washington's master class in dominating a movie. He's compelling, explosive, magnetic, all of it. In the hands of someone less daring, Alonzo Harris could've been just a cardboard bad guy. But Washington handily makes the role his. He owns this movie. And up until the pivotal scene with Scott Glenn, this movie is a kickass crime thriller. It's here (sadly) that things start falling apart. Til now, Ethan Hawke's internal struggle gives the movie its dramatic weight when Denzel's not on screen. But at this point, the movie's about a thug with a badge buying search warrants with stolen money, and the rookie being asked to shoot someone dead with no provocation. There's nothing left to the character of Alonzo Harris, seeing as he's just a criminal trying to buy his way out of a screwup with the Russian mob. All the b.s. he'd been spewing to Hawke is nothing. And everything from then on (Hawke's miraculous salvation from execution, ridiculous fistfight on rooftops, etc.) is just absurd. The brilliant first half crime movie gives way to the typical contrivances of a David Ayer script. It's all still worth the watch just for Denzel Washington's riveting performance. It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't live up to that incredible talent.5/10",5,0,2,16 November 2013
In Bruges," Forget the DVD cover and give this one a shot.
","I remember the marketing back in 2008 for 'In Bruges', its being sold as some farcical comedy. It isn't, and the movie made for a remarkably pleasant surprise. Colin Farrell's never been my cup of ea, but I really liked him in this movie; flawed character, cheeky little shìt, he's got great personality. And one of the movie's biggest gifts is making you feel for two leads, a pair of murderous hit men. It's a film full of foul language, prostitutes and a dwarf, and yet it excels at being both sad and rewarding.Sometimes it's a quirky sightseeing tale, others it's a crime movie - but essentially, it's a dark comedy, and a great one.8/10",8,0,0,22 December 2015
John Wick," This thing's got bite. Nice change of pace.
","Keanu Reeves isn't the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge flick, but he works fairy well for 'John Wick'. There's an inherent detachment to Reeves for a good portion of the film, but he's also got that quiet brooding that roils beneath the surface.Probably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes, which aren't cut to shreds. They're well-staged and have a nice fluid brutality to them. Simple but effective.What was also really nice was the clearly defined (under)world with its coded language, currency ad protocols. It harked back to 'Payback' and the mob-as-corporate-culture. Also, Wick had modern dress and domestic appointments (probably due to his departed wife), but he's using an old touchtone phone and getting around in circa '79s cars. Little touches that add character.It's great news that they're planning a sequel. They've already built the world, and I'm in for more.",7,2,4,23 March 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Jack Black's greatest role, and one of the best animated films of the last decade.
","'Kung Fu Panda' hits all the right notes of a terrific animated movie: gorgeous artwork, engaging story and characters, and it's made for everyone - big and small.The titular character is Po (Jack Black), a roly-poly panda with over-sized ambitions to match his girth. Stuck in his workaday job as a noodle-pusher, Po's biggest dream is to be a kung fu master and join the Furious Five, China's legendary superhero team (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Seth Rogen). Po is thrown headfirst into training when a prophecy names him the new Dragon Master, to the chagrin of the Five's master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Meanwhile, the imprisoned Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped, lusting for vengeance against Shifu, his former master. As the nigh-unstoppable escapee approaches, everything rests on the unlikely Kung Fu Panda.Steeped in Chinese mysticism and showcasing the breathtaking mountainscapes of the Far East, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a film that is impossible not to like. The frenetic action scenes come fast and furious, while the quiet moments are stocked with inspirational Chinese proverbs and characterization. Much of the humor - and there's plenty of it - centers around the comically overweight panda as he faces off against his kung fu superiors.And Jack Black has found the perfect character for his trademark brand of overwrought hyperactive comedy, which usually borders on obnoxious. But here, it completely fits with the Panda who won't quit. Po is full of heart (as is the film), and his boundless energy and need to reek of awesomeness just makes him one of the most likable characters I've ever seen.And the whole movie is just as likable. No, scratch that.Lovable.9/10",9,2,2,3 January 2012
Chinatown," Proves it's not just a noir poser; superb thriller
","For my money, Jerry Goldsmith's 'Main Theme' for CHINATOWN is one of the all-time great pieces of film music. Both seductive and melancholy, it instantly evokes the period setting of the film and the ridiculously bleak nature of the story. And it is one hell of a story; a grade-A film noir with a unique Water & Power angle that serves as a red herring to the real narrative substance. It's well-written and proves John A. Alonzo was one of the great cinematographers (there's some brilliant shot composition here). But it really comes down to the core cast. Nicholson fits into the PI mold well, both educated and crude around women, while John Huston, playing a monumental scumbag, brings the affable charm to really highlight the menace. Faye Dunaway ably pulls off the femme fatale component, until we realize that she's the film's heroine . . . unbelievably tragic though that is. It's the kind of movie that gets under your skin and stays there. Both the ending and final line are a testament to '70s filmmaking, with the balls to forego a happy epilogue for all involved. You couldn't make this movie today, and it sits on the top-shelf with the finest movies of its decade. It just gets better with every watch.9/10",9,1,2,25 June 2014
Gravity," Hits you right where you live; an unbelievably tense thrill ride.
","I wholeheartedly agree with the release hype: if ever there was a movie that demanded to be seen on the biggest screen possible, it's 'Gravity'. From the first frame, you're immediately plunged into outer space, and the magnitude of those shots enveloping your field of vision must have been breathtaking (I missed this in theaters, but the movie still makes its point on home video). I kept looking for the CGI trickery involved in sending the actors into orbit, but the camera movements, the brilliant looming Earth and omnipresent blackness of space make you feel like you're really up there. I love this movie; that they got Ed Harris for Mission Control Voice; the white-knuckle suspense . . . But more than just that, I loved George Clooney's character. His role in the movie is obvious, but he ties right into that human spirit angle something fierce. And even though I knew the big spoilers before seeing this (indeed, the worst kept secret around), 'Gravity' was worth every second. Normally I write these things to either just be honest about how I liked/disliked a movie, or to remember something about it. In the case of 'Gravity', I'm fairly certain I'll never forget one particular scene: where Sandra Bullock is telling Clooney to give a message to her daughter. It's Bullock's indefatigable human spirit that really lands the punch to the gut (her daughter's dead, and she's decided not to go see her today) and really gives this movie its lasting impact.9/10",9,2,4,2 April 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Deligtfully brazen
","It's movies like this that make me thankful I didn't grow up a devout anything; at least grateful for the ability to take a joke. My dad never took to this movie (it saddens me a little), but that's something for another discussion.There's a pervasive feeling that Christ is being subjected to potshots here, and that seemingly naughtiness is part of why 'Life of Brian' is a fun movie. But he's not, and the comedy troupe have instead set their sights on everything from the Romans and blind worship to Hollywood biblical epics. Mostly the Romans. They even slap Pilate with a speech impediment. It possesses a biting satirical wit that brings a smile to my face - especially in a movie that includes full-frontal and a zealous John Cleese; that guy's a can't-lose proposition). This doesn't have the number of laugh-out-loud moments that 'Holy Grail' does, but it still offers a great time.7/10",7,0,3,8 August 2015
Mulan," It looks great
","'Mulan' always seemed like the more interesting of The Mouse's late-'90s output; certainly the cast is first-rate, and I do really like the animation style - but it also features an array of subpar songs in a Disney flick. Seriously, you have Lea Salonga and you waste her talents on these? But despite the lame villain and some of the ineffective comedic elements (including a pre-Donkey Eddie Murphy) this was a hit with the real target audience; my kid really liked this, and I enjoyed this much more through her eyes than I would've alone. And in the end, Mulan is a great character. Even with shaky writing, this is a good story.7/10",7,1,2,16 November 2016
Se7en," It's great, but you'll want to jump in the shower after it's done
","This is exactly why I hold fast to the idea of a second look, particularly when it comes to movies. 'Seven' is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.8/10",8,3,4,22 March 2017
Wayne's World," It's got '90s stink all over it, but there were a few good laughs.
","You wouldn't believe the hype when 'Wayne's World' came out. Everyone was quoting the dialogue, MTV was pushing Bohemian Rhapsody pretty flippin' hard (awful song), it was everywhere. Which is mostly what killed it for me, for twenty odd years. A little goes a long way with this movie. But it's harmless; by-the-numbers SNL juvenile antics. It's pretty stupid, but the movie wears that as a badge of honor. Myers' shtick gets old, but it's Carvey's geeky awkwardness that's the highlight. Plus, he gets the best line ('Benjamin is nobody's friend. If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he'd be pralines and dick.') I like that the psycho hose beast was Lara Flynn Boyle. And I really got a kick out of Chris Farley's bit part.5/10",5,3,8,14 June 2014
The Big Lebowski," The Dude just wants his rug back.
","From those that I've seen, every one of the Coen Brothers' movies has that peculiar charm; offbeat characters, an odd sense of humor, what-have-you. And then there's 'The Big Lebowski', a different beast entirely. Get a load of this thing: it's a mystery yarn set against the backdrop of a bowling tournament, with more F-words than a whorehouse, a host of whacked-out characters and the protagonists are a stoner and his crazy Vietnam veteran buddy. It's also one of the most quotable movies ever produced. The magic is in the dialogue.But it's one of my all-time favorite movies because of the two leads. John Goodman seems to exist solely to keep Jeff Bridges in a state of perpetual exasperation, and their bickering never fails to send me into a fit of giggles.Also, if I can get Sam Elliott to narrate my life story, I'd call that a big bucket of win.10/10",10,2,5,12 January 2016
Star Trek," They turned Star Trek into a comic book movie.
","For better or worse (which honestly depends on what you're looking for with these movies), this aging franchise has been taken back to the shop for a complete overhaul. Not a sterling reboot, but also not half-assed, as Trek has now been completely reinvented for the Summer popcorn crowd; big, noisy and amped to a manic degree. The movie is seductive in its pure balls-to-the-wall entertainment value, and even I have to admit to tuning in for a few minutes whenever this is on TV. But there are large swathe of this that don't make a lot of sense and take the wind of the sails. For one why is Nero so cheesed off at Spock Prime, the one guy who risked life and limb to help him out? This is your big bad guy? He's terrible! Also, Spock Prime just happens to be on the same planet on which Kirk's been marooned? Really? But then that sort of deus ex machina isn't so far-fetched (I guess) in a movie that bend its story over backwards to get Kirk in the command chair.That said, what the movie does feature is a pretty interesting cast, the highlights of which are Chris Pine, Karl Urban and Bruce Greenwood (a thousand times, Greenwood!). If the movie works, it's wholeheartedly because of the people in these famous roles. But once the credits roll and the cheap thrills are over, the bad taste lingers.5/10",5,1,3,10 April 2015
Fight Club," Clearly I'm not in the target audience
","It's been a good 15 years since I've seen 'Fight Club', and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that 'gotcha!' ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't 'get' the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake.It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says 'The things you own end up owning you', it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory. You can taste the smugness. It's not a lot of fun, let's put it that way.4/10",4,2,6,11 February 2016
Akira," A triumph of animation
","'Akira' is more than just a character's name or an iconic motorcycle; it's 2019 Neo-Tokyo, one of the most distinctive places you've ever been transported to. Within this city are warring biker gangs, a sinister government bureaucracy and freakish all-powerful mutants. And despite the 'RoboCop' levels of violence, you'll find yourself coming back. This is that big of a mind-bender.There's substance to the claims that the plot can be a bit opaque, and I think there was too much of the epic manga crammed into this (the political subtext and metaphysics are only given a passing glance). But with regard to animation, there's simply no rivaling this. Look at the rippling destruction of a citywide energy blast or the blood spray of a human body as gunfire cuts it to ribbons; the sheer effort and attention to detail that went into this are staggering. The line work is articulate and the color is just stunning. This is a post- apocalypse and it's still a visual feast. The violence may be ugly, but the art sure as hell isn't. 'Akira' is as repulsive as it is dazzling and there's nothing else like it. 9/10",9,2,6,6 March 2012
Citizen Kane," 'Kane' has been built-up to high heaven. But put that aside, because it's worth it.
","'Citizen Kane' isn't a movie I revisit often, but it's equally engrossing on every viewing. I'm always more interested than emotionally invested. It's definitely a compelling story - sweeping, cynical, sad - and I do say that Charles Foster Kane is extremely memorable, as self-absorbed titans of industry go. But its appeal (for me) is on a technical level, which is consummate, to say the least. It's utterly fascinating from a cinematography standpoint (those shot compositions!), and there's always something on the screen drawing your eye. Most of the time, it's in many directions. Indeed, this movie's artistic craft is beyond question.Whether or not this measures up to the impossible hype is relative to the viewer. But it is absolutely worth seeing.8/10",8,1,3,26 April 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A story and characters that won't hold up on the small screen
","'Rogue One', as an actual Star Wars movie, left me surprisingly cold. I guess it all came down to the core group of characters, none of whom really clicked for me. Their whole campaign was a generic motley strike team story, seen before and done better in other films. It's actually kind of a snooze until the X-Wings show up. Prior to that, it's just hopping from one planet to the next.But these characters aren't all that important, are they? this is another chapter in Disney's Cinematic Expanded Universe, and we're all here to see the lead-up to the original '77 Star Wars. In a way, this is almost more fan-fiction than 'The Force Awakens' was. Everything's a nod or a reference, and to be honest, that's what's honestly satisfying about all of this; it's played to calculated effect. I got a kick out of seeing Darth Vader, not to mention the Tantive IV; the recycled '77 footage was nice touch; we had James Earl Jones and the red lenses again; and they actually did a decent job 'reanimating' Peter Cushing.But are they actually going to do something new with Star Wars or just keep playing on our nostalgia? 6/10 Leia didn't fare so well in the CGI department, but given the recent loss, the ending carried an unexpected poignance.",6,6,11,1 January 2017
Captain Marvel," Marvel's Wonder Woman (and that's a good thing)
","I didn't walk into 'Captain Marvel' expecting more than a girls-kick-ass movie, which, given the massive hype behind this film, was a fairly low bar. One of the problems I've had with the marketing is introducing Carol Danvers as Deus Ex Machina for defeating Thanos.The good news is that the movie easily surpasses expectations because there's actually a character here. She's as powerful inside as she is externally, and that's what ultimately makes this work. I was (as always) impressed with Brie Larson, although the script didn't offer her many chances to actually speak. It's to her credit that she charms with what she's given.The real surprise to me is that I enjoyed this movie in the larger MCU sense than just on the origin story basis - and I can't remember the last time this has happened. I liked Nick Fury's expanded role here, his youthful CGI work is impressive, and those scenes in which he has sort of a buddy relationship with Carol were very nice. Also love that he is a cat person.So yeah, she's super powerful, but it's earned, and this actually made me excited for the next Marvel movie (and I've been suffering burn-out for years).",8,13,30,5 April 2019
This Is the End," Even if you don't like these actors, you'll probably like this movie
","This has got to be one of the most random and asinine things I've seen in a very long time. But I also laughed a lot more than I thought I would. The opening series of celebrity cameos gets old rather quickly, but the movie wastes little time getting to the selling point: seeing these six guys (playing douchey versions of themselves) at each other's throats. And it's a novel angle, to be sure. And the strange factor just continues to ratchet until we get to the ultimate in WTF endings. Seriously, what was that?It'll probably be a while before I feel the need to watch this again, but I had a good time. Also, coked-up Michael Cera is pretty hilarious.6.5/10",6,7,16,16 October 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Hyper-violent action movie with zombies
","George Romero's '78 classic 'Dawn of the Dead' gets a cosmetic facelift in this über-gory remake from newcomer Zack Snyder. I will say this: it's a terrific movie if you've never seen the original. Snyder put together a pretty good zombie movie. But it's clear that he (and screenwriter James Gunn) wanted no part of the satirical humor of the original. Snyder just set out to make a kickass zombie movie, while at the same time upping the ante. And in some respects, he succeeded.The action this time around takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The pandemic (like the original) springs from out of nowhere, taking the country by surprise. A group of survivors bands together and seeks refuge in an abandoned shopping mall while they formulate an escape plan. All the while, zombie hordes gather on the outside of the mall, looking for a way in.The most noticeable change is in the zombies, themselves. No longer do they shuffle around like geriatrics. Snyder turns it up a notch with running, leaping and screaming. His zombies are indeed much more of a threat (not to mention terrifying). But the makeup here (compared with Romero's original) is on a whole different level. The pallid complexions of 1978 give way to bloody, decaying pieces of meat (nothing like a zombie with half a mouth!).What's interesting about Snyder's version is that it's almost more action movie than horror. Here, running and gun-play are just as important as blood-spatter and severed limbs. It makes for a lean, mean zombie flick, and in that regard, I think it works. I tend to wonder if the powers-that-be should've just concentrated on upping-the-ante with the zombie movie, but not even associate it with 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978), which is why I was ultimately disappointed. It's as if Snyder & Co. made this movie because they found the original 'too boring', and felt it needed to be faster, bloodier, etc. Lost in that update is the sense of fun inherent in the original. The remake also eschews the social commentary of the zombies being attracted to a shopping mall (mindless consumers), in favor of the shopping mall just being a place to convene in relative safety. In that respect, it seems rather arbitrary to set the movie in a shopping mall in the first place.It's clear they used the same title for brand-recognition, but it should've been its own thing; Snyder's throwing down the gauntlet with his own movie, not a remake.5/10",5,0,0,11 July 2011
Iron Man 2," Thankfully, doesn't disappoint
","IRON MAN 2 might not be quite the cohesive whole that its predecessor is (it can meander a bit), but there are plenty of things in the plus column. For one thing, Sam Rockwell is, next to Robert Downey Jr., the greatest performer in these movies. He's just as conceited as Tony Stark, but he's also got the ample comic charm to keep things light in between effects showcases. I love that Howard Stark is Walt Disney, and the glorious injection of kick-ass that is redhead Scarlett Johansson (mama!). The Grand Prix is a great set piece (I've always been fond of the silver-and red suitcase armor) and my favorite scene in the whole movie - just like last time - is Stark going to work in the lab. But this movie was tasked with both building on the first movie and setting up THE AVENGERS. No easy feat, and as such, you could do a lot worse with your huge summer comic book movies.7/10",7,2,7,6 January 2015
Alien: Resurrection," Witness the series running out of steam
","Well, at least there were no more favored characters to be killed off.'Alien Resurrection' is a movie I paid to see in the theater, and I was even disappointed when it fell to 'Flubber' at the box office. This is just to give you some perspective. Twenty years hence, it plays as something very French, very weird, and way too sluggish (and I'm not all that sure what I saw as a 17 year-old). It's certainly lost any of the spark of its predecessors, and the motley group of smugglers assembled here feels more like systematic xenomorph fodder. Even Ron Perlman(!) is wasted.What I will say is that Sigourney Weaver embraces the off-kilter vibe of her lab-reproduced Ripley. The character's lost somewhere between human and alien, and she plays it with a mix of cynicism and wicked curiosity. She also has the best scene in the movie when she discovers one of the lab failures that came before here and puts it out of its misery; it's a hard scene.We can probably all agree that cloning Ripley was a desperate attempt at keeping the series going, and it really shows.5/10",5,0,0,19 May 2017
The Hunger Games," Weak sauce
","I'd forgotten much about the book before I finally got around to the movie, but wasn't the book a lot more brutal? That's what this thing needed, something to really show how dangerous the Games are rather than just one quick scene of watered-down violence and some low-rent CGI beasts. There's also a lack of character development here and there's nothing to really make me root for Katniss during the long stretches of screen time where nothing's happening. That's what was really disappointing about the movie version: it's ridiculously slow. And when there is an action scene, it's in a explosive splash of dizzying shaky cam.Not a good start to a movie series.4/10",4,3,5,6 October 2014
Zootopia," The story has promise; most of the characters, not so much
","Looking at is sensibly, there was no way 'Zootopia' would live up to that kind of hype. Even so, it's definitely a mixed bag. There's one really good gag (the DMV being manned by literal sloths), but runs way too long and ends up shooting itself in the foot several times over. And eventually, the movie's energy (embodied by Ginnifer Goodwin) peters out. Now that I think about it, the movie could've done with more of her and less of Jason Bateman.That said, it does start out pretty well. And above all else, this deserves credit for having a positive message (rising above labeling and stereotypes) and seems to be targeted at all ages. That, I can get behind.6/10",6,0,4,4 July 2016
Mississippi Burning," Powerful stuff, but bring an iron stomach
","I have no idea how accurate MISSISSIPPI BURNING is, and I imagine a lot was changed for the purposes of making a movie. But geez, what a story. And make no mistake; it is rough going. There's all sorts of backwards sentiment to make you sick. The movie's got hate oozing through the seams. Most of it's revolting, sometimes horrifying. But as a gripping thriller, it is top-notch. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the shining stars of this whole thing as two cops clashing over different styles of handling the same case. Two amazing performances, and these guys work well off of each other. But there's great work from Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker and R. Lee Ermey (Dourif and Rooker, especially, who embody such hateful scum beyond belief). It's a great piece of drama, but also one that bluntly shows a different world in the south. And that world's not easy to stick around in. There is justice in the end, but just knowing that the good guys had to get their hands dirty to effect it leaves you all the more conflicted, just as it does our hero FBI agents. But when all is said and done, even if the movie's subject matter is hard to swallow, MISSISSIPI BURNING is wholeheartedly, without a shadow of a doubt worth watching for Gene Hackman. The man is at his peak in this movie, and his fluid transition from charming to outright menacing can be witnessed in the bar scene. Mesmerizing stuff. Hackman's abilities are beyond question. 8/10",8,1,1,14 September 2014
The 13th Warrior," 'The 13th Warrior': the dictionary definition of studio mishandling.
","It may be because I'm starved for an honest-to-gods Norse movie, but 'The 13th Warrior made for a rather kickass Viking/action/adventure/horror movie; a sweeping epic (at a less-than-epic length), featuring a rousing battle score, beautiful cinematography and some very nice swordplay (indeed, the movie really got going when Banderas fashioned himself a sabre). There's much fun to be had watching authentic warriors slay the predators, and the film etches itself into your brain with a supremely heartfelt and triumphant ending. 7.5/10",7,3,5,6 September 2012
Argo," A story so nuts, it had to be true . . .
",". . . but you don't expect to be so captivated, all the same. At least, I didn't.I can't say just how many liberties were taken with this movie's story -- or just how 'Hollywood' it is -- but that's why I loved it so much. Affleck approached this film with the '70s movie grain and aesthetics that are right up my alley (even kicking things off with the old Warner Bros logo). And even with such a top-shelf cast, Alan Arkin was the standout for me. His cynical producer made the film's first act in Hollywood so damn enjoyable, and he's just the movie's bright spot.But even so, Affleck's bona fides are on full display here; it's an exceptionally underplayed performance in an exhilarating suspense flick. He's never wowed me as an actor before now, but I can no longer question in front or behind the camera.This is a great movie!",8,0,0,7 October 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A modern-day high-seas blockbuster born from unlikely Disney roots
","Disregarding the bloated the carcass that has become the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series helps restore the lustre to 'Curse of the Black Pearl'. At least, it did for me. It's a rousing pirate adventure, cleverly mixing battle scenes, humor and memorable characters. But it's really built around Captain Jack Sparrow, which is a problem I had with the later entries when the cast really got crowded and he was (somewhat) sidelined. But he is the real magic here, and Depp plays the character with mincing bug-eyed flair. He's a treat.Then again, so's the whole movie, especially bearing in mind that it's a big effects movie spawned from a theme park ride. Let that sink in for a moment, and this really has no business being so good. Like some sort of mad science experiment in Anaheim that was never supposed to work.Yet it totally does.8/10",8,0,2,10 July 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Abrams, just make a Star Wars movie, already.
","My disappointment comes not from being a disillusioned Trekkie (would I even qualify for that?) but from the nice bit of Summer escapism that never panned out. Abrams' 'Star Trek Into Darkness' bursts onto the screen, guns blazing. It's a flashy, loud, sensory barrage that never lets up; like a fistful of speed pills on the big screen. Sometimes this attitude works, mostly it doesn't, and I often wished Abrams would stop moving the damn camera (one static shot here or there won't kill you, man). It's dizzying.One of the problems is that there is a staggering amount of story material for one movie. They tease a war with the Klingons, touch on terrorism (9/11, you know it), play with the idea of making the now-non-wheelchair-ridden Admiral Pike the captain of the Enterprise again, there's a lover's quarrel between Spock and Uhura, Kirk learns some hard lessons (or maybe he doesn't, we're not sure), and then there's John Harrison, the terrorist bad guy - no wait, the bad guy's Peter Weller - oh, OK, it's really Harrison. Who's really Khan. Why?The writers of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' might have had something if they weren't so concerned with 'Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan'. It looms large over everything in this movie. Every repurposed line, every recycled plot point, they're all reminders that I could be watching a much better movie, instead. Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof are too happy remixing the lore without respecting it. Why the big reveal that Harrison is Khan? Harrison was a good enough bad guy character in his own right, with his own motivation. Better than Nero, and good enough to stand on his own. And why would Spock Prime be consulted on this guy if the Cumberbatch and Montalban characters are apples and oranges? Why kill off Kirk if he's just going to be resurrected before end credits? We already know there's magical blood to fix him; it just cheapens a (well-acted, at least) death scene. I have to stop here, because the list will seem like nitpicks. But it also means that because of these constant callbacks, 'Into Darkness' never gets the chance to stand as its own movie. It's the uninspired writing that steeps this movie in mediocrity, and that's what's most disappointing. The filmmakers are too interested in reexamining, deconstructing, and rehashing the past, instead of taking us somewhere new. Nod, don't pilfer.I want the imagination back. 3/10",3,24,41,23 May 2013
Stripes," The movie's silly, but the laughs are genuine
","For me, 'Stripes' is one of the great '80s comedies; mostly because it's been funny over the years, and still holds up today. It's over-stuffed with a terrific cast, beautiful women and the comedic stylings of Harold Ramis (man, that guy could write 'em). There are some John Candy lines I still quote every now and then, and I get a kick out of watching Ramis try to keep it together in his scenes with Bill Murray. And speaking of Murray, he is plying his smartass likability to the nth degree here. The whole movie brims with it.And even though the movie completely switches gears into wacky misadventure during the second half, that first half is comedy gold. Also, Sean Young keeps getting more and more gorgeous as the movie progresses, so it all evens out.8/10",8,1,2,11 March 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Classy
","'Beauty and the Beast' is that rare example of a vaunted Disney movie that really works; on pretty much every level. It says a lot that I - averse to musicals - gravitate toward the songs in this movie. They're all good . . . even the Celine Dion ballad. The requisite puzzle pieces come together just right here. It's got a (genuinely) strong female protagonist, good humor, very nice animation, and even a message about not being a douche. Also, the weirdest-looking prince I've ever seen in a Disney movie.But here's the bottom line: If Disney applied that 'Lion King' prestige to this movie, it'd be well-earned, and they'd actually be right on the money. There's not a whole lot (any?) about this that turns me off, and it's a legitimately entertaining movie. Worthy of high praise. And as Disney Renaissance movies go (a phrase that gets thrown around with reckless abandon), this is right up there at the top.7/10",7,0,0,14 February 2016
Green Room," Supremacists, viscera and chills, oh my!
","When I first heard of 'Green Room', it was regarding the casting. Patrick Stewart as a bad guy? Shut up and take my money! Who would hear that voice and think malevolent Nazi psychopath? And it didn't disappoint on that front.Or on any front, for that matter. To be honest, it's been a while since I've seen a decent thriller and this movie is that much more refreshing because of it. Tightly-wound, ultraviolent, it goes down like an energy drink (without the bitter aftertaste). The punk band feels like a group of real people, and I love the cynical ending. It's got John Carpenter's fingerprints all over it.Great movie.8/10",8,2,5,8 September 2016
Happy Gilmore," Violence, hockey, vulgarity ... all the good stuff!
","My favorite Adam Sandler movie.I just think it aligns perfectly with his comic persona. He seems to fit this character perfectly. It's the kind of adolescent silliness that I gravitate toward. I can't tell you how happy I was that my 9 year-old seemed to approve ('That was a very good movie'). And she's way more mature than her old man is.It's not just the character of Happy Gilmore that's memorable here, but also Shooter McGavin, and Christopher McDonald deserves credit for making the entitled jackass a solid villain. Same for Carl Weathers, and you would think he'd be slumming it here, but he sure doesn't show it.Best of all? Out-of-Nowhere Bob Barker; secure enough in his celebrity to openly parody it with a free-for-all fistfight.Tell me 'The Price is Wrong, b***h!' isn't one of Sandler's best lines.",8,6,6,25 February 2019
Ted," For all the good this movie has to offer, 'Ted' is surprisingly just a step above 'meh'.
","It's got the '80s cultural references and Peter Griffin-voiced main character you'd expect from Seth MacFarlane, and there's a handful of pretty funny lines, and that's about it. I'm not Wahlberg's biggest fan, but the guy really does a pretty good job convincing us he's not acting against a CGI placeholder. I was hoping for more Ralph Garman, but the dude only had one flippin' scene. But you've gotta respect MacFarlane for getting Patrick Stewart to narrate this silliness. A flick about a talking stuffed bear dabbling in potty humor . . . Patrick effing Stewart. That the guy even has a chummy relationship with such an unparalleled god means MacFarlane has mounted his own golden chariot and is racing towards similarly lofty heights. Respect. Also, the Thunder Song was easily worth the price of admission. Movie's pretty forgettable, but I still have that song in my head. 6/10",6,0,0,8 February 2014
Spider-Man 2," Somehow, I'd forgotten just how good this is
","One of the unsung aspects of 'Spider-Man 2' is Alfred Molina. The guy brings charm and polish to a villain who - well, let's face it, Doctor Octopus isn't upper-echelon, and it's not just first-rate effects that make Ock as exciting as he is here. He's also integral to a movie that, like all the great sequels, tops what came before. More J.K. Simmons, bigger web-swinging thrills, A- game fight scenes, and they're all in the service of a story that focuses on the human underneath the mask. Peter Parker's burden is ever more cumbersome here, trapping him in a life that allows for no personal growth; the awesome responsibility that always comes first. And in the end, it's not the human spectacle that thrills so much as the catharsis that's finally attained . Sam Raimi laid down the gauntlet with this film; it's true to the source, highly entertaining, and maintain's just the right emotional punch.8/10",8,1,6,7 July 2017
Point Break," What a waste
","So, we're just remaking all of Swayze's movies now, right? And if the do-overs are good, that's no problem. But 'Point Break', aiming for passable, still misses the mark. This thing's a self-important mess, and really sucks the fun out of everything. The mysticism is deathly serious with no balancing levity. I guarantee you'll be missing the better actors of the original movie, and that's before getting to the halfway mark.I admit I maintained a cautious optimism at first (hey, I get a charge out of hearing The Black Keys just as anybody), but this thing's just a vacuum of excitement, in spite of the extreme sports emphasis. I never though I'd say this, but watch 'The Fast and the Furious' instead. It's the better remake.3/10",3,1,2,13 April 2017
The Fifth Element," Entertaining sci-fi with a well-chosen star
","'The Fifth Element' really seems like something only a crazy French guy could come up wit. Smash 'Blade Runner' into 'Heavy Metal', fill it with guns and Henson Creature Shop rejects, put MTV in charge of the music and find a hair stylist that's tripping balls on acid.Oy, the French.Anyhoo, there's still fun to be had here. Sue, the narrative's not as smooth as it could be, but the movie's colorful, it moves, and it's wildly imaginative. The effects hold up surprisingly well, especially the flying cars. And the actors (Willis, James and the unhinged Oldman) seemed to be enjoying themselves. If the movie has an Achilles' heel, it's Chris Tucker . . . and that foot needs to come off, stat.7/10",7,0,1,18 June 2015
Batman Returns," Macabre overload, if you can believe it
","'Batman Returns' tips the scales in the darkness department; which you would think is appropriate for a Batman movie and not something that would work against it. But every character herein is either born of tragedy or succumbs to it. This is Tim Burton's unchecked id taking over. That sometimes works, but in a movie jam-packed with villains, subplots and weird campy undercurrents, it doesn't offer a good flow.I don't hate this movie, but it's not very good. When Batman has something to do, the action's actually pretty fun. The Batmobile seems to roar onto the screen (even more so than last time) and there's a confidence that goes along with an anticipated sequel. But the performances from DeVito and Pfeiffer get lost in something that feels like cinematic depression.5/10Also, Christopher Walken steals the entire thing. That kinda surprised me.",5,0,3,13 August 2012
Blade," Nails the dark and creepy tone
","As a property, Blade easily lends itself to the big screen. He's got the vigilantism of Batman, Punisher's hatred and brutality, killer fighting moves, and the best parts of vampires without their weaknesses. He's just such a great character. And Wesley Snipes owns this rile, bringing distinct badass cachet to the party. He makes a vicious beatdown so bloody fun.It seems like this is where Marvel got its shít together after a string of misfires ('Captain America', 'The Punisher', Corman's 'Fantastic Four'). Finally, a movie that takes its source material seriously with a capable action director and an effects budget (for '98). The vampires are refreshingly non-emo and they even throw in some realism without going overboard (vampirism as a blood disorder was novel). To top that off, there's a literal bloodbath. It's very '90s, but still leaves its mark. The pieces just come together here so well.7/10",7,1,3,27 January 2015
That Thing You Do!," Affable in just about every way. Hanks nails it.
","The title song for 'That Thing You Do!' is so infectious that, even if the movie had nothing else to do, it still boasts a teflon song. For as often as its played through the course of the movie (and in your head after the credits roll), it's one weapons-grade toe-tapper. But that's not all the movie has to offer; far from it. There's a can-do optimism permeating this thing from start to finish, not to mention a sense of playfulness. And you can't help but be swept right along with the band on their meteoric rise to the big time (not even their implosion is enough to sour things). Talk about hitting it out of the park for a first-time directing gig, this is about as well-engineered a feel-good movie gets. The cast is great, the pacing's snappy and it all adds up to one very entertaining movie.8/10",8,0,1,6 October 2015
The Natural," Might just be the best-looking 'baseball' movie out there
","I've been on kind of a baseball kick lately, and obviously, 'The Natural' is going to come up. And it's a good movie, boasting some veteran talent both behind and in front of the camera. The funny thing is that it's not really about baseball, same as boxing is just a storytelling vehicle for 'Raging Bull' and 'Million Dollar Baby'. This is really an allegory of good and evil, of honorable men and the forces that would smother them; the symbolism's painted all over the walls in this place.When I read Malamud's book a few years ago, I was blown away by the ending, one that really underlines the novel's bitterness; and that finish has no place in this film. Even still, while you know who to root for and who to despise, there are still aspects that really need to be fleshed out; Robert Duvall's character, in particular.But I'm not out to poke holes. This movie is memorable not just for the acting or Randy Newman's main theme, but for its fondness for the period. You watch this for the sun-kissed cinematography and those crucial moments when fate (t last) steps in to level the playing field.Pacing issues aside, it's a movie everyone needs to see at least once.7/10",7,3,4,21 April 2017
Dead Poets Society," Well made in every respect
","From a narrative standpoint, Robin Williams isn't the focus of 'Dead Poets Society', but he does steal the movie; and his costars are no weaklings either, so that's saying something. But this is a story that rails against conformity and academic establishment, and as such, he is well-suited as agitator-in-chief.I love this movie, from its classical sensibilities to its autumn atmosphere (the photography is stunning). There's a genuine sense of youth here, and the pressures of parental expectation on these men is still relatable (and I've never been apart of that culture); enough so that a troublemaker like Robin Williams feels downright heroic.This is the kind of movie that just makes your heart swell. And even when it turns to tragedy, the move is organic.There's warmth all over this thing.9/10",9,0,1,14 March 2017
Ed Wood," Brilliant homage
","I've seen the train wreck that is 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', which makes 'Ed Wood' feel like an eye-opener. Is this true to life? Clearly not, but it's all shot up with so much whimsy and biting dialogue that you honestly don't care. Johnny Depp plays Wood with a cock-eyed optimism, and that positive spirit is what brings out the humor in his many failures. That, and a zest for angora sweaters.It's a modest movie, even with such a strong cast (particularly Martin Landau) and I love that it's uncharacteristic of Tim Burton. But of his collaborations with Depp, this is easily my favorite and never fails to leave me with a smile.A fine movie indeed.9/10",9,1,1,31 October 2016
Home Alone," Man must defend his castle
",Watching 'Home Alone' offers a nearly completely different experience as an adult; at least it did in my case. I was far more invested in the McAllister house than anything else. What the hell did Dad to for a living to afford that place? John Heard's character didn't seem like an high-level executive.What does stand the test of time is the violence and physical hell visited upon Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The Three Stooges live on in a John Hughes family film.I can see myself slamming this movie for the more sentimental Kodak moments . . . but my kid loves it and I love her giggles. And I love the production design that went into creating the McAllister house and the surrounding environs. It's a heartwarming slice of upper-class Christmas.,7,0,0,10 December 2015
The Hustler," The sports movie's dark underbelly
","You get a pretty good idea where 'The Hustler' will lead you after witnessing Paul Newman's utter defeat at the hands of pool legend Jackie Gleason (man, it's cool to watch him shoot). It's such a marathon contest that the effects are devastating. And that's only in the first 40 minutes or so, and the depths that Newman has to go to to overcome his personal demons and experience rebirth are gut-wrenching. I guess it'd qualify as spoilers to say he comes back and wins, but not the way you'd think.This is a fantastic movie - about character, not really pool - and it boasts some amazing talent. Newman, sure, but George C. Scott's a magnetic presence in an unscrupulous role. and Piper Laurie is the painful reminder of the bitter cynical undercurrent flowing beneath all of it.Outstanding.9/10",9,2,2,17 November 2015
Spotlight," Burns slow, but riveting to the end
","Garnered awards and horrifying subject matter put aside, take a look at the movie poster for 'Spotlight'. It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.The scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: 'They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys.' This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.But when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.Amazing stuff.9/10",9,12,16,26 March 2016
Terminator Salvation," Another misfire without Cameron
","At its best, 'Terminator Salvation' recalls the evil cyborgs of the previous (better) movies. And that's kind of it. McG tries to up the ante by making the machines bigger, but they look dangerously close to Bay's Transformers. That's not a compliment; some of these Terminators look like Decepticons. But this is a strictly passable entry in the franchise, one that promises plenty of guns and brooding combat but not very much else. A lot of this movie is mechanical - even Arnold's back via CGI workaround (though I will say they did a decent job rendering him; I was surprised by that). In the end, this is a hollow movie and unquestionably the series at its most dreary. It's not as eye-gougingly stupid as 'Genisys', but also nowhere near the first two.5/10",5,1,7,1 March 2017
Insomnia," Atmospheric, tangled thriller
","A veteran detective with skeletons in his closet, whisked away to a foreign land (for whatever reason) - it's been done many times. Most of the time, the 'is he dirty or isn't he?' routine is frustrating ('Black Rain', 'Boom Town', 'Rising Sun', etc.). BUt it's different with 'Insomnia'; you pretty much know the main character is a dirty cop, so it's really about the walls closing in, which is actually refreshing. And it adds levels.Other than that, it's the talent of the main cast that makes this fresh. Pacino, Swank and Williams are all terrific (although Williams is perfectly at home with quietly deranged; it's beyond creepy). And Pacino is well-suited for a guy who can't get any sleep. He makes run-down look easy.7/10",7,1,1,16 July 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," Pure Magic
","MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO's story is about as simple and wholesome as it gets: two little girls, having just relocated to the countryside, wander off and find strange creatures in the neighboring forest. But this thing is just brimming with heart. I was going to say the little sister (Mei) in her raincoat is the cutest thing ever, but that goes for all of her scenes. And Totoro, the eponymous no-neck cat/rabbit thing, while having no dialog, burst with likable personality. The animation here is nothing short of gorgeous. Even if you don't dig the character designs of Japanese animation, those painterly landscapes, clouds and lush greenery are eye-popping.It says a lot that MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO held my 5 year-old's rapt attention from start to finish. And this isn't short-attention-span fare. One of my favorite scene was the rainy bus stop. Very little happens here, but it's a terrific bonding moment between the main characters. You'll instantly see why Totoro with a leaf on his head is the film's iconic image.The movie's just an all-around winner, not much else to say. Precocious and full of wonder, it's like a shot of warmth to the ol' ticker.9/10",9,1,2,6 December 2014
500 Days of Summer," Deschanel's presence suggests a more pleasing movie than it is
","'(500) Days of Summer' finally clicks into gear somewhere just after the halfway mark when expectations clash with reality and Joseph Gordon-Levitt hits bottom. It' here that I really felt something for this character, and and the rest of the movie picks up from then on, right up until the sweet ending - a sweetness I guess I was expecting much earlier, which is why the first half left me cold. Very stilted and awkward. The supporting cast is lacking here (Moretz is the token common-sense friend), but hearing Richard McGonagle (Sully in 'Uncharted') narrate this thing was very nice.Overall, it's a good (albeit rocky) story about unrequited love and the pain that that entails, but the best thing here (aside from Gordon-Levitt) is that it's not your formulaic romantic comedy. And that subversion helps make up for the rough patches.6/10",6,0,0,8 June 2015
L.A. Confidential," Off the record, on the QT and unbelievably great
","'L.A. Confidential' is what comes to mind when I think of police corruption movies, especially on the basis of pulling back the curtain of Los Angeles' star-studded image to expose its seamy underbelly. It's a world where the bad guys are vicious and the cops aren't much nicer. I do hear 'overrated' a lot (these days) when discussing this movie, and obviously, I don't agree; but I think we can all agree that this is one hell of an ensemble cast. Even when I want to single one player out above the rest, another steps up to refute that notion. Every single person is ideal for his/her character. It's a huge part of why this movie is so damn good. That, and its flawless pacing.There are plenty of reasons to love this movie, but maybe (maybe) above all else, is the setting. This period (let's say from '45 to '55) has long been my favorite in Hollywood cinema. It's partially why I take to movies like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', 'Chinatown' and 'Devil in a Blue Dress'. Between this movie's sets, locations, warm color palette, wardrobe and Goldsmith's score, it's a stunning depiction of the time and place. I mean, this is a nice-looking film. 'L.A. Confidential' makes an airtight case for wanting to delve into such a disreputable world. The craft here is unparalleled.Top ten, baby.10/10",10,4,7,2 February 2016
The Jungle Book," This is what springs to mind when I think Classic Disney
","The thing that usually makes me a hard sell with Disney movies is that they're synonymous with musicals Something like 'Beauty and the Beast' overcomes this with no problem. At the other end of the spectrum is (ugh) 'The Lion King'. And then, there's 'The Jungle Book', which is the gold standard, if you ask me. These are the kinds of songs you find yourself humming in the halls at work; I mean, really, can you think of a more pleasing ear worm than 'The Bare Necessities'? It's not just the outstanding soundtrack, but the general upbeat mood this movie strikes. To this day, I love the back-and-forth between Baloo and Bagheera, and King Louie's sequence has to be some of the most fun you can have with one of these movies. Throw in the Beatles vultures and you've got an array of memorable characters.The whole thing's just a treat.8/10",8,2,3,4 July 2016
Deadpool 2," Goes full-on action movie, and it's a blast
","Between death, family and franchise-building, 'Deadpool 2' has a lot of balls to juggle. And it's a testament to the talent involved that every one of them stays in the air. In this character, Ryan Reynolds has found his definitive role; it's the perfect vehicle for his class-clown personality, while letting his id run completely wild. Sure, this was on display in the first movie, but even he was bound by the constraints of the origin story mold. And as a sequel, this movie makes clear that those bonds are history. It delves into the character of Wade Wilson while still offering a perverse take on the idea of the super team. It makes incredibly effective use of Josh Brolin as Cable, and even brings an array of color to Deadpool's farcical take on the X-Force. The whole thing is a rebellious 'wascally wabbit' jab at the superhero genre, and I enjoyed every second. Not to mention the inspired casting of Domino, who gives The Merc with a Mouth a run for his money in every scene (swooooon).I've seen this twice in the last few days and it's the most fun I've had at a Marvel* movie in quite a while. I love the violence, the cast and the satiric sense of humor. This is a franchise worth building. 8/10*Okay, Marvel property",8,1,2,22 May 2018
X-Men," From such humble beginnings
","The X-Men movies have become so big and the characters varied that it's actually kind of a surprise just how effective the first movie is. 'X-Men' does its job pretty well; it establishes the origins, sets up the world and makes it palatable to the mainstream. It's got a killer opening with Wolverine up North and Senator Kelly's Mutant Registration Act as McCarthy witch hunt. The rest of the movie isn't dull, but it's hard to top that.It's certainly not without its quirks. The blinding error of casting the oddly sedate Halle Berry (who bears none of Storm's regal presence) is only offset by the spot-on choice of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. And there are a few spotty effects due to the low(er) budget, but that's nothing. Although, whoever wrote the 'Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?' line should be ashamed of themselves.But really, when all is said and done, it makes for both a good comic book movie and solid Summer entertainment.7/10",7,0,0,24 April 2015
Spider-Man 3," A pretty solid superhero franchise drives right off a cliff.
","'Spider-Man 3' wasn't so much a letdown as it was a massive disappointment. A movie that was so preoccupied with the effects budget that the filmmakers forgot to cook up a decent script. I wanted to see if five years' passage would improve my outlook on the film, but it's still just as aggravating as it was in May of 2007. For starters, the movie suffers from too many bad guys. And none of them are in Doctor Octopus' league. Harry Osborn's still super miffed at Peter Parker for killing his father (even though he didn't), and has taken up Norman's mantle as some sort of misguided Green Goblin 2. At the same time, a freak accident turns escaped con Flint Marko into the Sandman - pretty much the granulated equivalent of Robert Patrick's T-1000. He doesn't have a beef with Peter, but he does need convenient bank job money to afford health care for his sick kid (and Spidey naturally stands in his way). Peter is also dealing with anxiety over proposing to Mary Jane (whom he's fought tooth and nail for two movies to win over). That seems enough for a movie, doesn't it? Nope, needs more.A sticky black substance plummets to Earth, finds its way to Peter's apartment and bonds to his skin. Turns out it's an alien symbiote using Peter as a host organism. Good news is it makes Peter more powerful. The downside is it also makes him a bit of a douche. So Peter finally manages to get this thing off of him, where it finds another host; this time, it's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), the new photog at the Daily Bugle. Brock's relationship with the symbiote manifests itself in blind rage, and we have our third villain: Venom. The villain congestion underlines a major problem with the screenplay: Sandman's the only character that feels like he got a full showcase as bad guy. Venom and Harry are treated as momentary distractions where they feel like they could've carried a lot more of this thing. And the black costume was a pretty major storyline in the comic. But here, he's in possession all of 20 minutes' story time. It's symptomatic of too many cooks getting short shrift in the kitchen. And that is precisely what is so infuriating about Spider-Man 3: the script. One that comes as not only lazy, but altogether cheap. Take Harry's character arc, for instance:1. Harry and Peter have a knock-down drag-out fight, Harry suffers head trauma and forgets he was ever mad at Peter. 2. Harry suddenly hears his admonishing father in his head, remembers why he was out to kill Peter, and now he's evil again (more fighting) 3. The butler (who wasn't even there in the last two movies) conveniently shows up and lays it all out for Harry. Dad was the bad guy, not Spider-Man! You've had him all wrong all along! 4. Harry sees the light and proceeds to help Peter fight the Sandman and Venom. But wait, there's more ...Peter and Aunt May are told by the police that the guy they thought killed Uncle Ben in the first movie was only an accomplice. The real killer was actually ... wait for it ... Flint Marko! I'll admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to see this brand of retcon. It's smacks of laziness, and it's dismissive of the audience's intelligence. I get it - they needed to give Peter an emotional reason to go after the Sandman. But even kidnapping his girlfriend (though it's been done before) is more ingenuous than this. Or Marko could kill Harry, and that might give Peter a reason to grow annoyed. What's mystifying about 'Spider-Man 3' is witnessing just how many things went wrong, compared to just how many they got right with the previous movie. 'Spider-Man 3' has too many villains, subplots and bad writing to be anything other than background noise when you're washing the dishes. Or, when you've lost the remote, and can't shake your vegetable torpor to get up and change the channel. It's not 'Superman 3' bad, but it's not good. Not good, at all.4/10",4,3,4,17 April 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," Well-intentioned
","I've never considered myself much of a Led Zeppelin fan, but the combination of 'Immigrant Song' and the sight of Thor doing battle with a fire demon is shockingly entertaining. It's the reason why I was hooked by the film's opening. But it didn't take long for 'Ragnarok' to settle into your standard Marvel sitcom, and that was hugely disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of fun moving pieces to this movie:  - Cate Blanchett vamping up the villainy
 - Goldblum playing the hell out of Goldblum
 - The funny rock guy
 - All of the Viking and heavy metal aesthetics
 - The '80s synth scoreBut with all effort to jazz up the most boring Avenger, brevity may have been the movie's greatest asset. 6/10",6,0,2,20 March 2018
The Prestige," Masterful deceit
","I remember vividly going to see 'The Prestige' upon release - the mesmerizing twists, the movie almost folding in on itself - but it becomes more apparent on further viewings just how well constructed this movie really is. The rivalry between these two fanatics goes to some scary lengths; and even though I usually gravitate towards Hugh Jackman in this story, it's evident that Christian Bale is the more obsessive in his stagecraft (which might just be the difference in the two characters rather than the actors). I love the unfurling of this story and its Victorian setting, and it's still one of my favorite Nolan movies. But the real cherry on top, the real thrill is when (and how) they inject Nikola Tesla into the proceedings. It says a lot (negatively) that this is the most we've seen of this man in the past ten years, and he truly does need more exposure. But either way, as soon as he enters the picture, it's like 'BOOM!' the movie enters a whole new strata. And Bowie's an inspired choice for the role.Killer movie.8/10",8,0,2,6 October 2015
The Terminator," Nightmarishly gripping
","You hear the name James Cameron and immediately think of big Hollywood spectacle. I mean, if nothing else, he's a consummate showman. And yet, one of his best movies works strictly on economy. 'The Terminator' takes the B-movie premise of a killer robot stalking a young woman and infuses it with imagination. It's a terrific script that takes time travel, a love story and a nightmarish vision of the future and weaves it all into something exciting. You can see the constraints of the budget in the DIY effects, but the real joys of this movie lie in its flawless pacing and brutal efficiency. Schwarzenegger is imposing enough, but the image of the endoskeleton in the factory is still scary as hell.There's an imaginative sci-fi angle to this, but Cameron knows you just can't beat a good thriller.9/10 9/10",9,4,5,27 August 2014
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Another go-around with the right hand of doom
","Del Toro already had himself one helluva foundation to build on with the original Hellboy; and here, he leaves a massive fingerprint. The fantasy tone, the humor, the aesthetic, they all bear his trademark; and it works beautifully. This is a sequel done right, happily expanding Selma Blair's role, making quirky use of Seth McFarlane and generally offering an entertaining comic book movie. I love the fight scenes, the surprises, and the best thing is that it leaves me thirsty for more.",8,1,1,8 March 2019
Ready Player One," Game on!
","In spite of the hype, I walked into 'Ready Player One' with a certain level of apprehension. Given the source material (likable in its own right), it's easy to expect a movie adaptation to crumble under the weight of its own references. But what Spielberg does here (and it's to his immense credit) is tap into the adventure movie escapism that's really at the core of this thing. Don't get me wrong, you have to work for it. The first act is pretty much all setup and cumbersome world-building, sweetened by dazzling effects. And I'm pretty sure the wealth of easter eggs are there to ensure repeat business (or at least give the pause button a workout). But it's actually what goes on in the real world - the interactions between the characters - that makes this so fun. The effects in this movie are impressive, but I found myself taken with the little touches here and there. It's when Spielberg and Alan Silvestri riff on themselves that calls to the movie fan in me. And there's an unexpected heart to these characters and this world that'll have me coming back. It's a rare example of a movie living up to the book and standing on its own.

The Hateful Eight," Inglorious self-indulgence
","In all honesty, between the first-rate cast, the lavish presentation and the fact that it's a high-profile western, my hopes were right up there with 'The Hateful Eight'. To those ends, it's pretty great. Thick with mountain atmosphere, nice photography and Tarantino's zeal for violence. My problem is the pacing. The movie is overloaded by setup that takes forever, and the patience is rewarded with more sluggishness. I like the idea of backstories unfurling during a snowed-in stopover, and the cast is a varied roster of seasoned players going to town on that dialog (Goggins, Russell and Jackson, especially), but, truth be told, it's one of the longest 3-hour movies I've ever seen.Actually, a good way to think about this is comparing it to 'Reservoir Dogs' but without any energy. This just wasn't doing it for me.5/10",5,3,6,8 May 2016
"I, Tonya"," A self-aware gem
","There were times that I wondered how much of 'I, Tonya' were true . . . but it never really bothered me because it's just wildly entertaining. A uniformly excellent cast, irresistible soundtrack and winking sense of humor turn what could've been a standard biopic into a raucous tragedy (not even the fourth-wall breaks get old). You wouldn't know that Tonya Harding's been buried in the tabloid past to look at Margot Robbie's savage performance (same can be said for Allison Janney). There's plenty of screentime devoted to 'the incident', but the filmmakers come from behind with a sympathetic portrayal of Harding herself. A total curveball move.This was a rental I had to see twice before returning. It's sad, tense, even hysterical, and I loved every minute.",8,1,1,9 June 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Wildly entertaining
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is such a memorable movie because it's the total package. Newman and Redford are one of the great movie pairings, there's a wonderful sense of fun with the whole thing, and it's got all the beats of a great western; one that's wholeheartedly a product of its time. You don't think that Burt Bacharach would make a good western score, but it just . . . it works here. It's spare, only crops up here and there, but the acapella singers fit the tone. And it's instantly recognizable. Hell, when you hear 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' in 'Spider-Man 2', you know exactly what movie Raimi is referencing.For me, what makes this movie is the writing. I mean the dialogue on this thing! It's what makes this such a subversive bit of enjoyment, a movie about gunslinging bank-robbers that's almost too hip for its own good. This is probably the mother of all buddy movies because of that, and most of the humor comes out in the Butch-and-Sundance bickering (their back-and-forth is hilarious). They're just such a likable duo. It brings out a smile so often that, even when things become dark for our heroes (in one hell of a shootout), you walk away with high spirits from such a great ride.9/10",9,0,1,1 April 2015
Moana," Has it where it counts
","As cynical as I am about Disney movies, I freely admit that I liked 'Moana' quite a bit. It wasn't exactly a challenge with Dwayne Johnson's involvement, but the elements that are usually a turn-off . . . weren't. The songs are good, the animation's beautiful, and the formulaic heroine with sidekicks really seem to work here.Cynically speaking, Moana is just another princess for the Mouse's stable. Having said that, you could do with a lot worse. She's got the spunk and strong personality to be a winning character, and she really makes this an enjoyable story.I could easily watch this again.7/10",7,5,10,14 March 2017
Crash," Much better when it was called 'Grand Canyon'
","I had an Interpersonal Communication professor that loved the hell out of 'Crash'. It was brought up while we were discussing perception in class, and I really liked that guy. One of the best teachers I've ever had.But he and I woefully disagree on this movie.Yeah, I guess you can say it deals with perception. And race. And cosmic coincidence. But it goes about it in the most sensationalized and calculating way possible. Characters just come at each other, blindly wielding epithets because . . . well, they're supposed to, I guess. There's no organic reasoning for it. The situations aren't well-composed, and those contrivances are like red flags; you can see most of these tragic events coming from a mile away. Misfortune arises simply because these people are dicks. There's no sympathy. That's a shame, because this is a good ensemble cast.The car accident scene is (almost) the worst. Matt Dillon's been a raging prick this entire time, but a sudden burning-car rescue constitutes redemption? It's not like he called Thandie Newton a bad name earlier on, he molested her with police authority. But now, the music swells, he performs a daring feat and it's okay, it's fine. He's just a guy trying to make it in the world. Let's all feel for this guy.No.But the worst scene, when the film sinks to its lowest, is the impenetrable cloak scene. You know the one I'm talking about. Michael Peña's being held at gunpoint and his five year-old daughter runs into harm's way, BLAM! - Peña screams at the heavens, clutching his baby girl . . . but no, she's okay! She was wearing her impenetrable cloak. But wait - no, it's just that the gunman had blanks. This shows you the levels of manipulation that Paul Haggis is ready to reach, and I don't think I've ever seen such a duplicitous scene in cinema. Haggis lets the scene of horror unfold, we know where this is going, cue the emotional music! Nah, everything's okay. No harm done, all is forgiven. All wrapped up with a pretty little bow. And maybe that scene wasn't supposed to be realistic (what other reason could there be?). But then, why would such a trick be pulled in a movie dealing about an effing social crisis? 'Crash' is a movie that supposedly tackles a hard subject, one that's still pervasive for a great many people, but it doesn't do so with any seriousness. It's just theatrics. Something to make people feel like they just dealt with someone real, and can pat themselves on the back for doing so.This is disgusting.1/10",1,1,2,30 January 2015
Snatch," This is what comes to mind when I think Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn
","It's a good caper flick in its own right, but the beauty of 'Snatch' is that it's pretty much all of the best aspects of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' (subplots, characters, dialogue, soundtrack) with more polish. It's tighter and somehow has even more energy than its predecessor. But it also has the better cast, most notably ill-tempered Dennis Farina and Jason Statham in his least physical (and funniest) role. The killer dialogue flows nicely with the movie's snide sense of humor and it makes for a shockingly entertaining crime movie. It's hilarious, violent and somewhat spastic in its collection of loser criminals.8/10",8,0,2,30 June 2015
BlacKkKlansman," Smart, terrifying and brutally funny
","I've gotta be honest, with a trailer like that, 'BlacKkKlansman' held little chance of disappointment; not with such a charismatic performance from John David Washington. I can't even think of a weakness in this cast. The minute you see Alec Baldwin as a right-wing firebrand, you know you're in for something special.It all starts with the wild premise - a black police detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan - the mechanics of such an operation are massively entertaining, and the sheer audacity of it is a constant eye-brow raiser. There's unbridled evil lurking throughout this movie, but it comes in the form of the small-minded. Let's face it, these white supremacists are morons (led by an equally hapless Topher Grace as David Duke), and their cruel intentions are regularly undermined by their simple natures. But Spike Lee pulls no punches here. The statement he's out to make with this is as time-worn as it is aggressive: hate finds its way into the top levels of power. And he makes no bones about tying it directly to modern-day politics. In the end, this is a delightful period piece with an impressive cast and more than its share of laughs; a wicked surprise all around.",8,10,20,31 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Solid reboot saddled with franchise setup
","When 'Homecoming' is actually about its hero, it's a lot of fun. And I think the reason it wasn't quite amazing is that I was expecting a Spider-Man movie, not another billboard for upcoming MCU movies. It needed less Iron Man and Avengers movie shoutouts, which distract from the good stuff.But it's that good stuff where the film excels and that's due in large part to casting Tom Holland in the lead role. He delivers on the promise of that teaser appearance in 'Civil War'. And it strikes just the right coming-of-age tone; Peter belongs in high school. Michael Keaton plays the heavy with great sneer, and Marisa Tomei is exactly what you'd expect as a younger Aunt May (plus, she offers one of the greatest closing lines I've ever heard). These are great spins on classic characters. Throw in what's gotta be the funniest use of Captain America in a Marvel movie, and there's a lot to like here. It's a purely functional reboot, I just wish they'd let Spider-Man stand on his own.7/10",7,2,4,8 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Legit farce
","'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the war room!' One of the most quotable lines in movie history and also an encapsulation of 'Dr. Strangelove' as a Cold War satire: abject buffoonery played with a straight face. This movie's a classic for great reason; the situations are absurd (and you know it's funny when the film's prefaced by an Air Force reassurance that it's all make-believe) and the best lines work so well because of the performances.In that respect, it's fair to say this rests on the capable shoulders of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott. And here's the thing: Sellers deserves every bit of praise for his three different roles, allowing him to fully stretch his comedic wings. Mandrake and Muffley are amusing because of their restraint. That said, Scott's Buck Turgidson (man, what a name) has always been my favorite. If Scott comes off like a boob, it's because he's a true-believer to the point of oblivion. From facial expressions to anti-Russkie tirades, he's a lot of fun.I mean, really, after fifty years, it's still bitingly funny. This thing's a keeper.",9,2,3,20 March 2017
The Bodyguard," Watch it to remember Whitney
","I vividly remember the stranglehold Whitney Houston had on the closing months of 1992 because of THE BODYGUARD, but I didn't remember much about the actual movie. I wasn't expecting much, and I guess that's why it exceeded expectations. . . but only just.Whitney for the most part fits what the role requires: stuck-up, naturally über-talented; she doesn't need much range. This whole thing rests on the shoulders of whoever's playing her protector. And Costner's decent here; he gets to flex his action movie muscle with a sweet dive through a window into a crouch, although he's frequently got that anxious trying-to-remember-my-next-line look on his face (unusual for him). He's got a ridiculous character name - but also drives an El Camino. The man is complicated.But on the whole, the movie never rises above mediocrity. It's a love story without passion and the tension doesn't come until the last ten minutes of the movie (which it really needed much earlier). But I also didn't feel like quitting before the credits rolled, which kinda surprised me. I can see why it was the IT movie of its time (it's very '92, like a shot-for-MTV snapshot of the period), but staying power is not one of its virtues.6/10",6,0,1,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Pure nostalgia
","I'm sure anyone who's been a fan of these movies has (by now) been brow-beaten with the imperfections of 'Return of the Jedi' in pop culture; another Death Star, the story doesn't even get going until half an hour in, just a bunch of Muppets, Ford and Fisher going through the motions, Ewoks. And you can't escape the Lucasfilm merchandising muscle when watching this.But for me, this just taps right into those days before I was cognizant of most of these complaints. That's right, back when I was a kid. I can't tell you how big a jolt I still get when Luke ignites that green saber (man, that sound!), and to see him stroll onto the screen in full Jedi Knight regalia and badass calm is always a treat. And ILM is at the top of their game here; the attack on the Death Star (which is a really cool image in its unfinished state) and space battle trumps everything Lucas did in the prequels. The Speeder Bike chase, the Endor atmosphere, this had such a cool look to a lot of it.'Jedi' doesn't reach the adult heights of 'Empire' or the classical thrills of 'Star Wars', but its power lies in its ability to timelessly transport me back to being a kid. There's no pretense here.8/10",8,1,2,20 May 2015
Fast & Furious 6," Faster, louder and way too long
","They've brought this series a long way from the streets of East L.A.; exotic locales, more characters, gonzo stunts and frenetic editing. But it's still the same hokey dramatic plot twists, hot-body posturing and really bad one-liners from way back. And the fast cutting and noise with these car chases just grows numbing after a while. I'm not kidding myself; I know I'm not the target audience. And that audience is specific and well-catered to. But this is really bad soap opera. On the plus side, it's still fun to watch The Rock work, and they sweetened the pot with Gina Carano. But this recurring cast is awful. 5/10On second thought, what i really do like about the last two movies is their serial nature. The end of one folds right into the beginning of another. You don't see that every day on the big screen.",5,3,6,3 February 2014
Blade II," Familiar, different and just as good as the first.
","The beauty of 'Blade II' is that it works both as a sequel and as a standalone. With just a few minutes of intro, you know what you're getting walking into with this, either way. Snipes, for his part, falls back in easily and does what he does best. He's the perfect Blade. And Guillermo Del Toro has his fingerprints all over this thing with the Reapers. It's much more stylish than the original, but it's also shamelessly ridiculous. They retconned Whistler back to life and didn't even blink doing it (although, try to imagine this movie without Kristofferson). And that's really part of its charm. There's plenty of bad CGI here (Snipes is full-on digital in a few scenes), but then again, it was 2002 - they were computerizing everybody back then. There's also Ron Perlman, so there's that going for it.But when all is said and done, this is a pure action movie, and there's a constant flow of energy. Fight scenes and Blade movies go hand-in-hand, and this one's got some great ones.7/10",7,1,6,27 January 2015
Alien," The stuff of nightmares
","It's kinda funny, when you get right down to it, 'Alien' is just a guy in a monster suit terrorizing a bunch of space truckers. But oh, man, what they do with that premise. It's a revered classic for good reason; it draws you right in and traps you aboard the cramped confines of a dingy space freighter while a horrific twin-jawed best kills off the crew one by one. But this thing just oozes atmosphere, from the Nostromo's claustrophobic corridors to the workaday lives of these characters. 'Alien' is cold, frightening and introduces one of the great movie monsters. Supreme craftsmanship, all the way.But seriously, if there's any doubt as to the impact of this movie, look up the '79 trailer on YouTube. It was a genius marketing campaign ('In space, no one can hear you scream' . . . there's no topping that), and it's got to be the most effective trailer I've ever laid eyes on.8/10",8,4,7,17 June 2012
The Polar Express," Has not aged well
","I don't think time has been very kind to 'The Polar Express', at least not for me. It certainly hasn't been kind to the motion capture effects, making the characters look stranger than ever (and keeping me at arm's length from the film). I remember getting caught up in the rhetoric when this thing was first released, and paying to see it in IMAX. That did wonders for the roller- coaster camera effects, but on the small screen, it's apparent that that coaster ride is the frame on which the movie hangs. That 'thrill-a- minute' preoccupation was distracting when I was more interested in seeing the gorgeously rendered North Pole. And the schmaltzy 'message' heaped on top of the event film that this was engineered to be just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.And in the interest of admitting personal bias, the songs are what really drag this movie down for me. I'm not a musical guy, so they were tolerable back in '04. The bad news is that they've tended toward the grating in the ensuing years. The good news is that Hanks still shines. Let's not kid ourselves, he carries this movie, playing most of the main characters and lending the film its heart and soul. But Ebert was wrong when he said this is destined to become a holiday classic. It doesn't belong anywhere near the likes of 'A Christmas Story', 'It's A Wonderful Life' or even 'Scrooged'. I'll stick with the Van Allsburg book.5/10",5,0,3,5 December 2012
Malcolm X," An unbelievable life story
","Right to the point: I've got nothing but love for 'Malcolm X'.Less a biopic than a sweeping American epic, it details the man's staggering journey from guttersnipe to cultural firebrand. It's absorbing on that aspect alone, but Denzel Washington in the lead role is another matter entirely. This is an actor who manages to embody the character, nearly disappearing into the role and making it come alive. Washington's skills at the pulpit highlight the ferocity of this character who inspires rebellion among his congregation. This is a resplendent film, well-mounted and carried out with conviction. It's easy to get wrapped up in and hard to forget once the credits role.",8,0,1,17 February 2020
Suicide Squad," I didn't heed the warnings, and I wish I did.
","They say that most of Jared Leto's scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. That's the good news. And that's as humorous as I can be about this. You don't have to be a fanboy to see that the approach was all wrong; to the characters, the tone, even the soundtrack. I don't want to throw gas on the fire here, but the quicker I can forget about this Hot Topic DC movie, the better.It's godawful.",2,1,2,13 June 2018
Elf," Admirable family film
","I never gave 'Elf' much consideration, and it's not 'A Christmas Story' levels of classic, but there's a lot to be said for Will Ferrell in elf booties roaming wide-eyed the streets of New York City. I guess the movie hinges on that central arrested development innocence vs. modern-day yuletide cynicism, but that ain't a bad thing. Favreau squeezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces and the guy really is an endearing spaz. I like the cast, Peter Dinklage is a great easter egg (for lack of a better phrase) and it's just the right dosage of holiday warmth. Sweet, but not stifling.7/10",7,3,4,19 December 2015
Taxi Driver," Good luck shaking this one off
","'Taxi Driver', besides introducing the unforgettable anti-hero Travis Bickle, deserves heaps of credit for its prolonged potency. This is a movie that gets under your skin, hits a nerve. Scorsese gives us a front-row seat to bear witness to Bickle's descent into marginalized madness. It's an uncomfortable trip, certainly, due in no small part to De Niro's jacked-up intensity. His isolation grows from awkwardly heartbreaking to deeply unnerving to straight-out mystifying when underage Jodie Foster becomes involved. Not to mention the assassination attempt. This is some fascinating stuff, and I really liked how the jazzy score played against the lurid subject matter. Urban decay has never been so engaging.8/10",8,0,2,1 May 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not bad at all
","There are a few things at which 'the Winter Soldier' excels. One, it's entertaining (draggy in parts, but overall great). For another, it's got some great chemistry. I liked the repartee between Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson. She delivers a lot of her lines almost with a knowing wink. But there's a genuine relationship between Cap and Falcon (someone who's introduced as an actual fleshed-out character). And I do love that this is a '70s political thriller masquerading as a comic book movie. Secrets govern everything, D.C. is choked up with sleeper agents and the mistrust runs deep.As a sequel, it's self-assured and a great Captain America story. And with another Avengers movie on the horizon, it's not a glorified commercial, which is saying something.7/10",7,2,4,19 April 2014
Lost in Translation," Oddly absorbing
","This might be the most relaxing movie I've ever seen - though it's not boring, and I think that's an important distinction. But it has a calming effect despite its abject melancholic ending.Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson share a touching chemistry as two restless souls in a foreign land. And the movie belongs to them. But how often do you see Tokyo seen as a mystifying culture as confusing as it is dreamlike? I guess 'Black Rain', but this is a much more subtle (and unnerving) depiction. It all feeds into the movie's sense of alienation and humor, both of which this pretty much nails.It's a great movie all around; a fine example of midlife ennui.8/10",8,0,0,4 November 2016
Tangled," By-the-numbers Disney fluff
","As recent Disney movies go, 'Tangled' is largely forgettable stuff. It looks like your typical CGI kids movie, and there's not a lot to these characters or the story.But my kid loves it, so they must be doing something right. She usually gets a kick out of Flynn Rider's antics - particularly the 'smoldering' scene and when he gets a frying pan over the head and stashed in a wardrobe. Which brings us to the movie's real charm: Zachary Levi, who makes Rider a likable guy and infuses this movie with much-needed personality. The guy's just plain charming, and his contribution to this movie cannot be understated.5/10",5,3,7,18 February 2015
Doctor Strange," Marvel as self-parody?
","'By far, my least favorite.' It was my wife who said that, which surprised me. She loves the MCU and is genuinely hard to displease as a person.But I agree. 'Doctor Strange' is several things, but primarily a mechanical origin story; as such, easily the least involving of these movies. It's all 'Inception' visuals and 'The Matrix' reality-bending. Strange himself lacks charisma, something Cumberbatch doesn't help, and his all-important lesson about arrogance lacks weight.It's certainly an expensive movie, and the CGI is top-shelf. But those furnishings and that solid cast are carrying a weak story.5/10",5,1,2,16 June 2017
Full Metal Jacket," Not Kubrick's best, but still interesting
","'Full Metal Jacket' isn't one of those movies I can watch with any sort of regularity. I'm pretty sure it's been 15 years' time since last I watched this, and it'll be another 15 before the next time. It's the kind of movie you see just to say you've done it; to finally get the pop culture references.In any case, the movie is never more compelling than in its first hour. Lee Ermey's larger-than-life drill sergeant varies from amusing to funny to scary. The writing is on the all with Vincent D'Onofrio's character from the beginning, and the conclusion to his vignette is undeniably haunting. But then the gears switch into a wayward war movie, moving from one firefight to the next, nowhere near as interesting as it was in the barracks.Ultimately, what you've got here is a great first half and a dull second, and the movie so clearly belongs to Ermey. But then again, a lot of this movie felt contrived in the service of that abusive drill sergeant. Pyle - drafted or not - should never have been there in the first place. That kid would never hold up to basic training, and the end result was foregone from the outset. He was basically there for Ermey to light into, and that makes the full metal jacket scene ring pretty hollow.6/10",6,0,1,14 February 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Oscar-worthy performances, uneven movie
","I'll say this: I very much enjoyed seeing ''Three Billboards' and would recommend it to anyone that asks, but it's because of the talent involved onscreen. Everyone in the main cast is incredible and these players help keep the movie going when the story falters. McDormand, for her part, is a force of nature, and years' worth of this character's pain and unflagging determination reside on the actor's face; the smolder in her gaze does plenty of talking. It's why the first half of the movie is exhilarating. Tonally, it's a bit off, with that excitement waning at around the halfway point (almost precisely with the death of a major character) as sorrow and brutality take over. Sadly, we never get that opening power back, and this feeds into a complicated ending. But one thing I really liked about this movie is that it does become about more than McDormand's grieving and turns into a small-town drama; and empathy comes from the most unexpected of characters. Despite any of these issues, it's highly worthwhile and I doubt I'll forget about this anytime soon.7/10",7,1,1,2 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Welp, this is how it ends . . .
","Not a bad movie, considering the negative word-of-mouth as of late. I've heard it said over the years that the right audience can make or break a movie, and I had just the right people. My wife and daughter really seemed to enjoy this movie, and I let that color my impressions unabashedly. Babu Frik, Lando, Kylo Ren's opening rampage; there were moments I got into because of the people sitting with me. On that basis, it falls in line with J.J. Abrams' usual passable blockbuster, and on this particular Sunday morning, it wasn't bad.But Sweet Jesus, this movie has problems.Right out of the gate, it's apparent that Disney did not have a roadmap for this sequel trilogy (and desperately needed one). Now we have have J.J. Abrams feverishly trying to repudiate The Last Jedi with every move. Then again, we also have his manic plotting and fetch quests running at full tilt. Not to mention his overt fascination with 'moments' and callbacks to the Original Trilogy. We had plenty of that in The Force Awakens, now's your chance to slow down and let things breathe as we close this saga out.No dice.I know I sound like an Abrams hater -- but I'm not, I know what I'm in for with every one of his movies. I just think he was the wrong choice for this job. As much as I love the middle chapter in this latest series, the handling of the trilogy as a whole was haphazard from the beginning. I'm as susceptible to nostalgia bait as anyone (that trailer for the new Ghostbusters was incredible), but this is like weaponized member berries.",6,2,14,17 February 2020
Pacific Rim," The love child of Rock 'em Sock 'em robots and Godzilla movies. And that is glorious!
","PACIFIC RIM delivers on the promise of big Summer popcorn action that that's been so disappointing did the past few years. The fight scenes are comprehensible - more rare these days with frantic camera-work - the CGI sure ain't cut-rate (the budget's right there on the screen) and the sound design adds just the right punch to the whole thing. The cast is just unconventional enough to pull off the cocky flyboy band of heroes (anchored by a commanding Idris Elba, not to mention the lovely Rinko Kikuchi). It's a well put-together piece of entertainment.The kicker with this movie is that I was engaged in the proceedings enough to be thrilled - and on the small screen, no less. In all honesty, I wish I hadn't missed this in the theater, and you can bet I'll be there for the sequel. There's a little kid in me that this appeals directly to; a big-budget excuse to see giant flippin' robots wailing on city-stomping monsters. It doesn't get any purer than that.8/10",8,0,2,10 January 2015
American Sniper," Fascinating character study
","The lion's share of 'American Sniper' is spent overseas and on the battlefield, but it's not that war movie that really interested me. It's the scenes when Kyle is back home that the movie bears some real weight. This character is so hard-wired and mentally with his brothers-in-arms that he can't explain to those back at home why he has to keep going back to Iraq. But it's also heartbreaking to see the destructive effects on his family life. Chris and his wife started out s something exciting, but the relationship suffers when he's back home; the anxiety increases simply when they're having a marital chat.It might be that, between 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty', I've just gotten bored with battle scenes in that region. The shootouts and ambushes weren't doing it for me (well-staged though they were). Not sure. But when the movie becomes (almost) anti-war is where the real tension happens. And give Bradley Cooper some real credit here; he really seems to inhabit that Texas drawl, rather than just affecting an accent. That, and the bulked physique, he's throwing himself into this role.7/10",7,0,4,18 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Dull and slapped together
","'Attack of the Clones', while not the worst of the lot, feels the least like a Star Wars movie. It's a very weird feeling. But there's also a very slipshod quality to it, at least from a writing standpoint. The Syfo Dyas thing could've been more fleshed out, Jango Fett is hardly a character that warrants so much screen time, and Anakin Skywalker is just such a lackluster character. I didn't care about him for a second (even while Lucas demands as much by killing off his mother), but then I didn't care about anybody in this movie. Again, very strange.But it also features the series two worst lightsaber duels. The fight between Anakin and Dooku is so badly staged (lit only by sabers, losing all sense of geography), while Yoda goes full-on Sonic the Hedgehog when he gets his hands on a blade. It's fascinating how badly these setpieces were composed.It's not the series' worst, but it's kinda dumb and lacks the spark and adventure of the others.4/10",4,0,5,18 February 2015
Romeo + Juliet," Nope
","It's obvious from the start that 'Romeo + Juliet' is Baz Luhrmann's stab at making the story relevant to the '90s, and I can appreciate that. Hell, if it weren't for 10th grade English class, who knows if I'd ever try my luck at Shakespeare? He's not the most accessible author around.But the execution is way off. Warring families are updated to street gangs and swords are branded as guns (literally), but the dialogue is strictly Elizabethan era. Those words and the contemporary setting do not mix. At all. It's especially jarring in the opening scenes with the spazzed-out gangbangers. This is a movie packaged for the MTV crowd; the direction's cartoonish, the style frenetic and any soul this story had is lost in translation.It's bad.3/10",3,0,1,19 August 2016
Ant-Man," Usual Marvel fare, but not as polished
","I can't say I've ever had any interest in Ant-Man as a comics reader, so I wasn't chomping at the bit for the movie version. And it's a mixed bag, but I do like the heist movie angle. And when the movie's actually about the titular hero, it's some good fun. There's imagination in the effects, and some solid laughs in shrinking the big superhero fights down to a small level. But the villain was much more interesting when he was named Obadiah Stane, and the tone of the movie was oddly (overly) morose during the Douglas/Lilly portion of the story. And the subatomic sequence was iffy.Honestly, it's the story. Ant-Man was featured in 'Civil War' for what, 5 minutes, and he was the movie's highlight. I think I was spoiled by the more comic tone of his appearance in that movie, and I wasn't expecting such a sullen outing here. At any rate, bottom line, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as enjoyable as it is without Paul Rudd. He is thoroughly likable and honestly what makes all of this work. I wouldn't mind seeing him suit up for a sequel, but he needs better material.And somebody please take that awful wig off of Evangeline Lilly.6/10",6,0,0,18 June 2016
21 Jump Street," It's predictable, but the laughs sneak up on you
","Nick Offerman had one of the great lines in 21 JUMP STREET:'You see, the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle sh-t from the past and expect us all not to notice.'Which is funny, but even still: how do these properties get picked for remake/reboot/refranchising? Someone, somewhere thought it was a good idea to take the Johnny Depp show from the '80s and revamp it, but how'd they arrive at this particular property? Do the suits write a bunch of names on the wall and wherever the dart lands, that's what's getting remade? In any event, 21 JUMP STREET works mostly because of its script and the chemistry between the two leads. Some of the jokes work well, others fall flat. Subverting the high school archetypes was also a clever bit. And I didn't expect to like Jonah Hill as much as I did, but that kinda goes for the whole thing. Channing Tatum made for surprisingly funny physical comedy. And it's really those two that make this work as well as it does - although, it was kinda funny seeing one person from every sitcom under the sun showing up here. It's pretty good stuff, and as for reheating the past goes, it's a winner. Also, really liked that Johnny Depp showed up at the end. 7/10",7,3,5,28 June 2014
American Hustle," Terrific cast, but uneven story
","'American Hustle''s inherent theme of reinvention is one I appreciate, but my enjoyment was derived (surprisingly) from outside the central Bale-Adams-Cooper trio. Though I did like the fast one they pulled at the end, I didn't really care about these characters. Jennifer Lawrence, though she seemed too young for the role, was riveting in her hot mess of a performance. Michael Peña and Louis C.K. were also highlights. But it was the technical side that I liked the most: the soundtrack, the production design, the wardrobe (splendid array of plunging necklines), the old Columbia logo before the opening credits - the general '70s vibe and atmosphere that was damn well created. Loved all of it. But overall, I missed what many found to love about 'American Hustle'. And I'm hoping I'll find more to like on rewatch. 5.5/10",5,1,1,23 March 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Heavy is the crown
","The original 'Godfather' ended with Kay literally being shut out of her husband's business (a deafening statement on her future). The same thing happens again in 'Part II' but with devastating results. And that's emblematic of the movie as a whole; it marks every box on the sequel checklist (more this, bigger that) but in the context of a profoundly downbeat story. The brilliance of this film is the use of flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone (De Niro). It's contrasting his rise with Michael's fall and moral decay, tracking the various bombshells in each man's life (the hits on Fanucci and Ciccio, an abortion, 'You broke my heart, Fredo.'). It's ideal for showing just how badly Michael is operating under the strain of power. The paranoia is palpable. 'The Godfather: Part II' is always the movie that's cited when discussing superior sequels. I don't know that I'd go that far, but I think it's a fantastic movie regardless, and certainly warrants any claims to greatness. If anything, it lacks the original's tight and near-perfect packaging, but makes up for that in undeniable ambition. Both are exceptional, but for different reasons. 8/10",8,0,1,13 July 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," Pounds pulses like nobody's business
","It's a tall order for a third movie to live up to what's come before it, but THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM does just that. I love how they play with the narrative; that most of the movie happens during the last few minutes of SUPREMACY. And even though we're constantly teased with the origin story of Jason Bourne, they actually deliver it, to a degree. This is a hell of an action movie. The fight scenes are brutal, the pacing's relentless (Greengrass just doesn't let up) and the constant motion gets to be a high after a while. The final car chase is beyond absurd, but you're so pumped at that point that it kinda fits. Really the only negative I can think of is the idea put forth that Bourne and Nikki were ever in a relationship . . . but that's got nothing on the rest of the movie. It fires on all cylinders. 8/10",8,1,1,16 September 2014
Fargo," A home run for the Coen Bros.
","What's cool about 'Fargo' (and there's plenty here to like) is that the crime-solving police officer is a woman -pregnant, no less- and on one treats her any differently. Marge Gunderson's a great character, and kudos to Frances McDormand for bringing her so vividly to life. But in and of itself, 'Fargo is a great crime movie, full of quirk and memorable characters (gotta love the Minnesotan accents), and darkly hilarious from beginning to end. The blinding white snow lends a great atmosphere to the whole thing. And no one involved in the crime is altogether bright, so you know this thing's going to go South in every possible way. Buscemi and Macy both play terrific losers (you just want to wring Macy's neck, he's such a sad sack), and the movie is full of Cieras! A loser car to go with the movie's pack of loser criminals. It all makes for one terrifically entertaining movie. And that image of the socked foot sticking out of the woodchipper is one for the ages. 8/10",8,0,0,28 February 2014
Predator," Lean 'n mean sci-fi action
","Boy, if this isn't a can't-lose proposition: take an (almost) all-male cast of commando badasses - plus Shane Black and his awesomely awful jokes - throw 'em in a jungle with a murderous alien hunter and put John McTiernan in the director's chair? Win-win, that one. PREDATOR is a wicked mix of Rambo artillery, inventive sci-fi and blockbuster action that still holds today. It's tightly paced, the cast all have great macho personality, and when an exhausted Schwarzenegger flies out on that chopper, you feel like you've just seen something special. It's one of those movies you just have to sit down and watch if it's on cable.8/10",8,1,2,30 December 2014
Nightcrawler," A lead actor so off-putting, yet mesmerizing
","There are good performances from others in the cast of 'Nightcrawler' (Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton), but this is Jake Gyllenhaal's show, without a doubt. His character is all platitudes and fake corporate speak, and his gaunt appearance really ratchets the creep levels. But it's his shrewd opportunism as a DIY one-man camera crew - not just in strong arming the news outlet to buy his footage, but also beating the police to a murder suspect - where he devolves into a sociopath. Indeed, this might just be the most unlikable character I've seen from him. Its sheer menace hidden beneath awkward social graces that makes this guy so riveting. The whole movie, for that matter, which maintains its high levels of watchability even in the quiet moments.I imagine the ending will turn off many, but it's a delightfully absurd way to go out.8/10",8,0,1,13 March 2015
Léon: The Professional," I guess I expected a cheap actioner, but this offered much more
","It's funny, I remember seeing the laserdisc for 'Léon' at a store back in the '90s. The cover featured a blurb that read (I'm paraphrasing from memory), 'It'll make 'Speed' feel like a slow ride to Grandma's house', which always left with me with a particular thrill-ride impression. The truth couldn't be any further from that description, but there's something deeper here than just action junk food and that's why the movie comes on like a sucker punch.Everyone in this cast is extremely well chosen, but Oldman threatens to steal the show with his signature psychopathy. Geez, that guy. And on the subject of action, this has it, no question. When Reno dons his beanie, you know you're in for some bloody fun. But the movie's real asset is the pairing of hit-man and orphan (Reno and Portman, respectively). It's an unlikely relationship, but also earnest enough to really go for the heart at just the right point.It may look and feel like a Luc Besson action movie, but it's very well made and thoughtful in its sadistic approach. There's emotional resonance here, to be sure.8/10",8,1,1,11 March 2016
Oblivion," When the bullets aren't flying, it's pretty engaging sci-fi
","The best of what 'Oblivion' has to offer is its unique look. It features a distinctive style and design from the weapons, air/spacecraft to the architecture (man, that house in the sky is something) that makes this Apple store future inviting. This is a visually attractive movie, there can be no doubt.It's somewhere in the second half that the movie starts to question everything thus far, and switches gears into action movie with a series of shootouts. Surprisingly, this is where it started to lose me. Even so, the answers provided in the third act are a nice payoff. Iit ends on a poignant, hopeful note. For a Tom Cruise sci-fi, it's a solid movie - not as satisfying as 'Edge of Tomorrow' or 'Minority Report', but still pretty good. And after 'TRON: Legacy', Joseph Kosinski is someone to keep an eye on.7/10",7,0,0,10 February 2015
Watchmen," The fidelity should be praised, but maybe not the style
","'Watchmen' has an intro (from the first shot to the end of the opening credits) that's somehow mesmerizing. Just something about the marriage of sight and sound that I get lost in. It's dark and brutal, but it's easy to get carried along. And then Bob Dylan starts playing and it's always a stark reminder that I'm in for one hell of a soundtrack (it's incredible).It's a (mostly) entertaining movie, but it's never as good as those first few minutes. And I think that's ultimately why my enjoyment has diminished over the years (especially given its runtime). I'm usually more inclined to pick up the book instead. Zac Snyder deserves bonus points for such strict adherence to the comic book; on the other hand, there's no subtlety and he loves his slo-mo shots. Believe it or not, that can get old after awhile. Maybe that's why it works better on the page.6/10",6,2,3,31 August 2016
The Bourne Identity," Still packs a thrill. Terrific action movie and the start of a great series.
","It's funny how Summer movies play out over time. I vividly remember the big tentpole releases of 2002 ('Spider-Man', 'Attack of the Clones', 'Road to Perdition', 'Minority Report'), and none of them hold up for me as well as 'The Bourne Identity'. It was a gamble back then to cast Matt Damon in the lead role (even though Liman & Co. clearly spun the Bourne novels into something else of their own), but it pays off. Damon is fully up to the task and brings his A game, belying his fresh-faced looks and convincingly brings a lethal spy to life. It also helps that he's backed by Chris Cooper and Brian Cox, but he deserves loads of credit. The beauty of this thing is that it just doesn't seem to lose steam. Bourne's always moving (and therefore, so are we), whether he's trading fists or bullets, playing Spider-Man on the side of a building, or tearing up the streets of Paris in a well-done car chase (with a great song choice). But even in the quiet scenes, the mystery continues to deepen, and our attention is never adrift. And this was before Greengrass' hyperactive editing took over in the sequels. That takes skill. The movie's got plenty going for it: the car chase, the fight scenes, the rapport between Damon and Potente, the seething rage in Cooper, beautiful locations, and the occasional sense that anything can happen (indeed, shockingly brutal fight scenes). Solid spy/action movie, and all-around entertaining.7.5/10",7,0,1,13 May 2013
Baby Driver," Joyride on cloud nine
","Surprises this pleasing just don't come along often.'Baby Driver' is a heist movie, and as such, it feels indebted to other luminaries (The Driver, Bullitt, Drive, Heat, etc). The only difference here is that the wheelman is someone more akin to Starlord than the usual loner. And just like those movies, jobs go wrong and loyalties swap quickly. But Baby (Ansel Elgort) doesn't belong in this underworld. He's not Gosling or McQueen, and that's where the movie reinvigorates the subgenre. Once the love interest (Lily James) gets dragged in, this reaches a whole different level.But here's where the movie's real magic comes in. It's not just for lovers of fast cars and stunt driving (i.e. me); it's more about the universal appeal of music and how it soundtracks everything we do. It's why there's such bubbly pleasure to be had from both the chase scenes and something mundane, like going out for coffee. This is one big fanciful mixtape, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie make such novel use of it before. The songs really get into your pores. It's just an added bonus that there are brilliantly choreographed car chases to go with it.I can almost guarantee that one cannot walk out of this movie without wearing a huge smile. It's almost a high.9/10",9,7,12,11 July 2017
Justice League," This horse needs to be put down
","Rumor has it that DC Comics has little control over the cinematic universe, which goes a long way in explaining 'Justice League'. To paraphrase Mark Brendanawicz, this movie's a camel; a horse made by committee. In other words, nothing about it works; certainly not the characters, each and every team member is either forced (The Flash) or just flat. Their personalities are terrible. I don't know why this was so frustrating exactly. There's nothing about it that really angers me, but just as well, there's nothing about it that makes me look forward to more from the studio. It's a cheap, washed-out excuse for a four-color fantasy, another passable movie to clog up the genre. 5/10",5,4,7,2 May 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," Continues the trilogy's downward trend
","'The Matrix Revolutions' suffers from the same problems that plague 'Reloaded', although this time there's an unshakably depressing tone. The movie has a sort-of hopeful ending, but it's still a major downer, and the core three characters deserved better. And a sizable chunk of the movie's running time is spent on the garish Zion scenes (sure, that's where the film's humanity is, but I kept wanting to return to the admittedly more striking world of the Matrix).But the movie's preoccupied with the idea of Neo and Smith as two variables in a larger equation. And the weird thing is that, for that larger theme and for all of the fight moves and bullets fired, everything comes down to an underwhelming Superman fistfight.It shouldn't be this boring. That's the most disappointing thing about all of this.3/10",3,1,1,5 May 2014
Man of Steel," It's not that 'Man of Steel' is a bad movie, it's just that there's nothing here for me to grab onto.
","And that's mostly because they spent too much running time and money on the wrong things. Lots of expensive (and garish) CGI. Not enough time getting to know these characters (Laurence Fishburne really got the shaft here, but there's also no chemistry developed between Lois and Superman). So much time is spent on/in Kryptonian settings that there were times I forgot this was a Superman movie. It also doesn't help that Zod's a lame bad guy. And that overwrought Zimmer score won't stop. And how do you completely remove the soul from Pa Kent? Who was that guy they got Costner to play?But it's still no 'Superman III', and here's what they did right:Snyder's movie stands on its own, devoid of any chains to the Donner films (thought that'd never happen). They also delivered on the flying scenes, emphasizing Superman's power (and his smile when first taking to the skies is infectious), not to mention some majestic cape shots. And it's also a good cast, they just need some actual meat to work with. Which brings me to the movie's greatest strength: the man wearing the tights. Henry Cavill makes for a terrific Superman, charismatic, and boasting a physique to weep openly over. He's absolutely the reason I'd watch a sequel, and I cannot speak highly enough of Cavill's turn in the role.But this material shouldn't be so dark. They Nolanized it and made everything Batman serious. That's not Superman. If his S-shield is a symbol of hope, then this film is a surprisingly bleak affair.Not to mention uncharacteristically colorless.5/10",5,2,5,30 December 2013
Grease," Iconic
","Full confession: In a '50s musical, my favorite song is Frankie Valli's titular disco track. That's what's kind funny about this movie: it's youthful midcentury Americana by way of the '70s. But it's also pretty much a cinema staple - you're an oddball if you haven't seen this (I mean even the '98 rerelease was enough to tell me that back in high school).Musicals aren't my thing, so I'm not the ideal audience for this - but even I can appreciate big set pieces and elaborate dance numbers. And any time you see the L.A. river in a movie, you think of this drag race. That alone says a lot about the movie's legacy. But the cast looks good (even the way-too-old Stockard Channing), the songs are lively, and you don't really see this kind of thing anymore.6/10",6,0,0,18 April 2016
Footloose," The cure-all power of dance!
","Either I missed the boat on this one, or it's really as superficial as 'Flashdance'. 'Footloose' has that packaged-for-MTV feel to it and the rest is cartoonishly serious. I dig Lithgow, but his character's turn from pained fascist to sympathizer is awful. Between the book-burning scene and the spirited game of tractor chicken (set to 'I Need a Hero', sheesh), this gets pretty silly. What was odd is that usually movies are able to pull off teenagers with older actors, but everyone looked way too old here.This is a soundtrack movie all the way, and Loggins is calling the shots. But I'd rather just have the album.5/10",5,0,6,6 August 2015
The Color of Money," You're here to see Eddie Felson again, and Scorsese delivers
","'The Color of Money', which I guess is a better title than just 'Green', has some big shoes to fill as a sequel. I mean, 'The Hustler' was something else. And it would've been really cool to see Jackie Gleason return, but at least we get a hotheaded Tom Cruise (and there is nothing in this world quite like a Cruise tantrum).But it's not a bad movie, and it's at its most entertaining when some actual pool is being shot; the camera work, watching the two stars work their cue magic, it's great stuff. And speaking of Paul Newman, he is the charismatic core of this movie, especially when he regains his long-dormant hustler mojo. It's more exciting than you'd think.7/10",7,0,1,10 December 2015
The Thing," A 'Thing' of beauty
","Take ten guys (all on the raggedy edge), strand them in the middle of frozen nowhere and trap them with an alien monster that wants to replace them one by one . . . Hell of that isn't a surefire recipe for a kickass horror movie. And more than that, 'The Thing' boasts a genuinely palpable sense of atmosphere, even from just the sound design alone. John Carpenter sows the seeds of mistrust early on and that feeling just compounds as the story unfurls. This is a masterpiece of paranoia. It's why, even after we get to a point when the effects no longer hold up (they still do), this will still be an intensely unnerving movie. Ballsy, too,a with that ambiguous ending (not to mention the fantastic closing line).Also, Kurt Russell and a flamethrower. This movie's operating on a whole other level! 10/10",10,2,5,28 August 2012
Lilo & Stitch," Fares even better on rewatch
","'Lilo and Stitch' is an approachable movie because of its charms, in each of the main characters. Lilo has got to be the cutest Disney character in existence. Stitch on the other hand is a lovable spaz. And when I first watched this movie, that likability and the Elvis soundtrack made for a generally pleasing movie.All of that seems heightened on the second go-around. I clearly admit bias as Lilo reminds me of my own kid. But she has great chemistry with Stitch and it enhances the broken family story. I can't relate to that, so I don't know how realistic it really is - but it's emotionally effective and it's not overdone.This is top-tier (modern) Disney, with surprising wit and an ideal voice cast. The songs are good, the sentiment is endearing and this just hits all the right notes.It's a great movie8/10",8,4,5,5 July 2016
Armageddon," Loud, dumb and . . . not fun
","I realize everyone's already asked this question, but it's still worth asking: Criterion? Really? There's a lot wrong with 'Armageddon'. The choking sentiment; the specious logic; bad science; awful dialogue; and (hands down) the worst movie song I've ever heard. One good thing is that it's not Michael Bay's worst movie. That's something. But it is his patented sensory assault; between the dizzying cuts and the restless camera, this must be what a coke binge feels like.4/10 While we're on the subject, how did they arrive at Aerosmith for the radio tie-in? I guess when you've got a ballad on your hands, who better to tackle that beast than a cat in a blender?",4,2,6,5 July 2016
American Psycho," Perfect casting brings it all together
","One thing that I never hear mentioned with 'American Psycho' (around these parts at least) is its production design. And this is one of my favorite things about this movie. The costuming, set dressing and locations all come together to create a believable high-end '80s world. There's genuine atmosphere here, especially with the steamy nighttime streets. It's remarkable because the movie was filmed in Toronto. They did an incredible job with the look of this movie.The other genius move is the casting of Christin Bale as Patrick Bateman. Hes become an accomplished actor in the last 15 years, without a doubt, but this is still my favorite performance. Bateman's such an empty shell, a societal poser spewing PR blurbs, and Bale infuses him with a manic energy, balancing it with the ever-slipping sanity. His environment is full of the self-absorbed yuppie culture (no one knows anybody else) and his psychosis beautifully satirizes the self-absorbed culture where status rules. There's so much more personality here than the character had on the page.But in the end, it's a terrific black comedy. The dialogue's chock-full of memorable one-liners (we're talking 'Lebowski' levels here; even if you haven't see the movie, you've heard the quotes), the songs are great, and when all is said and done, it's just a thoroughly entertaining movie.9/10",9,0,0,6 December 2011
North by Northwest," About as classic as they come.
","One thing about Cary Grant's character in 'North by Northwest': he's amazingly good-natured about the whole kidnap/murder thing. He's also surprisingly hangover-free after all that booze they pumped into him. Can't say I'd be so happy-go-lucky. But these are tiny nits to pick in an otherwise top-notch thriller, full of intrigue, paranoia and a bit of whimsy. It's remarkable how suspense just builds and builds in this movie (Hitchcock really was boss). And both the crop-duster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are iconic for a reason (their scramble on the face of the mountain is a real nail-biter).This movie's got it all: some great action, sharp dialogue between Grant and Saint, and some striking use of locations (the U.N. lobby and James Mason's cantilevered house, especially). Of what I've seen from Hitchcock, it's probably his most entertaining.9/10",9,1,3,20 February 2014
The Shining," Gotta be the creepiest effing thing I've ever seen
","I'm used to the gore and cheap jump scares of modern horror, so I was expecting the scariness of 'The Shining' to have dulled over 35 years.Nope.Psychology, that's where the real horror lies. That, and the claustrophobic atmosphere (pretty snow on the outside, encroaching madness on the inside). Hopeless isolation. And it doesn't help matters that Kubrick plays on your emotions. He just wouldn't let up with the often-terrified expressions on Danny Lloyd's face, but it is extremely effective. And between the tracking shots, movements and unbalanced camera angles, it's just watching the maestro at work, turning the screws just a little bit more. Cold and calculated.And let me just say that, even though it's never mentioned alongside the other famous images ('Heeere's Johnny!', the twins, REDRUM, the blood), the woman in the bathtub scene was the scariest. The reveal in the mirror, her cackling, the unrelenting strings - Jesus Christ, 'unnerving' would be the understatement of the year. Kubrick turns something erotic into . . . that?! Maybe it's because that's the movie's first real scare, but that scene left its mark, no question.What a movie!9/10",9,3,6,16 August 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Amazing Spider-Verse
","I'd written the trailer off as an excuse to showcase somebody else other than Peter Parker; and that's kinda true. No point muddying up the MCU with alternate Spider-(wo)men. But that's selling it unbelievably short. 'Into the Spider-Verse' is an opportunity to see other people slinging the webs; worthwhile characters that bring variety and energy to the story. And it's a tale with a heartfelt father-son core. Miles Morales gets his own (well-handled) origin story in a dizzying and eye-popping New York.If this movie has a weakness, it's the monolithic Kingpin, but the animation, immersion and excellent cast more than make up for it.Sony's really got something here.",8,1,6,28 December 2018
American Beauty," Total Oscar bait, but at least part of it's entertaining.
","Kevin Spacey, for me, remains the most memorable thing about American BEAUTY. He has all the best lines, his character is the most interesting, and his midlife rebellion is genuinely funny. But that revolt is only the first half of the film. This movie isn't nearly the bastion of depth that it was when I was nineteen. The angst and twisted side of suburbia feels fake, on the nose. And that triteness is at its worst when we delve into Ricky's subplot. The flying bag is where the movie teeters on insufferable. Bentley's not the problem, he seems well-suited for the role (same for the rest of the cast). But there's an unmistakable smugness to the writing of this thing that ruins whatever beauty this story has. 5/10",5,1,3,23 January 2015
Over the Hedge," A Bruce Willis animated movie . . . but not half bad.
","Aside from some of the character models, 'Over the Hedge' has mostly held up after almost ten years. It's got an exaggerated sense of humor that'll please most kids, and the satiric wit aimed at suburban lazies is worth a few laughs. Not just suburbia, but one of those house farms that springs up outta nowhere, seemingly overnight, like a weed. Most of the movie's spent taking shots at slovenly America's junk food addiction. Does it beat you over the head with this? Sure does, but we had it coming. Plus, you can never take too many jabs at Dr. Phil. Ever.The plot's paper thin, but its also high-energy and a breezy 80 minutes. And that's one hell of a cast, the highlight of which is a caffeinated Steve Carell.6/10",6,0,0,10 February 2015
Wanted," Age didn't help
","'Wanted' is one of those movies I was kinda hoping would be a little better with the passage of time. And after eight years, that's a resounding no. There were a lot of things that were awful about this movie back in that theater seat in '08, but one thing that really bothered me was the story's beat-for-beat ripoff of 'The Matrix'. McAvoy's reconditioning is more violent than Neo's, but it's all there regardless. It's pretty blatant.The movie is pretty hard to stomach, even having been reared on a diet of shallow action movies. 'Curve the bullet' has gotta be one of the stupidest things I've ever heard, and the movie gives no good reason to accept it. C'mon, if you're going to steal bullet-time, at least give me something to go on; don't just shoot physics the bird.But even today, 'Wanted' is a rotten reminder of how bad action movies could be in the 2000s. It's got that tweaked style that feels more like a bludgeon than a thrill, and a garish look to really seal the deal. To trot out the Matrix comparison one more time, it's got none of that film's artistic sensibilities, which would've helped this go down so much easier.3/10",3,1,5,27 December 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A worthy sequel and pretty cool action movie
","I was a kid when 'Terminator 2' came out, and I remember that Summer vividly. It was everywhere; the Subway marketing campaign, the Guns 'n Roses song, even the action figures. It didn't occur to me that this movie would hold nostalgia value, but . . . well, there you go. There are a few reasons why 'Terminator 2' doesn't deliver as much enjoyment for me as the first film; I was never that hot on the score, especially the chase scenes; the T-1000 is a much better effect than a opposing force, it (and Patrick) lacks the unstoppable stalker quality and scare that Schwarzenegger had in '84; Linda Hamilton's narration is a bit much (we can see why she's brooding without hearing her tell us why); and the dialog in between action spectacles is so low-key and done in whispers (usually the ones involving Hamilton) that it tends to slow things down. But the movie (for the most part) makes up for these with its novel sci-fi invention and terrific action scenes:1. The shotgun in the rose box (just a great image) 2. The showdown in the mall hallway 3. The truck chase through the canals 4. The entire Cyberdyne sequence (and a great location pick for that office building)Cameron makes an interesting contrast between the sun-drenched Los Angeles daytime with the cold blue steel palette of the night scenes. And regardless of the film's lesser points, this is a movie with its own look, style and enough excitement to keep anyone interested in its nightmare war-ravaged future. It's still not Cameron's best, but it's also no 'Avatar'.7/10",7,1,1,18 April 2013
Apocalypse Now," An unfocused trip
","It took me a bit to nail down the reason for my less-than-fawning reaction to 'Apocalypse Now' - after all, this movie's so damn revered - but, surprisingly, it's Martin Sheen's voyage up-river (which is really the bulk of the movie). I'm surprised as anyone, seeing as I generally dig his stuff. But his journey into Cambodia just tends to meander through the film. Sure, there are firefights mixed in, but none of this is ever as exciting or mysterious as the film's two most winning features: Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. And they're only present for such a short time. Duvall is just such a larger than life sociopath; it doesn't hurt that he's at the forefront of the movie's wildest set piece, but he owns the screen. I'm fairly certain the man's ruined 'Ride of the Valkyries' for me (hijacked, not soured). And Brando looms so large over the entire movie that, you're left wondering what kind of answers are coming when Sheen finally tracks him down. And it's a hallucinatory payoff, to be sure.6/10",6,1,3,14 May 2015
Rocky IV," Rocky stares down absurdity
","I'm nowhere near a Rocky aficionado (I still haven't seen the first three movies), so I don't really have a yard stick to compare 'Rocky IV'. Still, it's not rocket science, and the opening is enough to catch all the laymen up. But there's one thing that doesn't jibe: how in hell is Rocky going to survive (let alone best) a man that can punch with inhuman strength? No amount of American know-how montages will excuse this.And as for the montages (there are what, 4 in this movie?), it really does feel like you're watching a music video after awhile. The key to this movie is its value as an '80s tchotchke. The idea of Rocky going to Russia, beating the monster and signaling the end of the Cold War is beyond silly. It's asinine. But the movie's entertaining enough to (mostly) carry through that. The soundtrack's pretty good, too (I've got a couple songs on my gym list). The movie's an artifact from a time when MTV ruled our culture, and Stallone clearly wanted in on it.Not a great movie, but it's surprisingly seductive in its watchability. This thing comes on TV, and you find yourself hanging with it.6/10",6,0,1,15 September 2015
Face_Off," Just the right mix of over-the-top and exhilarating
","BROKEN ARROW had already made me a John Woo fan when FACE/OFF was first released, and I was all over this movie. The camera moves, the dazzling gun play, the exciting shootouts . . . and the doves. Woo's brand of guns akimbo fight scenes worked its magic on my teenage brain in the worst way. And what's really satisfying about FACE/OFF is that those action scenes hold up. The big setpieces are well-choreographed and even intense, especially with the big speedboat chase. It was really cool in the mid-'90s to see such a big Hollywood action bonanza with a sci-fi bent: two arch-nemeses literally swapping faces and effectively switching places with each other. This angle does demand a lot from the audience (and if you're turned off by this movie, you'll probably start punching holes in the logic), but it's the two stars that hold this up and make it all worthwhile. Half the fun of the whole thing is just watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage effectively switch roles; Cage plays the tortured and vulnerable character while Travolta chews the scenery (to the hilt). Travolta makes for a great heavy, and it's pretty cool to see him let it all hang out. It's a hell of an action movie and a great showcase of talent from the two leads. 8/10",8,1,3,10 September 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," More of the similar and that's just fine
","Over the course of 4 movies, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt has been dangled from cliffs and skyscrapers, hurled from a helicopter to a speeding train and taken on attack choppers. It's the kind of big-screen Summer spectacle you can expect from an M:I movie, as if tom Cruise has opened his own big Hollywood lemonade stand and hands out reliable thrills to those seeking a good time. Brand marketing gold, baby.And 'Rogue Nation' is no different, putting the Impossible Mission Force in perilous question yet again, and leaving our heroes to fix it. Ethan Hunt's a character who runs headlong into reckless action , and Cruise the actor who's willing to do the stunt himself. It moves, it's fun, and the cast works like a well-oiled machine (also, adding a femme fatale was a nice touch).More, please.7/10",7,1,2,19 January 2016
Spider-Man," A worthy adaptation
","Part of appreciating Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is understanding its role in the Hollywood superhero boom of the last fifteen years. But on its own terms, what it really does right is the balance between morality and superpowers; the give-and-take of Peter Parker's crushing burden and those thrilling scenes of swinging through the city. That's what really stands out to me today (that, and J.K. Simmon's pitch-perfect casting as J. Jonah Jameson, who owns every one of his scenes). Not all of it works - the story is a bit drawn out and the dialogue scenes between Maguire and Dunst are marshmallowy soft - but it's a perfectly decent treatment of Spidey.And these days, I still watch it with the firmly-imprinted memory of its success in 2002. The genre landscape was entirely different back then, and a Spider-Man movie wasn't a sure thing. Raimi was a genuine surprise as director, but he produced a film that retained the vibrancy of its source material and populated it with grounded characters. And the timing really helped; it ended up being an anthem for a post-9/11 New York.In other words, it was a breath of fresh air.7/10",7,1,2,17 May 2017
Collateral," 'Fates intertwined, cosmic coincidence'
","It's really not every day that you find a thriller that waxes philosophical in-between murders, especially not one that's extremely well-paced (what with most of it taking place in a taxi). Years ago, someone suggested 'Collateral' to me on the basis of Tom Cruise's performance ('You really believe he's a hit-man'), and they were absolutely right. Cruise is operating on a whole different level here. He can go from preachy a**hole to nightmarish assassin with the flip of a switch. The precision in his weapons-handling is fascinating, and when the character is in his zone, there's simply no disrespecting his tradecraft. Whatever your feelings on his personal life, they just melt away while you're watching this. And I still think this is his best performance.But 'Collateral' doesn't stop there, because Jamie Foxx more than holds his own. Both men bring added dimension to their characters, and they make simple conversation scenes riveting. Pretty much everyone in the supporting cast is bringing their A-game, and it's a fully rounded Mann movie; it looks good, the shootouts are explosive, and it's just an all-around stellar movie from start to finish.9/10",9,1,2,2 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A misstep in tone; oddly downbeat
","Admittedly, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this movie. The blockbuster success of Raimi's original 'Spider-Man' was celebrated just ten years ago. And there's an argument to be made that one should keep an open mind to new things, but there are also plenty of superhero properties that deserve big-screen treatment. But here we are reanimating the same characters for huge Summer movie business.I'm impressed (for the most part) by the casting. Andrew Garfield makes an excellent Peter Parker/Spidey (especially given the angsty subject matter); he's got the mannerisms and the lanky physique. And Emma Stone makes the perfect Gwen Stacy. She was spot-on (especially in those thigh-high socks!). Rhys Ifans goes a long way in making the Lizard interesting (a character that's never blown my skirt up), while Martin Sheen is a terrific improvement over Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. And for even the most casual Spider-Man fan, the screenwriters really nailed Spidey's witty banter. It's not used often, but it's very effective in bringing the character to the big screen. And Webb brought his A-game when it comes to the action scenes. The fights between Spider-Man and the Lizard are hard-hitting and riveting, while the swinging through New York is an exhilarating ride. But it's not all sunshine and lollipops. For one, it takes forever for this movie to get going, and only then it proceeds in fits and starts. It's way too long at 136 minutes, and it doesn't help matters that the movie drags for long stretches. Horner's score is oddly out of place, especially with the school fight scene. And it's unnervingly dark for a Spider-Man film. It's great that Peter goes through some angst and anger issues, but there's not enough humor and light-hearted scenes to balance it out. You get to the point where you can easily see how things will turn out, and it's a downer. This isn't Batman - there's no need to make this character dark and overly brooding.It's clear that 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a setup movie for another big franchise. And seeing as we have a terrific actor for the lead role, I'm cautiously optimistic. Garfield is great. But for god's sake, let's lighten things up.6/10",6,0,2,18 November 2012
The Lego Movie," Everything is indeed awesome
","THE LEGO MOVIE has so much going for it, it's absurd. I love that they made Batman a self-absorbed douche (and Will Arnett does a terrific job with this). And everyone else does great, too: Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Nick Offerman, and especially Elizabeth Banks (god, she can make reading the phone book sound sexy). No one expected much from this movie when it was announced (myself included), so to see just how good this thing turned out is the real surprise. It's well-written, damn well-animated (so much of this CGI looks genuinely stop-motion; top-notch stuff) and features an array of great characters. But most of all, it's a whole lot of fun.9/10",9,0,2,20 June 2014
Aliens," A marvel of pacing and gripping action
","You've gotta hand it to Cameron and his zest for strong female characters. Even in a movie full of hardcore marines (especially Jeanette Goldstein), it's Sigourney Weaver who gets the real crowd- pleasing moments. Ripley doesn't have the muscles or the training, but she's got baggage and maternal instincts. Her taping together of the flamethrower and pulse rifle is one of my all-time favorite gear-up scenes. It's short, but emotionally driven. She even gets the best line of the movie: 'Get away from her, you B----!' Seriously, you take her young and you've got a bloodthirsty ursine on your hands. But that's just the sweet spot. ALIENS has pretty much everything going for it. It's a brilliant mix of action sci-fi and war movie, and an excellent bit of escapism. It's amazingly paced and the action is unrelentingly tense. Reiser is sleaze of the highest order (to go along with the slimy Weyland-Yutani Corporation), and the whole cast in this thing just feels perfectly chosen. But the really cool thing about the movie is that, even though I've seen this movie many many times and know all the beats, it doesn't fail to entertain and keep the pulse pounding. That counts for a whole hell of a lot. 9/10",9,1,3,6 October 2014
Now You See Me," Shockingly disappointing
","'Now You See Me' has such a great hook - an illusionist 'Ocean's Eleven' - but it also has serious problems. One of them is that for such a sterling cast, there's very little in the way of likable characters. One, actually, and he takes the fall in the end. But it's hard to see good actors playing awful characters (Woody Harrelson's the one who escapes largely unscathed because he's Woody Harrelson) and it speaks to the flimsy writing. This movie plays fast and loose with internal consistency, straining credibility way beyond acceptable limits. I could even stomach the completely artificial ending if the rest of the movie was grounded in some kind of reality. But all of the tricks and sleights of hand are just flashy effects - these people are more superheroes than magicians.It all really comes down to having a laugh at your audience, which this movie does with glee. Add in the intolerable smugness, A.D.D. camera-work and editing and this isn't an ounce of fun.4/10",4,2,2,20 October 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Nicely done
","Y'know, I've gotta be honest, it's not all that hard for an X-Men movie to please me. Cast Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, don't call it 'X-Men United', and already you're on your way. And with 'Days of Future Past', aside from the killer story hook, I really just came here hoping for Sentinels. Yep, giant robots. I'm an easy mark.But it's also loaded got just the right ingredients (Fassbender, McAvoy, a slo-mo shootout set to 'Time in a Bottle' and Jackman continues to be a series highlight; he is unbelievable in this role. I was surprised at just how fringe Halle Berry has become, her role almost non-speaking. It's the right way to go. This is a fine movie, both as a comic book spectacle and as an adaptation of a landmark Marvel storyline. It capably juggles a boatload of goings-on during two concurrent time periods, and the battle scenes are pretty well done, too. Basically, they didn't screw it up. And they could've. It's a stellar return to the series for Singer, and I'm looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse'.8/10",8,0,2,29 September 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Cap deserves his own movie, not Avengers 3
","I will say this, 'Civil War' is certainly a step up from 'Ultron'. It's still the same sort of bloated showroom floor for next year's big Marvel movies, and I never liked the central warring factions plot line, but it does at least have more enjoyable bells and whistles. I wasn't expecting to like the big fight at the airport. It's a noisy mess, but it's also where the movie seems to come to life, with Ant Man and Spider-Man especially. Their humor is what makes this tick, and the sad part is that it's so short-lived. It's the little things like this that get lost in the big showdowns and Marvel movie infrastructure.But the Civil War idea is so damn stupid, and really only exists to thoroughly divide our heroes along ideological lines. I dunno, Stark just seems too insubordinate to fall in with the UN, and his motivations (not to mention the big reveal about is SPOILERS) just seem unbelievably contrived.That said, it does end pretty well, an unlikely ray of hope manages to break through. But the question of where these characters go from here is left a mystery. I'm just not looking forward to watching the Black Panther movie for an effective closure.6/10",6,5,11,20 May 2016
American History X," Deeply flawed, but still resonant.
","'American History X' deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie.That said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama.As long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch.6/10",6,1,2,21 October 2016
Duck You Sucker," It's not dynamite, but sometimes interesting
","'Duck, You Sucker' is a Leone movie and I freely admit that I was expecting something akin to the Dollars Trilogy (both of them came packaged in the Sergio Leone Anthology, so it's not too big a stretch). Which is nowhere near the case, and that suits me just fine. But it is bogged down by a solemn vibe, and even though revolvers are (mostly) traded in for explosions, you start to miss the larger-than-life presences of van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach after awhile. I was on board with the revolutionary politics of the thing, but the pacing is all off.I do like Rod Steiger and James Coburn, both wielding iffy accents (although Steiger seems a bit more at home with his). And there were moments of great poignancy, particularly in the cave and the final scene. Between the pacing, the uneven tone and Morricone's score (very 'Butch Cassidy'), it's not my favorite. But there's chemistry between the two leads.6/10",6,1,4,5 June 2016
Tropic Thunder," This is the kind of Ben Stiller we need more of
","Back when 'Tropic Thunder' came out, it was part of the press that Robert Downey Jr. was playing a black man - that, is, playing an uber-serious actor submerging himself in the role of a black character (complete with skin pigmentation surgery). And that brand of multiple abstractions kicks up my admiration for that guy. What wasn't part of that press was who was playing Les Grossman, the sociopathic studio boss who hijacks the movie with his foul-mouthed douchebaggery. He's the movie's secret weapon, and everyone (myself included) did a double-take when they realized it was Tom Cruise in bald cap and padding. He's completely against type here and so buried in the role that believing who that is feels like a tall order.That's what makes this movie so funny: it goes there. Always out-of-bounds and going for broke. And the humor is constantly riffing on the movie industry (I imagine all the tropes are covered); it's always absurd but feels so spot-on in its satirical jabs. There's just something deranged about all of this. There's a lot of shaking your head in disbelief at what goes on here, but it's also more fun than it probably should be.7/10",7,1,3,17 July 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Unusual, refreshing and (yes) epic
","I've never read the 'Scott Pilgrim' comic books, so I couldn't tell you how closely this movie hews to the source material . . . but on its own terms, it's pretty sweet. I love that the hero is a bass player (unsung as movie instruments goo) and Michael Cera's a terrific choice for this character. He's a whiny douche, but manages to have a decent character arc. and hell, it's not just him - look at everybody else; I can't find one weak link in this cast (although, Chris Evans and Brandon Rout stand out in the League of Evil Exes, not to mention Mary Elizabeth Winstead's disinterested hotness).Really, this whole thing is about relationship baggage, and it's such a quirky setup; a romantic comedy steeped in gamer culture . . . with fight scenes. And as it rolls on, it's just infectious. Movies like 'Scott Pilgrim' don't just come along everyd- ... ever. 8/10",8,0,2,15 August 2012
Enchanted," A star turn you wouldn't believe
","Admittedly, 'Enchanted' isn't the kind of movie for me. I'm not a musicals guy (Disney songs especially, for the most part), and I don't typically go for their cold, calculated way of making a movie like this (you can just see how this movie would be engineered by the Disney brand, rather than writers). But it's still got nothing on 'The Lion King', and for that, we can all be grateful. That said, the real reason to watch this movie is Amy Adams. No question. If you describe this movie as a Disney fairy tale come to life, then she is its personified princess. Not an easy task, and she makes it look like a snap. She's immensely lovable, and her performance outshines everyone else in the cast. She is absolutely worth the price of admission. 6/10",6,0,0,21 November 2013
The Usual Suspects," It killed in the '90s and still does
","It's been quite some time since I first saw 'The Usual Suspects', but I still remember that twist ending; one for the ages, that one. Would a person today be able to see it coming? Not sure, but no question does the movie still hold up. It's a playful exercise in misdirection with the novel camera tricks, jumbled narratives and central burning question: 'Who is Keyser Söze?' (try telling me you haven't heard that catchphrase in popular culture). And even if that big reveal no longer packs punch, at its heart, it's still a sizzling crime movie with a motley assortment of macho gangsters.7/10",7,1,2,20 November 2015
Inside Out," Now that's more like it
","I didn't walk into 'Inside Out' expecting much. With Pixar's recent track record of pre/sequel/princess movies (with 'Toy Story 3' being the only one worth mentioning), they weren't exactly batting a thousand. Which is what made this movie such a pleasant surprise.It's a return to fine form for the studio; great characters, imaginative world, a story that actually connects on more than one level, and most importantly the sense that those tears it's jerking from your eyes aren't for superficial reasons. This is an emotional movie, there can be no doubt. But there's also an amazingly cathartic payoff when all is said and done. And you walk away from this already missing these characters.Hell of a movie.8/10",8,18,49,4 July 2015
Die Hard 2," More terrorists, more explosions, more John McClane
","Bruce Willis' smirk would never again be this bulletproof. It tends to make John McClane overly confident for a while in DIE HARD 2, a movie that promises more and bigger: effects, explosions, firefights and a bigger cage for our hero to run around in. While it doesn't rise to the unreasonably high levels of its predecessor, it does give us big-budget Summer tentpole, a likable hero, ridiculous situations and a droll Christmas wit neatly boxed and gift-wrapped for an early July Christmas. It's clearly a retread, and the filmmakers want you to know that ('I can't believe this. Another basement, another elevator. How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?'). It's a self-awareness that adequately sets the stage and lets its audience relax and enjoy the ride. As DIE HARD sequels go, it's loud and not at all deep, but makes for a solid good time.7/10",7,1,3,22 December 2011
Flashdance," Come for the dancing, stay for the . . . um . . .
","I'll admit right now that 'Flashdance' was probably doomed when I saw Jerry Bruckheimer's and Joe Eszterhas' names in the opening credits. But to be fair, the movie's got their fingerprints all over it. Jennifer Beals has the same irrational rage that Elizabeth Berkley had in 'Showgirls'. and it's a tired blue-collar-underdog-fulfilling-her-dreams story, shot like a music video. Not to mention the high-powered pop soundtrack. Peel away that packaging, and there's not a lot there.And oddly enough, there's also not much of a payoff after she nails the audition. It just sorta happens. 5/10",5,0,0,26 May 2015
Avengers: Endgame," The MCU's riveting, moving, uneven crescendo
","Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the 'casual Marvel fan' category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.I liked watching 'Endgame'. It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.For me, it's questionable.",7,3,7,30 April 2019
Dirty Dancing," Didn't have the time of my life, but it's pretty good
","Even if you're not into chick flicks, DIRTY DANCING is worth the price of admission just for the two leads alone. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze (rest his soul) make for ideal casting. Their intensity smolders, and that kind of chemistry doesn't grow on trees. Oh, and Cynthia Rhodes' dancing scene - that was five kinds of steamy. Geez, that woman. And I was onboard with the '80s songs in an early '60s movie (it oddly works) until the kid put on the record and an '80s song actually starts playing. Nevermind that it was the extremely schmaltzy 'The Time of My Life', that was just cheese overboard. Although in all fairness, this movie does not shy away from the cheese: 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner'; really, she's just sitting there at the table, it's not like someone backs her into the margins literally. It's a really hammy metaphor. But this movie was surprisingly involving; and at the very least, the dancing scenes are worth it.6.5/10",6,0,0,31 August 2014
Quantum of Solace," Squandered potential
","'Quantum of Solace' isn't a great movie (by any stretch), but it does have a few things going for it.One, it picks up right after 'Casino Royale'. I like seeing this in movies, and as such, it hits the ground running. And it features both Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton (hello, nurses!). Also, Bond's the real villain here, so consumed with rage and revenge thirst that he barrels through everything and everyone. It's a novel twist for a different kind of OO7 movie. The downside is that Dominic Greene is still a hanger-on for most of the movie; dull as dishwater, that one. As far as this movie's concerned, the idea works better on paper.But then there are the action scenes, one after the next, each edited to within an inch of its life. Images coming at you fast and furious, leaving no time to get a sense of geography in a fight. Both frustrating an exhausting.There was probably no chance of living up to the promise of the preceding movie's ending, but cutting out the shakycam would've helped unbelievably. As it stands, There are sections of this movie that I like, but it loses ground by the third act. But there's a pretty great final few minutes, which keeps this from being wholly forgettable. But only just.6/10",6,0,0,21 February 2015
Independence Day," Only in Hollywood would a nerd and a fighter pilot be our last best hope
","Watching 'Independence Day' takes me back to that fateful day in early 1996. I saw the trailer right before 'Broken Arrow' and that image of a wall of fire and debris coming toward the screen blew my 15 year-old mind . Some serious seeds were sown that day. So I guess I've got a soft spot for this movie even to this day. Even now, those fireballs are still pretty awesome, and even after seeing this as much as I have, I still get caught up in it.To me, 'Independence Day' is synonymous with huge effects spectacle, at least in terms of Summer escapism. In a way, the movie really embodies it. Sure, we've had billion-dollar grossers since then, but can any of those movies really compare? None of them scream the July 4th holiday like this one, even while famous D.C. landmarks are decimated. I dare say that this has become synonymous with the idea of tentpole Summer titles, and even ingrained as a patriotic movie.Bottom line, it's the assured direction and across-the-board likability of the cast that makes this so watchable. I love the dogfights, and to this day, Bill Pullman's speech is rousing, to say the least. As cliché-ridden as this is, it's very well packaged.7/10",7,0,0,22 June 2016
No Country for Old Men," Makes an indelible mark. Not to be soon forgotten.
","It doesn't tend to come up when I think of crime movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' is a great one. It's got that slow and methodical predator-stalking-his-prey tempo, and the movie's populated with some great characters. Anton Chigurh is surely one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever laid eyes on (the cattle gun is novel, and the sound of that shotgun!); Bardem ratchets the creepiness of that guy to unbelievable heights. Conversely, Brolin's outlaw has got to be one of the dumbest. He proves himself a wily criminal, but drug money always has someone coming for it. Not bright.But even in a movie full of well-drawn characters, Tommy Lee Jones is still the highlight for me. He vividly brings to life the sardonic world-weary lawman and I found myself looking forward to his next scene and hearing his dialogue. Dude's just got that gift. Harrelson's equally gifted here. But I was also floored on a technical level. There's great atmosphere; those arid deserts are not a place I want to find myself lost in (that howling wind is its own brand of unnerving). But just how much of this movie played out with no score. The sound design here is amazing; more often than not, it's just he background noise of a ticking clock, beeping transponder or footsteps providing us with any sound at all. It's haunting, really.7/10",7,2,3,17 April 2014
Days of Thunder," The only thing missing is a throbbing Kenny Loggins tune
","The suits at Paramount clearly wanted a 'Top Gun on wheels' (even going so far as to hire Robert Towne to write the thing), but 'Days of Thunder' ended up being a loud, stupid mess; a soulless commercial (not just the Mello Yello product placement) machined with star, director and producing power, but ridiculous in its dramatic narrative. It is awful. Which is why it is also glorious - naturally, for all the wrong reasons:1. There's lots of melodramatic screaming in this movie. And squinting.2. Tom Cruise goes from being a reckless prick to a reckless prick with a trophy. He learns nothing from the events of the film; it's golden.3. Robert Duvall spends screen time giving an inspirational locker room speech to a stock car. 4. Kidman works her Aussie accent for maximum hotness. 5. Almost makes me care about NASCAR. Almost. And to top it all off, Cruise is sporting one of the greatest character names in cinema: Cole Trickle. Just say it back to yourself: Cole. Trickle. You can't make that nonsense up. And somebody did!Gather some like-minded individuals and crack open a few cold ones. You're in for some laughs. 6/10",6,1,2,25 May 2014
Toy Story 4," A sequel no one needed, and yet . . .
","'Toy Story 3' wrapped things up so nicely that this movie can't quite shake the outlier feel; but even I have to admit to getting wrapped up while watching this. It looks fantastic, the cast is uniformly excellent (consistent with the franchise) and the story beats hit home when the need to. I appreciate the maturity in Woody's and Bo Peep's arcs and absolutely loved the addition of Keanu Reeves and Key & Peele.'Toy Story 4' may not be a game-changer, but it's a worthy addition.",7,0,0,20 April 2020
Batman Begins," This is how you reboot a major franchise
","From the casting and writing to its tone and direction, 'Batman Begins' is just rock solid in every way. It's the impressive end result of new blood being injected into a franchise that was effectively beaten into the ground with a shovel (I'm looking at you, Schumacher).Finally, we get a big screen treatment that focuses on the title character (with the exception of the terrific 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'). Essentially an adaptation of Frank Miller's seminal graphic novel 'Batman: Year One', the film focuses on Bruce Wayne's childhood trauma of witnessing his parents gunned down in a dark alley. We follow his rigorous journey and training into his eventual rise as a vigilante crusader for justice in a city that's choking on its own corruption.The genius of the script (written by David Goyer and Christopher Nolan) is that it slowly builds, piece by piece, an otherwise simple origin story, but with its own narrative drive to keep us watching until the big payoff (the first appearance of Batman in costume). We don't even see the makings of the outfit until 50 minutes in - but we're so enamored of these well-written characters that the buildup is self-sustaining.Another wise move is on the part of the villains. The Scarecrow (Cilian Murphy) may seem an unlikely pick as the (seemingly) central villain - especially out of Batman's expansive rogues gallery - but pairing him with the city's crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) as pawns in a larger scheme is a welcome change of pace from the usual 'Let's team up to destroy Batman!' line of uniting villains.And from a casting perspective, the film is top-notch. Christian Bale dons the black cowl this time around, bringing the necessary intensity required to pull off the emotional turmoil and militaristic resolve of the Dark Knight. Michael Caine was wisely cast as his closest ally and butler Alfred, bringing a welcome humanity to what could so easily be a throwaway role in lesser hands. Perfectly cast as James Gordon is Gary Oldman (the man was born to play Gordon). Even background players Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer are heavy-hitters. The only weak link in the chain is Katie Holmes - though, to her credit, she's playing the moralizer-turned damsel in distress. Not a lot to work with. And as well-cast as Bale is in the title role, he's only outmatched by Liam Neeson, who just sizzles in every one of his scenes.All in all, a very well-done film, assembled with care and professionalism.9/10",9,0,3,26 October 2011
Liar Liar," Carrey in fine form
","There's a virtuous message at the heart of 'Liar Liar' (a yuppie lawyer learns the cost of putting career before child) that helps the movie achieve timelessness; and that's part of the reason this is still so watchable after twenty years. It's even one of those 'cable movies' that tends to draw you in whenever it's on. But seriously, can you think of anyone other than Jim Carrey who could've carried this movie? Even back in mid-'90s Hollywood. Absolutely not, and most of the laughs come from just pulling the ripcord and watching him go. It's his anarchic style and manic energy that gives the dialogue its potency. The supporting cast is left to do the heavy lifting while Carrey owns the screen. And it's for the best. This is over-the-top in the best sense, and it remains highly watchable today.8/10",8,0,1,20 November 2017
Wreck-It Ralph," Tremendous world-building
","I'm as cynical as it gets when it comes to Disney, but even I have to give props when they do something right. And 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a winner. The father/daughter relationship between Ralph and Vanellope is sweet, endearing and a punch to the gut. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are ideal choices, but it's a pretty great cast from top to bottom. and despite the sticky sweetness of Sugar Rush, the ending doesn't come off schmaltzy.That said, the opening setup is my favorite part. I do love the Pixar-like invention of the first half hour; seeing what happens behind the screen and traveling from one game to the next through the power cords. It's very 'TRON'. And I love the movie's sense of humor with Bad Anon. They could've been cheap with the video game references here, but they feel authentic and are genuinely funny. This is good stuff.7/10",7,0,7,11 November 2012
The Princess Bride," All of the classical fantasy elements remixed in a charming stew
","It's funny, as a kid, I always used to watch 'The Princess Bride' only to a certain point (the ROUS would invariably result in my turning this off and doing something else). So for years, I'd known this as half a movie. This is my second watch as an adult, and I'm still surprised at how dark this movie gets in the second half (the machine) and delighted by the unrecognizable Billy Crystal and Carol Kane.Regardless, this is a terrific fairy tale and far more entertaining in its sef-awareness. Tongues don't come as firmly in cheek as they do here. And I can't think of a weak link in this cast, all of whom evidently relish William Goldman's script wordplay. The witty banter is laid on thick here in the best way possible, and keeps things alive when the swords are sheathed (and such swordplay is impressive, at least to this non-fencer).This is a really fun movie.8/10",8,1,2,13 August 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A worthy sequel; good stuff
","Thankfully, DreamWorks hasn't settled primarily on mediocre fare like MR. SHERMAN AND PEABODY, and they can still produce quality family entertainment. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 it's exhibit A. It doesn't quite measure up to the heart and soul of the first movie, even when dealing with unification and loss. But it's got plenty of the good stuff: action, adventure, family, fierce loyalty, heroism. I was hoping for more of the sweet flaming sword, but that's not a gripe. And those flying scenes have more *whoosh!* than ever. And let's face it: Hiccup and Toothless are an awesome pair, and they are the backbone of the series. No matter how big the spectacle gets or how many dragons they want to throw up on the screen, as long as the series features those two characters, I'm in.7/10",7,0,2,17 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An escapist whimsical trip
","You don't just watch THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL. You feast on it. It's got a story that you don't really know where it's going, but there's a great feeling of fulfillment at the movie's end. If you're familiar with Wes Anderson's wholly unique style, then you know what you're getting into here: eye-popping visuals and endearingly quirky characters. The dialogue grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go, and the most hilarious lines come seemingly out of nowhere. It features a gonzo cast, with just a laundry list of talent, and it's almost every few minutes that a familiar face turns up. The colors in this movie are gorgeous, but it's the film's winning sense of humor that won me over. Even the sight of a prison guard being shanked is worth a laugh. And I submit to you that the image of Willem Dafoe hurling a cat out a multi-story window is one for the ages. Just try to remain straight-faced.9/10",9,2,4,8 September 2014
The Transporter," It's trash, but hell if it ain't entertaining
","I don't think I've ever witnessed a movie that so thrives on a strangely dumb likability as 'The Transporter'. I felt a very European 'The Fast and the Furious' vibe from this (not just the Matt Schulze connection), only not so insulting to the brain. There's no use coming to this with knives sharpened; it's inviting in its mindlessness.To wit: Jason Statham's a conveyor of goods for various criminal enterprises, and his every action is governed by a code of rules. Obviously, he'll come to break those rules and find himself in hot water with the bad guys as a result. Cue the series of physically impossible fight scenes. It's not hard to see where this thing's headed, but somehow, it doesn't make you want to slap yourself. All of this absurdity rests on the icy coolness of Statham, a man rising to the occasion without reservation. He's why something so flimsy can actually work. Even when he's fighting thugs on an oil slick, it's still engaging.I liked it just as much today as I did in 2002. I've got no interest in the sequels, granted, but as a standalone, it's a fun movie.7/10",7,0,0,26 November 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tense and exciting, this is a great entry into the series.
","What's really surprising about 'Ghost Protocol' is that Brad Bird, its man at the helm, made the jump entirely from animated fare - and he's remarkably capable with action movie staging and direction. Color me impressed. The disbanding of IMF is a novel approach to changing up the franchise. Without support, these superspies are forced to improvise to the nth degree, giving this movie an unpredictable edge. The core group of actors gel together pretty well (with Cruise continuing his unique brand of age-defying ass-kickery; man, that guy is nuts), and it's a team I'd see again in a future installment. That stuff with Ethan's wife at the end was a little much, but his walk into the vapors more than made up for it. This series still has some kick left in it. A great collection of popcorn action movie talents.8/10Also: my god, Paula Patton is unnervingly good-looking.",8,3,5,19 May 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Reheated leftovers . . . with a dash of stupid
","The list of Spielberg movies that have disappointed me like 'The Lost World' is a short one. Ugh, I miss the original cast. Or maybe it's just the characters that were flavorless, but I did find myself wishing Grant and Sattler were around. Goldblum does a good job communicating the fear that all these other idiots should be feeling, but he can't carry the whole thing. Oh, but we do have Vince Vaughn! Throw in another rabble of weak characters with the hunting party and there's not a lot of excitement here. It's all monster movie, no sense of wonder, and some genuine silliness thrown in. Gymnastics on a raptor? That didn't seem wrong even on paper? Then there's the San Diego post script to get through (terrified Japanese fleeing a T. Rex? Really?).I remember (kinda) liking the movie when it came out, but time has definitely not been kind.4/10",4,5,14,8 July 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 2011's sleeper hit
","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a movie that, upon its release, I had no interest in. I'd seen the Charlton Heston original, but none of the sequels. So I wasn't invested in the series, as a whole. But 'Rise' is actually pretty flippin' good. Which is both surprising and a pretty impressive feat, seeing as it's a film that keeps you emotionally invested in CGI primates.James Franco's corporate scientist seemingly perfects a cure for his Alzheimer's-afflicted father (Jon Lithgow), using chimps as test subjects. The unexpected offspring of one of his subjects (eventually named Caesar) genetically inherits the cure, and after being taken in by Franco, thrives in a domesticated realm and develops mentally at an exponential rate. But an accident leaves Caesar's protective instincts misunderstood, and the chimp finds himself consigned to a primate shelter.It's here where the film itself really thrives. Caesar goes from domestic bliss to the cold steel and cruel zookeepers of the shelter, and we enter into our 'primate prison movie'. Here, 'Rise' deals with themes of captivity, animal cruelty and the general mistreatment at the hands of man - the emotional core of the film that creates sympathetic characters out of computer effects and and actually make its audience think twice about how protected (read: captive) animals are treated.Left to his own devices (and now self-aware enough to know that humans are just another breed of animal), the super-developed ape bands his prison inmates together, usurping the bonds of the animal shelter and makes good his escape, through the streets of San Francisco and to the wilderness beyond.'Rise' is clearly a movie that, through telling a prequel story, seeks to restart an ancient franchise, and spur a brand new series of sequels. After Abrams' success in this field with 'Star Trek', it was inevitable that Hollywood would go this route with other brands. But 'Rise' works best (for me) as a stand-alone movie; one that's not connected to Heston's film. Seeing one of the bad guys watching 'Planet of the Apes' on TV makes for a nice shout-out, but hearing Draco Malfoy utter Heston's trademark line ('Get your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty ape!') just feels like a cheap reminder that this is ultimately a reboot.Regardless, it's a film that had me glued to the screen, and definitely an unexpected gem from a disappointing Summer.And kudos to both Andy Serkis and some incredible motion-capture work that make Caesar one of the most sympathetic characters I've ever seen.8/10",8,1,2,22 March 2012
Cars," Why does it feel like a soulless cash-grab?
","'Cars' was never one of my favorite PIXAR movies, even back in the days when I was an ardent fanboy. But before I say anything else about it, the animation is resplendent, above reproach and characteristic of the studio's reputed craft.It's everything else that isn't. This movie lacks the heart of the studio's other titles (say, 'Toy Story' or . . . hell, any of them) and it grinds down to a halt once the story moves away from the race track. From there, it's lots of Larry the Cable Guy, awkward gags, and awful cover songs. It's completely fair to say that Michael Keaton - in his few minutes' worth of presence - steals this thing.But it's shocking to learn that this 'Doc Hollywood' rip-off was a passion project for John Lasseter.It's not good.5/10",5,1,2,13 June 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Goes down (too) easy.
","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, 'Infinity War' is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to 'The Empire Strikes Back', but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10",6,16,37,29 April 2018
JFK," The hype is no joke
","Good lord, the cast in this movie!Daunting run-time notwithstanding, 'JFK' is a work of consummate professionalism, from the camera work to the writing and direction. I'm not a history buff when it comes to the Kennedy assassination, so I couldn't tell you how accurate this is, but the important thing is that it *feels* accurate. It's a stroke of genius to make Kevin Costner's character the heart of this thing, and that draws you into a story that just keeps moving; and then it's just star-gazing, with one familiar face after another popping up. I don't know when I'll have the time set aside to watch this again, but I can tell you this: it doesn't feel long.This is high-conspiracy at a dangerously entertaining level.",8,3,6,30 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," HIstorical revisionism isn't usually this entertaining
","Didn't really know what to expect besides the (unbelievable) cast and the obvious love for the time period, but 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' turned out to be higher-end QT for me. This is much more in line with 'Jackie Brown' than his other plot-driven films, and that breezy feeling suits the film to a T.Case in point: an unusual amount of screentime is devoted to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) slipping into a theater and watching herself on the big screen in 'The Wrecking Crew', beaming at the audience's laughter. This is nothing less than a celebration of Tate's legacy (and loss); the camera loves Robbie and so do we. The sweetness in this scene is refreshing.It's also one of Tarantino's funniest, with much of the humor derived from the characters' disdain for hippies. Yes, Sharon Tate a character in this and yes, the third act goes down on that fateful night . . . but history plays out differently, with brutal and hysterical results.I loved this movie. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb, the period is a engaging sandbox, and this is a highlight of Summer 2019.",8,7,19,21 August 2019
Gone Girl," This is what the fuss was about?
","The more time passes since finishing 'Gone Girl', the more the aftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the final credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of hype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are playing such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to either of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was just a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that she was alive.Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw character. This is all very hollow, like some big-budget Lifetime movie.No, thank you.5/10",5,7,11,11 February 2015
Django Unchained," Hilarious, uncompromisingly brutal, but delivers on all fronts
","A spaghetti western/blaxploitation mash-up from the mind of Quentin Tarantino? SOLD!And yet there I was, sitting through the nerve-wracking theater-going experience that was 'Django Unchained'. How Tarantino moves from moments of white-knuckled tension to other moments of sheer hilarity and utter enjoyment just boggle the mind. He makes it seem so effortless, and at the same time hard to stomach. Watching this movie made me wonder what exactly attracted this man to such a, shall we say, unattractive subject as slavery. I mean, every single horrible aspect of the material is right there, in-your-face and highly unpleasant. Much of this movie (not even the violence, really, which was typically 'excessive-to-the-point-of-comical' Tarantino) was hard to sit through, with Tarantino trading his his trademark 'f-bomb a minute' for the 'n-bomb a minute' dialogue. But that's what makes the ending so damn gratifying. To see the horrors of what Django has to go through (and the horrific world in which he lives) just makes it that much more satisfying when he finally shows up and delivers a serious dose of ass-kicking to all involved. Seemingly in spite of the uncomfortable subject, 'Django Unchained' was a hell of a good time at the movies. I haven't laughed so hard in so long as I did during the 'bag' scene (complete with unexpectedly hilarious Jonah Hill appearance). The violence is the fist-pumping sort, that of the crowd-pleaser variety. And it's one hell of a well-acted movie. Jamie Foxx lends a tortured badassery to the title role, while everyone from the supporting cast to Don Johnson is noteworthy. DiCaprio gives a deliciously unhinged performance (it's worth seeing, believe me). And Samuel L. Jackson plays a character of such despicability that it's nothing less than shocking. It took way too long for someone to kill that guy. But it's Christoph Waltz who makes this movie, for me. The guy is extraordinary. His wonderfully dark humor and playful delivery just made him a sheer pleasure to watch. I couldn't take my eyes off the man. He was electric. It might be my favorite performance in a Tarantino movie, though I haven't seen him in 'Inglorious Basterds' yet. Almost three hours long, and definitely not a boring movie. I went in with high hopes, and wasn't disappointed. Just an incredible movie, harsher aspects and all. 8/10",8,7,17,13 January 2013
Get Out," Hell of a debut
","The only thing I'd known before walking into 'Get Out' (aside from the hype) is that it somehow mixes racial politics and horror. And really, that alone is enough to get the curiosity piqued, but it's the mechanics of the thing that makes it so entertaining. The *how*.Jordan Peele kicks things off with a certain sense of foreboding; that a potentially awkward meeting-her-parents getaway has sinister intent. Nothing is what it seems, and that uncertainty makes the viewer uncomfortable (in my case, at least). Dread builds on itself until Peele finally pulls out the rug with a classic horror twist; from there, it's a solid thrill ride til the very end. I liked everything about this movie; the excellent cast, the sharp writing, the tense subject matter. Even the comedic side character is ideal But I loved that I had no idea where all of this was going. It's scary as hell and a lot of fun.8/10",8,19,38,16 January 2018
Drive," A hero in thug's clothing
","There's something wholly unique about 'Drive', a (swear-to-god) art-house genre movie that lays down a mood just as easily as it suckerpunches you with a visceral death scene. There are way more unspoken stares here than action scenes, but even still this has one of the finest car chases since . . . well, a very long time. And somehow, Albert Brooks very nearly steals the whole thing.This is one of those movies you just get sucked into; that soundtrack and the chic '80s vibe are intoxicating. You don't shake this off for some time afterward. It's one hell of a ride.9/10",9,1,4,5 February 2012
Frozen," Make it stop. Please.
","Welp, Disney finally did it. They Lion King'd 'Frozen'. I actually really liked this movie when it first came out (you live with a wife and small children, it tends to happen). I liked the songs - an unlikely scenario, for me - I liked the layers to Elsa's character, harking back to the Beast, and I really am impressed with Bell's and Menzel's singing voices. Still am. Always will be.But then they had to go and rev up the unholy death machine that is Disney marketing and ruin it. No matter where you go, there's that stock image of Elsa and Anna grinning at you, just slapped on every possible thing that is able to be purchased in this country (if I see one more effing Olaf ... ), it's so half-assed, it's insulting. Between this and the songs that you just can't seem to escape, this movie has been beaten into submission. But unlike 'The Lion King', this was actually a pretty good movie. But I just don't have the constitution for it anymore. Because they couldn't just let it be. And I know that marketing shouldn't have any impact on how you rate a movie here. Most of the time I'd wholeheartedly agree with that. But here's a textbook example of how a studio can muck things up for someone's enjoyment of a movie - and that is entirely germane to this situation.God help us all with Star Wars.4/10",4,5,14,6 February 2015
Hellboy," Perlman owns
","'Hellboy' has its own sort of magic; the product of ideal actor and director bringing to life a character they evidently love. That magic is right there on screen, and even though we've seen some superhero movies over the past 15 years also do this (to an extent), it's uncommon for a movie like this to be made with such adoration.Del Toro's sensibilities fit right in with the paranormal atmosphere, while Ron Perlman brings Hellboy to life as the big red lummox hiding beneath a gruff exterior. This is a world full of freaks and monsters in which it's rather easy to spend two hours. And those freaks have dimension and heart.Not to mention a giant tentacled god.There's no pretense here; I love this movie. It's impressive, sweet, and massively entertaining.",8,1,1,8 March 2019
Stardust," Good fairy tales don't come along everyday
","'Stardust' really seems like one of those well-machined fantasies that checks off all of the genre tropes: witches, curses, falling stars, enchantment, a valiant hero, pirates . . . And the earnest romance weaves all of this into a nice package. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the hell out of her sorceress role and steals this show, while De Niro offers himself up as a transvestite buccaneer, and the cast is rounded out by beautiful women. It's a little unwieldy and the running feels long after a while, but stick with it and the movie rewards on a true love level alone. Plus, it's a Neil Gaiman story. Win.7/10",7,0,0,20 July 2015
School of Rock," A winning concoction
","'School of Rock' is one of those movies where the casting is key. It's got a good story, but if you don't have an endearing lead and a great group of kids for him to teach, there's really no movie. Hack Black's perpetual motion (er, spasticity?) does a lot to make this movie work, and he's got a genuine rapport with these kids (musically talented in their own right). The story doesn't really hold any surprises; the jig's coming up and you can see it from afar), but the stand-up message is worth it. And it's overall some good fun. Black always struck me as a polarizing screen presence, but here, he's a charmer.7/10",7,1,1,6 October 2015
The Game," What a rip-off
","For the most part, 'The Game' is a decent thriller. You question what is and isn't real, and Michael Douglas does a great job of selling the character's descent into paranoid angst (the whole thing's on his shoulders, and it's an admirable performance, mostly). But even so, in a movie that puts your protagonist through all manner of doubt and peril, I might've cared about his character were the direction not so detached. This movie is cold. Stylish, sure, but definitely clinical.And honestly, no thrills can make up for that grossly moronic ending.SPOILERS Alright, so after all of that stress and anxiety you've put this guy through, bringing him low enough to walk off the edge of a skyscraper roof, you neuter everything with an airbag waiting at street level. And then he just gets up, realizes it's all been a stunt (all to exorcise some daddy issues), and everything's okay? Cue the band and party atmosphere? What if he'd picked a different side of the roof to step over? And there's no way any sane human being wouldn't cold cock Sean Penn for that. Seriously.It's a rug-pull, and it sours the whole movie.Respect your audience, Fincher,4/10",4,2,5,28 January 2016
Kick-Ass," It's funny, it's violent, and actually a breath of fresh air among all of the trite genre movies.
","'Why hasn't anyone become a superhero?'That question is at the heart of Matthew Vaughn's 'Kick-Ass', a deconstructionist superhero movie that sees awkward teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) actually don the spandex and venture out onto the rooftops ... who then proceeds to promptly gets his ass kicked on more than one occasion. But the question gets away from Vaughn, as the movie introduces a larger narrative and centers on a violent pre-teen girl (Chloe Moretz) who, as the sidekick to the Batman-esque Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), eschews a normal childhood in favor of ACTUALLY kicking ass. For the most part, it's a fun ride. Cage gleefully chews the scenery in his gun-wielding Batman ripoff role (complete with Adam West dialogue impersonation). 'Kick-Ass' features more bloody fight scenes than you can shake a stick at, with Moretz doing most of the anatomical damage. And unless you're Roger Ebert, there's some deliciously twisted humor to be found in those ass-kickings. And Mark Strong shines as the big bad guy crime boss (unexpectedly hilarious). There are moments of adolescent angst, the 'hero' actually does get the girl (not really a spoiler, here) and the words, 'With no power comes no responsibility' are actually uttered. What better time for this movie's release than at the height (I hope) of Hollywood's superhero fetish. 7/10",7,3,4,6 August 2012
Ghostbusters," Destined for greatness
","So many things came together at the right time to make 'Ghostbusters' a hit, but in the end, it's just unbelievably quotable. This is one of the reasons it's become something larger than just an effects comedy (that, and a bulletproof Ray Parker, Jr. song). It's the convergence of comically-gifted players, great writing, high production values and a director who knows his stuff that makes this a classic. I love the attention to detail put into the costumes and equipment, and it's always fun to see cosplayers at conventions and on Halloween who have gone to great lengths to make their costumes screen-accurate.The movie was made with enthusiasm, and it shows with every viewing. It's as durable and time-tested its titular pop song. There's a good reason why people (me) always go on and on about this movie, or drop lines into everyday conversation. It's just that good.10/10",10,0,0,31 October 2012
Shrek the Third," Spaceballs 2- . . . I mean, Shrek 3: The Search for More Money
","Easily the weakest of the three movies, plotwise (I know there are four, but this is enough), leaving most of its charms to the ever-increasing background characters. Almost like clockwork, whenever I'd start to drift, Gingerbread Man would show up and steal the scene; or Merlin (Eric Idle); or Arthur (Justin Timberlake).It's clear that the machine is running on fumes at this point, but it's not really a dud; there are a few bits of hilarity. You just have to wait around for them.6/10",6,0,1,14 August 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Well if it ain't broke . . .
","There's a certain recipe to these movies, and 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' adheres faithfully to it Johnny Depp gets into one ridiculous situation after another, plays the dialogue with eccentric flair, all the while acting as a plot device for two central characters. In this case, it's Brenton Thwaites and the lovely Kaya Scodelario. There's an element here of getting the band back together as the crew and Barbossa reappear, and aside from some new curse, it's all very familiar.It's not as overblown as I'd feared (and mercifully shorted than 'At World's End), and maybe that's because of the audience. The guy in from of me was pretty pumped when the Black Pearl made her return; we're talking' fist in the air.Strictly as a vehicle for Johnny Depp to do his pirate thing, it's not bad.6/10",6,2,5,13 June 2017
Slap Shot," One of my favorite sports movies
","To be completely honest, 'Slap Shot' would've charmed me simply for being a hockey movie. We could do with more of those, without Emilio Estevez. But it earns its place among the better (best?) sports movies not for having underdog skill, a committed dream or thirst for winning, but for dabbling in the gutters of blue humor and distilling the sport down to its most low-brow of beer-guzzling violent fun. The closest thing I can think of to compare this to is 'Major League', which is a compliment unto itself.Even if you don't like the sport, the movie is absolutely worth your time for an unusually profane (and always likable) Paul Newman and for the psychotic Hanson brothers.Thoroughly entertaining.8/10",8,2,2,8 January 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," What a waste
","I don't remember the first movie being all that bad, aside from misguidedly dark. It had a decent cast, one central villain, and told the origin story in a standard by-the-book fashion. But that all goes out the window with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2.Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti and Dane DeHaan range from questionable to god awful. When you have one bad apple in your group, it's an acting issue. But half your cast? What happened in two years that Marc Webb suddenly can't direct? Foxx and Giamatti, it's gotta take work to get something bad out of these guys! The other major problem is that they throw everything (kitchen sink, too) into the story. There is a *lot* going on here: three villains, Gwen's Oxford drama, the mystery of Peter's parents, two (almost) crashing planes. One bad guy's enough. If you're good, maybe two. This has three, one of whom is the Green Goblin. Again. Can we drop it with this guy already? It's top-heavy, not epic. Between the plot points and the noise, disorienting effects (I did not watch this on the big screen) and gaps in logic (Why is Electro miffed at Spidey?) this is an overlong train wreck.3/10",3,3,20,9 January 2015
Ex Machina," The robots will enslave us. We all know it. But this is a nice take on it.
","'Ex Machina' is the kind of slow-building and unpredictable movie that I was sure would have one of those rug-out-from-under-you 'mindscrew' endings. Not the good kind, but of the short-changing variety. Thankfully, it goes for the genuine payoff, a fitting capper for such an experimental (and somber) movie. Very nice surprise.This is a story about ideas (some really good ones, too) and its roll-out is appropriately tense from almost start to finish. The effects are fantastic (mostly on Ava herself), and the modernist architecture set against the nature scenery makes for eye-popping visuals.It doesn't feel like a big movie, but its impact is.7/10",7,0,1,15 September 2015
Back to the Future Part III," The holy trilogy goes out with a bang
","It's a tall order for a third movie to not only bring the series to a tidy conclusion, but to follow up the hectic tone of the previous entry. But 'Back to the Future Part III' does both, and a great job no less. What's cool about this is that, even though the pacing and tone are more relaxed (fitting the Old West setting), it's still a tight script. I don't tend to look at the clock during this movie, and that says a lot.Also, this is Doc's story, and it's a great change of pace to finally see him a little more front-and-center. I have to admit, his intro in this movie is also pretty badass. And Steenburgen's nod to 'Time After Time' is a treat.'Part III' is a great resolution to the series, tying up all the loose threads and bringing things to an end with a nice dose of character. This could've gone sideways (one wrong move, and you'll wind up with a 'Godfather Part III'), but it never does, and makes for one hell of a finish to the trilogy.9/10",9,4,4,28 October 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A soaring effort
","'Nausicaä of the Valley' of the Wind is a movie that just seems to get everything right: how to take its audience to a fully-realized fantasy world (steampunk-tinged yet bursting with opulent color); how to tell a story with an emphatic but not smothering environmental message; and anchor it with a strong female character. I was just as enthralled with the animation as I was with the music.There's an amazingly empathic heart beating inside Nausicaä and it feels like a deeply personal effort. Studio Ghibli's reputation for quality and imagination is firmly established, and this is no disappointment in that respect.Absolutely worth seeing.8/10",8,0,1,16 April 2017
Transformers," It really takes the wind out of your sails as a fan
","One thing that always bugged me about TRANSFORMERS (aside from the eyesore robot design, LaBeouf, and giving Optimus Prime a mouth), is that it felt like a ripoff of INDEPENDENCE DAY: nerd pinpoints enemy signal, big attack, stuff blows up, motley band of heroes find alien that the government's been hiding for decades; that was kind of a deal-breaker for me. Most of my problem with this movie is script-related. A lot of it is hard to watch, the logic is specious and the gags are awful.On the whole, there are better ways to do a big Transformers blockbuster, and Michael Bay is the wrong direction (incomprehensible action scenes, dizzying camera movements). For one, alien doesn't equate with insectile. They don't have to look like toys from the '80s, but they also don't have to be hideous. This is some expensive CGI, but I can't tell what body party I'm looking at. And it feels like a Michael Bay movie for most of its running time, and the guy's got his own massive niche (this is not a dig) . . . but this is unbelievably silly, even in its serious moments.4/10",4,0,2,6 January 2015
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Christmas Town? Hmmm . . .
","No one saw THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas securing a solid pop culture standing, but it certainly has. And that makes me happy. There's some unexpected heart to this movie - at the very least on a technical level (you can see it was a labor of live with the staggering attention to detail and amazingly fluid animation, particularly in Jack's spindly limbs). And I love that, at its core, it's about a misguided scare king trying to extrapolate the meaning of Christmas from its various parts (complete with a scene in the lab). To top that off, it all goes horribly wrong. How often do you see Santa totally pi**ed? This is a winner for its songs alone, but it's also a high watermark in stop-motion animation. It's macabre, a little dark and just demented enough to still be wholly unique.8/10",7,0,0,20 December 2014
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Captivating
","At its core, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' contains a message about the power of the press that's both powerful and disappointing. It's hard to reconcile what's on TV today with what Edward R. Murrow was doing in 1953 when he used his show to push back against Sen. McCarthy. There was nobility in Murrow's fight, and David Strathairn plays him with a quietly commanding presence. He delivers Murrow's words beautifully and it's a highlight that the telecasts play out (largely) on their own. This is a modest story but makes for good drama and breezy entertainment.7/10",7,0,0,30 April 2015
Big Hero 6," Some decent superhero junk food
","'Big Hero 6' is kind of a misnomer as the movie really focuses on two team members and relegates the other 4 to set dressing. Know that going in and you'll be fine. For me, the heart of the story lay in the relationship between Hiro and Baymax (mostly because they pumped the big white airbag so full of charm and personality, he's a great character). But that's where the movie started to feel a lot like 'How To Train Your Dragon', and not just because the hero is perched on the big guy's back. Hiro/Baymax, Hiccup/Toothless; the 4 remaining superhero team, the viking background players. It's not a deal-breaker, I guess, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't nagging. For all I know, it was like this in the original comic. But either way, I hope they give some thought to the other four in the next movie and make them actual characters.This is a pretty movie, to be sure. They did a great job with San Fransokyo. But between the undercooked characters and the lame villain (easily pegged from the beginning), there's plenty of room for improvement.6/10",6,1,32,24 March 2015
Dumb and Dumber," At the very least, it lives up to its title. And that ain't a bad thing.
","At some point, maybe 10 years back, I finally came around to the juvenile wonder that is DUMB AND DUMBER. Can't imagine why I wasn't fond back in '94 when I was actually 14 years of age, but now it taps right into my inner 14 year-old. It's shockingly quotable (it surprises me much mileage I get outta these lines), and it's just unbelievably dumb; these guys move from one moronic decision to the next, and you just wanna wring their necks for passing on the bus full of swimsuit models. Together with ACE VENTURA, this is Jim Carrey at his funniest and it seems tailor-made for his physical comedy strengths. It even works as a road movie, with a surprisingly catchy soundtrack.These laughs just don't get old.8/10",8,1,2,30 December 2014
Grave of the Fireflies," Very good, but very rough
","'Grave of the Fireflies'sure isn't a movie I can put myself through with any kind of frequency, but it does make you think about those caught in the middle during wartime. To really turn the knife, the focus here is on two orphaned children. There's money but no food, jobs or family. Is there any possible happy ending here? Hell no! But it's still a powerful story that goes for the emotional throat. And I still care deeply for these characters even after all is said and done. With such a (tear-jerker) reputation, I have to admit I walked into this expecting to come out a blubbering fool. I didn't to such an extent, but on the other hand, it's not everyday you see such power from an animated film.It's just so bloody unfair what these poor kids have to go through, but I can't recommend this highly enough.8/10",8,1,2,18 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An unforeseen upswing for the sequel trilogy
","The short version is this: I love this movie. The year's passage after seeing 'The Last Jedi' hasn't dulled its impact. This is a movie that approaches the status quo and completely flips the table. It's fearless; it's surprising; it's unexpected; it's the kick-in-the-ass that this new trilogy needed. The only question I'm left with at the end of watching this is, 'Where the hell do we go from here?'. And that is exciting.*SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS*Now for the (much) longer version. I appreciate the movie from a warts-and-all perspective; and there are definite flaws. For one, the entire Canto Bight sequence. I like the theme introduced, but it's a tangent that slows the movie down. That, and Benicio Del Toro. Just doesn't work for me. You could also make an argument against the general pacing of the film.That said, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Particularly with Mark Hamill's performance; far and away the movie's shining star. He realized a broken Luke Skywalker and brought out the conflict and pain therein. His scenes with Daisy Ridley were among the best in the movie. I can't speak highly enough of him in this film. His finale still hits me square in the chest, and it stands in direct competition with Yoda's appearance for my very favorite scene (I can't tell you how excited I was to see Yoda again in the theater, put to phenomenal use; it's nothing short of a tonic).There are issues I had with The Force Awakens that this (thankfully) addresses directly. I love that Rey's parents turned out to be nobodies (think about it, the last thing she should be is a Skywalker or a Kenobi); I love that undeveloped characters like Snoke and Phasma are summarily dealt with, giving the next movie freedom to move; and I love that Kylo Ren suddenly has purpose as a character.The more I see this, the more I get the criticisms. Things that could've been done differently, better, etc. What I don't understand is the acute backlash. If anything, The Last Jedi just exposes the flaws of the last movie. Sure, Luke didn't get his heroic turn in the conventional sense, but neither did Han or Leia. They were just used as background players for the new generation, but they deserved so much more. Luke gets shafted the most; The Force Awakens centers on 'Where is Luke?' but all we get is a wordless non-ending.And why is the Rebellion (Resistance) right back where it started? They were so quick to copy the original trilogy that Han, Leia and Luke are fighting and running again for no good reason. Everyone's old and tired and repeating the past. This never sat well with me, and because of the circumstances (R.I.P. Carrie), our heroes are dead.As much as 'The Last Jedi' leaves us (me) with a sense of hope, I am cynical. I don't doubt for a second that Abrams will retcon Rey's heritage (noooo, Ren was lying!) and probably bring back Snoke. The desire to play it safe is strong with Disney - especially with their knee-jerk reaction to Solo's underperformance. Abrams is all-too-willing to wield the nostalgia bait, and it makes me nervous about Episode IX.But here's what keeps me engaged: I'm pretty sure Luke will return. And even in Force ghost form, that's enough to buy a ticket for the next one.",8,6,22,29 April 2019
Brave," Sadly homogenized
","I dunno what to make of 'Brave'. It says PIXAR before the title, but this is very much a Disney movie, from the gags and rhythms right down to the cutesy tone. I think that's the biggest thing; it's just kinda generic. Which is disappointing because it's set in the underused Scotland (and features some really picturesque locales). But mostly, it's the weak story, and it feels surprisingly long for 90 minutes. There was some great buildup with Merida's archery, but no payoff for such an independent female warrior.It started out with promise, but falls right in line with 'Tangled' and 'Frozen' product.5/10",5,1,2,20 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," I can get behind these misfits
","I'll admit right now that I did not expect much from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Never heard of the comic and didn't have hopes of any height. But they turned all that around with the trailer (they knew Chris Pratt's charisma would sell this). What's really cool is that every character had personality beyond just Pratt, and I really dig the movie's sense of humor; some really good one-liners here. And I love that Quill's Walkman played such as important role in the movie. It was a nice character touch. The fight (and dogfight) scenes were exciting, it didn't take itself too seriously and it made for a good time at the movies. Bring on the sequel.7/10",7,4,9,27 December 2014
Caddyshack," Actually makes golf a watchable sport
","You mention 'Caddyshack' and you're talking about one of the great '80s comedies. Its humor ranging from sexy to scatological, this is some finely-tuned lowbrow material. And it just works. What's funny is that this is supposed to be Michael O'Keefe's story, but the movie's hijacked by the comic veterans (Chase, Dangerfield and Murray). The real brilliance of this movie is seeing the ad-lib ripcord being pulled on Bill Murray and watching him go. That stuff about the Dalai Lama is gold! The cake's icing is the lovely (and nude) Cindy Williams, not to mention the gopher. Between the one-liner factory, bawdy humor and a Kenny Loggins pop song, it's a recipe for success.8/10",8,0,3,20 July 2015
The Evil Dead," What happens in the woods stays in the woods
","It's always interesting to go back to a famous director's early days and see the film that showed all of his/her promise. In Sam Raimi's case, that film would be the 1981 gore-fest 'The Evil Dead'.Five college students steal way for the weekend to an isolated cabin in the woods of Tennessee (what could go wrong?). Stashed in the cellar is an old Sumerian text, better known as the Book of the Dead. Also with this book is a tape recording that, when played, recites the written contents of the book . . . and summons the spiritual evils that lurk within the woods. In no time, the cabin turns into a haunted house, the woods become alive and demons start possessing the new tenants.It's a horror film that's heavy on scares and bodily fluids and light on character development. The college students aren't so much characters as they are archetypes (even Bruce Campbell, who will go on to play the memorable hero in the sequels, is just the token gangly dweeb here). But it's not a movie about character. Five kids get trapped in a cabin, surrounded by evil, and all manner of horrors ensue. That's it. And the filmmakers deliver.The film's strength lies in Raimi's ability to make the absurd (i.e. a woman being raped by vines) uncomfortable to watch - if not downright scary. And on a shoestring budget, no less. It's a scary movie laced here and there with some comedic touches - but things won't get funny until 'Evil Dead 2'.7/10",Null,0,1,4 October 2011
Shrek 2," Shrek's b-side material
","Although largely a fun endeavor, 'Shrek 2' is in full franchise mode, trading in some of the original's spark for a dose of cynicism. The story's a retread of the inner beauty theme from the first movie; one that grinds things down once Shrek becomes human, and picks right back up when Gingerbread Man shows up. The three leads are still harmonious, and the new characters are also enjoyable; but aside from one really good cat joke, it feels like a step down.6/10",6,1,1,14 August 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It's all fun and games while the bodies pile up
","It's no wonder I fell hard for Uma Thurman when 'Kill Bill' first hit the scene; The camera is extremely flattering and her sex appeal fits very well in the exploitation film mold.To me, 'Vol. 1' is Tarantino at his most watchable. The scrambled narrative, eclectic soundtrack and excessive violence all work together with unparalleled harmony. The characters are as colorful as the palette. But it all really comes down to the revenge angle, and this movie's got it everywhere it counts. The Bride is wronged in the worst way, and her fury is surprisingly satisfying (wasn't sure this would hold up, but it does exceedingly well). Between the bloodsprays and the fight scenes, there's an electrical charge coursing through all of this. That final showdown at the House of Blue Leaves is insane. I used to think that Vol. 2 had a leg up with the character development, but it's hard to compete with something this exciting.9/10",9,0,2,16 February 2017
Jurassic World," Same island, new faces
","I have nothing bad to say about 'Jurassic World'; for all intents and purposes, this is a decent Summer blockbuster that'll hold your attention throughout. At least, it did for me, and I was watching it on the small screen. But I guess I have nothing great to say about it either? Almost none of the characters are memorable (think 'The Lost World'), which allows Chris Pratt to easily steal the movie. So if he's your thing, then settle in. But look, Jurassic Park hasn't been great since the first one, and this movie rides that nostalgia to the very end. I guess that makes sense if you're going to reboot this series, but it doesn't leave you with much after the movie's over.",6,0,1,11 August 2018
Mission: Impossible II," Less bang for your buck despite the bullets
","'Mission Impossible II' did _not_ stand the jump from big to small screen. It's one of those movies that puts the chapter-skip button to use. When the guns are holstered, it's a real drag, and that's really the best way to describe this movie. Thandie Newton's subplot just doesn't work, and you find yourself wanting to move ahead to the next action scene. Speaking for myself, that is.To that end, if you have the patience to sit through the melodrama, there's a real charge to the gunfights. The tactical precision of the first film has been replace by dual-wielded Berettas; and it's fun, even today. Using your motorcycle sideview to shoot the guy behind you? That's total John Woo! The man left his mark on the franchise, to be sure - it's just a shame it had to be with such a dull script.4/10",4,1,3,5 August 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Coasts on its lead actors' chemistry
","It wasn't until after watching 'The Adjustment Bureau' that I learned it's based on a Philip K. Dick story. And you wouldn't know that to look at this movie, seeing as they've wrung all the Dickian paranoia out of it in favor of an overt 'love conquers all' angle. But even with the dependable likability of Matt Damon (and the splendid Emily Blunt), as a love story, it gets a bit frustrating. I mean if you're going to have interventionist men in hats slinking around our world through magic doorways, a little menace can only spice things up, right? Do we ever doubt that this appealing coup0le will triumph over the odds? Nah.6/10",6,0,0,17 November 2015
Black Snake Moan," Exploitation, but with heart
","Y'know, it's funny, the only thing I'd heard about 'Black Snake Moan was that Samuel L. Jackson chains Christina Ricci to a radiator. Which, in and of itself, will leave you with the wrong connotations. But it's not until he actually does fasten her down that the movie finally gets interesting. Prior to that moment, this was some harsh subject matter, and I wasn't sure I wanted to stick around to see more punishment. But that brutality pays off in a redemptive second half, which is where - thankfully - the black humor is allowed to manifest. Both of these characters are human with their own demons to exorcise, and there's actually some love there. There's a growing bond that we're able to hang onto as an audience. This is a worthwhile story, no question, and the message seems to be healing through restraint and good old fashioned blues. Unconventional, but also kinda refreshing.7/10",7,0,1,10 March 2015
A Bug's Life," Proof that Toy Story wasn't a fluke
","It's under-appreciated, but 'A Bug's Life' has the ingredients for a worthwhile PIXAR movie; conflict, characters, inventive world-building. If you really want to tear holes, you could argue that the story's been done elsewhere (The Seven Samurai, Three Amigos, Galaxy Quest) but there's creativity here and it still feels like something new.And then there's the cast, all well-suited to their roles (with Spacey nailing the terrifying villain; what can't that guy play?) and the side players lend plenty of color. Does Denis Leary seem like a PIXAR fit? Nope, and it turns out he's a highlight.Seems pretty hard to dislike this movie.7/10",7,1,1,15 August 2017
Logan," The claws (really) come out
","Wolverine finally gets his R-rating, and it's a double edged sword. The bright side is that the berserker rage really means something (straight up hack-n-slash, baby). The unpleasant side to this is that there's no shortage of punishment in this movie and that's no more evident than in the lowly states of Logan and Charles Xavier (putting aside the ending, it's heartbreaking to see Patrick Stewart wasting away like this): this world has taken an unbelievable toll on both.It's a painful movie, hitting on everything from death to (fragile) hope to even child abuse; and pretty much everything you'd want in an old-man Logan tale.But my god, is it bleak.7/10",7,3,6,7 July 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Exhausting
","'Age of Ultron' descends upon its audience, hitting the ground running with guns blazing. Makes sense; after all, 'in media res' is probably the best way to start such a thing. But that action . . . it doesn't really stop. Just moves from one huge setpiece to the next, destroying city blocks (sometimes actual cities) in its wake. This movie is so intent on giving us non-stop action and introducing new characters and setting up MCU Phase 3 and pounding our senses that the subtle pieces of character from the first one are all but gone. The relationship between Bruce and Natasha was nice, and they did give Hawkeye some nice personality this time around, but that's about it. And Ultron was a lackluster bad guy, enhanced a bit by Darth Spader, but only just. There was just so much infrastructure here, so much to take in, that you just want some space to breathe. The pieces are all well-machined - a move here, a stunt there, new toys from from Tony Stark - but it's not as satisfying a whole. It does its job at beating you about the face with CGI battle scenes, that much you can't even question. But if this is the MCU's trajectory, then . . . stop the ride, I want to get off.5/10",5,2,8,6 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," It looked like a winner
","It was the recent ad campaign for the sequel that brought 'Hotel Transylvania' to my attention (much to the delight of my five-year-old), but the movie never really gets above 'eh'. It has the usual stale kids' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it's a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it's short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there's an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).My kid liked it, so the movie's got that going for it. But for entertainment that offers multi-generational appeal, I'll have to look elsewhere.5/10",5,5,8,29 September 2015
The Insider," Riveting!
","The main draw for 'The Insider' (for me) isn't the whistleblower story that takes center stage, but the 'other' one that happens after Russell Crowe has breached his contract and given an interview with 60 Minutes. It's the trials of Pacino's character trying to get the story on the air that really resonate with me. Which isn't to say one half is better than the other - this is an extremely watchable film, start to finish - just that you can almost feel Edward R. Murrow's spirit looming large over the proceedings as the power of the press is (almost) smothered by Big Tobacco.Either way, this remains one of my favorite Michael Mann films, almost sneakily compelling as it contains no shootouts, hit men or neon atmosphere. But the pacing here is impeccable.9/10",9,1,1,26 May 2015
Quiz Show," Yeah, I can see this being nominated
","There's something appropriate about Robert Redford heading up a movie about the mid-century quiz show scandals; after all, a lot of this movie centers on a government bureaucrat sniffing for answers. It's not Watergate, but surprisingly engrossing for something related to television. The movie takes its time basking in '50s nostalgia before the real drama kicks in. But when it does, it's remarkable. Subtle, but riveting nonetheless. And even with the shady goings-on it's one of the classier movies I've seen in a long time.That said, the cynicism runs alarmingly deep. The dirty laundry is aired before Congress, but it's not the bad guys that end up paying. The contestants who played along end up being destroyed, while the larger machine continues to churn right along; and that is one bitter ending.Great movie.8/10",8,0,0,9 November 2016
Major League," One of the great sports comedies
","As baseball movies go, MAJOR LEAGUE is my favorite. Been that way since I was a kid, and the laughs are still fresh today. It boasts a terrific collection of characters (pretty much the whole cast - even smartass Bob Uecker - but mostly Berenger, Snipes and Sheen), and MAJOR LEAGUE II even proved that you can't just replace Snipes' charisma with another guy. I love this movie's profane attitude, that these misfits band together in one collective middle finger to the team's shrew owner. There's some real heart here and it's a great down-n-dirty triumph over opposition story. But at the end of the day, it's a great comedy with more than a few memorable one-liners and a winning sense of humor. It's even a great Cleveland movie. And I always forget, between the editing and the roar of the crowd, just how charged that final game is.Be ready to wear a smile when the end credits hit, 'cause there's no other possible facial expression. It's just science.It's a fantastic movie.9/10",9,0,2,18 August 2014
The Dark Knight," Memorable, and a great Batman movie, but ultimately too cumbersome for its own good
","There are parts of 'The Dark Knight' that seize my attention - the Batpod chase, the Bats v. Joker interrogation, Batman's foray into China, and that opening bank heist was extremely well put together - but the movie from start to finish feels bloated and overlong. Part of the greatness of 'Batman Begins' is that it was grand in scope without becoming top-heavy. I realize a major influence on 'TDK' was the sprawling crime saga that is 'Heat', but I'd rather watch that movie. Which isn't to say that this is a bad movie; far from it. So let's cut to the chase on where this movie delivers. The cast, once again, is incredible (Nolan was smart to surround himself with pros), the on- location footage goes a long way in the realism department, and the big action setpieces are pretty crazy. And then The Joker strolls onto the screen and boldly claims the movie for his own. Heath Ledger doesn't just dazzle in the role, he makes off with the movie like a crazed bank robber. Ledger's ballsy performance makes this clown both frightening and hilarious. He owns this movie - and that's saying heaps with a sterling cast like this. This is a textbook case of watching a gifted actor dominate the screen. 7/10Also, let's be honest, Bale's throat cancer voice was pretty effing bad.",7,1,2,1 August 2013
Annie Hall," As a cultural artifact, it's a must-see
","Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I watched 'Annie Hall' to see what beat out 'Star Wars' at the Oscars. And I can see why; it's a critical darling, and has left its own imprint on popular culture. Everything from sitcom to romantic comedy owes a debt to this movie.I liked this movie well enough, primarily for the script. It's playful with staging and multiple fourth-wall breaks (Woody Allen at his funniest here), and written for an adult audience. And Diane Keaton's ditzy performance added a necessary dose of sweetness. On the other hand, It was Allen's presence that sucked a good deal of enjoyment, at least for me. Had I seen this movie forty yeas ago, his neuroticism would've probably seemed a lot fresher to me. As it is, it feels overplayed and grating. But I also know I'll revisit this someday, and I'm probably in store for an epiphany. This just feels like one of those movies. 6/10",6,2,4,2 April 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," A trip worth taking
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen. Even when I first watched this, walking in with no familiarity, I was bewildered, but still couldn't look away. It asks huge questions and let's the viewer come up with their own answer (that's a gamble; rarely does it come off just right). Different interpretations of the film's meaning abound. Unconventional is a great way to describe this.But when all is said and done, it's an adventure, as grand as they come; space travel, artificial intelligence, evolution, the unknown It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm always pleased to see it being screened at revival houses. And if you happen on one showing this in 70mm, pounce on it; the argument can be made that '2001' relies less on plot and more on sight and sound, which means people aren't kidding when they say this is an experience.10/10",10,4,8,12 May 2016
Men in Black," The last (only?) great Will Smith Summer movie
","It's impressive how they were able to produce a great effects comedy out of such a corny comic book property. But thanks to a breezy script, some nice CGI and makeup effects and great comic writing, 'Men in Black' fires on all cylinders. It's got a fine cast (Rip Torn, Siobhan Fallon, Tony Shalhoub, and my favorite Vincent D'Onofrio performance) and there's not very much here (at all) that feels forced. And to top it all off, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones prove to be gifted comedic actors (and at their charismatic utmost). As Sonnenfeld films go, it ranks right up there with 'Get Shorty' and 'The Addams Family'. It's a great New York movie, popcorn movie, and a 90-minute series of memorable one-liners. It was a high-point of '90s movies, for me, and holds up terrifically today. 9/10",9,4,5,5 December 2013
The Graduate," Undoubtedly a product of its time, and that ain't a bad thing.
","I can't say this without a hint of shame, but my first exposure to 'The Graduate' was that scene in 'Wayne's World 2' ('Sorry! Wrong wedding!'). So I came into this movie thinking it was some kind of underdog thing for Dustin Hoffman's character. But there's an appropriate ugliness to this film that disabuses one of that notion very quickly. He's not a character to root for, at all. And there's a sadness to the film's outcome when all is said and done because these are not smart people. That said, Anne Bancroft can seduce any man with that voice. She ends up pretty hateful in the end, but man, she worked her sultry magic. And Katherine Ross, though she's not playing the sharpest knife in the drawer, does a terrific job in such a thankless role. And this is the funniest performance I've ever seen from Dustin Hoffman, suffering in his terrified awkwardness in the face of a classic '60s cougar (damn if Bancroft didn't pioneer that culture). 'The Graduate''s a classic for good reason; great soundtrack (relying on only three songs), great characters, and indeed a well-photographed movie. And it leaves us with some nice ambiguity by the end credits (not a happy ending, personally). It's a well-made film.",8,0,0,3 March 2014
Elysium," A frustrating disappointment
","'Elysium' puts forth a future in which the rich have taken to outer space to live in disease-free comfort while society's dregs wallow in Earth's hellish remains. The protagonist is sick and needs one of those cure-all med bays that only service the upper-crust (MacGuffin for the win!). Does Blomkamp do anything with this? No, he just wants to blow stuff up and shoot big gins. I wouldn't even call this liberal propaganda because it's all there so Matt Damon can go Bourne on everyone and kick some ass. And even when he does change the system, it's a hollow victory. Any world-building is all in service to the run-and-gun latter half. The bad guys here (heartless CEO Fichtner, evil politician Foster with that absurd accent, low-rent sociopath Copley) are awful, not at all fleshed out. This is an eyesore with noise standing in for excitement.5/10",5,1,1,12 February 2015
Taken," One magical scene (almost) makes the movie
","That action hero image that Liam Neeson has cultivated over the last ten-odd years is a well-earned one. And as far as I'm concerned, he did it without throwing a punch. 'Taken' features a scene - you already know the one - in which Neeson calmly lays out the consequences to his daughter's kidnappers: (Note: read these words in his deep gravelly voice) 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.' If it were me on the other end of that phone, I'd know damn well I'm headed for a gruesome end. And 'Taken' pretty much fulfills that promise. Neeson moves from one set of bad guys to the next, methodically laying waste to their scumbag ranks. It's a workmanlike campaign of torture and death. What's disappointing is that the action scenes are a dizzying cut-to-ribbons affair, a stark reminder that this is really your typical Luc Besson eurotrash. It's got that crucial emotional element and a perfectly cast lead actor, but it's never as good as that one phone call.6/10",6,0,0,19 September 2016
This Is Spinal Tap," Comic brilliance
","'This Is Spinal Tap' is certainly not without its memorable moments (Nigel's 50 guitars and amp that goes up to 11; the Stonehenge prop, Harry Shearer trapped in the cocoon; the free-form jazz odyssey), but its genius derives from the biting satire - and yet still loving in its sendup of the British metal scene. And these guys say these insane lines without bursting into laughs! And there's more than a few familiar faces sprinkled throughout the cast: Angelica Huston, Fred Willard, Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal and a not-yet-annoying Fran Drescher. It's a very fun movie; the wit is sharp (for a group of dunces), the tone is just perfect, and it features 'Big Bottom' and 'Sex Farm', two of the funniest songs ever written.8/10",8,1,4,20 May 2014
Avatar," All that fuss for this?
","There's no doubt that, had I seen 'Avatar' in theaters, my reaction would've been kinder. You can still get caught up in the world of Pandora on the small screen (to some extent) and appreciate all of the work that Cameron put into realizing it, but that's really the selling point here. If you take away the 3D and the big screen, this is rehash of familiar stories and recycled characters. Seriously, just take the characters from 'Aliens' and cast new actors. Even Weaver's playing a bitchier version of Ripley here. Throw in the world's most obvious bad guy and professional-vacuum-of-charisma Sam Worthington (not to mention the big loaders), and you've essentially got the biggest selling movie in history. That's what was so disappointing about 'Avatar'; it's wholly derivative. of better Cameron movies.Serious disappointment. 4/10",4,4,9,7 January 2012
There's Something About Mary," Adolescent hilarity
","Here's how you know you're watching a keeper: when Brett Favre shows up with his complete lack of screen presence, yet the laughter continues unabated.'There's Something About Mary' is every winning virtue of the Farrelly Brothers served up in an oddball love story. It moves seamlessly from an awkward teen movie straight into middle-aged depravity. Just an array of sleazy characters, and they are hysterical; chiefly Keith David, Matt Dillon and Chris Klein. As if the one-liners aren't enough, you've got the story of Ted's prom night from Hell, or the story of Mongo the special kid on a leash.This had me in stitches back in the '90s and it still does today. I can't think of that many comedies from such a hit-or-miss decade that still hold such lasting value. I can't speak highly enough of this.9/10",9,1,2,1 March 2017
Mission: Impossible," Mission accomplished
","I never gave 'Mission Impossible' much consideration twenty years ago (I guess I wasn't yet sold on Tom Cruise) and instead took to the later entries as pure action movies. Truth is, it's a pretty cool movie, working mostly on style and convoluted plot twists. The spycraft is more emphasized here (although that's really in the service of the big set pieces (a gripping vault caper and insane helicopter/train scene). Still, it's the little things that pop; who'da thought Ving Rhames sitting alone at a laptop would yield so much charm? As paranoid espionage goes, it holds up pretty well.7/10",7,0,0,5 August 2016
Super 8," Tribute rings hollow
","The biggest thing 'Super 8' has going for it is its cast of child actors. They work well together, they're relatable, and their scenes are where this movie lives and breathes. Good performances, all around. But this movie sells itself as a loving homage to vintage Spielberg, and that's where it's disappointing. Abrams brings his trademarks (always with the lens flares) but gets lost in the reverence. It feels like the key parts of 'Goonies', 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T.' but none of the wonder. No soul. This is an empty vessel - very very skillfully made, but without heart.5/10",5,0,0,28 January 2015
The Last Samurai," A last stand for the ages
","Tom Cruise is your haunted veteran who finds himself fighting a whole new civil war in the Far East; and if you want a crash course in what makes the samurai so damn cool, then this will slake that thirst. It also promises at least one epic battle scene, and surely delivers on that note as well.But I appreciated this movie far more during the quiet moments, when Cruise is held captive by his enemies and forced to learn about the samurai ways. It's his scenes with Ken Watanabe that are really worth the price of admission. They're heartfelt as the two warriors learn to appreciate the simple act of conversation.It's brutal, it's violent, but also just as beautiful as the scenery.",7,2,5,6 August 2019
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Proves there's money in the formula
","There's a familiarity with 'Home Alone 2' that serves it well. If you want to see Stern and Pesci get hurt again, you've come to the right place. And there's serious entertainment value to be had in that respect. You wouldn't believe the squeals of laughter coming from my 8 year-old as Marv took a brick to the face. And another. And even more. Should I be worried? Nah . . .But I enjoyed this one a bit less than the original because the Kevin McAllister character is a harder pill to swallow this time around. Just seems like more of a jerk in this movie. The airport confusion that results in his being separated from his family is more contrived, and it all comes off rather cynical.",6,1,3,20 December 2018
Groundhog Day," Life lessons through cosmic intervention
","A sweet romantic comedy, an inventive premise, and a pitch-perfect roe for Bill Murray. All of this is true of 'Groundhog Day', a move that seems to roof for its egotistical main character even as it punished hum relentlessly. Murray's droll wit is superbly cast as the big-city lout forced to relive the same day over and over, surrounded by unassuming simplicity and good-natured folk. His misery is played to exceptional comedic effect, and on some level this just *had* to have been written for him specifically (like Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'). The roe just seems to fit itself around the actor like a glove.Beyond its irresistible hook, this proves to be a thoughtful, warm and fruitful venture on all fronts. A well-executed entry from the great Harold Ramis.",8,1,1,17 February 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Brutal, but well made
","'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't have the entertainment value of other Tarantino movies (I don't come to this for 100 minutes of escapism). But what it does have is serious cheek. Scratch that, what I really mean is cojones. This movie does a terrific job amping the tension in spartan dialogue scenes, and an even better job commanding your attention with a snap of its figurative fingers. When it's not a bunch of gangsters jawing about pop culture over coffee, it's one of them bleeding out in the backseat of a car, or another taking to a cop with a switchblade (effective ruining 'Stuck in the Middle with You' for me). It's that kind of visceral punch to the face and methodical enjoyment of sadism that this movie prides itself on. And the camera work (a simple pull back to reveal a looming sense of dread, roving camera during a tense warehouse standoff) is the mark of a director who knows how to captivate his audience. The hard-edge-to-fun balance is off for me, which is why I don't make this regular Tarantino viewing, but no question he was on his game here.6/10",6,0,0,6 October 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," As endearing as it gets
","It is a damn shame DreamWorks Animation had to be the one to step up and fill the Viking movie void. C'mon, studios.That said, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one hell of a movie and worth any wait involved. And it's not just Vikings, but also adventure movie . . . everybody learns something here, but they keep things light. It's loaded with heart, memorable characters and beautiful animation (I'm sure the flying scenes were pretty cool in 3D). The sentiment's genuine, the humor razor sharp; it's got an impressive cast, a heartwarming story and It's just a lot of fun.It's not every day you find a modern animated movie so well-packaged.8/10",8,0,1,11 January 2015
Total Recall," Finely-tuned sci-fi/action
","Man, what isn't memorable about 'Total Recall'? Mars, Sharon Stone, 'two weeks', Kuato, Johnny Cab, the Rekall chair . . . to say that this movie doesn't leave its visual mark is just denial. This is Philip K. Dick by way of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and that probably shouldn't work as well as it does. Couple those with Verhoeven's direction (and violence) and Rob Bottin's makeup effects, and it's a heady mixture. This is one of Schwarzenegger's great Summer movies, all wrapped up in a tight package.Highly quotable, too.8/10",8,1,2,7 March 2016
Beauty and the Beast," It is what it is
","I have to admit, I'm not really sure where to stand on 'Beauty and the Beast'. The Mouse clearly didn't treat this with kid gloves; the costumes alone are eye-candy enough and there's not one negative to this cast.But when you get right down to it, it's purely a reimagining (for lack of a better word). As if you'd ever watched the original and thought to yourself, 'This is great, but I wonder what it'd be like with Emma Watson as Belle, or Josh Gad as LeFou'. You're getting the same songs, dialogue and set pieces, and the story doesn't stray at all from the animated version. And yet I found myself missing Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion and the cutesy Disney supporting players (the CGI on Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts & Chip just doesn't compare . . . especially on the Beast).It's a well-appointed movie, and somehow disappointing.6/10",6,0,0,13 June 2017
Sicario," Fascinating
","The word of mouth for 'Sicario' wielded words like taut, suspenseful and tour de force. And for most of the movie, I was feeling underwhelmed. And just around the corner would be a scene - quiet and understated - that easily lived up to the hype. This movie has a funny way of doing that.All throughout, I got a distinct 'Training Day' vibe (the upside is that this is less blunt about it and a much better overall movie). And my favorite aspect of the film is when Emily Blunt's character is out of her depth, seemingly wandered afield of order and sanity with an unlawful CIA. These macho head games are the movie's bread and butter. Second to that is Benicio Del Toro, and the narrative focus this character takes in the third act is truly nail-biting.Unnerving is the best word I can use to describe this movie. It just inserts itself into your brain and doesn't shake off.8/10",8,0,0,10 January 2016
Pretty Woman," The premise is absurd, but the movie's irresistible
","Let's face it, the subject matter in 'Pretty Woman' is iffy, and it makes for an unlikely fairy tale (although, between you and me, Disney could use more movies with prostitutes in its catalog). And the movie's charms might not work at all depending on how you approach this.But I don't think Julia Roberts has ever been more likable than she is here, and that quality runs throughout the cast (except for Jason Alexander, going for maximum douchebag). It's fascinating reading about some of the edits made during production as this could've been a much darker movie. But it came out more than alright.All of the pieces fall into place nicely here, and with Roberts and Gere, it's no wonder this was such a big hit. Is it reality? Of course not, it's a Garry Marshall romantic comedy. But it is exceedingly enjoyable.I love this movie.8/10",8,0,2,15 July 2016
Pulp Fiction," It set the world on fire, and for good reason
","I can absolutely understand why PULP FICTION has achieved the lofty cultural status it has. Even if you don't like some of the subject matter or Tarantino's seedy underworld, this is an exceedingly well-written movie; very violent and occasionally hilarious. The situations are absurd and there's great dark humor that arises because of this. And QT knows how to go from ridiculous to tense and unsettling at the drop of a hat. It's unbelievable how much enjoyment can be had from two people talking, and the movie is driven by these very conversations. And this is one bulletproof cast, right down to its bit parts. Even the violence is so over-the- top and in such bizarre situations that you can't help but laugh at how nonsensical it all is. This movie has grade-A dialogue (it's quotable beyond measure), the jumbled narrative works extremely well for the movie's unexpectedly connected stories, and it went a long way in defining the '90s (it certainly redefined Dick Dale's Misirlou). Not a bad movie, either.8/10",8,0,1,2 October 2014
Jack Reacher," I want more.
","I remember seeing the trailers for 'Jack Reacher', last year. They sold it as a badass Tom Cruise muscle care beat 'em up. So it probably turned some off when the move wound up being part crime thriller, part '70s action film (no caffeinated editing or shaky cam), methodically paced, and tension that runs at a slow burn. You can always blame the chimps in marketing.Size controversy aside, Tom Cruise brings all that is necessary to the role, making you believe that he can actually beat the shít out of 5 other guys in the middle of the street. And as an action film, 'Reacher' subtly delivers, with a nail-biter of an opening sniper scene, an ending quarry shootout that is surprisingly tense (happily so), and a well-done car chase that leaves one righteous cherry-red Chevelle in a tragic state (heartbreaking, that one). The fist fights are raw and brutal, well-choreographed with Cruise delivering a plethora of groin shots and bone crunches. It's a sight to behold. What's disappointing about this movie is that it's a one-off. It didn't do well at the box office, and I'd love to see more of this character. He's hard-nosed, brutal when pushed, and when the case is solved, he drops off the grid. Is it even possible to do that in today's hyper- connected world? The ability to just quietly recede just floors me. But even more than that, it's his code of doing what's right that makes him someone to root for (that fist-pumper of a closing shot really brings it home). Like 'Dredd', 'Jack Reacher' is a thoroughly pleasant surprise of 2012 ... and probably the last we'll see of both. 7.5/10",7,7,10,30 May 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," The dialogue will make you work, but it's worth it
","'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' has that kinetic style that comes from making music videos - but it's not nearly as empty as that sounds, what with all of the sub-plots going on here. This is a dingy underworld populated with a wide array of colorful characters - all sleazy, but thoroughly entertaining, be they nasty muscle men or rank amateurs. And it's a movie that rife with personality; great lines, a soundtrack mixing '70s soul with '90s rock, and even the violence has a sense of humor. And then, outta nowhere, there's Sting as a disapproving bartender.It's a gas.7/10",7,1,1,23 June 2015
Les Misérables," I'm no expert on the play's history, but the vocal talent makes this worthwhile
","This isn't anywhere near my genre, so LES MISÉRABLE was probably never going to blow my hair back. I've seen this on stage and I know the story - it's just that the songs aren't really my forté. Also, there was a lot of in-your-face hand-held camera-work, and that got old pretty quickly.That said, I can wholeheartedly appreciate the skill herein on a technical level. Hugh Jackman felt right at home with the singing, and his voice is admirable. Crowe's no slouch, either. And the title of this thing pretty much describes what you're in for, so it's no dose of Prozac.But Anne Hathaway's rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' is worth the price of admission, even if it comes very early on in a 2-and-a-half hour movie. But have the tissues ready, because it is bloody heartbreaking.6/10",6,1,1,20 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It's a pleasure
","Despite the mention of Thanos and five different post-credits scenes, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is just that kind of Marvel movie that flows very well on its own terms. No MCU infrastructure to maintain, it's free to do its own thing. Which is refreshing, let me tell you. To that end, it's exactly what I was hoping for; the songs are well chosen (The Chain, in particular, one of my very favorite songs) the humor's great, and the story's strong enough to balance new faces (Kurt Russell, Stallone, the Hoff). It's a little saggy in the middle with everyone separating off on their various narrative jaunts, but when the group is together, the movie fires on all cylinders.7/10",7,2,5,13 June 2017
Titanic," With better characters, the romance might actually merit the running time
","Well, it's not 'Avatar' levels of disappointment, but 'Titanic' is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it's actually about White Star Line's monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director's name. But the rest of it . . . 5/10",5,3,5,8 September 2017
The Untouchables," 'THAT's the Chicago way!'
","far and away my favorite De Palma film, 'The Untouchables' remains one of the great gangster/corruption movies. I can't imagine it hews all that closely to historical fact, but it makes for great entertainment; exciting when the heroes make gains, heartbreaking when they suffer (horrific) losses. There's some nice camera work in this movie and the train station scene is a masterclass on unbearable suspense. And even though Costner fits well in the noble crusader role, it's Connery who really steals the movie. Seriously, he's on fire here. And all of this works in utter spite of that awful score.Great movie.8/10",8,1,2,2 July 2015
The Matrix Reloaded," The Wachowskis lost focus, and the sequel really suffers for it.
","There's one scene in particular that's emblematic of my disappointment in 'The Matrix Reloaded': The Burly Brawl (or 100 Smiths Fight, whatever you want to call it). Neo's just made the big discovery, he's going out to start his new quest - oh but wait, we'll just put the movie on hold for this seven minute exercise in motion sickness. Nothing even comes of the fight; Neo flees. It's that brand of special-effects-trumping-story that really derails this movie. There are new ideas and bigger themes, sure, but they're drowned out by poor pacing and talking scenes. Things grind to a halt for a rave scene, Neo has to talk to the Oracle, then the Merovingian, then Colonel Sanders, and you just want things to get moving again. The first movie had its share of exposition, but it served to shed light on the mystery on this strange world we've just been thrown into. 'Reloaded' really shines during the action scenes, but it's unfortunately one of those movies that really lends itself to the Chapter Skip feature on your DVD player. 4/10",4,1,3,5 May 2014
The Disaster Artist," The effort's there, but the aim is off
","I'm not gonna lie, I had high hopes for 'The Disaster Artist', but . . . eh, let's face it, they showed all the funny stuff in the trailers. Yeah, it's one of those movies, and in that respect, Seth Rogen steals the show (simply by virtue of playing the center of the crew's frustration). Don't get me wrong, you've gotta give James Franco credit here, he's got the Tommy Wiseau 'character' down cold - the guy goes all out - but the movie goes awry because it tries to make Wiseau into some kind of misunderstood conundrum. The best parts are when they're actually making 'The Room', but that's only half the movie. 6/10",6,0,1,8 April 2018
Zombieland," Time to nut up or shut up
","If ever you need affirmation of Woody Harrelson's charismatic virtues, 'Zombieland' is Exhibit A. Granted, a big part of it is the character as written (and it's done well) with its collection of killer lines, but Tallahassee is the comedic backbone of the whole movie. And the guy brings the good ol' boy charm in spades. And I love that he's battling the undead in a quest for Twinkies. It's one hell of a character.And it's a fun movie. The cameo/bit-part (I dunno if it'd count as a spoiler, but I still won't say who it is) is totally from out of left field, but still adds to the movie's charm. The truly odd thing I've found about this movie is, as likable as Harrelson is, they somehow manage to drain loads of likability from Emma Stone. That was surprising, and not something I'd thought possible. But it's still a fun movie, and it's gotten a surprising amount of play from me over the years.7/10",7,1,3,31 October 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a vexing movie
","This isn't the first time I've seen 'It's A Wonderful Life', but it still leaves me cold. And it's primarily because the Dickensian 'what-if?' hook that redeems George Bailey in the end isn't enough to make up for the brutal treatment of that character up until that point. I know that's a minority opinion; my family thinks I'm nuts. But look, Bailey's a dreamer, brimming with a youthful ambition that gets snuffed out time and again by his obligation to Bedford Falls. Sure, there's a message here, that he protects the town from predatory capitalism, but to see the man struck down by one cruel twist of fate after another is beyond frustrating; and the payoff feels cheap in comparison.This is a classic for a reason, and who knows, maybe I'll grow into it. But as it stands, its charms are wasted on me.6/10",6,6,12,15 December 2016
The Departed," This is some tense stuff
","I'd heard a major spoiler before seeing 'The Departed' several years back, which I honestly though ruined the movie. But the death of that primary character was only a small piece of it. Most of the time with this movie, you're just wondering which 'something bad' is going to happen to DiCaprio. I mean, the walls just do not stop closing in on this guy. Scorsese lays on the dread something fierce. But those last ten minutes of the film are on twist after the next, just one character turning on another. And even today, I was caught right up in it, as if I'd never seen this before.Plot twists aside (and they happen like shotgun blasts), 'The Departed' sells itself with its roster of actors. I mean, just look at this cast. Not to mention the sizzling dialogue. I dunno if crime epic is the right phrase for this, but it's definitely a killer cop/mob movie.8/10",8,0,1,13 April 2015
Die Hard," This baby never gets old
","It always throws my family for a loop that I watch DIE HARD every Christmas. But I can't help it, it's tradition. It's been a Top 5 of mine for many years and I don't see that changing anytime soon. It's a first-rate action/thriller and takes everything great about the action genre and just makes it better. If the screen isn't being owned by Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman (riveting performances, both), there's the welcome comic relief of Hart Bockner, Paul Gleason and the FBI guys. It features a score that's Michael Kamen at his best, striking photography, a relatable hero and a script with no throwaway scenes. Part of the fun of watching this movie is getting to spend two hours inside the Nakatomi building. The sets reflect the building's opulence, and even the unfinished floors provide all sorts of atmosphere. It's impressive how many things DIE HARD gets right. Let me put it this way: compare this to the more recent entries in the series. It's a jarring difference.10/10",10,2,3,23 December 2014
Psycho," Thieves check in but they don't check out
","Watching 'Psycho' reminded me a lot of Spielberg's 'Duel', and it's obvious where the homages lie. And even though we all probably know the spoilers before walking into this, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It's the buildup that matters, whether Janet Leigh's negotiating the open road with a guilty conscience or just stepping into the shower. I knew exactly what would happen, but I still couldn't look away. Hitchcock knows how to ratchet suspense; it's like seeing the master at work. Which is usually the case with his movies, it's just that this time, it's steeped in sin and voyeurism. We're all complicit, and that level of audience manipulation isn't sold in stores.Great movie.8/10",8,0,2,6 March 2017
American Made," The gringo who always delivers
","It's never boring and almost always colorful, but it took me a while to nail down why 'American Made' is so entertaining. It's because Tom Cruise is playing a cinematic Tommy Vercetti, in bed with the CIA, Escobar, Noriega, even the White House; high on vice and seemingly bulletproof. It's a playful flashback to a lawless time, and Doug Liman has the spirited direction and fast cutting to really make it pop. You could chalk it up to Cruise's easygoing confidence, but there isn't really a negative to any of this. Highly engrossing. 8/10",8,0,1,9 March 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Really, Spielberg?
","Most of the time, if I see a bad movie, I don't need to spend time afterwards scrubbing it from my consciousness. But I did with 'Revenge of the Fallen', which is the whole reason for the '1' rating; not one that I've ever given out before. But I don't ever want to sit through this again.It's the same hideous bot designs as last time, same dizzying camera movements and ugly palette, just more of all of those for the sake of a bigger sequel. But I've never seen a movie this bad. LaBeouf is more spastic than ever and the story is needlessly convoluted for a giant robots movie. I didn't have any fun with this; it's loud, incoherent and Michael Bay's rocking the shaky cam. Seriously? Up until now, his brand has been tolerable - not all that enjoyable, but tolerable. But here, it's just awful. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not pretending the Transformers is something bigger than it is. It isn't. But everything that was wrong with the first movie is exacerbated here: characters and a story that are really badly drawn, horrible CGI (be honest: those robots are hideous) and action that's no fun to look at. Except this time, there's a broad attempt at 'humor', be it racist or scrotal. And were the vulgar comedy actually funny, there wouldn't be a problem! No problem at all. If that's not bad enough, it's 150 minutes long. It's merciless! At a certain point, the stupid becomes suffocating. So yeah, it's a rating befitting a movie I want to forget. A shameless exercise in making Summer fare painful, and escapism shouldn't be an endurance test. Eff this movie.1/10",1,3,11,24 September 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," Breath of fresh air
","I'm convinced that everyone should see 'When Harry Met Sally' just for the orgasm scene. I can assure you it's worth sitting through a romantic comedy for (on display here is meg Ryan's considerable charm and comedic talents), and it's a classic piece of cinema for a reason. And speaking of romantic comedies, here's one that defies the ridiculously formulaic nature of the genre as it's become in recent years; intelligent, accessible, and even though the relationship material has been mined by myriad sitcoms over the last twenty years, its voice still seems fresh. The dialogue's got wit, and it works well given this well-chosen cast.Even if this isn't doing it for you, settle in for a great Harry Connick Jr. soundtrack.7/10",7,2,2,20 January 2016
Crazy Heart," Sweet redemption
","If I had to describe 'Crazy Heart', I'd call it a country song that's been thrown up onto the big screen. And I say that in the most complimentary fashion because it's the kind of quiet, worn-down cowboy song that sneaks up behind you and does so without being ostentatious or melodramatic.The cast here all hold their own (between Maggie Gyllenhaal, Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell), but it's the star turn from Jeff Bridges that really makes this shine. He embodies the pain and self-recrimination of a has-been performer on the downslope of life. Like the rest of the movie, he's organic and the award-winning performance speaks for itself. 7/10",7,2,2,8 January 2016
Love Actually," Shouldn't be nearly as good as it is
","In some respects, 'Love Actually' is every bit the gift-wrapped box of sentiment you'd think just looking at the DVD cover. Some of this rings unbelievable, and I tend to be the person who finds that a turnoff. Maybe that's the cynicism talking. But there was a point when all the moving pieces clicked (right around when Colin Firth is bidding adieu to his Portuguese maid, and soon after, the Norah Jones song kicks in) and I really got sucked into the interwoven subplots . And it's not all love and treacle; there a sizable amount of heartache also built in. This is a hell of a cast (with Neeson, Firth, Rickman and Thompson as standouts) and if you're looking for a Christmas movie, short on commercialism and long on warmth, you really could do a lot worse than this.7/10",7,1,2,15 December 2016
Sausage Party," I like the idea, but this needs a much better script
","With this kind of merrily vulgar humor, I guess it's kind of a feat that 'Sausage Party' was greenlit in the first place. Honestly, this had me at Disney parody, but its targets are much more varied: organized religion, racial division, consumerism. And its cheap animation is at odds with the voice talent (seriously, look at that cast). I think that cheapness contributes nicely to the middle finger that is this movie.On the other hand, as an actual comedy, this is the worst I've seen in a long time; chock-full of facepalm gags and insufferable dialogue. If it wasn't trying so hard to be edgy and just roll with it, this would be fun. At the very least, the vocal talent would probably save it. It's not easy hearing good performers delivering awful lines.4/10",4,0,3,2 December 2016
Man on Fire," It's a thrill to see Washington go on a rampage
","'Man on Fire' is one hell of a revenge movie, but the movie's brilliance lies in its well-drawn relationship between Denzel Washington's lone wolf and Dakota Fanning's cub. Their chemistry gives this movie its heart and soul way before any retributive blood is spilled. Washington ably slips into the role of drunk ex-CIA lost cause, and Fanning is just about the cutest damn thing in movies. And because of this, her kidnapping is genuinely harrowing . . . and his quest for payback is just brutal enough to make you cheer the man on. Tony Scott's frenetic editing always keeps you on edge, and the emotional depth in Helgeland's script is what really makes that ending a one-two punch. This is a well-written movie, and these two characters will linger in your brain long after it's finished. 7/10",7,1,2,17 May 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Owns the Summer 2014 competition.
","'Edge of Tomorrow' is easily sold as Tom Cruise's sci-fi 'Groundhog Day', which feels kinda cynical, but there's also some 'Aliens' and 'Starship Troopers' thrown in. But in the end, that doesn't really matter, because this movie hits it out of the park. It blazes as an action movie, and the sci-fi hook is a nice touch. Cruise can laugh at himself getting killed every few minutes, which adds to the guy's likability. And he's great in the action role. Same for Blunt, who's just one gorgeous militaristic badass. And there's just enough emotional substance to make for a happy ending to this thing. It's exhilarating, funny, sometimes even heartfelt. It's a well-done movie, all around.8/10",8,3,6,30 January 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," Off-pitch
","Threee years may have passed, but 'Pitch Perfect 2' feels more like a TV episode than a full-fledged movie. Which may or may not be a good thing, depending on what you're looking for, but as a sequel, it's a mixed bag. The Bellas' story was all over the place, and despite a varied singing group, all of their appeal lies in Rebel Wilson. I mean, yeah,you could say she's all fart jokes, but her 'I'm so fly' persona is put to good use.The real reason to watch this is the lineup of side players (John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks, David Cross, Snoop Dogg). The focused humor and killer lines belong to these actors; chief among them Keegan-Michael Key, who flat-out owns this movie as a self-absorbed record producer. That guy is hilarious.6/10",6,0,0,31 May 2016
Whiplash," Clawing to the top with blood-stained drumsticks
","Tape your fingers now or else those nails will be bitten down to nubs when this is over. Equally unbearable and exhilarating, Whiplash turns the teacher-student relationship right on its head; far more Full Metal Jacket than anything inspirational. To that end, this is the best I've ever seen from J.K. Simmons, spewing venom as Miles Teller strains under his withering abuse. This is psychological thriller against the backdrop of jazz (a sentence I never thought I'd see myself typing), and Simmons is the emotional terrorist you just do not see coming. That goes for the whole movie, one that I've never seen anything like. There's a wealth to appreciate here, from the masterful editing and direction to the music, and the hype is absolutely warranted.And is it just me, or does 'Not my tempo' belong up there with 'Is it safe' as far as chilling lines go?",9,1,1,30 April 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," A punishing marathon of excess
","Biographical or not, this never tried to avoid comparisons to 'Wall Street' (simply cranked to eleven). Throw in some 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', add a dash of DiCaprio's charm and that's 'The Wolf of Wall Street' in a nutshell. I guess I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie - I mean it's Scorsese in the director's chair - but for all of the energy put into scenes of unrepentant debauchery, the movie only really feels alive during a late-hour FBI raid set to a 'Mrs. Robinson' cover. And that moment happens all too close to the three-hour mark. I can't imagine sitting through this again.",5,4,5,13 June 2018
Army of Darkness," Bruce Campbell's defining movie
","It's not everyday you get a third movie that measures up, but 'Army of Darkness' does just that. And this time Ash is banished to medieval times to face off against his evil doppelgänger, and . . . a legion of stop-motion skeletons. Which should give you a pretty good idea the sort of comic absurdity that is this movie; one that wears its B-movie leanings on its sleeve. Also, it's hilarious. But really, it's the movie I think of when I think Bruce Campbell. The chainsaw hand, the boomstick, the gags. This is Bruce's finely-tuned b-movie persona. His talents are put to extremely likable effect as the lunkhead braggart. And all of his iconic lines are here: 'This . . . is my BOOMSTICK!'; 'Give me some sugar, baby'; 'Well, if it isn't Mr. Fancy Pants . . . '; 'Klaatu, Barada . . . Necktie!'; 'Whatsa matter, you raised in a barn? Shut the door.'; 'Groovy'It's just such a memorable presence. Hail to the king, indeed.8/10",8,3,4,13 October 2011
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Ah, the '90s: when Die Hard was still good
","Finding enjoyment in 'With a Vengeance' means accepting that it's a Die Hard movie cobbled together from other script material, and it has to outdo the last movie. Also, that it's another Gruber and another heist angle. But it does spice things up with a buddy for McClane - and while the franchise wasn't screaming for a sidekick, there's a lot of charm in the Bruce Willis/Samuel L. Jackson relationship; they've got terrific chemistry, and hell if Jackson doesn't steal the movie.At a time when everyone was aping the DH formula, this movie actually feels like it was doing something different. It doesn't always work (the ending especially), but as an action movie, this baby's got some kick.7/10",7,0,1,6 November 2013
Con Air," Immensely entertaining
","'Con Air' is like a nice souvenir from that late-'90s sweet spot when Nicolas Cage action movies were good. For my money, this is his 'road House'; the hair, the accent, the roundhouses. It's impossible to take him seriously (and yet he's the sterling hero of the movie) and that applies to the rest of the movie as a whole. One wrong move, and this could be insultingly stupid, But that move never comes, and the absurdity is somehow very appealing. This is a great cast, spouting macho dialogue to a screaming guitar score; violence and explosions all over the place while Cage's cartoon character stares down every last convict. And the one-liners just come one right after another. Bruckheimer's not usually my cup of tea, but I had a lot of fun with this.8/10",8,1,2,4 August 2016
Jaws," Great White Hype
","Not everything in a movie withstands the test of time. In the case of 'Jaws', it's the makeup effects (did the body parts ever look realistic?). Which this movie easily transcends because of the brilliant mystique of the shark. It takes forever to finally see it while everyone in the story is constantly reacting to it. That constant suggestion of the monster is the movie's greatest weapon. Well, that and the iconic score (Williams and Spielberg: a partnership for the ages) and the memorable characters. It's a masterpiece of suspense.8/10",8,0,1,24 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It all hinges on this one, and Lucas blew it
","When people talk about prequel disappointment, they're usually talking about 'The Phantom Menace'. And it was a shaky start, to be sure. Still, there was always promise that the next movie would be better and finally hit the groove again (even after 'Attack of the Clones'). But 'Revenge of the Sith' crushes that promise and buries it six feet under. This movie was beyond disappointing; it was a total waste.It suffers from the same awful dialog that's plagued both its predecessors (Ewan McGregor still has that knack for rising above it, for the most part) and there are more awkward CGI effects - but by now, that's expected. No big surprise. What was odd this time around was some really strange swordfighting choreography, with lightsaber experts leaving themselves open to attack and fancying some weird twirling like an airplane propeller. It's very strange. And that duel between Kenobi and Skywalker felt like some sort of weird dance routine. But the 'Matrix' sequels were like that, so it's no big surprise.It's character motivation that really ruins the whole thing. Take Padmé, for instance. There she is, on the birthing table, and she's dying. Is it because her husband tried to kill her? No, it's because she's 'lost the will to live'. What kind of contrived nonsense is that? In both prior episodes, this is a chick who takes up arms and fights. She's no damsel in distress. And now she's giving birth to two children, and just gives up? No way. She's a fighter, she's not going to just give up. And do you know how unyielding the Mama Bear instinct is? It's an unbelievable cop-out what happens to her in the final moments.But more than just Padmé, this is supposed to be the big payoff; we're all finally getting to see what sends Anakin Skywalker over the edge and Darth Vader rising from the abyss. But Lucas has spent so much time on other things that, even 20 minutes into the final movie, Skywalker has to start being evil fast. He wasn't irredeemable in the last movie, but all of a sudden, after one scene with Palpatine, he's . . . a bad guy. But it's not a turn that comes about organically. Every single time someone in this movie (or an event) tells Anakin not to trust Palpatine, he ignores it. He's kind of a moron. Which means that he's marching toward the dark side for no reason. Even after Palpatine reveals he's a bad guy, Anakin just sorta goes with it. Even after Palpatine reveals that the trick to keeping a loved one alive (that he's been stringing Anakin along with) doesn't really exist - but maybe it can if they work together - Anakin shows no signs of reason, logic or being the normally functioning person that he's been for most of his life. So by the end, when he's frothing at the mouth with hatred at everyone who's been talking sense this whole time, He's just some guy that doesn't listen. That's the fall from grace we've been teased about for decades? It doesn't fit. At all. And to top it off, after he tries to choke the snot out of Padmé, he's shocked that she eventually dies? He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. It's such an incompetently handled characterization that you can't help but feel short-changed. Luke Skywalker's going to have to save some guy who's just been an obtuse dick.Sure, Lucas was against the clock with the Skywalker turn, but there had to have been a better way to turn him while making us feel something for the guy. He didn't do it for anyone but himself, and it's a completely wasted opportunity. It's (mostly) the reason I can't stomach this movie, even after ten years. It's not at all well-written or thought out, and does more harm than good in bridging the two trilogies.2/10",2,4,7,18 February 2015
The Lion King," Self-satisfied nonsense
","All credit where it's due, on a technical level, THE LION KING is a very well put-together movie. The colors are vivid, the character's movements are fluid, and it's just a very pretty movie to look at. I give this movie a bad rap all the time, but even I have to admit this. My problem is that it's been unbelievably overblown for twenty years. Disney marketing got it into their heads that this is some sort of high prestige experience; bigger than all their other animated fluff, and warranting of blind praise from everyone. It's impenetrable for me because I haven't been able to listen to the soundtrack for two decades (and the movie's big on its music). 1994 radio was saturated with both the Elton John songs and the Simba numbers, and I haven't been able to hear any of it again since. For a musical, that's kind of a deal- breaker.Story-wise, it definitely works better when you're a kid. The characters aren't obnoxious and Simba's reckoning isn't shallow. But it's just such nauseating material. The whole thing's built on pomp and spectacle, but there's nothing underneath. 3/10",3,3,8,5 September 2014
Inception," Damn clever premise and slickly executed
","I'm not sure why I didn't see INCEPTION when it first came out, or why it's taken almost five years . . . but damn, what a movie. Dreaming itself is a fascinating subject, but to merge this with a heist movie? Win-win in my book. Nolan doesn't hold the audience's hand during the whole thing, which is kinda refreshing, and I didn't expect the emotional undercurrent running throughout. The big action setpieces took serious imagination, not just Paris folding in on itself, but the amazing swirling hallway sequence. Throw in some slick gunplay and this is a great ride.7/10",7,2,3,24 January 2015
The Secret Life of Pets," The story's thin, but the cast is pretty great
","'What do our pets do when the humans are at work all day?' That's a really good hook - something you'd expect from PIXAR, at that - and it has wide-reaching appeal. That there are gags centered on animals other than just cats and dogs means that a lot of this is accessible to just about everyone. And when 'The Secret Life of Pets' is about that premise, it's gold. There's a wealth of stand-up talent in the cast, and the animators find plenty of behavioral humor to mine in the pets (cats, especially). But then the main characters are taken out of their home and onto an epic adventure - and this is where the movie goes straight into 'Flushed Away' area. I was much more interested in the goings-on in the apartments than I was in the sewer.But, aside from that narrative indulgence and some ill-advised song choices (there are much better odes to the Big Apple than 'Welcome to New York'), this is a decent children's movie. It's not as tight as the Despicable Me movies, or even 'Minions', but of all the movies you can be dragged to by a kid ('Smurfs' anyone?), it's a harmless Summer diversion.6/10",6,0,2,25 July 2016
Finding Dory," Nothing soulless about this one
","Because of the studio's recent emphasis on sequels (prequels, what-have-you), I'm in the habit of selling PIXAR movies short. And 'Finding Dory' was no exception; my expectations were admittedly low. But the filmmakers quickly reminded me of why I liked 'Nemo' so much, and I was on board from there.It's a lively adventure movie, briskly paced and boasting worthy additions to the cast. It maintains the gorgeous ocean visuals of the original and there's something genuinely heartfelt about the story. A classic family theme is sufficient, but the real message is extremely touching and appropriately subtle: teaching kids how to live with a disability.There was just no disliking this movie.7/10",7,1,3,7 July 2017
Arrival," This really leaves a lasting impression
","It's your classic tale of alien visitors; where are they from and why are they here? But there's a subtlety to 'Arrival' that makes it stand out, even while it's drawing comparisons to the wonder and mystery of grander films ('Close Encounters', '2001'). The military maintains a sizable presence in the movie, but it never really gets to that hysterical point (sure, the planet's armed forces are ready to go to war, but there's also a surprising level of restraint). And I liked that the real focus was on communication, not just with the aliens, but also between our sovereign nations.There is a surprise at the end (I don't think twist is the right word because that evokes Shyamalan, and this isn't that movie), and to a certain extent, that's really the point of the movie - even though it's handled with depth and sensitivity. But up until that point, this is Amy Adams' show. I've always liked here, but of her performances, this is one of my favorites. I could compare this to 'Gravity' and that'd give a good sense of the maternal subject matter - yet it isn't apt because that's not what happens. It's complicated in the best sense of the word.8/10",8,2,7,12 May 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Reputation notwithstanding, this is powerful stuff
","You could describe 'The Shawshank Redemption' in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.And that cast is impeccable.9/10",9,1,1,14 April 2016
The Cannonball Run," The usual suspects: antics, hijinks, shenanigans
","'The Cannonball Run' . . . well it's got some gifts under the tree, but it really taps right into your base male interests: fast cars and hot ladies.Now that I think about it, if you watch this with beer in hand, you've got the trifecta.Anyhoo, it's a decent road movie, the cars are fun and Burt Reynolds fronts one hell of a cast. The 'stache gets upstaged by two chicks in a Lamborghini (mmm Adrienne Barbeau), but who's going to complain about that? Jack Elam seemed to get all the laughs in this movie, at least from me. I wasn't expecting that.7/10",7,0,1,18 August 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Going to have to let this one roll around in my head for a while
","I'm not really sure what to think of 'Birdman'. I know this was supposed to be a juicy role for Michael Keaton (and it is), but didn't know what to expect beyond that. The cast is remarkable, that's for sure (Keaton owns here), and I do like the jazz drums score. The long takes were interesting and I appreciated the work that goes into them, the high levels of coordination, but the camera just couldn't sit still. I have the same problem with J.J. Abrams, but didn't think that'd happen with 'Birdman' as well. On the plus side, this movie made creative use of the referential humor. Usually, when something is being meta, it's glaringly obvious. But here, it's actually funny.This isn't 'Gone Girl' underwhelming, but perplexed is the best word to describe my reaction.6/10",6,0,2,18 March 2015
Platoon," '... we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves'
","'Platoon' is hardly an obscure movie, and I guess the reason it's taken me so many years to finally see this is - I dunno, you see enough war movies over the years (not to mention having seen 'Full Metal Jacket'), how affecting could this actually be? That's a stupid reason, and the joke's on me; 'Platoon' is devastating. This is probably as anti-war as they come, and that it's partly somewhat autobiographical just gives it more punch.I don't think I've ever seen a movie of this type that really emphasizes the dehumanizing effects of war. Charlie Sheen's fall from wide-eyed grace isn't so much heartbreaking as it is tremendously dispiriting. And putting him between two opposing symbols of embittered soldier (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger) makes for a clever storytelling hook. I really don't want to give away any spoilers, but when one of these lead actors is killed, it is deeply sad.This one absolutely lives up to the hype.9/10",9,5,6,26 August 2016
Scream," Shockingly obnoxious
","I've gotta plead ignorance on 'Scream'; I didn't get it. It started with that Drew Barrymore opening, the stuff of icons; it was after all the centerpiece of the marketing, the movies lasting image, and what all the girls in math class were raving about in '96 (even I remember that). But my god, is it grating.And things never improve from there. The horror clichés are the point, but these characters are just there to rattle off references. With Craven at the helm and a veritable who's who cast, this was no lightweight movie. But even at an age where I get the horror movie callbacks, this did nothing for me.5/10",5,2,4,4 August 2017
Prometheus," Pretty good scifi ruined by identity crisis.
","There was enough grandeur and scope that PROMETHEUS could've easily stood on its own two feet; a visually stunning idea movie with a good cast. It had enough problems with rigorously washing away any enigmatic flourish by answering its own big questions . . . but it also runs itself ragged by serving as an ALIEN prequel. It's got the same story beats, the archetypal crew members, the maybe-sinister android, the strong heroine running around while being terrorized. I could even hear it in the score. And that shot of Shaw blasting off would've made a great capper, but they had to have just one more showing a damn alien being born.5/10",5,0,0,21 January 2015
Halloween," Deserves its place in cinema history
","I've got nothing to prove here; I'm a total puss when it comes to horror movies. I just don't have the stomach for them. 'Halloween' is the rare exception, and it fits naturally with this time of year. This is scary not because it's a guy in a mask with a chef's knife but because he's a stalker; and Carpenter plays that like a master violinist. The climactic scene with Jamie Lee Curtis in the closet is nerve-wracking enough, but the early scenes with Michael Myers following her through the suburban streets just bury the creepy needle. It's the way things are dragged out in this movie - the tracking shots, the breathing sounds under the mask, that damn score - all played to just that right length.This is economical filmmaking, brutally effective and notorious for good reason.8/10",8,0,4,24 November 2009
Wonder Woman," DC finds its footing
","There's a lot that went into 'Wonder Woman'; it's partially a romantic comedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybe above all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.In other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre. I loved this movie.8/10",8,71,160,20 June 2017
Despicable Me," Perched at the top of the heap; this movie hits all the right notes
","The day I showed 'Despicable Me' to my daughter was the day we knew we had a new favorite movie. Now there's Minion paraphernalia all over the house, she's quoting lines left and right and I'm not even sure how many times she and I have watched this movie. But that's just the sort of film this is; the kind that sneaks up behind you, worms its way into your heart, and before you know it, it's all around you. Everything about 'Despicable Me' from the voices (Carell nails it here), the action, cool songs and winning sense of humor (the Looney Tunes-esque violence of the Minions, the satirical jabs at American culture) is just spot-on. But most of all, it's the endearing sentiment at the core of the movie that shines. Just loads of heart. This is an all-around winner, full of heart, talent and sentiment. My whole family loves this movie.9/10... Also, can anyone honestly say they knew that was Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario? Anyone? 'Cause I've never been a Brand fan, and he almost steals all of Nefario's scenes. One of my very favorite voices in an animated movie.",9,1,1,5 October 2013
Back to the Future Part II," Fun with paradoxes!
","Of the series, 'Back to the Future Part II' is certainly the busiest, what with its various timelines, character iterations and manic pace. And I can absolutely understand why that would've been a point of contention back in '89. But to me, that's all apart of the ride. It's almost a caveat to the enjoyment of this movie that there was never supposed to be a sequel. And seeing as Gale and Zemeckis wrote themselves into a corner with the ending of Part I, what they did with this is impressive.I still love the gags during the future sequence and just the way the world is depicted. Also, a flying DeLorean is just ridiculously cool. 'Part II' is a technical marvel; and even with its lack of resolution, this is still a very entertaining movie.9/10",9,1,2,21 October 2015
Raging Bull," It's a long way down . . .
","I guess 'Raging Bull' qualifies as a boxing movie, but not like 'Rocky'. The sport is just a mechanism for Jake LaMotta's snarling and abusive life story; one that begins with talent in the ring and a pretty girl, and ends in ragged solitude. Throw in some brutal fight scenes and a melancholy score and you've got a dark portrait of one mean s.o.b.Again, it's not really a boxing movie, and that's not a criticism. I think the best scenes happen outside of the ring, where Joe Pesci stands as De Niro's equal and the two really electrify the movie. And as wickedly as those title bouts are filmed, the most harrowing scene is just LaMotta in a jail cell. Scorsese just holds that shot interminably, never offering relief with a cut. I just think that's remarkable that, in a movie with so much blood and bone-hitting sound effects, such an unassuming scene packs the biggest punch.7/10",7,2,4,11 March 2017
The Iron Giant," Its heart is giant
","Would it be immature to say that 'the Iron Giant' is Vin Diesel's best movie? Either work? Either way, he did help bring the Giant to life and was integral in the bond between a boy and his robot. The character's got personality and he was key. And not just Diesel, it's pretty much the whole cast. It's got an appealing animation style (fantastic use of CGI) and just the right assortment of memorable characters.The themes here are timeless - fate, freewill, having a soul - and the emotional wallop this movie packs is fearsome (the Giant's final word is guaranteed to bring the eyes to mist, and I mean that). and in the hands of a lesser director, this would come off as calculated schmaltz. But the reality is far from it. This is heartwarming of pharmaceutical grade.One of the best family films I've ever seen.9/10",9,0,1,31 August 2015
Shrek," Some real talent behind the microphone
","'Shrek' has a big heart, and when it's in the right place, the focus is on the characters and the message of acceptance. Mike Myers and (especially) Eddie Murphy leave their marks on a mostly successful spin on fairy tale clichés, and this movie has some serious laughs going for it. Not all of the references work, though (good lord, bullet-time? The Macarena?) and it could've done with a lot less Smash Mouth.But none of these are deal-breaking. This has likability written all over it, to go with the pointed jabs at Disneyland (to go there is to realize how smart this movie is) and going on a quest with an Ogre, a donkey, and their feisty princess is a lot of fun.7/10",7,1,2,14 August 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," God, the suspense!
","'The Silence of the Lambs' took me by complete surprise, and that's meant in the best way possible. When the movie began, I wasn't expecting such a varied bag of tricks, but there was always some new surprise just around the corner. A genuine nail-biter, no question. And few movies can jack up the levels of dread and creepiness like this one; stalking camera movements, interrogations in uncomfortable close-ups, and that's not even touching the crazy messed-up stuff going on with Buffalo Bill (I almost can't believe that guy was on 'Monk'). And Lecter's escape was one of the most deeply unnerving things I've ever seen. I really liked Jodie Foster's character; Clarice Starling is in a league with Marge Gunderson ('Fargo') - a rookie rather than a veteran, but no less self-reliant in a man's world. Doe eyes masking steely resolve. It's a great performance.This is shocking stuff, and a movie that burrows itself deep within your brain. Tough to shake . . . but you don't really want to, either.8/10",8,0,1,8 August 2015
X-Men: First Class," Sadly disappointing
","Yet another origin reboot. 'X-Men: First Class' isn't without its pluses; McAvoy and Fassbender own this movie (on the other end of that spectrum is Kevin Bacon and ehhh January Jones), not to mention Hugh Jackman in possibly the greatest cameo ever. And it was nice to see a story where Charles and Erik work together for a change. But aside from that, this is some weak sauce. the story, the roster of X-Men, the effects. It makes for a bland reboot and has nothing on the Singer movies. None of the heart, in spite of its invention.But Fassbender is a hell of a Magneto.5/10",5,1,3,18 May 2015
The Wolverine," Finally, a decent Wolverine flick!
","One of the opening scenes in THE WOLVERINE probably does the best job of showcasing the title character that we've seen thus far on-screen. He stumbles upon a dying bear, tracks the killers to a nearby dive bar, and strolls in with malicious intent. Even though he doesn't end up killing anyone, it's a fist-pump of a scene to see the man in his element, doing what he does best.As superhero movies go, this one feels like a breath of fresh air; a personal story that brings Logan face-to-face in Japan with his past and getting mixed up with the yakuza. It's a slow burn but certainly not boring. Hugh Jackman slips back into the role with ease, carrying the character's baggage with sardonic wit. The fight scenes are lightning fast and hit hard, especially the zonked-out boss battle. And the story leaves Logan in an interesting place, character-wise. This totally makes up for X-MEN ORIGINS.7/10",7,0,1,15 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Ambitious, a little shaky, but makes for a good capper.
","There's a lot riding on this movie after 'The Dark Knight', but 'The Dark Knight Rises' does a pretty good job delivering on the third installment promise. And just like before, it's populated by great actors (adding in Cotillard, Hardy and Gordon Levitt). It's befitting of the Nolan brand. The big grinding plot machine is a little top-heavy, but it picks up the threads from both prior movies and sews them into something of a finish. Indeed, everything's all wrapped up with a tidy bow. Except for that line about the auto-pilot. That was flinch that smacked of having the ending both ways.An even though I'm still not sure on Darth Va- I mean Bane's voice (yeesh, he was unintelligible in the theater), give Tom Hardy credit for doing something different with the character. Bale's still rocking that awful Batvoice (I guess it's too late in the game to change it now); Bane and Bats make quite a pair in this movie.The movie's best feature (for me) is Catwoman. Hathaway's gorgeous, sassy, makes for a fine cat burglar, and even though I'm never hot on multiple bad guys in a Batman movie, she fits well enough into the narrative. That was always Nolan's gift with these movies: his handling of the rogues gallery. It's not that there are too many bad guys, it's that they mesh as pawns of one another. They still show up, but aren't crowding room.7/10",7,0,0,24 March 2015
Iron Man," Forged in greatness
","You can't really rewatch any of the Marvel movies without seeing them in the context of the larger cinematic grand scheme. Upgrades, expansions and awkward missteps are constantly in the back of your min while you're watching any one film. So how does 'Iron Man' stack up after eight years of universe-building? Pretty damn well, actually.It's a terrific blend of origin and redemption stories, resting on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr. (ideal casting), but there's also a great feeling of invention to the movie; whether Tony Stark's in a cave or in a lab, it's fun to watch him work. And the armor's got a great robotic look to it. It'll be tweaked along the way - but even here, it looks cool.It's not without weaknesses - Don Cheadle turned out to be a welcome replacement for Terrence Howard - but on the other hand, the sequel antagonists also haven't compared to Jeff Bridges. It's also not a glorified commercial for the next entry (surprisingly refreshing). This is my favorite Marvel movie for good reason. It looks great, the character arc is solid and it's a testament to how well a foundation can be laid.8/10",8,0,1,5 July 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It could've (should've) been so much better
","Two good things came of 'Batman v Superman': Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot. My hopes have been high for a new Batman for over a year and the same can be said for Wonder Woman. That these characters get spin off movies mean this movie is already a success in one department.As for the movie itself, it's a mess; primarily because of the writing. There is so much jam-packed into this that the actual fight is almost a footnote to everything that has to happen here. And a lot of it doesn't make sense. How does Lex know who Martha Kent is? And Clark can find Lois in Africa in seconds but he can't find his kidnapped Ma? And as much as I liked Ben Affleck in the role, both Batman and Superman come off as dicks in this movie. Their motivations just don't hold water. That's the biggest problem my wife had with this: they weren't staying true to any of the characters.I can't tell you how disappointed I was when the movie brought in Doomsday and went full-on Death of Superman. Even during the second half, when it was all one big battle, it didn't shoehorn awful comics story lines.It's really not a bad movie, but is indicative of bad decisions across the board by WB and Snyder. No Superman movie should be this sullen.5/10",5,1,4,21 August 2016
Tombstone," If ever a western could qualify as a chick flick, it's this.
","I'm not sure whether it's in spite of, or because of the movie's lack of subtlety, but hell if 'Tombstone' isn't an entertaining ride. All the the usual (dependable) are her: revenge thirsts, gang wars, gun fights, showdowns and memorable characters - mostly because the actors take their parts and run with them. Such scenery-chewing is endearing. There's more than enough rugged to go around, yet there's such a strong romantic undercurrent that really flavors the whole thing. It's amazing just how Dana Delany impacts the movie even when she's not on screen. But it's a western first and foremost, and not a bad one, at that. You tend to wonder how historically accurate all of this is, (with Doc Holliday especially), but that's nitpicking with a movie this good.7/10",7,0,1,1 September 2011
The Emperor's New Groove," Fun movie; really sneaks up on you
","What's really surprising about 'The Emperor's New Groove' is how likable David Spade is. One wrong move and that voice can be abusive to the ear holes. But he works here, and fits in wit some good performances that elevate this movie above its mid-tier Disney material (Eartha Kitt's a good villain, and John Goodman provides all the movie's heart). I dig this flick's sense of humor, and the animation is top-notch (you don't see Incan architecture every day, and the animators do it justice).But it's Patrick Warburton who handily walks away with the entire thing, and it's one of my favorite Warburton performances (outside of 'The Tick'). He's got all the best lines and he's endearing as all hell, making Kronk one of the best Disney characters.7/10",7,0,1,7 June 2014
Blade Runner," Ridley Scott's timeless masterpiece
","Audiences in 1982 did not respond kindly to 'Blade Runner'. Too downbeat, too slow-moving, and not the same kind of Harrison Ford performance we all fell in love with in 'Star Wars' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Truth be told, I hated this movie, the first time I saw it. It took two and three further viewings to really appreciate what was going on here, and the movie soon became one of my all-time favorites, as a result. Director Ridley Scott plunges his audience into a nightmarish vision of the not-too-distant future Los Angeles, complete with flying cars and industrialism run-amok. Other planets have been colonized for the elites, while the rest of humanity is left on Earth. The monolithic Tyrell Corporation manufactures Replicants (artificial humans that are near-indistinguishable from the real thing) , the latest version being the Nexus-6, for use on off-world jobs that are either too dangerous or unseemly for a real human. Four-year lifespans are implemented to keep the Replicants in line, and Blade Runner units (special police forces) patrol the streets to root out any infiltrating renegades. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner who's pressed into service when four Replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy and Brion James) hijack a shuttle and hide out on Earth. Their pursuit is to gain an audience with their maker, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Turkel, meanwhile, has introduced a new version of the Nexus-6 in the form of Rachael, his administrative assistant (Sean Young). And Deckard finds his mission clouded as he slowly falls in love with the beautiful woman.From an acting standpoint, Ford, Young and Hauer are the standouts. Ford delivers a low-key performance, brandishing his devil-may-care grin only sparingly. His portrayal of Deckard suggests a man who's trying to put all of the pieces together and make sense of it all; constantly uncertain. It's an ambiguous character (the good guy, but not so likable), and Ford truly sells it. Young really shines here, 'humanizing' Rachael as the character faces its existential crisis. She's terrified and unstable when placed in a romantic situation and her heartbreak seems completely genuine after hearing Deckard callously drop the bombshell that she's not real. And Hauer, as the cerebral and most dangerous of the Replicants, plays up the childlike wonder of an emotionally stunted humanoid, while always keeping that lethal edge lurking underneath the surface. As good as the film's star is, Hauer absolutely steals the movie with his minute-long soliloquy at film's end. Chief among the film's critical praises is its depiction of the dystopian 2019 Los Angeles; a city choking on its own technology and overpopulation. The streets swarm with all manner of ethnic varieties, all of them societal dregs (while the ones with money vacated long ago). Massive blimps float overhead touting the promise of a new life on the off-world colonies. Rain is constant, the skies are black, and foreign peoples violently mix into a salad bowl of clashing cultures, dominated by that of the Japanese (possibly the result of the early '80s concerns of Japanese takeover of L.A.). Advertizing reigns supreme, from blimps to billboards taking up the sides of skyscrapers. It's a triumph of art direction, production design and cinematography. Scott has created a world that lives by its design; both repulsive and engrossing, at the same time. The streets are lit mostly by commercial neon, while interiors are lit by shafts, rays and baths of light (thanks to the brilliance of cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth). You can almost feel the steam rising from the streets and smell the grime on the payphones. No one in their right mind would want to live here, but it's the kind of place that's brimming with detail that leaves its mark; you're drawn to this vision, time and again. And let's not forget Vangelis' synth-noir music, which is less a score and more a mood exercise that wholly blends with the fabric of the overall movie's design. Total immersion, that score.'Blade Runner' polarized audiences when it was first released, mostly due to its 'leisurely' (as Gene Siskel famously put it) pacing and murky narrative. Style over substance. And I thought the same thing, at first, but further viewings proved me wrong. There's a lot going on here under the surface, the visuals just impress and constantly bring you back for another go-around. Ultimately, 'Blade Runner' is a movie about ideas, from slavery to mild paranoia, and (chiefly) what it means to be human. It's a movie that I've seen countless times, and I'm still ready to watch it again. If it's not the vast array of textural surfaces and thematic layering, it's the performances from Ford and Hauer that prove engaging (again and again). It's less a design aesthetic, more a totally immersive world that I totally enjoy returning to. It's nothing short of impressive that the same praise bolstering 'Avatar' is even truer of a 30 year-old film lacking any CGI. 10/10",10,1,4,28 August 2012
Monsters University," Doesn't hold a candle
","'Monsters University' has my vote for the most unnecessary prequel, story-wise at the very least. If Mike Wazowski is working at Monsters Inc. in the original movie, then this movie's ending is a foregone conclusion; he'll either triumph over adversity or find a loophole. It's got a pretty good cast, but Charlie Day steals the movie easily (and it's not the first time). But it lacks the heart and soul of the original. Even Ratzenberger feels shoehorned in, and he's the studio's quirky Easter egg. It's not a weak effort because a lot of work went into this. But the story's deeply lacking.5/10",5,4,6,14 February 2015
Casino Royale," Bond as character study
","Part of me feels kinda bad that my favorite OO7 movie isn't a Connery . . . but to hell with it, 'Casino Royale' is that good. This movie's a textbook definition of how to reboot a huge franchise and do it right. Just pare it all back to the basics: no gadgets, an unpolished OO agent, tie it into topical terrorism, adapt the very first novel, and find the perfect guy for the job. I love that Craig is so close to how Bond was in the book - which should never be a sacred goal in an adaptation such as this, but it's nice that it happened. He's sharp, upper-crust, yet bears the steely gaze of a killer. There's a lethal edge to this guy that makes this movie work so bloody well.And it's a thoroughly entertaining movie, outside of the Bond aspects. The fight scenes are beyond brutal, they're downright nasty. And the action - be it free-running through a construction site or fighting off bad guys in a collapsing building - is propulsive enough to make you forget sheer size of this movie. In lesser hands, this story would be top-heavy, but they pull it off; and make it look easy. Not only that, but there's even time (in a go-for-broke action movie) to weave in a bit of a love story.It's just so damn absorbing.10/10",10,0,6,8 April 2015
Bull Durham," Offbeat love triangle with solid cast
","For a baseball movie, this was a bit of a curveball, but I liked 'Bull Durham' for a number of reasons. One of them being its treatment of baseball as a daily grind; that these are just shlubs in the stadium workplace. Another is the writing; this is some great dialogue and a few of those lines just seem to come out of nowhere. It works pretty well as a romantic comedy, but even better as a clash of wills between two competing players - which takes a somber note as Kevin Costner dishes out wisdom only to find himself spit out the bottom of a middling career in baseball. that aspect drew me in more than I 'd expected. And I must surely not forget to mention the film's most winning feature: the utterly magnetic Susan Sarandon. The movie just charges right up when she's around.7/10",7,0,0,26 April 2017
Identity," A few too many face palms
","Looking back on this ('Identity' is a movie that requires the dust to settle, first), I can respect the goal of this movie to move from whodunnit to mindscrew psycho thriller. And back when it first came out, I was a lot more engaged by the big reveal at the end than I am today. For a while, I wasn't sure if the problem was a bad script or just that it doesn't hold up on rewatch. It's the script.It's got good ideas, they're just poorly executed. People die off in the most contrived ways (you know how it is: you may not have seen a death coming, but you feel cheated after it happens). And that big ending twist only really works if you're just passively watching. Any scrutiny is bound to leave you frustrated. This certainly isn't my favorite John Cusack movie, although he does carry it.5/10",5,1,4,14 July 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," History swirled and remixed into colorful cotton candy
","The original 'Mary Poppins' was steeped in warm-n-fuzzy, so it makes sense they'd go with the same approach for the making-of story. And that tended to dictate what goes on in 'Saving Mr. Banks', at least to me. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is revisionism (hell, maybe it is), but I didn't make it to the end credits feeling like this is actually what happened (didn't Travers hate 'Mary Poppins').But it's a good story, and enough to sweep you along (flashback overuse aside). The best thing here is the cast, each one fitting in very well (with Hanks and Thompson the clear standouts).But somehow, still sappier than even 'Poppins'.6/10",6,0,0,18 May 2015
Speed," Cinematic adrenaline
","'Speed' has the distinction of being the one movie that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theater. And that speaks volumes when it seems like every action movie promises just that; but I actually had to scoot back at one point. On that basis alone, I hold a soft spot for this movie. I've seen it so many times over the years, and it's still a nail-biter. The camera work, the pacing, it's just an amusement park ride when you get right down to it.On a different note, it's also one of my favorite Keanu Reeves movies. The role just seems to suit him. Jack Traven's just the right mix of hero cowboy that we can root for even when he's throwing himself into another disaster. Dennis Hopper's entertaining enough, but I've always been partial to Reeves here (which I can't claim very often).It's no genius, but just smart enough and still manages to get the pulse pounding. I love this movie.9/10",9,2,4,20 November 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Goes through the motions, and after awhile it feels kinda dumb
","Usually, when you hear mention of 'Live Free or Die Hard', it's qualified with 'not a good Die Hard flick, but a great action movie'.Ehhhhh.If what you're looking for in an action movie is something that's always trying to outdo itself with bigger set pieces and unfurls with the nauseous direction of Len Wiseman, then . . . maybe you can call this great. But it's not very smart, and even less fun. And as a Die Hard movie, here's the problem: there's nothing personal in it for McClane; no wife in peril, no brother of the bad guy he killed who's forcing McClane to stampede across New York City. He's just there. He's cardboard hero guy, being billed as a superhero without a cape. and when you've got him falling out of buildings, hurling cars into helicopters and battling fighter planes, it's the Indestructible Bruce Willis Show.Credit where it's due, it is bookended by Mary Elizabeth Winstead scenes, which is enough to keep you seated from one set of credits to the next. But the stuff in the middle isn't very good.4/10",4,3,6,22 June 2012
X2: X-Men United," A sure-footed sequel
","Now here's a prime example of a sequel that builds on and surpasses the original. Freed from the constraints of telling an origin story (and infused with a bigger budget), 'X-Men United' gets down to the business of throwing more characters at us, widening the scope and delivering great comic book movie spectacle - all while deepening the gay rights symbolism (you can widen this to civil rights in general if you so choose, but it's pretty on-the-nose here). Ian McKellen owns, once again, but Brian Cox is a great addition, as well as Alan Cumming (he made a great Nightcrawler).Even if this movie was lacking, you still have to admit that that opening - Nightcrawler's balletic attack on the White House - was pretty damn cool. Fortunately, this movie surges right along and lets the property live and breathe. In retrospect, the one downside is that Singer wasn't around for the third movie. I really do like this world he's created.8/10",8,0,0,24 April 2015
Lucy," Bourne + The Matrix + a healthy dose of likable insanity
","'Lucy' is nothing at all like I'd expected - that is, your usual Luc Besson schlock. But he is seriously tripping balls with this one. All because of a drug o.d., Scarlett Johansson begins to open her mind far beyond our known capacity; which means she's just full-on superhero. And the first half of this is a tightly-paced bundle of energy. IT is pure comic book and a lot of fun. I'm actually surprised it isn't Japanese ('Ghost in the Shell' and 'Akira' jump to mind).The second half is where it loses step, explaining the nutballs plot and trying to make a statement on man's power list. Scarlett manipulates space and time like Neo and it loses its winning personality. For me, this movie boils right down to its lead. She is perfect; and I wonder how good this would've turned out with a lesser actor. Casting makes up for an awful lot in the writing department here.7/10",7,2,4,26 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Buried underneath the melodramatic fan reactions, there's a good movie here
","My Disney cynicism runs pretty deep - but not unfounded, what with the Mouse's recent announcements of killing Slave Leia merch and banning blasters from their theme parks (hello? It's Star Wars!) - so you can imagine my level of anticipation for 'The Force Awakens' wasn't all that great.Still, certain promises were made in the trailers, and all I really wanted to see was the Millennium Falcon fly again And it does, beautifully. Also, there was a flamethrower Stormtrooper. Talk about hitting the right buttons.I can't adequately describe my schoolboy glee when Han and Chewie walked in. Harrison Ford is beyond terrific in this movie and he made me want to see the rest of the band back together.I have a theory that a lot of this movie's appeal (magic, if you will) lies in wanting to see those long-dormant characters. Just their various reveals is enough substance of that. It's very in-the-moment, emotionally rekindling. And who knows how well the this will hold up down the line on rewatch? But as a movie, it's pretty cool. All of the fun aspects of Star Wars are here. Is it fan service? Yeah. A remixing of 'Star Wars' (1977)? Absolutely.But I had a good time.7/10 Revised 7/1/16:Sadly, that appeal wears off a bit and the holes tend to be more glaring on the small screen. It's not all that fun as a rehash of 'Star Wars', and killing off Han Solo just to give the emo villain some depth is infuriating. Aside from Rey, the new characters are bland, and it functions like most of Abrams' films: frenetic, but empty.It's not a bad movie, at all, but they were clearly going for fan concession. And that just doesn't hold up after the first buzz. I know it's the first movie in a trilogy, and we have to see where this is going . . . but how many times have we been asked to do that in the past 15 years? This should function on its own.6/10",6,12,34,30 December 2015
RED," Could've been so much better
","As Morgan Freeman puts it, 'We're getting the band back together. That's nice'and it's when the cast is having fun with the material that 'RED' is decent. And a solid cast it is, but the lead was entirely miscast. Bruce Willis applies his halfhearted smirk and lets everyone else do the heavy lifting. And so much of this focuses on his character, so he just sucks the energy right out of it.I didn't like watching this very much because the tone was all over the place. When the (better) costars were on the screen, there was glee, there was energy; and they're doing their best with lackluster characters. If Willis would just get out of the way and let Malkovich, Freeman and Mirren work, this would be great.5/10 Speaking of Helen Mirren, she's the shining star of this movie. She just lights up the screen like the guns she wields (which are huge). And that is something to see.",5,0,0,11 May 2017
Rear Window," A voyeuristic classic
","I was fairly young when I first watched 'Rear Window'; early enough that the sheer radiance of Grace Kelly was my primary takeaway.But as an adult, it's easy to see why this movie is taught in film school; the gliding camerawork, the lighting, the mise en scène. Hitchcock's use of framing is nothing short of brilliant, and draws you into the story from the very beginning (such a seduction is key to the fun of all of this).One thing that really stood out to me was the ability to create the vibe of that sweltering Summer day, given that this was shot on a soundstage. And speaking of, that set is amazing. It'd have to be, given how long the camera lingers, but still, impressive production design nonetheless.There was much more to appreciate this time around. It's tense, engrossing and technically masterful. And Grace Kelly still lights up the screen.",8,0,1,22 August 2018
Pitch Perfect," Standard chick-flick material
","I would've enjoyed PITCH PERFECT a lot more were I into acapella, so for most of the movie's runtime, it was fundamentally not my thing. But the similarities to GLEE (and I'm obviously not the first to draw this comparison) are unavoidable: the backstage drama, the love story, the staging of the big stage numbers and the song selection. It'd be GLEE writ large if the tone were a little more fantastical. Still, it's hard not to appreciate the ablities that went into this movie, and it's evident that everyone here is doing their own singing. You've gotta respect the talent here. It did need more Rebel Wilson. And Elizabeth Banks. They're the comedic core of the movie. But this was definitely geared toward the GLEE crowd, which doesn't include me. 6/10",6,0,1,29 June 2014
The Truman Show," Brilliant
","'The Truman Show' is a marvel of engineering. Great cast, high concept, but it's the overall illusion that's really impressive; that it somehow all works. If you really wanted to poke holes in this movie, you could (the enormous resources required to maintain that dome, the ungodly costs, and that doesn't even touch the subject of prostituting Meryl). But the script is adept at addressing such concerns, or at least sweeping them under the rug. You find yourself absorbed in Truman's inner struggle, and his blossoming sense of adventure. This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey performance; he's ideal. Ed Harris, too (geez, what can't that guy do?). The movie's premise of reality TV isn't new (and I'm not sure it was even back in '98), but it's honestly an imaginative take on the whole concept and maintains a surprising level of depth.The truth is, there aren't all that many '90s movies that hold up on rewatch, but this one absolutely does.9/10",9,0,0,23 February 2016
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Most righteous
","'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' is about as goofy as it gets, but that's totally its charm. And I can't really think of anything that's not likable about this movie; the historical figures at the mall, Napoleon and the waterslides, Bill's stepmom... It's got a surprisingly catchy soundtrack, some great one-liners and a winning sense of humor. The two leads are perfect choices for the eponymous dimwits (can there be a role more suited to Reeves' 'Whoa' persona?). It all just works here, even if the time travel logic is threadbare. This is just good cheesy '80s fun. But most of all, I just love that George Carlin's in this. On paper, he seems unlikely, but fits like a glove.8/10",8,0,0,1 January 2015
The Matrix," Made its mark with a Superman punch; outstanding movie
","I always try not to let bad sequels taint the otherwise remarkable original film, but this tends to happen with 'The Matrix'; I forget just how good this movie really is. What's really surprising is just how well this still holds up, fifteen years after the fact. It was easily the greatest movie of 1999, and a high point of the decade. It's not just an action movie with sweet kung fu and leather-clad gunfights, but also one hell of a sci-fi trip; an honest-to-god journey through the rabbit hole, seductive in its intriguing mystery and still riveting after many viewings. The Wachowskis showed an incredible eye for framing, shot composition and camera moves; this thing reeks of style.It's a classic any way you slice it, and a laundry list of memorable scenes (the opening rooftop chase, Neo's unplugging, the SWAT ambush in the apartment building, the lobby shootout, the helicopter crash, the subway fight and subsequent chase). The agents still make for striking imagery with their comically oversized Desert Eagles (I love Weaving's intonation and line delivery).And while it's probably the most cartoonishly parodied movie of the last half-century, those bullet-time effects and killer fight scenes haven't lost their luster. 8/10",8,1,2,7 May 2014
Looper," A clever time-travel movie. Its kinda rare.
","A modern Bruce Willis performance I actually liked. Imagine that. LOOPER's got a sweet time-travel hook, but it's the unwavering love angle the really deepens things. I can honestly say I had no idea where things were going with this movie, and I like the ultimate direction it took. I can see why people are impressed by Rian Johnson; the man's got vision and the makings of a great filmmaker. A little too much lens flare, although not to J.J. Abrams levels of excess. Nice eye candy here too, with the pretty ladies; the foxy Piper Perabo and ball-busting hayseed Emily Blunt. And even though the eyebrows are ridiculous, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job of mimicking Willis' mannerisms. Not to mention anchoring the whole movie.7/10",7,1,3,27 December 2014
Casino," Bloated, but there's some good mob stuff here
","It's not 'Goodfellas', but there are stretches when 'Casino' is pretty great. That back-and-forth narration between De Niro and Pesci is a brilliant narrative trick and plays like a guided tour through this lavish empire the mob has carved out in Las Vegas (this, in spite of the town's gaudy trappings). Seductive, to say the least.It's in the second half that the narration vanishes and the movie starts to overstay its welcome. This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence). It's mostly when the '70s give way to the '80s and Sharon Stone's drama takes center stage that things become sour. 'Boogie Nights' sprang to mind around this time, although that was a much more satisfying story.6/10",6,1,2,28 April 2015
Heat," One hell of a cop movie
","What makes 'Heat' one of my all-time favorite movies is that the characters are so well-developed. And not just Pacino and De Niro, but also the supporting players. (Almost) everyone here has a backstory, something to make you really care about them. This works like gangbusters for those that don't make it, but equally so for those that do.And one of the characters in the movie is the city of Los Angeles. It's such an urban sprawl that it can stand in for pretty much anywhere (and in some ways, it has). But Mann takes us from the upper-crust designer houses to the workaday neighborhoods and really gives this place some personality. Not always a pleasant one, and that's what's great about it.This is the movie that screams Michael Mann to me: the expert weapons-handling, a spectacular bank shootout, clearly defined characters on opposite sides of the law, an engrossing story. It's a movie that puts every minute of it's almost-3-hour runtime to great use, and one that leaves you (me, at least) floored when the end credits roll.10/10",10,0,2,25 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Pure uncut escapism
","In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching 'Star Wars' on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10",9,4,6,25 May 2015
Deadpool," Makes a great case for R-rated comic book movies
","Admittedly, I walked into 'Deadpool' hoping for little more than just a decent treatment of the character. He's not complicated; he's got Spidey's witty banter (jacked up with vulgarity), Wolverine's healing factor, two guns and a pair of swords. Not complicated. He looks like what you'd find in the margins of some twelve year-old's notebook.And they finally did it. Ryan Reynolds works well as the Merc with a Mouth, fluent in his own language of potty words. What's refreshing about this movie is that it's a love story disguised as a very naughty action movie. The fight scenes (slo-mo notwithstanding) are pretty cool, the sex scenes are funny, and it's somehow a breath of fresh air for those suffering from genre fatigue.7/10",7,7,21,12 March 2016
Tarzan," The last gasps of the Disney Renaissance
","Gorgeous animation aside, there's no a whole lot that's memorable about 'Tarzan'. Even the baffling Phil Collins soundtrack is as vanilla as it gets (seriously, the guy owned in the '80s, but by the '90s . . . WTH?). The cast runs from great (Glenn Close) to extremely iffy (Rosie O'Donnell), but even by Disney standards, this isn't the strongest story they've rearranged. Don't get me wrong, I know I'm not the audience for this movie - I'm way too old. My daughter got a lot more out of it than I did. It's great for kids; there's color, movement, etc.It's really not a bad movie, but it's never really satisfying.5/10",5,1,4,19 September 2016
Apollo 13," 'With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.'
","I was a teenager when 'Apollo 13' was released and had never known of this story. Neil Armstrong, The Challenger, sure, but not this particular doomed mission. But Hollywood's version of the events is probably the most American movie I've ever seen - not just those willing to hurl themselves out into the black, but those on the ground forced to bring them home (that's right, it's an engineering movie; the nerds are behind the wheel).And as a movie, it's a pretty great ride, going from adventurous space travel to unity in the face of disaster. Ron Howard knows how to maximize emotional impact, and it comes when you least expect it. There's genuine melancholy when the astronauts are denied their landing on the moon - and as dangerous as their predicament is, the real drama happens in the control room. That's saying something with a big effects movie like this. And as much as I like Tom Hanks (and this is a fine cast, right down the line), this really belongs to Gary Sinise and Ed Harris in supporting roles. And Harris has one of my very favorite lines in cinema: 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option.' I dunno how accurate it is, but this film - on its own terms - is a tribute to American know-how. I know how clichéd that sounds, but . . . that about sums it up.9/10",9,2,3,8 September 2016
Fast Five," I haven't stuck with these movies because the first was about as mediocre as it gets.
","The L.A. mod/racing scene's not my bag, and it was mostly forced drama. But they seem to have reinvented this franchise as a heist/'Expendables' thing (and I'm a sucker for a good heist flick). They also brought in Dwayne Johnson. Here, take my money. But 'Fast Five' is a grander/more expensive version of the first movie; forced drama and unrelatable characters. And this is a cast that's surprisingly low on charm. So the casting of both Johnson and Joaquim de Almeida is indeed a charismatic highlight. All in all, this makes for a pretty good mindless entertainment. The action's frenetic, the setpieces absurd. Speedy cars, 'splosions and whatnot. I've got no problem with this movie - I'm just not apart of that target audience. 5/10",5,0,1,31 January 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Chapter 2: The Inferno
","There's something delightfully askew about this movie. For one, the not-so-subtle allusions to Dante. In an action movie. Man, that's just precious.While 'John Wick 2' doesn't have the suspenseful revenge buildup of its predecessor, it doubles down on the mystique of the underworld's internal workings; which makes sense as that was the allure of the original.But one of the things I really like about this movie is that, even with the beautifully gruesome violence, there's a fair bit of humor mixed in; some of it even taking the action to bizarre levels. Like, say, Reeves and Common continuing their fistfight during a fall down the stairs, or even co-opting New York's homeless as part of the assassin network (and Morpheus as their King . . . I just thought that that was very funny).It's all part of the surreal magic.7/10",7,1,2,16 June 2017
Jackie Brown," Another spot-on Elmore Leonard adaptation
","JACKIE BROWN seems to play against Tarantino's usual violence-and- pop-culture driven type and that's why I love this movie. It's a loving ode to '70s blaxploitation movies and a slick caper movie that just oozes style. But it's not a huge departure; there are still the long stretches of dialogue between well-rounded characters, but it's the quality of the writing and how smoothly the dialogue flows that keeps things moving. Boring is not a word to describe this movie. This thing's got a heavy-hitter cast (whacked- out De Niro, the always terrific Keaton, Fonda rocking that beach bunny getup and Jackson who just unloads the attitude) and it spotlights Pam Grier and Robert Forster, who are both winning casting choices.It's my favorite Tarantino, a slow-burn character piece that just seems to hit all of its targets. The soundtrack cooks, Chris Tucker gets capped after five minutes' screen time, and it's always a thrill to watch the heist go down. Great movie, all around.9/10",9,0,2,27 September 2014
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Can nonsense be any funnier? Ni!
","I was in high school when I first saw 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', so you can imagine how many times we'd describe a woman with huge . . . tracts of land. The movie sent me into a fit of giggles then and it's done so on every viewing since. Is the infantile subject matter the reason for the Grail's easy accessibility? 'Like of Brian' possibly better shows the troupe's anarchy-fueled wit, but this is where they push it to the point of lunacy. Silly beyond belief, and I love every bit.We can all agree it's the most iconic of their movies. Everybody knows Monty Python by this movie: the Black Knight ('just a flesh wound'), the coconuts, the Knights who say 'NI!', the rabbit. And people will quote long stretches of dialogue (not just catch phrase, I'm talking scenes); a high contender for most quotable movie of all time.At the very least, it's damn funny.8/10",8,0,1,11 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars doesn't get any better than this.
","You've gotta admire George Lucas' moxie. It was bold enough that he sought out to self-finance 'The Empire Strikes Back', but the movie has to be a downer on top of it. Make matters worse, he ends on one humdinger of a cliffhanger that people had to wait 3 years for resolution. That's sheer balls. But what a terrific movie it is. For one, it surpasses the original, which is rare in the sequel department. But it also takes its time to let the story unfold, characters get fleshed out, and the whole thing's a stirring mix of humor, drama and action. Yoda's scenes are some of my favorite of the trilogy. Frank Oz was able to lend that puppet such a personality that it simply becomes a wizened old Jedi master and not a special effect. And Darth Vader's presence in this movie makes him one of the all0time great movie villains. He's unhinged, choking out underlings left and right, and pursuing Luke with reckless abandon. Badass seems kind of trite, but it fits here. 'The Empires Strikes Back' is a movie that just fires on every last cylinder. Great dialogue, suspense, set pieces and production values. For my money, it's John Williams' finest score, and the movie continues to be one of my absolute favorites (not to mention the best of the trilogy). 10/10",10,0,0,1 December 2013
Minions," Delivers on its promise
","'Minions' doesn't really have anything new to offer, aside from crassly commercializing the yellow side players in the 'Despicable Me' movies. You sort of accept that going in. Personally, I've always been fond of the little pill-shaped bastards, which is why I enjoyed this movie. It's 90 minutes of exactly what you'd expect from them and it turns out that's enough to sustain a whole movie. The cast is great, despite the miscast Sandra Bullock (not a slight, I like her) and the humor is just right for a light-as-it-gets Summer movie. The '60s setting also worked surprisingly well.Honestly, as toy commercials go, you could do a whole lot worse. 7/10",7,6,9,20 July 2015
Aladdin," One of the classics
","'Aladdin' . . . not only the best movie in the exalted Renaissance period, but also -- along with 'The Jungle Book' -- Disney's best musical. Seriously, this soundtrack is chock-full of earworms and none of them are filler.Everyone knows what this movie's best feature is (and I'll get to that in a second), but the level of quality in its animation is staggering. The color saturation is purely eye-candy, and it makes Agrabah a memorable Disney kingdom. Even the characters (some of the whitest Arabs ever put to film) have personality in their movements that you just don't expect.These assets by themselves make this a worthwhile movie, but it's Robin Williams who blasts it out of the park. His overstimulated execution leaves an indelible mark on this company's history, and the lion's share of laughs come directly from him. It's a gifted, delightful and energetic performance, and it's easy to lay the movie's vast appeal at his feet.But honestly, the whole thing is wildly entertaining.",8,2,3,23 May 2019
Incredibles 2," Solid family fare
","PIXAR sequel fatigue has given way to a certain cynicism over the years, but 'Incredibles 2' nicely withstands such negativity. Sure, we should've gotten this movie years ago, but it also provides ample summer fun. It's a feat that Brad Bird is able to make scenes of mundane domestic life as entertaining as the crowd-pleasing action scenes. I do think that Jack-Jack *is* this movie, but in any case, I enjoyed myself throughout.If I have one complaint, it's the score. Giacchino goes way overboard with the horns.",7,3,4,21 September 2018
Sin City," Frank Miller: The Movie
","Comic book movie or not, 'Sin City' has got style coming out of its pores. It's a vast understatement to call this an adaptation; translation is more apropos, as if Robert Rodriguez physically lifted the content from the page and threw it up on the big screen. Whole panels are right up there for all to see. If Frank Miller painted the figurative picture of a city that no sane person would want to live in, the movie does it justice and adds the necessary realism to populate it with Hollywood actors. Its only weakness is that the viscera bogs things down after a while.But this movie's a treat for the cast alone, which is top-notch. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are ideal choices for Marv and Hartigan (respectively). Rosario Dawson's warrior woman is something else (man, oh man). I can't really think of a weak like in this group. I have to say that Brittany Murphy was my favorite here; she has the toughness and the vulnerability for the role, but she also has a real presence. That says an awful lot when she's able to stand out among heavy hitters like these.7/10",7,0,3,24 November 2015
Spectre," The spectacle's there, but not so much the actual danger
","I walked out of 'Spectre' with an odd mix of satisfaction and disappointment. As a Bond movie, it delivers on the set piece front, no question. That cold open is something else entirely, and I absolutely loved the scenes in the Alps. There's even a slinky car chase and a brawl on a speeding train for heaven's sake. And it's nice looking, too; lavishly appointed, and that doesn't even cover the hotness of Léa Seydoux. Basically all the reasons to see it on the big screen.But the stakes are never really high. Bond goes rogue(again), the future of MI-6 is under threat (again) and the sinister multinational corporation that ties the Craig movies together is just a cabal of highly-placed goons. I'm not sure if I'm just one of those nitpicky fans or the script was genuinely undercooked. Time will tell.6/10",6,3,7,20 November 2015
Braveheart," Top-notch work from Mel Gibson; a truly moving film
","It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about 'Braveheart' is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score.And despite its 3-hour running time, 'Braveheart' is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10",9,2,4,20 September 2013
Moon," Understated, but packs a wallop
","'Moon' is impressive in that, despite (or due to) a limited budget, it's able to tell a compelling story in a suitably realized setting. Because of the isolation of this one character laboring on a remote moonbase, it really does add to the feeling of being out there - as space-faring cinema goes, at least. It also helps tremendously that there's a lived-in quality to the sets, turning the clinical corporate facility into a workaday environment.But the centerpiece here is Sam Rockwell, who really does carry this film all on his own as (essentially) the only character in the story. He pulls it off beautifully. And the power of his performance (and the script) is making you feel for something that's so disposable. It's not the plot twist that resonates with me, it's the undeniable human angle.8/10",8,0,3,18 February 2015
True Romance," Solid writing, harsh style
","If you compare this to another Tarantino flick (let's go with 'Pulp Fiction'), 'True Romance' offers a load of memorable bits; the Sicilians conversation; Brad Pitt's classic stoner; Bronson Pinchot; Gandolfini's merciless beating; the absurd shootout at the Ambassador. This movie's full of funny dialogue - and with that, some pretty gruesome violence. For me, it's not very cohesive, and once we leave Detroit for California sunshine (when it goes overboard with the cigarette smoke and filtered light) it loses something. The first act is where the sweetness between Slater and Arquette really shines; once they get the drug deal rolling, we lose Walken and that cute couple and it's a standard Tony Scott movie. We get back to the romance at the end, but by then, I really did miss Walken (and Gary Oldman - man, that guy's nuts).It's the loud and in-your-face style that I wasn't really onboard with. Some Scott movies work pretty well. Some really don't. This was somewhere in the middle. And don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to violence; far from it. But here, it takes control.6/10",6,0,2,16 July 2016
Happy Feet," Feet of fury
","Man, George Miller directed a happy-fun kids movie. I realize that everyone and their mother's already pointed that out a thousand times by now, but . . . It's just not what you'd expect from the maestro of Mad Max movies. And it ain't bad at all.'Happy Feet' moves from an ugly duckling story to one that's purely agenda-driven, but it offers a fun time doing it. The songs are good, it looks fantastic and Robin Williams walks a fine line between overbearing and scene-stealing (as only he can).Good luck keeping those toes from tappin'.7/10",7,1,1,21 March 2017
The Nice Guys," Just the right escapist fix
","'The Nice Guys' had one of those trailers for the ages that you just know would yield a disappointing movie. No let-down here; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a terrific mix of comedy, action, porn and Detroit gangsters. With less profanity and violence, this is something that'd work great on TV. But that'd be neutering it.It's a Shane Black movie in every respect - the end result of mixing 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and 'The Last Boy Scout' - but that's also why it's so entertaining. It's his signature brand of dialog and brutality that make for a good time. But it's also the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both are good casting choices, but this is Gosling's show; he plays the hell out of a hapless loser, and more than a few laughs come from his spastic humor.The tone is spot-on, the plot has just the right twists, and this works beautifully as light and breezy Summer fare.And I haven't seen a soundtrack this good in a very long time.8/10",8,4,10,20 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," This is that sought-after toy just waiting under the Christmas tree
","I've gotta say, with dystopian futures having become so commonplace, it's really cool that a 35-year-old franchise can come along and make it all feel fresh. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' deserves that honor, and a sweeter breath of fresh air you can not ask. A return to lean R-rated action where practical effects rule the day, its veins coursing with high-octane gasoline and attitude to spare (hell, balls might be more apt to describe it). It unloads the thrills but sneaks in the human sadness unsuspected.Really, this is just the kind of big-budget Summer action movie I've been asking for. Noisy and propulsive, but not as a mere formality. It's manic, wildly imaginative and . . .Simply put, this is one hell of a ride.9/10",9,4,12,15 May 2015
The Breakfast Club," Like a middle-finger to adults
","I was an adult when I first watched 'The Breakfast Club', and it spoke to the high-schooler in me. A real head-turner, this one. What makes it so resonant is the authentic depiction of high school teenagers - five disparate archetypes brought together during detention. I say archetypes, but I think everyone in the audience can relate to (at least) one of the characters. Hughes' writing is the blood that courses through the movie's veins, but it's got a cast that really makes the whole thing work (especially Paul Gleason). Also a pretty good soundtrack (not just for 'Don't You Forget About Me', but also 'Fire in the Twilight', easily my favorite). And there's something about the locations in a John Hughes movie. His choice of high school is both something that feels close to where I went, and a place I want to visit one of these days (his forte wasn't just writing and soundtracks; the man really knew where to shoot).This is a movie with real staying power. And the only thing I have to say against(?) this movie is Ally Sheedy's makeover near the end. It never sat well with me, and it's an unnecessary perpetuation of the importance of looks (just before we hear Anthony Michael Hall reading their rebellious letter to the principal, at that). I dunno, that's just me.7/10",7,0,0,23 June 2015
Donnie Darko," Excellent movie, but also something else entirely
","'Donnie Darko' is a curious one. All of the ingredients for a notable movie are there (a fine cast, superb soundtrack, great writing), and it sure does jam enough stuff into the story: jet engines, tangent universes, superhero themes, there's even a teen movie nestled under all of this. And it all comes together to make something unique and absorbing; eerie, darkly funny, brimming with a strange mix of charm and sadness.And sure, you can sum this up as a cult movie with an intricate puzzle of a story - but for me, this is a world of its own. I find myself getting sucked into this movie, just fall right in and get lost. This is primarily because it brings '80s suburbia to life staggeringly well. The marks of the period aren't littered all over the place like cheap props, but are sewn into the fabric. The touches are subtle but wholly effective. There's just something about this movie that puts me right back there as a little kid in 1988. I look at this and see a (jaded) middle America of the time, and not the Long Beach locations. It's really something when you can evoke a time and place like this and the filming locations don't poke holes in the illusion. Simply put, watching this movie is an experience (for me, at least), which goes a long way in explaining its high replay value. And then there's that soundtrack (which is an unbelievable assemblage of songs), but on the matter of that Gary Jules cover . . . I imagine that, were I to hear that song for the first time outside of the film, I'd probably hate it in favor of the Tears for Fears original. But I know it for the last few minutes of this movie, and it beautifully accentuates the mood during those closing moments. 'Donnie Darko' and 'Mad World' are inseparable, and as such, it's a tremendous song. This whole movie is fascinating.10/10",10,1,3,22 October 2012
The Wedding Singer," As a teenager, this was hilarious
","My attitude towards 'The Wedding Singer' has really taken a dive over the years. I remember when everyone was talking about it in high school, and it was pretty good. This was back when ironic gag-a-minute '80s humor was funny. Now, it just seems half-assed (a DeLorean rolls up playing the 'Miami Vice' theme). There are still a couple of good laughs here and there: Jon Lovitz, the rapping granny, Frank Silvero), but the romcom formula is being played to the fullest here - two destined lovers kept apart by misunderstandings, miscommunications, etc. - and Sandler's this ridiculously sensitive milquetoast. Were it not so syrupy, this would be easier to stomach.5/10",5,2,5,10 August 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Makes for a great finish (back with Indy was a trilogy)
","It seems fair to say that 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' stands in the shadow of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (not just the Nazis and the big set pieces) but that's not really a criticism. This is done in the spirit of the original movie - a welcome ray of light and exuberance following 'Temple of Doom'. Basically, the unhindered escapism is back.Most of this is due to the ingenious casting of Sean Connery; the father-son angle is really the heart of all of this, and their natural chemistry is crucial to making it all work.What else is there to say? It's a great movie.8/10",8,0,0,26 August 2016
Back to the Future," Everything that's great about the '80s. And cinema.
","Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and 'Back to the Future' is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. 'Back to the Future' has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon. This is my idea of a perfect movie.10/10",10,4,5,4 July 2015
Goodfellas," Wiseguys were never so riveting
","GOODFELLAS is almost 25 years old, but I don't think there's been a better mob movie since. This movie does a terrific job showing the flash and allure of being a successful mobster (the cash, the respect, the twisted sense of family) and then the dark and dirty side - the graft, lies and ferocity. Liotta's fall is as rough as his rise is seductively entertaining (think SCARFACE, only a whole lot better) and it's punctuated by brutal acts of violence.Overall, a great movie; features an immersive soundtrack, half the supporting cast of THE SOPRANOS, and Lorraine Bracco, who just radiates sassy broad. And lest I sinfully forget: Joe Pesci, whose savage hothead character lends this movie its dark humor. He moves from butcher's knife to gun (several) to ice pick and it's always somehow funny. He lights up the screen in this movie; it's an amazing performance.8/10",8,0,0,20 December 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Better in almost every way.
","The rare example of a sequel that builds on and surpasses the original, 'The Bourne Supremacy' ups the game and is one massively entertaining flick. Matt Damon has a little more to work with this time out, often playing a more contemplative supersoldier than the boyish fish-out-of-water amnesiac of the previous movie. What happens to the character in this movie is rough and terribly sad, and Damon wears the weary effects well. As for the rest of the cast, beefing up Brian Cox's role was a good move (wasn't enough of him in 'Identity'), as well as the addition of Joan Allen. Good actress and a good fit for the role. The killing of Marie so early in the story was a ballsy move, but proved a great way to get at Bourne and get him back on the offensive. Having her tag along again as our main character globe-hops would've felt like a retread and slow things down. They made the right call. On top of that, Bourne's frame-up that leads to a deeper mystery was a great way to sequelize the original movie, as well as open things up for additional movies. Solid approach. As for Greengrass' 'documentary style' camera work and quick-cut editing, it does take some getting used to. And I can surely understand how it's a turn-off to some (maybe most). But it doesn't (for the most part) detract from my enjoyment of the piece, and it does add to the kinetic sense of perpetual movement that makes the movie exciting. Also gives the fight scenes a jolt, though they don't really need it with those brutal thud sound effects.It's in the car chase that the camera work and hyper editing goes overboard. This chase scene has such a dizzying effect on the senses that it is a bit much. And once the action comes to a close and both cars are crashed in the middle of the tunnel, you kinda feel that post- car accident disorientation. But Greengrass uses the preceding foot chase (a great one) to build things up. But the time we get behind the wheel, we're so amped that it almost flows nicely. But 'Supremacy' is a hell of a movie; holds up incredibly well after repeat viewings, and even the reuse of 'Extreme Ways' for the end credits is still a fist-pump of an ending. It's definitely my favorite of the series. 9/10",9,1,3,16 May 2013
Princess Mononoke," The artistry here is astonishing
","I guess you'd call what I'm doing a Studio Ghibli film quest, and 'Princess Mononoke' was an interesting item to mark off. But it's not a favorite of mine. The movie's certainly ambitious, once again tackling an ecological story and adding a sense of ambiguity; good-and-evil isn't so simple, and the real struggle is for a balance between industry and nature. My problem (and I speak solely for myself) is that I couldn't get 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' out of my head for most of this runtime. And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters. Is that fair? Maybe not, but again, it's just me. But like I said before, this is impressive on a technical level. 6/10",6,0,2,24 April 2017
Jurassic Park," Stomped its competition, and had fun doing it
","Part of me wonders if this movie would've had such an impact on me were I just a bit older back in 1993. At its heart, 'Jurassic Park' is really just a monster movie, but it rides high on Spielberg as the master showman; it plays like an amusement park full of impressive effects and plenty of scares. In one scene, he takes the vibe from wonder to dead to horror, and I still appreciate that as a much older adult; same for the CGI, which is used perfectly as a tool (and still holds up for that reason). I can't say whether the science is accurate (though I still think it's cool), but the thrills deliver and the cast is good (letting the smartass Goldblum steal every scene). There's a reason why 'Jurassic Park' owned the Summer of '93 and it's right there on the screen. 8/10",8,3,4,16 June 2015
Beetlejuice," Surreal, unusual, freakish and proud of it.
","Tim Burton built his name on his macabre style but 'Beetlejuice' is one odd movie (in a good way). But some of the stuff that goes on in this is just bananas, and that speaks to the movie's inherent personality. There some serious imagination at work here, not just the title character, but in the Salvador Dali netherworld images (complete with giant sandworm), grotesque makeup and its playful take on the afterlife. It's also got Winona Ryder at her most charming, and Catherine O'Hara's a B on wheels in this movie; oh, man. And then the unforgettable Danny Elfman score. It all adds up to something pretty great.But that's all before we even get to the crown jewel, the pièce de ré·sis·tance: Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. It'd be weak to say he steals the movie; he owns it lock, stock and barrel. He's a comic performer at the top of his game; lewd, profane and utterly without boundaries. It's one of his best performances, that's a given. Even those who don't like this movie have to admit that.But then, how could anyone not like this movie? 8/10",8,1,1,6 November 2015
The Simpsons Movie," A successful move to cinemas
","TV's longest running sitcom family makes it to the big screen . . . or Homer Simpson screws everything up for Springfield.Either one is a good way to sum up 'The Simpsons Movie', a wholly enjoyable flick that maintains the show's sense of humor. And that's really all that was needed, throw in a few guest stars and some choice one-liners from the various local color, and you've got a movie. In that sense, the story doesn't even really start until the 45-minute mark, with so many side characters being given screen time. Which isn't a bad thing because it's consistently funny. That goes for the whole movie; it's got wit, heart and plenty of Homer's nonsense.7/10",7,0,0,15 June 2017
All the President's Men," Well-made, powerful, and one that will stick with you long after the credits roll.
","It helps that the subject matter makes for one hell of a movie, but there's a level of craft brought forth by everyone involved that makes 'All the President's Men' one of the honest-to-god great movies of the '70s.The writing in this movie is just a thing of beauty. Most of the first 30 minutes moves from one conversation to the next, but your attention is held fast by a cast-iron grip. That the filmmakers can make several minutes of Redford making call after call at his desk gripping is awe-inspiring. And the dialogue between the characters (not just lead, but supporting, also) carries an authenticity you don't often see. Men engaging in heated discussion, talking over one another that makes you forget these people are reciting lines; it rings true-to-life and these actors disappear into genuine newsmen.And while 'All the President's Men' makes heroes out of Woodward and Bernstein, it by no means glamorizes their job. It's because of the hours upon hours of work they put in, their dogged determination that the story breaks. Hoffman and Redford have a natural chemistry, and two newspapermen become classic movie characters for it.This is a powerful movie; riveting, very well-made and for my money, the ultimate political thriller. From Pakula's direction, the all-around incredible performances and William Goldman's brilliant screenplay, it's a shining example of everyone at the top of their game.10/10",10,3,3,1 May 2013
Evil Dead II," Wickedly entertaining
","'Evil Dead II' is a departure from the first, in that it's not a straight-up horror film. After a short (slightly altered) recap of the first movie, we find Ash (Bruce Campbell) still in the cabin, having survived until daylight, the last man standing. But the forces of evil still lurk in the woods, and the bridge is out, so Ash is stranded.The tone is significantly lightened this time around, with much of the film spent on watching Ash get his ass kicked inside the cabin - whether it's getting beaten over the head with glass plates (by his own possessed hand) or being doused by a spray of blood from the walls. Just witnessing Campbell wage war with his own hand is worth the price of admission. There's so much Looney Tunes comedy and Three Stooges slapstick that you can't help but laugh at Ash's abuse (which seems to be the driving force behind the making of this film).It's the prototype for the horror/comedy we see so much of today. Even so, 'Evil Dead II' bristles with so much manic energy, you can't help but appreciate the humor and sentiment from the filmmakers. A supremely watchable film of the highest order.8/10",8,1,2,12 October 2011
Up in the Air," Romantic comedy? Drama? Either way, it's good.
","Usually if I see Vera Farmiga's name in a movie's cast list, I'll invariably sit down and tune right in. As a rule of thumb, it's worked out pretty well so far; her presence always imbues a scene with warmth. And it's no different with 'Up in the Air' - and the nice thing here is that she's apart of a greater whole. Everything about this movie is spot-on; the writing, direction and especially the cast. It all hangs together very well. Clooney's somewhat against type here, playing a fairly unlikable character, but hell if he's not charming nonetheless. And he shares a brilliant chemistry with Farmiga. This is a story about relationships, both the lack and need thereof. There are twists and turns, and I needed a little bit to absorb and reconcile the ending . . . but the movie's a winner, plain and simple.7/10",7,0,0,15 September 2015
V for Vendetta," Exciting, resonant, all of the good stuff
","It's been a long time since I read the Alan Moore source comic, so I couldn't tell you how well 'V for Vendetta' is as an adaptation. But it does make for a great movie.Herein, you can find references to '1984' and 'Fahrenheit 451', not to mention a clarion call for chaos in the name of liberty - all under the umbrella of fascism (a potent theme, and one that makes anarchy fashionable). But it's also fairly moving story, which says a lot for a Wachowski action movie. Also, can I just say that it makes knives way cooler than guns? And it's not just the blood sprays and the explosions that give the movie power, but the spoken words themselves.And speaking of dialogue, Hugo Weaving is the movie's winning asset. Give the guy credit for conveying emotion under an inexpressive mask, but more than that, the sonorous tones of his voice make the vaudevillian word play extremely appealing. He uses it to profound effect. The whole cast is great, but he was a novel choice for V.8/10",8,1,2,9 March 2016
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," A hit-or-miss ballad
","'Talladega Nights' is ad-lib city - as the end credits gag reel will attest - but you can still see these actors running wild with their dialogue throughout the actual movie. I tend to think this is why, as Will Ferrell movies go, I don't take to it like I do 'Anchorman' or 'Step Brothers'. Some of it works, some of it falls flat. To its credit, it functions pretty well as a NASCAR parody, and does infuse the drive-in-a-circle sport with energy.That said, Gary Cole easily walks away with this movie - which that guy has a knack for doing, but it's still fun to watch. Then again, it is a full-length movie built on Will Ferrell's Dubya impression.6/10",6,0,0,26 April 2016
The Godfather," In the dictionary under masterpiece
","Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why 'The Godfather'is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about. I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in. This is an epic in every sense of the word.9/10",9,0,0,7 March 2017
