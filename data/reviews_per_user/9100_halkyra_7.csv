The Blair Witch Project," A movie that keeps going even after you leave..
","It's hard to describe the disturbing feeling I had after leaving the Movie. The Blair Witch starts innocent enough but draws the audience into the story until you can share the terror with the main characters who are doomed from the start. Not a drop of blood or even a single glimpse of the witch, but its that, which is not shown which, is truly frightening. My parents couldn't take showers after Psycho now I could never go camping. The final moments of the movie will haunt you for a while. Don't go home alone. Trust me.",4,1,3,18 July 1999
Minority Report," A good with an interesting concept.
","The good part is that it is a really interesting movie with some provocative concepts. If you could prevent a murder before it happens, would you? Should you? The future is well laid out and it was easy to sink into the world and enjoy the ride. It is more of a 'who done it' thriller than a Sci-Fi action.The bad part is that it doesn't make sense in parts. It moves quickly and it keeps you going for the whole time but afterwards I found myself thinking, 'What a minute, that didn't make sense'. There is also a theme of an one-eyed man but I missed what message the director was trying to convey with it.Overall it is a great movie and one worth watching.",8,0,0,11 July 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Finally Disney pulls off a good movie
","Disney's last few attempts at movies have been weak but Lilo & Stitch is something I'm proud to take my children to see. Each of my children could relate to a character and they spoke and laughed about the movie for days.The movie is about outcasts who come together in a family. An Alien who is breed to destroy large cities in trapped on a small island surrounded by water (doomsday monsters can't seem to swim), is forced to learn to live in a family and the fun begins there.",7,1,2,11 July 2002
Pearl Harbor," A Good Blockbuster Movie.
","I was pleasantly surprise. I was worried that they would try to replace a plot with a formula. The movie did seem anti-climatic when Pearl Harbor occurred and then the movie continued another 45 minutes with the Dolittle raid, but it was worth it to see the movie's final catharsis. The final ending had an Armageddon dilemma (two men, one Ben Affleck again, who love the same women, who looks like Liv Tyler, and they are on an impossible mission). It had some great laugh in the beginning (Affleck's nose) and some real tear jerkers at the end. The may be this summer's perfect date movie.",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A great Plot, Good characters and a balanced use of effect & location.
","Unlike American films, which have happen feel-good, Crouching Tiger, like many foreign films, doesn't give you the ending you want but the ending the story needs. The press talks about its `Matrix-like' special effects, but its real strength is its story. Like a classic Greek tragedy, our hero and heroines are prevented from true happiness because of some flaw. The male lead, Li Mu Bai, is an almost supernatural warrior, but yet his deepest desire for love and happiness is prevented by his own sense of honor. He has a chance to turn away from his `green destiny' but he cannot. The young nobleman's daughter, wishes to be a great warrior rather than a housewife but her own angry and arrogance prevents her from her only chance and in the end, she knows it. When all is done, only those who realize that they can never get true happiness or those too na√Øve will be able to survive. This is a provocative story will surprise many people who are not used to seeing such concepts in a film.",9,0,0,9 February 2001
Mulholland Drive," It is only a recording...
","This movie is more of experimental cinema than your normal American movie.The movie plays like suspense or mystery but 2 hours into the movie when a box is opened the females change characters and the movie continues as if nothing happened at all.There is also a cowboy wandering through the scenes changing the flow of action and a blackened bum who harkens death and Hollywood gangsters.It's like an abstract painting. It has no other meaning then what you give to it yourself.Strange but entertaining...OkIf you cannot stand a world without order, and cannot sleep unless the movie has reason, then just believe that the whole movie is one half real and half delusion of Naomi Watts character Diane who cannot deal with her life. It may not explain everything but it's my best thoughts on the movie. Remember as the man said on the stage....it's only a recording...",Null,1,1,16 January 2003
The Sixth Sense," Finally a good ghost story
","Finally a good ghost story comes to the screen this summer. This is a solid story line that will draw you in, then hit you with a surprise twist at the end. The less that you know about this film, the better. Bruce Willis does a wonderful in the strange and at times unsettling movie.",Null,0,0,17 August 1999
