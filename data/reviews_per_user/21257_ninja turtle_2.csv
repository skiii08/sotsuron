Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How does one make a movie to which there is already an ending?
","I am not a child of the Star Wars era, or am I?Before 1999 I had never seen a Star Wars movie in my life (I'm 20 years old). I wondered what all the hype was about. I rented the original trilogy months before The Phantom Menace was released. I liked it very much even though I thought it was a little cheesy and I alredy knew that Darth Vader was Lukes father. But i fell in love with the mythological aspect of the movie.I will never forget the summer of 1999, the summer of Star Wars. My two best friends and I raced to the movie theatre after school on May 16 and sat down to watch Episode 1. I could barely contain myself. The movie finished and I walked out of the theatre with mixed feelings about it. Something was missing. The mythological aspect was not present, in fact almost absent. Nevertheless I enjoyed the movie. I saw the movie two more times in theatres, bought it on VHS and now own it on DVD. I've probably seen it about thirty times by now, and have reached a few conclusions.Q. How does one make a movie to which there is already an ending?A. Stick to the original plan. When George Lucas first planned out his original 6 episode saga. I'm sure that the ending was the best (like in all great stories). Thus, Episode 1 is merely a building block. The story and characters are all part of something bigger. But of course, we're not suppose to know that. Anikin's destiny is not spelled out, unlike Luke's destiny.Q. Why did George Lucas decide to tell his story through political conflicts and not through mythology? Good vs Evil.A. I think the real question is, How does good become evil? I was expecting Anikin to be a poor orphan child clouded in mystery. But, then why would Qui-Gon Jinn want to train such a troubled boy. George Lucas is telling his story as if we have never seen the original trilogy. Therefore we would all assume that Anikin will turn out alright and everyone will be happy. Nothing in the prequel trilogy is black and white. There is no big Evil in Episode 1. It is merely an evil phantom's menace in a civilized era. And like any civilized era, it has its political conflicts.To me the two biggest flaws in this movie were that Anikin did not seem to have a real relationship with his mother and that we were never presented a historical background on the Sith. I really would have wanted to see more Darth Maul, he wastes no time on words. The ending duel is my favorite fight scene of all time.Anyone who blames Jar Jar for their inability to enjoy the movie, obviously doesn't understand much of anything. I am also sick and tired of hearing people say that the special effects aren't good enough. Show me one movie with better special effects.I love this movie even though it could have been better. George Lucas is one of my biggest inspirations. And as I look at all the Star Wars posters and toys in my room, I can't help but wonder how the story 'ends' 4/5",7,2,4,18 April 2003
The Others," Best of it's kind
","I have always wondered if anyone would get a suspense/horror movie done right because lately its all been crap.I loved this movie from beginning to end.I was creeped out even in the first half hour when nothing was going on. The movie takes some time to pick up the pace but every little second gives some details and explanations.This movie had everything it was well written, the actors were perfect not to mention the british accents alone creeped me out.I'm sick and tired of cheap scares in almost every horror movie out there.THE OTHERS builds up a mood which is something most movies don't even take the time to do and of course the ending is excellent. 9/10",9,0,0,11 August 2001
