The Blair Witch Project," 87 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
","Although I respect peoples opinion, I still find it hard to believe that people gave this movie a 10. First of all there whole marketing strategy of trying to make us believe that this was a true story did not work. Which is probably why I did not get in to the story at all. Maybe if they had dropped that I might have enjoyed it a little more. The idea was original and all, but it just did not work. The worst part of it all is that I heard that they are working on a sequel. I won't be fooled this time!",1,2,5,21 January 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," A movie that will stay with you for life.
","First of all this movie is THE CLASSIC of all sci-fi. All sci-fi movies are inspired by this movie. Probably one of the first serious sci-fi movies. Some may even consider this a religious movie. That's what make it so original. There are so many themes that the movie is able to touch everyone in a different way. After the first time I saw this movie, I could not get it out of my head. I enjoyed it so much because a lot of it was left to the viewer. The meaning of the mystical ending can mean something different to everyone. There are not many movies like that. I now own a copy of 2001 in wide screen format which just has unbelievable detail to it. Even after so many years the quality of it is unmatched. Plus, what a great soundtrack. I enjoyed every Kubrick movie, but this one is my favorite. Probably my favorite movie of all time!",10,1,3,21 January 2000
Pulp Fiction," The best movie of the 90's
","This movie blew me away. One word to some it all up is 'Refreshing'. That's what this movie was to me. Finally something different, original but intelligent. The way the story is told, the dialogue, the cast ... Everything was right on the money. The movie is filed with classic scenes, memorable quotes and unforgettable characters.I recommend this film to everyone who wants to see something fresh. Beware you must open minded fallow the story. But don't worry, even if it's told in a special way it isn't avant-garde to the point where it's impossible to understand it.I just hope that Tarantino can come up with the magic again. I was disappointed with Jackie Brown, I cannot blame him. Not every movie could be masterpiece.",10,0,0,21 January 2000
