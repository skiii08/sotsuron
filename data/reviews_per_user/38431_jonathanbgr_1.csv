Deepwater Horizon," waste of time!
","what a stupid movie!,.. a movie to justify the drilling companies for what happened, that it was nature? and a bird flying into the control room messing everything up? come on! ,.. they shouldn't drill in the first place!,.. well played etc,.. but what a stupid story! If this movie was made to justify the disaster that happened back a few years ago along the coast of California,.. then i would suggest going there and have a look at the beaches yourself, I've seen stranded sea creatures all hit by rotor blades and drowned in thick tar along the coast line,.. and the view of the horizon is blocked by these oil drill stations,..",Null,2,5,5 October 2016
