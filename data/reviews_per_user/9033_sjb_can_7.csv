Skyfall," Equal to the hype
","I went into the movie a little skeptical because of the hype. Also, I was worried about the opening sequence they kept pitching because most car chases, chases in general, bore me. But this one was riveting, interesting. It was fantastical but just shy of over-the-top. Loved it. Adele's song and the beginning movie credits was interesting, entertaining, beautiful. Javier Bardem played the best Bond villain I've seen since the '70's. His acting was a work of art. Judy Dench was, as usual, perfect. Daniel Craig was more than eye candy, more substantial. Sam Mendes is obviously an amazing director. He was able to make even the couple of corny lines work to the movie's advantage. And the filming/editing was flawless.Those who haven't watched the old Bond movies might miss the punch of some of the really enjoyable moments, like the Aston Martin, Moneypenny, Q... I was delighted at the memories.",10,5,15,23 November 2012
Star Trek," It was true to the original while taking us where no Trekkie has gone before.
","I was a little put out by the special effects extravaganza and the childhood scenes of Spock and Kirk at the beginning, and thought, 'Oh no. This is going to be a long two hours.' Then Doctor Leonard McCoy showed up and I started to enjoy it. From the middle of the movie on, I had a silly grin on my face. I was utterly full of joy. Since I was four years old, I've loved Spock, Kirk, Bones, Chekhov, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, and this movie brought them all back to life in an amusing and satisfying way--which I did not think possible. Of course, the Romulan threat, with the intense Eric Bana as the menacing Nero, was as formidable an enemy as always. Simon Pegg's Scotty was humorous and his Scottish accent was perfectly over the top. Leonard Nimoy as the future Spock seemed a little contrived at first, put there to please us old Trekkies, but in the end, I was convinced that he was needed. I can see that the film would be enjoyable to people who'd never seen a Star Trek film in their lives, but I can't help but feel sorry for them because they couldn't possibly get just how clever these film makers were in their casting, directing, effects, etc. to give a classic a face-lift without making it look like plastic.A Fun, Fun film!",10,1,7,19 November 2009
Shutter Island," Hitchcock-esquire, atmospheric mystery that held me comfortably in my seat for 2 1/2 hours.
","I wish I could experience the movie without having read the book. A mystery isn't very mysterious when you know the outcome. I was interested and entertained, but not enthralled. Unfortunately, except for Ben Kingsley's perfect performance (as usual), over-acting ran rampant. That coupled with the heavy, melodramatic music punctuating the brooding backdrop of a mental asylum on a rocky island with a hurricane lashing its shores, it was more typical of a movie for audiences of the 1950's than 2010. Perhaps Scorcese wanted it that way since it was set in 1954. I found it a little over the top. If it had been toned down just a notch, I think I'd have given it at least an 8. The story was complex and compelling in its own right and handled pretty well; however, I wonder if the atmosphere got in the way a bit.",7,2,6,21 February 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Funny Movie; Hilarious Special Features
","Even when I wasn't laughing out loud, I was smiling during this movie. It is the most original spoof I've ever seen (I realize that is an oxymoron, but true nevertheless). Real talent went into the making of this movie. John C. Reilly was fabulous as the lead and the supporting characters didn't miss a beat. Whatever you do, don't dismiss the Special Features disc. It is as funny or funnier than the movie. Start with the things you'd usually watch but then watch the things that usually bore you. The Real Dewey Cox and The Making of Dewey Cox was very entertaining. All the deleted scenes were funny except for one. The two discs provide an entire evening of enjoyment.",9,0,1,10 April 2008
Disturbia," No Hitchcock; just a teen thriller
","With the high ratings and references to a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, I was unpleasantly surprised when I sat down for two hours of teen scene. Also, I was angry over the cheap 'shocking scene' at the beginning of the movie that was unnecessarily traumatic to watch (we could have understood Shia's character without it). While David Morse brought some adult weight and the last fifteen minutes of the movie were suspenseful, I was disappointed, to say the least. Shia was so riveting in The Greatest Game Ever Played, but here, he was upstaged by Aaron Yoo who played his best friend. Shia seemed a supreme unlikeable geek, not a cool teen acting out because of emotional trauma. There is no chemistry between him and Sarah Roemer and her role is unnecessary, as Morse, Yoo and Carrie-Ann Moss create the tension. Although I'm not a suspense lover, the edge-of-your-seat scenes near the end were very well done, and Shia showed what I expected of him--but it was too short and too far into the movie to bring up my vote.",5,2,5,24 May 2007
Avatar," Exceptional until last half hour of mind-numbing, immoderate violence
","I was in awe of the world Cameron created and was spellbound. I didn't care that the storyline was somewhat predictable or that some of the graphics weren't in focus. I ignored the 'message' about genocide, greed and Earth rape (all worthwhile messages but I really go to movies primarily to be entertained). And I succeeded in surrendering to a wonderful 3D experience, until the last half hour of inessential violence. It was over the top and so unnecessary. There were better ways to play out the conflict, ways that would have been satisfying. Also, the bad guy was so annoying. Yes, we are supposed to hate bad guys and want them to meet their maker, but I didn't care what happened to him--I just wanted him out of the movie. I recommend seeing the movie in 3D for the beauty of the imaginary planet and its inhabitants. But only people who enjoy long drawn out scenes of gratuitous violence will leave feeling the end wasn't designed for cheap thrills.",7,0,4,22 December 2009
The Departed," Stellar performances by Leo, Matt, Jack, Alec and even Mark
","For two hours, I was mesmerized and had this movie ranked a 10. But the last half hour left me feeling dissatisfied. Sometimes that is thought-provoking and stimulating; this was frustrating. While the deaths came as no real surprise, the rapid succession made each inconsequential. I was highly invested in these characters, and I, the audience, deserved a fitting reckoning, a flourish. A shot in the head by a civilian! No humiliation; no atonement. The rat symbolism was contrived, and definitely not compensation for a muddy ending. So why did I still give it an 8? Because it was a really good movie; the disappointing thing is it not ending up a great movie.",8,1,2,16 February 2007
