Scarface," Scarface is one of the best movies of all time, and perhaps Pacino's best performance.
","The fact that it didn't make the top 250 on this list is laughable, especially when Terminator 1 and 2 made the list. IMO Scarface is a ten, and is easily in the same league as The Godfather 1 and 2, Casino, and Goodfellas. A great thing about Scarface is that it's the only 3-hour film that I didn't feel bored watching at least in one part. Any others, Titanic, LOTR, etc... there was always a time when I got a bit bored, but not in Scarface. And then there's the final sequence of the movie, which IMO was not long enough, as it was amusing to see Pacino cradle a lifeless sister then blast 50 or more Bolivians apart. But the glasses guy got him in the end, just like he got Suarez, and that's pretty cool, cos you don't expect the main character to die.",10,0,1,23 December 2004
