Hereditary," Horror content is missing, waste of time, worst movie ever
","According to me direction is weak, script is bad, story is worst, acting and everything else is bad. Horror content is there but hardly for 1 minute out of 2 hours. Unnecessary scenes make it worst. It is nothing like a ghost or monster based horror movie, but more like full of sorrow and tragic one. I personally don't recommend to watch it.",1,3,6,26 August 2018
