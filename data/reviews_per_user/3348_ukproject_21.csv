It," Super 8 meets Jeepers Creepers.
","I haven't read the book. I haven't seen the original and I now wish I hadn't wasted my time and money by watching this movie either.As far as I could tell, this movie is aimed at kids and I actually found myself yawning all the way through. It just didn't work in any way whatsoever. The back story of why and how Pennywise came to be and why he does what he does isn't properly explained. In fact instead of a discernible story being told there's just a string of jump scenes separated by a few dialogues thrown in here and there.The only time I jumped in shock is when I added up the cost of the evening.'IT' is a floater.",1,27,57,16 September 2017
Memento," One of the most confusing movies you'll ever see, but it's worth it.
","This is one of my all times favourites and even after watching it for the umpteenth time, I still have to pause and think about it.Momento is the only movie I can think of, that makes you as confused as the character portrayed in the movie. Movies like The Matrix can only show how shocked Neo is when he learns that he has actually been living in the Matrix, but there was nothing the director could have done to make the audience feel as confused as Neo.Memento though really does screw with your head, but not to an extent where you are unable to finally figure out what's going on.You need to either pay attention, or give Memento a little thought after the credits have rolled, and everything clicks together.There will never be a movie like it.",10,0,2,18 July 2009
Captain Marvel," Captain Mediocre
","Groot is a tree who speaks one sentence throughout the entire franchise yet has more character, wit and charisma than Captain Marvel.Having also watched Endgame I don't even see her relevance to the finale. What was the point of Nick Fury paging her at the end of Infinity War? To provide inter galactic towing services for broken down space ships??Oh yeah. To pump out another Marvel movie and to milk more money from the fans.The most pointless MCU movie and the most mind numbingly boring MCU superhero.",1,6,14,16 September 2019
Passengers," Professional reviewers robbed you the chance of watching this beauty at the cinema.
","Luckily I have a 110' HD home projection system with active 3D and surround sound and was able to see this movie as it was meant to be seen. A truly full blown emersive experience!!!I'm a sci-fi nut and my wife most definitely isn't and this is one of the few sci-fi movies that we both often enjoy watching. The sci fi part is plausible, the romantic element is relatable, the special effects are realisticaly stunning and the ending is beautiful yet tragic.There is probably nothing more isolating than being out there in the expanse of space, and Passengers takes you on this voyage effectively. The vast canvas of infinite space is beautifully yet frighteningly laid out in front of you.Passengers isn't just a movie, it's an experience, and if professional reviews swayed you from watching it on the big screen then you've really missed something truly special.Initially I watched Passengers on a 3D Blu Ray rental and since have bought my own copy.",9,2,3,10 November 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Do not call me a Trekkie
","I'm definitely in the Star Trek camp. I not a fan of Star Wars. My favourite is still the original Wrath of Khan, I still watch repeats of any Star Trek series that appears on TV and I even like the first Star Trek movie as well as the dreaded ST Nemesis.There! Now I've got that out of the way you're probably wondering why I haven't given this movie a 1/10 rating or why I'm not trashing 'Into Darkness'.The reason being that unlike most hard core Trekkies I am not a total moron. If you simply can't enjoy a movie for what it is and end up crying all over your Star Trek posters in your bedroom while wailing 'Roddenberry must be turning in his grave', you need to get a life.ST Into Darkness has action, humour, and above all the chemistry that existed between characters of the original series. Yes there were some let downs, plot holes etc, but in no way does this movie deserve a 1/10.",10,1,5,5 January 2019
Superbad," Coming of age movie that stands on it's own.
","First of all, any review that uses 'Superbad' in its title in an attempt to put the movie down reveals more about the depth of the review rather than the movie itself.While there is nothing new about a movie that features a bunch of teenage boys obsessing over the opposite sex and ways to get laid, it is unfair to compare Superbad to American Pie, Porky's and the like.The key factor that drives this movie beautifully are the characters. If we didn't know someone like Seth, Even and Fogell at school then that's probably because we were like one of them. Each of the actors superbly portrays the bravado boys use to mask their insecurities over dealing with girls.The humour is plentiful, funny and appropriate and yes, there's plenty of bad language and crudity, but we're talking about a teen movie here, not an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Anyone watching a teen movie who then gets offended by swearing and sex should not be watching that movie in the first place.This movie reminds me of my own days at school decades ago now when us guys simply could not stop using the 'F' word and looking back we must have sounded ridiculous. I can also remember my first day lying about my age not in order to buy alcohol but adult magazines off the top shelf as well as the first alcohol fuelled party that I attended. Superbad brings these memories back vividly.Even though I'm a big fan of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I have to admit that Bueller's character was not only unrealistic and outlandish, but bordering on dislikeable. Watching it recently I found myself rooting for Principal Ed Rooney to give Bueller his comeuppance.Geekily charming, yet annoying and endearing at the same time Fogell 'McLovin' now has to be one of my all time favourite teen characters. The characters of Officer Slater and Officer Michaels only work well because they bounce off the character of McLovin. Seth and Even work well as a teen odd couple and all three lead characters are developed well to the extent that you even end up rooting for all of them. So, all in all a very funny movie, with some very touching moments. If you want to watch a movie that takes you back to your school days, your old friendships and your attempts at trying to pass for 21, this is it.",10,6,10,17 October 2010
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor: God Of Worst Marvel Movie
","Thankfully, I've got Thor I and II which both stand up to repeated viewing. This version was a total confused mess that I barely just managed to sit through once. The humor is weak, childish and force fed, the story was shambolic and the music sounded as though it was played on a 1980s casio keyboard.Awful!",3,5,11,2 March 2018
Predator," The Only Movie I've Seen Where The Audience Stood Up And Cheered
","I remember watching Predator at the ABC Cinema in Streatham back in 1987 and when the scene where Arnie and his buddies do a spot of gardening ended, the entire audience stood up and cheered. Never seen anything like it before or since.",10,2,4,13 June 2019
Knowing," Did not Know what was going on
","I wasn't really bothered by the religious overtones of the movie and really can't understand why anyone is getting upset. If you're religious, you get a religious message, if you're not it's just fiction. If anyone is stupid enough to allow something from Hollywood to shape their beliefs then there isn't much that can save them, or it seems they join Scientology.What does knock a lot of stars off for me is the number of inconsistencies and complete and utter lack of logic even as sci fi. It just does not make sense. If a planet was about to be destroyed, would an advanced civilisation save a few, young, select children by warning them a generation too soon via cryptic messages and giving them visions of Armageddon that would send a fully grown adult into a psychiatric ward? There are a string of such inconsistencies that leave you more occupied picking holes in the story line. If you put to the back of your mind the fact that the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, it is still worth watching, even if just for one pretty spectacular scene.You're still just left disappointed with the feeling that it could have been a great sci-fi movie.",5,0,5,19 November 2011
Salt," Should come with Smelling Salts
","Sit down on your sofa with a bowl full of fresh popcorn and stare at a pile of dog turd for 100 minutes. Congratulations, you've just watched Angelina Jolies latest action flick 'Salt' while feeling just as nauseous, and my advice has saved you the cost of renting or purchasing this cinematic excrement.Believe me, you've seen it all before anyway. In a nutshell; Bad evil Russians, good world saving Americans, contrived plot twists, and the PC enforced girl power female who despite being almost unhealthily thin, manages to toss bulked up men around in all directions. To then follow any semblance of a plot is like trying to follow a Shakespeare play while the actors are wearing Donald Duck costumes.Ridiculously bad.",1,3,8,5 December 2010
Avengers: Endgame," Hey Captain McFly!! I thought I told you to never come in here!!
","Captain McFly and Doc Emmett Bannner travel back in time to undo history but unfortunately Thanos Tannen finds out about the time travel shenanigans and manages to use time travel himself to his advantage.I'm a massive fan of time travel movies but this just seems to be a tacked on plot device to suck more dough from the fans.Lots of explosions and CGI. Pretty to watch, but that was about it.Should've ended with Infinity War.",6,5,9,16 September 2019
District 9," Kicks Hollywood in the Ballz.
","This movie should be at least an 8.5 simply for at least trying to venture far away from the Hollywood formulaic tosh being served up in the US. Not to mention the endless remakes, reboots, prologues, follow- ups, epilogues, directors cuts, 3D versions and other gimmicks that force us to pay to see the same movie repeatedly.First, aliens that do not depart their planet of origin with their heading set for the USA. Hallelujah!Secondly, aliens that do not automatically speak perfect English, with an American accent of course.Thirdly, no Hollywood 'A' list actors to boost the appeal of a substandard movie.And fourth, no Hollywood ending with a miraculous yet obvious antidote that cures all ills overnight.There are many other examples where the Director kicks the Hollywood movie making formula right in the gonads, and leaves it on the ground writhing in pain and while District 9 is far from a perfect movie it entertains, provokes thought and draws attention to characters rather than the actors.",10,2,3,5 June 2012
Jurassic World," The most horrific creature ever in the Jurassic franchise....The Stilettosaurus
",My rating would have been a 8 if she'd been mangled to shreds by any of the dinosaurs. or even a 9 if Chris Pratt would have pulled her high heels off and beaten her to death with them.,3,0,1,27 October 2019
Groundhog Day," One Man Show
","When I watched Groundhog day for the first time years ago I was captivated by two things. Firstly the concept of being caught in a time loop and secondly Bill Murrays portrayal of the man caught in said loop.In the years since I've always been fascinated by movies and TV shows featuring time loops and time paradoxes. In some cases movies have also used time as a mechanism to drive a psychological or supernatural point rather than a sci fi story and Groundhog Day is such a story.Groundhog Day has no mechanism for time travel, there's no scientific device or porthole or rip in the spacetime continuum. He just lives through the same day over and over. Why?In the end it turns out that the whole reason for him reliving the same day is for him to improve and make himself a better man in order to win the heart of an entitled, self obsessed, sanctimonious, judgemental woman who herself doesn't have to make an iota of self improvement herself.Bill Murray pretty much carries this movie single handedly. There's no sci fi, no moral, no logic and no sense here.Groundhog Day has aged, badly.",3,5,12,25 July 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Mind Candy for the Adolescent.
","OK I'll admit it, I'm probably out of the demographic that this movie is aiming at and my vote would probably have been much higher if I was still in my teens, but I'm not, so I didn't.Maybe I've matured abit, maybe I'm simply getting too old, but a CGI fest mindlessly tied to a pointless story, backed by indifferent actors and put together by a director who seems more focused on the bottom line than anything else just does not do it for me any more.When I watch a movie and simply do not care who dies, or what gets destroyed and as a result all the explosions and action are reduced to a glorified screen saver no matter how pretty or realistic they are, when I leave the theatre or switch the bluray player regretting the time I've just wasted, I know a movie has failed to engaged me.Movies are normally certified with a minimum age limit. This one should have a maximum recommended viewing age of about 15.",3,1,9,25 December 2010
Inception," One of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.
","As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.You can't get much more of a creative license than have dreams and dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'.",1,11,22,14 October 2010
Arrival," Starts off slow, slows down abit in the middle, and literally crawls on its hands and knees over the finishing line.
","A friend of mine told me not to bother watching this. However, being a sci-fi fan I was pretty sure that 'Arrival' would be right up my street.It really wasn't.The most frustrating thing about this movie wasn't necessarily that it was awful, but that it takes a concept like first contact with an Alien civilisation, pretends to make a serious sci-fi flick and then basically fills the reel with fluff, incompetence, over-dramatisation, and apart from the main character, a load of incomprehensible, bumbling buffoons.I'm quite a fan of bad movies but I can't think of one that I've seen that made me want it to end with 45 minutes left.And here I was thinking that Interstellar was a load of tripe that would take some beating. Yet here comes another sci-fi flick that again pretends to be a lot deeper than it really is with customary nods here and there to 2001.Newsflash: 2001 was made in 68 and still kicks movies like Arrival and Interstellar mercilessly.No way does this awful flick deserve an 8.0.Edit Nov 2019: Just rewatched Arrival 2 and a half years later to see if I had it wrong the first time I watched it. Nope. Arrival still sucks.",1,9,16,7 April 2017
Life," Life: Alien Fans need to get one
","When movie makers have pretty much run out of ideas and every other movie is either a follow up, prequel, sequel, re imagining, 3D version, lego version or what not, movie goers still feel that they're being original by spotting a familiar theme in a movie that's been pointed a billion times already. Personally I never got the fuss over the Alien franchise. I've always found it to be more of an ordinary horror/slasher flick rather than classic sci-fi with plot holes large enough to pilot the Nostromo through. Life has similarities with Alien in certain aspects. While the premise is far more interesting and way more plausible than the Alien franchise, the execution is less so. The characters are weak and undeveloped to the extent that I really didn't care if they lived or died. The hard science was poorly thought out and careless which is inexcusable. And the constant need to have the characters make stupid decisions in order for the story to progress kept preventing me from immersing myself in the movie.Nevertheless, this is still a movie that fans of hard 'sci-fi' will enjoy overall. For those of us who entertain the possibilities of an alien life form being out there, the thought of one being biologically alien to what we know is far more interesting than one that looks like a big lizard with acid for blood.One thing that I definitely find encouraging is that movie makers are now more willing to ditch the 'Hollywood' ending.",8,2,5,5 March 2018
Annihilation," Neither a masterpiece nor a complete disaster
","Movies like these really frustrate me. In fact they infuriate me. In terms or atmoshpere, tone and the subject matter Annihilation is the kind of movie that is rarely released as studios now generally prefer to play safe with dumbed down Popcorn Sci Fi. Hollywood now typically sticks in some action, explosions and a few comic relief gags, tries to appeal to a broad base of viewers and release yet another crummy cookie cutter 'sci fi' movie.I don't mind slow, moody movies especially if they make you think outside of the box and make you uncomfortable. Annihilation definitely fits that bill.Where everything comes apart at the seams is the continuous stupidity shown by nearly all the major characters. It's difficult to really get into a movie when you're exclaiming 'why on earth are they doing that?' for the 50th time the first of which being why on earth were the most unhinged people posible being chosen to confront one of the biggest threats the planet has ever faced?Others have listed the string of stupidities in Annihilation so I won't list them yet again.. All I can say that this was an opportunity to make something really special. It's a shame it didn't happen.Watchhable, but that's about it.",6,1,2,19 June 2019
Moon," They do make movies like this anymore.
","The science fiction Genre is so broad that there really should be sub-genres within it.On the one end you would have Science Action 'Star Wars', 'Independence Day' and 'Avatar' type movies, where there are definitive heroes and villains, space battles, lasers and a general sound and vision extravaganza.On the other end you would have Science Drama movies like '2001', 'Blade Runner', 'The Thirteenth Floor' where the place is slow, the viewer is required to figure the plot out for himself, the action is minimal and heroes and villains are either non existent or interchangeable.'Moon' definitely fits within the latter category. 'Moon' is dark, broody and atmospheric, there is only one main character throughout the entire length of the movie and pace of the movie is extremely slow.Sam Rockwell plays the part of Sam superbly. The effects convey the disconnection and isolation extremely well and the music is minimal and spot-on. The voice of Kevin Spacey for GERTY was rather distracting and I would have preferred a voice that I didn't actually recognise. The plot is reasonably solid and keeps you thinking. To be honest as with most movies nowadays nearly everyone will figure out where the story is going well before the punchline. I think that movie goers have pretty much seen it all.***major spoiler Alert*** Many of those who have pointed out plot holes have not really thought their holes through. The most expensive factor in maintaining a staff presence on the moon is the actual cost of the trip from Earth safely to the Moon. It is THE main reason why we've never been back there since 1972. It is cheaper to send an unmanned probe to Mars than it is sending a manned mission to the Moon. The last mission, Apollo 12 cost $1.5bn. In todays costs you're probably talking $50-100bn per single trip.By comparison, once you've perfected the biological duplication aspects of cloning, the cost of production is negligible. Dolly the sheep didn't cost billions. I'd safely assume that the cost of sending up a module that maintained clones in suspended animation and released them as needed would be negligible by comparison especially being based where there exists a readily available source of electricity.The level of technology shown in the movie would indicate that despite the advanced level of robotics, a human is required on the base to trouble shoot and manage the operations.Another plot hole that keeps coming up on IMDb is why if it is possible to program a memory, is it not possible to program a clone to simply perform its duties without question. Again this plot hole coming from so-called sci-fi buffs defies logic. A clone is still an intelligent human being and you cannot program a human being without that human being then questioning their programming. It is far easier to give a human being a purpose and a reason for doing something than to command it to do something as with NLP, hypnosis and brainwashing.My guess is that the original Sam was sent to the lunar base for the first time with his memories being copied before his duties commenced. The corporation then decided to see how long Sam could stay there before cracking up and discovered that 3 years was his limit. They then gave the clones a limit of 3 years and used the recorded messages from Sams wife to simulate the environment for the cloned Sams. Whereas the original Sam was sent back home, the cloned ones were not.As with pretty much all science fiction, you still require a certain suspension of belief. You of course have to accept that it is possible to artificially insert memories. If you really put yourself into the mindset of Sam, the most haunting aspect of the movie really hits home. And that is the realisation that countless Sams will have lived out their 3 year lives in yearning anticipation of going home to their family. To see them climb into the pods expecting to be jettisoned back to earth to then be incinerated was deeply saddening. Not only is Sams life meaningless, he is no more than a product in a line of disposable products.The only real plot hole for me is Gerty. A corporation with so much invested in the project would not allow its programming to be able to sabotage the operation by helping Sam to learn the truth. This is one of the reasons why I'm not giving this movie a 10. The other reason being the bog standard typical Hollywood fairytale ending. The perfect ending for me would have been for the two earlier Sams to die having learned that those on planet earth are well aware and accepting of the disposable status of clones and the situation on the Moon, and for the new Sam to wake up oblivious to what has happened.Sometime hopelessness and the insignificance of our existence in the greater scheme of things is a fact of life that we conveniently forget.The movie itself raises real questions that will need to be answered soon. Technically we are already capable of cloning a human and it is only a matter of time before we do so, if we have not done so already. If a corporation was responsible for bringing a cloned human into existence would it be justified to view that clone as an 'investment' and therefore the property of that corporation? Would the rest of humanity feel threatened by clones and consider them to be sub-human and therefore undeserving of the rights that the rest of us enjoy?",9,1,7,5 November 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Overated, predictable, formulaic, unrealistic heap of cinematic garbage.
","To date there's only one movie I've actually walked out on. SM isn't one of them, but it was a close call.In general I can't stand the over exagerated, over romanticised and over acted movies that come out of Bollywood. In the case of SM all Danny Boyle has done is produced his version of sentimental Bollywood claptrap, and Western audiences and critics lapped it up.SM is boring and predictable and the forced Bollywood sentimentality will have you cringeing from the opening titles to the end credits.",1,1,14,11 November 2019
