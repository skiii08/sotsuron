The Lobster," Worst Movie Ever Made
","This has got to be hands down the worst piece or rubbish I have ever seen.It was cringe worthy how they tried to make it arty but it turned out to be pretentious tripe. Anyone giving it good reviews are just trying to look intelligent as if to say 'Oh yeah I get it' When there really is nothing to get. It was just awful strung together, boring crud.I don't know how they managed to get such good names to sign up to this movie, really that is all it has going for it. I think without the names this movie would not have been seen by anyone. Do yourself a favour and give this one a big miss. By the way I do like indie movies and i do like art house movies, I am not some philistine who doesn't appreciate good art and fringe cinema, but this was truly bad.",1,74,132,17 December 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," They can't make comedies anymore.
","I don't know what it is but I call it the Family Guy and Ricky Gervais effect. People try to act and sound like the Family Guy characters or in the UK like Ricky Gervais. It is a kind of way they speak, they keep a joke going on too long and add words that don't need to be there for comedy affect. They talk over each other because they think it looks 'more authentic' as in the way real people speak. Pitch Perfect 2 being a perfect example of this. Comedy now is just a cringe fest. It is not funny at all. If you look at comedies pre 2008 they are some great really funny, well done classic comedies. I wish that Family Guy had never happened because it has single handedly destroyed comedy, even The Simpsons try to copy it and it is the worst, most un-funniest show that has ever been on TV.",1,13,41,18 June 2016
