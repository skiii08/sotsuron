Blade Runner 2049," Exhausting
","That Ridley Scott had anything to do with this is a surprise. The music: what music?The sound effects? Every bump and nose wipe was a 10 on the theater sound system Richter scale. A little subtlety would go a long way in improving every aspect of the effects. A good story? Please.The interminable 'dramatic' hold scene?. Good grief. They made up half the screen time.The story? It's finally revealed in the last half hour as a remake of the Da Vinci Code. And poorly. Sorry guys. How this got an IMDb rating of 8.7 on day one is as big a mystery as, well, anything in the last 8 months of life in the USA. Yuk.",1,69,149,6 October 2017
