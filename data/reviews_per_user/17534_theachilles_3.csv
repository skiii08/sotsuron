Lucky Number Slevin," Average
","I have no doubt that the filmmakers had great expectations about their creation. They may have thought they were delivering a new 'Pulp Fiction'. And I'm not making just a random reference here, since 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a classic example of the disaster Tarantino's success has brought in cinema. Every year, dozens young filmmakers come out with a straight recipe of copying the Tarantino's filmic universe (that is, if we accept the existence of such a universe after a very short  so far- career of the man). However, in this particular film we shouldn't blame only the director, Paul McGuigan, who had after all warned us for his limited potentialities since his previous film 'Wicker Park', where one could easily see the absence of a personal style and his tendency in stumbling in front of weak choices from the scriptwriter. Once again, a great deal of responsibility for this hollow film should be 'recognized' to Jason Smilovic, who wrote the screenplay. When Tarantino made the choice of using everyday dialogue and scenes that until the dawn of the 90's the rest filmmakers would leave out without any second thoughts, he made it with a certainty. The certainty that was given to him, first of all from his wide ranged knowledge on cinema, and also from his contact with literature  more particularly with contemporary American novels from which he has borrowed his famous narrative techniques and devices. And this fertile dialogue of mediums, combined with Tarantino's intelligence, created a very distinctive signature, both on the grounds of subject and style. And 'Lucky Number Slevin' lacks all these. Someone could argue that McGuigan also starts a dialogue with cinema - Tarantino's cinema. But it's more than obvious that he hasn't got neither the talent nor the knowledge needed, so he just copies. The characters speak in between their troubles about their favorite films or about super heroes (sounds familiar?). And when we are presented with original lines, they aren't much superior than this: 'I'm a world class hit-man', Bruce Willis says in one of the worst moments of his career. And that's too bad, because of the excellent cast including Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, who little can do to save this mess. As leading actor, Josh Hartnett who also starred in 'Wicker Park' and who Hollywood systematically promotes with no obvious reason, not even after this film (waiting for 'Black Dahlia' from master Brian DePalma). So, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is indeed a well made film, but one made by craftsmen. But cinema is art, not craft, and more than a hundred years after its birth, it shouldn't feel the need to prove it.",Null,3,7,14 August 2006
Lost in Translation," The Coppolas still delivering the goods?
","A middle-aged actor, with his career in its downs, finds himself in Tokyo for the shootings of an advertisement. There, he'll meet a just-married girl, who left everything back in the States in order to support her photographer husband.It seems as Sofia Coppola is trying to prove from the very beginning of her career that she has far more talents than her famous last name. After the almost autobiographical Suicide Virgins, she comes up with a story that is a model for our era. And this is the era of easy solutions, of emphasizing on body pleasures and on the unconditional expression of feelings. She is dealing with a love story that many people would think that has never existed, just because there weren't any physical proves. But if there's a reason that makes this movie so special, is exactly because it portrays all these things that would never happen in front of our eyes, the things that no one would say, but all of us feel in the inner part of ourselves. Inside one of the most crowded cities of the world, our heroes feel more lonely than ever before. They find on each other the compassion they seek, not just because of the same language, but because they share something deeper. They both are face to face with life's choices. It doesn't matter that she's in the beginning and he's in the middle of the course. The circumstances are the same.Although Coppola is touching perfection as far as the script is concerned, from a directorial point of view she's unable to cover certain weaknesses. In its biggest part, the film is nerveless and the few emotional breakouts of the plot aren't followed with intense scenes. However, these weaknesses are well-hidden thanks to an astonishing Bill Murray. The way he combines a psychotic comic personality and a gloomy tragic character in the same role is admirable. Johansson also shows that she has a lot to give in acting, as long as she continues with the series of great choices that has so far made.Lost In Translation, without coming up to the unprecedented reaction that the movie spawned to critics all over the world as it ain't The motion picture event, it can easily excite the viewers with its melancholy, humour and lyricism.",6,0,1,12 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Here comes the bride
","Quentin's back after a long long time. And he delivers the good. This time the story is quite simpler. So what's all the buzz? The film is so directed. Shattered narration, black and white sequences, animation scenes! This time is the action that plays the ball and not the dialogues. And Quentin did it again. With an incredible soundtrack and astonishing performances by all the actors, KILL BILL is a masterpiece that MUST be seen. Follow the bride to her roaring rampage.",10,0,1,24 January 2004
