Black Swan," Black Swan: Not Just For Ballerinas
","Black Swan is just another example of burgeoning director, Darren Aronofsky, flexing his muscles to prove that he is the king of getting in to the eager viewer's head and sending them on an experience that transcends the screen.Black Swan tells the story of the dedicated ballerina, Nina Sayer (Natalie Portman), as she is given the lead role in an avant-garde version of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. In Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel), the ballet's director, version of the classic ballet the role of the Swan Queen is divided in to two parts, the White Swan and the Black Swan, that are to be played by the same ballerina.In the eyes of Thomas, Nina is the perfect candidate for the White Swan. She is sweet, innocent, and unexposed to the world of temptations around her. Where her skill and devotion to the art of ballet do not help her is in the case of the Black Swan. Thomas makes aggressive sexual passes at Nina, kissing her against her will and telling her to touch herself just to see how being bad feels are simply the beginning of his attempts to prepare her for a part that requires charged passion above ability.Slowly, as Nina becomes more engrossed in her attempts to become the ideal candidate for the part of the Swan Queen, she loses her mind. Between her over-bearing ex-ballerina of a mother (Barbara Hershey) and the other dancer vying for her position (or is she?), Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina is thrown in a world much darker than the role requires.The beauty of this film is based in its ability to get at the viewer. The idea of who is the 'good guy' and who is the 'bad guy' is constantly being challenged and blurred until the lines are indistinguishable by those both in the movie and those watching from afar.The film brilliantly mimics what Thomas is trying to accomplish in the ballet itself. Rather than the parts being clear-cut and easy to see, it requires a sharper eye to realize who is playing a certain role at any given moment. Basically, guessing and anticipating is the name of the game and the only way to play is to stay pinned to the back of your seat with every passing moment.After having seen this film I am only inclined to see it again and again. I do not have beyond a shade of doubt that every time I see it I will experience something new as a result of its depth and brilliance of story telling.The last Big Five (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Screenplay) winner at the Oscars was the Silence of the Lambs in 1992. I have no problem predicting that this film might just take all five of them.Good work Mr. Aronofsky. Good work.For more see:http://pocketwatches-e.blogspot.com/",10,10,21,12 December 2010
