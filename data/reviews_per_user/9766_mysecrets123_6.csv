The Expendables 2," Stallone did it again, but with more gun fire and hilarious dialog
","This movie was on my must see list and I finally saw it. This review will contain some spoilers so please beware before you start reading this review. I will keep the the spoilers as minimum as possible. Unlike the first movie, this movie, Expandables 2, starts with a bang. The movie contains much more action shots than the first one. I am sad that Mickey Rourke didn't make an appears again in this movie. The same team is back on a task that goes wrong, of course and now it's personal. I do not know was is my movie theater but the picture was a bit 'grannie' it seemed like an old classic from the 80s. Van Damme out did himself in this movie, unlike his other action movies he did a good job acting. You can see the the boys are aging but when you start watching all that 'old classic 80s action movie' genre that I do believe Stallone revitalized , you get hit with childhood memories and figure out how much I missed those macho action movies. The movie is filled with numerous action scenes and many entertaining lines. Chuck Norris entered the movie like only Chuck would, legendary! The whole movie in general was a blast, the dialogs were short and hilarious, reminded me of the 80s action movie dialogs. I can't wait for the Expandables 3. This is a must have collectible for anyone that loves old classic action movies. Stallone did it again! Thank you!",Null,3,16,17 August 2012
World War Z," Excellent zombie movie more than I expected
","I gave this movie a high rating since I am a zombie movie lover. This review will contain spoilers so please skip it if you want to avoid any spoilers. The movie starts off with a bang and gets to the point in minutes. The only thing that I really didn't like about the movie, were the sprinter zombies which I am not a fan of. Seeing that zombies get some mysterious super speed that no human has is kind of ridiculous but acceptable in this movie because it makes the movie a whole lot more intense. Overall Brad did a great job with his acting in the movie as did the other actors. I really liked how the movie developed and how one of the doctors at the beginning of the movie, which I though was going to be one of the main characters, died off in seconds. The movie was killing off characters quite fast (not the main ones of course but rather secondary roles). I really enjoyed the zombie airplane scene since it was really intense. Overall the movie was very intense from the start and ended in that matter where I was able to catch my breath and go home without fearing a heart attack. The ending also leaves room for part 2 what I would like to see one day. If you like action movies and zombie (and Brad Pitt) then this will be a very enjoyable action, triller, horror movie.",Null,9,24,22 June 2013
The Expendables," Thank you Silvester Stallone for yet another great movie... please keep them coming
","First of all I cannot believe that someone would rate this movie anything else but 10/10 stars. If you grew up in the 80's and you loved action movies your going to love this movie. Lately, all of the movies that Stallone produces are amazing. I loved what he did with Rocky and Rambo... Honestly I didn't expect anything else from this movie. I was so impressed with the movie that whenever my boyfriend was trying to talk to me in the movies I wouldn't register him. Why to watch this movie? Well the actors are all well known for acting in action movies. Most of them had similar characters as they did in previous action movies. Second, the editing was amazing, full of tension and action that a chick has got to love. There were many positive messages in the movie, like Stallone has left is Rocky and in Rambo.There were many funny moments and scenes in the movie. The action is amazing, full of typical 80's action scenes. I just got out of the movie theater and had to write a review. I want to thank Stallone for making this wonderful action filled movie and I am just hoping that he makes another one soon. Please bring back Old school action movies and actors that I grew up with... I miss watching old school action (warrior) actors.",Null,2,8,20 August 2010
Gran Torino," Absolutely amazing
","I loved this movie. I really won't say anything about it. When I saw the trailer I though it might be a dark and heavy movie, but I was amazed how positive and fantastic this movie is this movie is a MUST SEE!!!!! I loved how he made a modern cowboy version and showed what happened to America how it became a dangerous place over night, how kids are out of control these days and that the good kids are the odd ones today. there are so many messages in the movie that are very positive and that are showing the harsh reality. I was expecting a different ending and I was in tears in the end. I really felt so sorry for his dog. Again this is a MUST SEE LOVED IT",Null,1,7,30 April 2009
Avatar," I was blown away
","This is the most astonishing movie I have ever seen. First word I heard leaving the theater was 'amazing!' No doubt about it.I won't discuss the plot,but the plot is good, nothing can match the special effects of the 3-D.Here's the least you need to know:<ul><li>It is 'new age' all the way. It's all about 'we are all one with nature'.</li></ul><ul><li>It's a long movie, about 3 hours to be precise. Be sure you have your snack in hand and your 'business' taken care of, just in case you don't have a 15 min break like I did. </li></ul><ul><li>Sexuality was not much of an issue, the only thing remotely sexual was the 'hair-bonding' ritual.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending was predictable from the start, but again an extremely enjoyable movie.</li></ul><ul><li>Finally, the special effects were amazing. This you got to see in 3-D!!! You'll feel as if you are IN the movie after a few minutes. You'll be reaching for the floating jellyfish(tree seeds), dodging the flying dragon-birds...etc. I was so impressed that I felt as if it was all happening in front of my own eyes. I do not recommend watching this movie in 2-D. I believe that this movie was made to be viewed in 3-D. </li></ul><ul><li>The movie is not only a movie but it will open your mind and make you reflect on your life. As I wrote earlier it's kinda 'new age vs modern world view'. </li></ul>I truly hope that you enjoy the movie. I know that I did. 3-D is a must !!! just a few extra bucks, believe me you won't regret it. the only thing that makes me sad :( is that I have to wait until late 2010 to buy the 3-D bluray. enjoy :)",Null,14,22,27 December 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonard DiCaprio gives stellar performance
","Wolf of wall street like any other movie based on true events was totally blow out of proportion. Even though the movie was filled with funny and very entertaining moments the film in my personal opinion was killed with the over the top explicit and borderline pornographic scenes.This is why I gave this movie a much lower rating. I came to watch a movie, not a movie without these kind of explicit 'party scenes'. Leonard DiCaprio gave a stellar performance and Scorsese made a fabulous film. I just think that they went a bit too overboard with the length of the movie. The movie was way too long, 3 hours was pushing it. It was a movie that shouldn't have been longer than 2 hours. Totally lost one hour of my life since they were filled with pointless party scenes or something similar. I got the point of the way they partied based on the first one. In the end after 2 hours, I totally lost interest and couldn't wait for it to end. The party scenes were way too many and over the top, shocked they didn't show someone getting a heart attack. I did like how the movie started and ended, gave the movie a head and a tail and made sense as to why it started the way it started. They needed to be a bit toned down, it made me think how far apart were erotica films and normal cinematic films. I would like to cite a sentence from Tropic Thunder 'never go full retard' I feel like the movie at moments went 'full retard' Great movie worth the watch but too long and over the top party scenes.",Null,3,8,28 December 2013
