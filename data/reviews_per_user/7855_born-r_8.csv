The Avengers," A excellent action Movie, with all we expected from the Superheroes in it
","'The Avengers' (2012) is the newest film from Marvel Studios / Disney Studios with the classic superheroes, directed by Joss Whedon (from TV series 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer') and starring multiple characters from other movies, together, for the first time: Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury).The film follows the ending hook given after the credits of 'Thor' in 2011 (just a note, there is also one in this movie, but before the credits, for a sequence of Avengers), with the cube Tesseract of 'Captain America' ​​(2011) being in the hands of SHIELD that analyzes it, and Loki ('Thor') being the main villain who seeks it, and that is brought to Earth by its activation, so that with the help of a mysterious ally and his inter-dimensional army he cans conquer and actually dominate the Earth as a ruler.Due to these growing threats in the story, SHIELD active the plan from a team of superheroes, The Avengers, with the heroes mentioned above to help prevent the plans of Loki.Visually the film is one of Marvel's most well made, with action scenes to the level of Iron Man, but more intense: the downsides of characters of other films, that were not as successful as 'Thor' and 'Hulk' were corrected here, and the characters have greater expression.Of course, in terms of special effects there is nothing wrong - the scenes are very intense and uses it very well, and are impressive in some parts, as well as the fight sequences between the characters.Musically I am without criticism, as all the movies from Marvel the orchestrated soundtrack fits perfectly with the action - the same can be said of the sound effects used in the film.The performances are excellent, each character is significant in themselves in the story, and their different personalities are displayed perfectly, even in characters without much impact on earlier movies.The differences in personalities secured a good laugh as well as some comic lines and scenes. Thus, the entire cast came to life - even Loki, in the role of the 'eternal loser'.And tell by the way, I thought that no character has been erased by the presence of another, despite the stronger personality in the movie, of Tony Stark to be the most striking.The story itself is not worthy of an Oscar for best screenplay, but this is not the intention of the film - but the fun is, remember that this is the basic reason to watch movies, and at this point it beat my expectations, being almost as good as 'X-Men: First Class.'One of the constant criticism that I have seen is about the main villain Loki, said to be too weak for the role: I think he fits the role allocated to him, as is evident through the story itself, the comic lines and the bonus credits hook - I think a greater villain is reserved for the sequel.In short: it is a great action movie, with a solid script for the style, with excellent performances and visual effects - and it is what you want when you go to watch something in Cinemas, looking for fun pure and simple.It serves as a reminder because every year we expect so much to see the upcoming movie from Marvel / DC Comics ... My score: 9.0 / 10.0.",9,1,4,6 May 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Movie Mixture of History / Terror, with Nice Effects but Regular Story
","This film is based on a novel (which by the way has a different ending), and shows Abraham Lincoln, in an alternate world where he loses his mother to vampires, and fight against them in his revenge and eventually in a Civil War, where the South uses them as secret weapon. The script is mildly interesting and use historical facts, that were changed or omitted (eg the 4 children of Lincoln does not exist here), admixed with the central plot - the acting is good, but nothing worth of an Oscar. The most prominent and attractive feature is the photography of the movie that uses some cool effects (Matrix style) and color contrasts that are very interesting in several scenes. But there again: any script of other era with vampires would be cool anyway - the way the inspiration in Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice is more than obvious to me ... uncompromising, is a good fun action movie, but a poor movie overall in other aspects. Another advise: if you will watch it in normal LED / LCD / Plasmas Television the image is very good, but you see int he scenes that it was made to watch in 3D televisions. Rating: 6.5 / 10.0.",6,0,0,9 December 2012
Underworld Awakening," A letdown in the Underworld Saga
","I am a fan of the series: in this movie, the focus of the story shifts a little - the humans has discovered the other 2 'new' species, and begin to purge from Earth both Vampires and Lycans. Selene and Michael attempt to escape, but are captured: 12 years latter, Selen awakes in a cryo chamber (Subject 1), in a research facility, and sees another chamber, the Subject 2, believing this is Micheals one - only to discover latter that in this chamber, was a Hybrid 12 years child, her daughter, that is being pursued by surviving Lycans... the rest of the story gets around this: has a lot of action, but a think the focus is too narrow, only in this event, and the movies ends with a direct hook to a 5th movie. Its a enjoyable sequence, filled with action, but I think it's the poorer one. My score: 5,0 / 10,0.",5,3,4,25 March 2012
The Bourne Legacy," A New Trilogy Beggins, without Matt Damon?
","Another film, based (loosely) on the books, but without Jason Bourne (Matt Damon would make this movie, but as they exchanged the director, who was to be the one of the original trilogy, he refused). Basically the film deals with events that occur parallel to those occurring in The Bourne Ultimatum, where the Program Outcome, on which super-agents are created with chemical and genetic changes are eliminated one by one - the protagonist this time is Aaron Cross, trying to survive, helping a project scientist, persecuted in the files burning. The film is a little slow in the start, but half an hour from the start , we have more action: the action, though not as engaging as the original movies is very good, but the dense and catchy plot that held the original trilogy is lost in this side-story, that still leaves a hook for more sequences. Worth as it is a good action movie, but I gave it a 6,0 score because of the discontinuity in this spin-off of the original trilogy (which I loved).",6,0,1,8 December 2012
In Time," Nice starting plot, bad unfolding story
","'In Time' is a 2011 film directed and written by Andrel Nicoll, and which stars Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried in the lead roles.The story is about a dystopian future where people live to 25 years, stopping the aging process by this age, but that is the limit age of life and they may live only another year after that. When they turn 25, by some means of biotechnology, a fluorescent green marker appears on the right wrist, that shows the remaining lifetime. In this future (which is similar in part to our own world), instead of money, the exchange of lifetime between the people is used to buy things, pay salaries and everything else.There are a kind of police in this future, called Time Guardians who control everything, and investigate cases of theft of time: this is necessary, for the world and cities (in case a version of Los Angeles), are divided by time zones, which divide the poor citizens of the rich (and the amount of lifetime determines this).Will Salas (Justin) is a resident of the city's poorest area, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde), and is always a altruistic person, giving time of life for those in need, remaining with 24 hours - he ends up meeting a stranger in a bar, with more than a century of life, which passes to him his lifetime... from these point and other events, the story unfolds.Raymond's mother dies and he wants revenge for it, going to the richest district, to try to change the system, where he get to know Sylvia Weiss (Amanda) - but the claims of life gained by him are being investigated, and he is suspected of murder and chased by Raymond Leon (Gillian Murphy).The film presents an interesting approach to the plot, which has appeared in other films by the way, but the future of this film is different: it is interesting to see how everything has a price advertising that is marked in minutes or hours instead of money, a very nice feature that the production did well.The rest of the movie is set in suburban neighborhoods and some locations in the center, with large buildings, but everything else has a 'clean' and artificial look - the vehicles of the future, are modernized versions of classic cars like Mustangs and Shelby Cobras. Also the streets are generally very empty, and is even stranger in a dystopia future.The acting in the movie is very good, but only by the protagonists.The great problem of the movie is that from two-fifths of it forward, the story fades, and begins not have much logic basis, dealing only with the consequence of the initial events, without other repercussions, in addition, the 'Bone and Clyde' duet that main actors become do not have much logic... for example, banks in the future has no security at all?Anyway, the movie contains an interesting plot in the beginning that promised a interesting movie, but it dissipates during it, which is partially saved by the performance of Justin Timberlake. I finished the movie disappointed, hoping that would have been different in the way it was conducted. My score: 5.5 / 10.0.",6,0,0,18 April 2012
Inception," A Masterpiece from Nolan
","'Inception' (Legendary/ Warner, 2010) is a fictional film/psychological thriller, which also encompasses the theme of Heist, and which was nominated for several awards at the time of release, being written and directed by one of my favorite directors, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dunkirk, Dark Knight, Interstellar, Insomnia). The story is about a mercenary (Don Cobb - who have a traumatic past) and his team who designs and extracts secrets from the subconscious of people during the team-created dreams, infiltrating themselves through a device and sedation. In a last job offered, the mission will be different - implanting an idea in the head of an heir of a gigantic company, and it will not be easy this time.The script develops within Nolan's complex style, which require a little more than just watching the film, but rather to understand it, having several background details that are revealed as the film passes, and with a plot that evolves to the end with an upward curve in the action and drama within the film. The events and mystery in the tragedy of the protagonist life has a fundamental role and even echoes in the very end of the film, in the last scene. The film was highly acclaimed and awarded at the time, including an Oscar for cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects, and was also nominated for best picture, screenplay (both went to The King's Speech in the Oscar s edition), art direction and original musical score.The cinematography has a Noir style, performed by Wally Pfister (who has worked with Nolan on other films such as Dark Knight, Prestige, Insomnia), an ultra-talented professional, who uses perfect angles in the scenes and sequences, with a good use of shades differentials in every situation and dream sequences. Each one have it own style, and in one of the sequences that takes place within a layered dream, the environment ends up spinning within reality, and being a cinematographer adept of naturalism (i.e. what one can do without effects in CG, he tries to do, which gives an additional emphasis on the quality of the production) the team used the same technique Kubrick used to simulate the zero gravity sequences in a 2001: A Space Odyssey. The locations were filmed in various locations, such as Morocco, NY, England, France and Los Angeles and were filmed in 35mmm anamorphic format (which expands the field of view and captures things that would be outside the angle of normal view) and also in 65mm in key sequences.Lora Hirschberg's award-winning sound effects and visuals by Chris Corbould, Andrew Lockley, Pete Bebb are also perfect and impress and immerse people in the film. The music track is by Hans Zimmer (Interstellar, Lion King, Gladiator), who doesn't even need to comments on the references to his excellent work. In the cast, also outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Looper), Ellen Page (Juno, X-Men, Umbrella Academy), Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai, Godzilla).The movie is for me another milestone on the cinema, being smart, with top-notch photography, music, effects and sequences allied to a great background story with very good performances. It is for sure a classic to all those who like intelligent fiction movies.",9,1,2,15 March 2020
The Woman in Black," A Gothic Ghost and Haunting Story, with Daniel Radcliffe
","'The Woman in Black' (2012) is a Gothic suspense-horror thriller, directed by James Watkins (writer and director of Eden Lake), that passes in the early twentieth century, in England: it is the story of a lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), who lost his women in the birth of his boy, now age 7, and that are depressed ever since.After the death of an elderly woman who owned a secluded mansion in the middle of a marsh, in a rural English town, he has the job to arrange the paperwork, in order to sell the house and moves there to deal with it.From here begins the story that unfolds from the occurrence of sinister events, and the villagers strange reactions, who fear a superstition that curses the village.The film is well done, visually, has a sad and gloomy, dark atmosphere typical of Gothic-themed movies. There's no abuse of special effects or blood, and the film relies more on the atmosphere of suspense, until the end of the movie.I just noticed a inconsistency in the filming, when two characters are driving, in a open car, and the hair of the characters do not move - after that I noticed no other gross errors.The music, which only appears discrete and pertinently, and the sound effects are good, and helps to compose the general atmosphere.What stands out in this movie is the performance of Radcliffe, beginning to get off of his eternal role of Harry Potter: his acting in the movie are very good.The main story unfolds gradually as the secrets of the house, the legend and its ghosts are explained until the end of a film that follows and the Gothic style ending.Just as a note, the film is based on the book by Susan Hill, written in 1982, which has the same name, and has the same story, but with modifications in the sequence of events and the ending.Overall is a good movie to pass the time, being a good classic tale of Gothic horror-thriller, related to ghosts and haunting, but nothing that really stands out among the many films that exist.My score: 6.8 / 10.0.",7,0,1,5 May 2012
Looper," Great Sci-Fi Movie with a Intelligent Story
","Great Sci-Fi movie, in a dystopian near future (2044) where in the future of this future criminals are sent to be killed and theirs bodies dispatched in the past (the present one, where the film begins) through a time machine, which is banned in the future and is considered illegal. The executioners are called Loopers, and receive payments in silver bars, attached in the victims bodies.Everything is well, until the Loopers start having completed their cycles (ie 30 years after, they are sent from the future to be killed, and so the evidences about the crimes are gone), in a increasing frequency...The film uses almost no special effects, has several action scenes, and the film sets use suburban environments, with the classic future of marginalized people, and vehicles in most scenes that have implementations, but are our current ones with low-cost technologies, with a nice retro look. Some devices in the movie are nice future versions of the ones we have, like glass-like cellphones and holographic computers.The performances are very good, especially for a boy who appears later in the film (Pierce Gagnon, only 05 years old), and that surprise yourself! The other performances are good, especially of Bruce Willis, but the protagonist, Joseph Gordon-Levitt I didn't found so good, perhaps because he was trying to imitate the way Bruce Willis is acting (of his version of 30 years in the future).The script is very interesting and has some twists and scenes in the future that explain the past and vice versa, but nothing as complex in Inception or Memento - from the middle of the movie things start to be interesting and the film's ending is very surprising and interesting.Briefly is a great sci-fi, with a very smart script and solid performances in a credible future. One of the best films of the year 2012 in the genre in my opinion. Rating: 8.5 / 10.0.",8,1,4,6 January 2013
