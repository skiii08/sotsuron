Vertigo," Now I Know Vertigo Feels Like!
","Vertigo is one of the more complicated movies I have ever seen, and just trying to think about what exactly is happening was enough to make my head spin in opposite directions, and I mostly mean that as a compliment. It just shows what a competent movie director Alfred Hitchcock made. There are many things happening in the movie, so you will have to pay attention to keep up with what is going on. It took me two grasps to understand the basics of the plot. Kudos to Hitchcock in creating a movie that effectively employs plot twists and turns to keep the movie audience guessing.So in a way. this thriller could be about Hitchcock himself and the way he handles women in his movies. Hitchcock is famous for his control over the production, especially when it comes to his movies. They all have the same qualities in his films, and thus end up looking foolish. Vertigo is one of his best films, because he spoofs himself in away. The men in the movie, especially the main character Scottie Ferguson, treats the women rather in a disrespectful, obsessive way. It shows how men can become obsessive over things they can't have, especially the women.As it is with many Hitchcock films, they are all technically impressive. A big part of the film is the term 'vertigo' itself. By definition, vertigo is essentially being afraid of heights. Scottie's backstory is explained in the beginning, and part of it shows why he was afraid of heights after going through a rooftop chase and almost falling off a roof. The way his vertigo explained was actually quite frightening. Seeing the shots from ground to sky as the camera moves away from the ground made his fear even more realistic.So what is this film all about? Well, Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) is a former detective who is retired because of his paranoia with heights. One day, a former colleague named Gavin (Tom Helmore) approaches Scottie with a request to follow his wife around, Madeleine (Kim Novak) because he fears she was possessed by a dead person. Scottie reluctantly agrees to do so. During his investigation, Scottie begins to fall in love with her. But due to a tragic accident, Madeleine dies. Soon thereafter, Scottie meets another woman named Judy (also played by Kim Novak), who uncannily looks similar to the deceased Madeleine. Scottie begins to grow obsessed with her and he eventually tries to groom her into a mirror image of Madeleine. Doing so helps begin what is a shocking climax perhaps resulting in a murder conspiracy.This film is very much well-acted. James Stewart is one of Hollywood's 'Golden Age' stars and he delivers a magnificent performance. He made his fear of heights very believable and his growing obsession in the latter part of the film was incredible to watch, even though he was a treating a woman a way a man should never treat a woman-through compulsive obsession. He treated Judy like an object, and in a sense mirrors Hitchcock's reality. Kim Novak delivered a convincing performance in her roles as Madeleine and Judy. She's blond, icy, and often humiliated-very normal in a Hitchcock thriller. But without spoiling anything, Judy and Madeleine are two characters who are closely related and Novak was able to play both of the roles effectively.Overall, Vertigo is a very strong Hitchcock thriller. It's undeniably scary and creepy, with Hitchcock excels at making his films be. The beginning is very effectively scary, as we are introduced to Scottie's vertigo. His obsession towards the women was also creepy, but at the same time, puts you to the edge of your seat making you wonder what will happen next. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is a shocker and its something you won't see coming thanks to the masterful direction of Hitchcock and wonderful, convincing performances from Stewart and Novak. The plot twists and turns when you least expect it, so be prepared to bring your mind to the film. You'll need it.My Grade: A-",9,2,3,10 January 2016
Scarface," Watch Al Pacino In All His Glory!
","'Say hello to my little friend!'You know, when I saw Brian De Palma's gangster epic Scarface for the first time, I hated it. I thought it was a loud, ugly film that is over-the-top in the most gruesome way. As a gangster film, I was also comparing it to The Godfather films which also starred Al Pacino. I guess I did not like that the films are basically the polar opposites within the same genre. Flash forward many years later, I took away my original negative review away because I actually quite liked this film. It became a cult classic and I understand why. The film remains loud and over-the-top, but it's a gritty, dark, violent, and a more realistic take on the Latino gangster world of the 1980's.The film was written by renowned filmmaker/screenwriter, Oliver Stone. Stone allegedly was fighting cocaine abuse at the time which actually made him the perfect writer for the film considering everything he was going through at the time. Those familiar with film history may know of the 1932's Howard Hawks film of the same title, which coincidentally enough was the most violent film ever made at that time. Stone disliked that movie. He wanted to update that film and set it in a more modern time with drugs as the main culprit, not alcohol. Stone's script is a bit excessive in terms of the 'f' word and violence, but Stone was able to give the film plenty of meat for the audience to gnaw on.The film was originally going to be directed by Sidney Lumet. Lumet wanted to blame the current presidential administration for the influx of cocaine in Miami. Producer Martin Bregman disagreed with his statement and booted him of the project. Brian De Palma, coming off 1980's interesting Dressed to Kill, was hired to take Lumet's place. Palma was able to inject his own vision into the story. Along with Stone's script, Palma made the film ultra-violent. When it was time for the MPAA to give the film a rating, it was rated X 3 times before Universal got involved and made enough tweaks to give the film a hard R. I found that interesting because X ratings were usually reserved for pornographic films and little marketing would have been done for the film. In any case, De Palma did a great job directing the film.The film follows the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban gangster who immigrated to Miami during the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Montana felt that the humble work of an immigrant and making little cash is no use for him. Thanks to his friend Manny (Steven Bauer), he took a contract killing which allowed him to gather his green card. Shortly thereafter, he is working for drug lord Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and he brings all sorts of violence into Miami. He is very protective of his younger sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and becomes associated with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), a big drug user herself. Now Tony wants it all and he will do what it takes to get it all. But is he ready to pay the hefty price?Al Pacino gives a delightfully overboard performance. He absolutely owns the character of Tony Montana. His portrayal as the gangster isn't the kind of portrayal where we sympathize with him, but we do get inside his head and understand the motives of his actions. He wants to go to the top, and isn't that really the dream for all of us? He definitely knows how to curse up a storm and how to kill a person in a shocking, violent way. The supporting turns are also excellent. Steven Bauer kills it here as Tony's partner. Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are very watchable and their careers were launched after this film. Pfeiffer is one of the best actresses of her generation, so I was surprised to see that both De Palma and Pacino were ready to pass on her, but Martin Bregman saved her career.There are so many incredible scenes here. The film has a basis in history, so I actually was able to learn quite a few things about the Cuban immigration to America and how Fidel Castro used this opportunity to send his prisoners, like Montana, over to the states as a price of revenge. Keep in mind that violence and blood are here throughout. There is a shocking scene involving a chainsaw. The final shootdown, where the film's well-known line of dialogue is said, is also crazy fun to watch. There are also some moments of levity. I like when Tony Montana is trying to bluff his way through customs in Florida.Scarface is one of the more realistic gangster portrayals you'll find. I mean its raw, gritty, and violent-just like it was in the real world. Maybe the technical aspects cannot reach the levels of the Godfather films, but maybe it doesn't have to. Some folks believe the film also has a cheesy 80's feel, but maybe you could blame Giorgio Moroder's awesome synth score. While the film was initially disliked upon original release, it regained popularity over time and people generally call it a classic. That is the same way it went for me; dislike upon first viewing but grew to like it eventually. This movie also shows why Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors. He is the MAN! It's near three hours long, so be prepared for it.My Grade: B+",8,0,0,1 April 2020
Gremlins," Gremlins is Funny, Scary, and Most Importantly...Entertaining!
","1984's Gremlins is one messed up movie...and I am all down for it. The movie came out at a time where it was acceptable to blend the genres of horror and comedy. In fact, it came out the same weekend as the very popular Ghostbusters. Which did the same exact thing, but perhaps a little less scary than Gremlins. The film itself infuses a nice mixture of comedy and horror and it really is a fun movie. There are several grotesque moments, but this film is my childhood and it might be the one film to show your child when introducing the genre of horror.Can you believe that Joe Dante's film is rated PG? Creatures being blown up in a microwave, these gremlins looking like the monster from Alien, a really sad story about why Kate, one of the characters despises Christmas, and so forth. Along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, this movie inspired the PG-13 rating which we would see in a few months. There have been stories where parents walked out of the theater with their 4-year-old child because the film was marketed as a cute, cuddly movie in the vein of E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. Despite the involvement of Steven Spielberg in both projects (he executive-produced this film), this movie is NO E.T.I was very surprised to see the movie get a June release date considering the film is set at Christmas. It could have been a factor in the film's success, but it ultimately was the fourth-highest film of 1984. This movie was widely accepted by the audiences, and Joe Dante did a great job combining different genres. I laughed often, but I was also terrified at times. The movie is really scary in certain parts. The creatures themselves added to the scariness. Gizmo himself is a mixture of Yoda and a kitten and is super cuddly, but Stripes and his gang make the creature from Alien seem like a super cute puppy. The creature designs are excellent. Practical effects are good modern-day films, huh?Inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is in New York and he wanted to buy a gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) before he leaves. He stops is a mysterious Chinatown shop where he encounters a Mogwai, that very cute creature. He is told of three rules: avoid bright light, do not give him water, and never, ever feed him after midnight no matter how much he begs. Billy falls in love with his new pet, named Gizmo. Over time, Billy breaks these rules, which causes the birth of the mean-spirited Stripes. Stripes and his mischievous, evil gremlin pals are ready to show the Norman Rockwell lookalike town some very crazy moments.I wouldn't say the acting is the best part of the film, but the performances are good enough. Zach Galligan, who was unknown at the time, had some good chemistry with Phoebe Cates who plays his girlfriend, Kate. Spielberg wasn't sure about Cates because she was known for playing risquÃ© roles such as that in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but she was impressive. The supporting cast were well-known veteran actors all who gave respectful performances; Dick Miller, Polly Holliday, Hoyt Axton, and Judge Reinhold. Then there is young Corey Feldman. Feldman mainly acted in commercials at the time, so this role boosted his child star status and he did a great job.Gremlin's music was composed by Jerry Goldsmith who is familiar with the world of horror/sci-fi. The music is instantly recognizable, especially the Gremlins March. His music sounded so playful, but at the same time sounded tense. The film has the looks of a Norman Rockwell painting. The beautiful small-town look...that was destroyed by the gremlins. John Hora did a good job giving us the looks of the town before and after the destruction. Dante did a great job directing the film. He preferred the film's sequel, but I think he still did a great job. Spielberg was originally going to direct the script, which was written by Chris Columbus, but he ultimately gave the directing duties to Dante.Keep in mind that there are some really dark scenes. The Christmas explanation by Kate was based on an urban legend and was quite controversial. Warner Brothers actually wanted that scene cut, but Dante wanted to keep that scene in. Of course, the second half of the film is based on the destruction by the Gremlins and there is A LOT of it. Also, children, please do not microwave your pets. While not the greatest horror-comedy, the film is a minor classic. I think this is a Christmas film despite its June release date, so give this film a watch...if you dare!My Grade: B+",8,0,1,1 May 2020
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Joy!
","Who said that schmaltz was such a bad thing? In the world of film, too much of schmaltz or saccharine is often viewed in a negative light. In 1965's The Sound of Music, the film is practically running with sentimental/saccharine feelings.....and I love the movie every bit for that. This movie is viewed as the best musical of all time, and I can agree to that statement. The word that can describe the movie is joy. From the moment Julie Andrews popped on screen, waving her arms in the air against the beautiful mountain background and beginning the title song, a smile creeped upon my face and it stayed there for two hours and fifty-two minutes. The joy is infectious and each character has a sense of happiness despite the Nazis lurking in the background. This is the type of musical you'll remember forever. I saw this movie once as a child and twenty years later, was able to sing along to such joyful songs like 'Do-Re-Mi', 'My Favorite Things,' 'Edelweiss', 'So Long, Farewell,' and of course, 'The Sound of Music.' With all these songs, composed by the brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein, the movie moved with a brisk pace despite the running time and left an imprint on all musicals to come.The movie is loosely based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp, and I emphasize the word loosely. Many historical facts were changed for dramatic purposes and director Robert Wise made a trip to see Maria to tell her this movie is not a biography and will be the better for it. From the memoir that was published in 1949, the famed Broadway show opened in 1959 and ran for three and a half years being a huge hit with fans and critics alike. Ernest Lehman was hired to write the screenplay, Robert Wise to direct, and the rest is history. Some may find Lehman's script to be compared with dripping maple syrup from the Vermont woods or Wise's direction to be corny, but I think they were perfect for the film.In 1930's Austria before the onset of Anchluss, there is a young woman named Maria (Julie Andrews) who works as a nun but is clearly not the type of woman for that profession. A Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) seeks a governess to care for his seven children. Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) convinces Maria to take the job. Von Trapp runs a tight ship and the children show their unhappiness by driving away their previous governesses. However, Maria is able to warm up to the children by showing them love and the joy of music. More to that, Georg and Maria begin to fall for each other despite the postulant nature of Maria's and Georg's engagement to a baroness (Eleanor Parker). But world events may soon run its course. Nazi Germany is about to annex Austria and Von Trapp may be needed to commandeer the German Navy's ships.The joy shown throughout the film is seen through the performances of nearly every character. If you thought Julie Andrews signature role was 1964's Mary Poppins, guess again. She was fantastic in that movie and that magical role is what gave her this role as Maria, but really transcends herself. From the start to finish, you are in complete awe of her. The joy she brings to Maria and her voice is powerful. I said many good things about Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago, but I think Andrews should have won on second watch. Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is also great. He was a veteran Broadway performer, but his performance as Georg Von Trapp introduced him to the world of movies. The seven Von Trapp children were all surprisingly good, although it's a shame none of them would go on to have distinguished or lengthy careers, but at least we have them to remember with these iconic roles. My favorite child is the eldest child, Liesel played wonderfully by Charmaine Carr. She brought a realistic vibe of finding love. Just listen to her beautiful rendition of 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen.'I was really impressed with The Sound of Music. It impressed audiences in 1965, and it still impresses people in 2018. In the world of negativity, this is the kind of movie we need. The movie has the ability to put a smile on a person's face through music or through love. Schmaltz is oozing from these songs, but in a great way. All because there is joy to be seen and heard. Julie Andrews is the heart and soul of the movie, and it's her magnificent role that drives the film. In addition to the music, the Austrian views are breathtaking and they also add to the joy of the film. If you like musicals, or films in general, check out The Sound of Music.My Grade: A",9,2,2,23 November 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of My All Time Favorites!
","Steven Spielberg is back, better than ever! After the dismal failure that was 1941, the acclaimed director teamed up with George Lucas, coming off his Star Wars fame to create one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie from 1981 and is in my top 20 films of all time. This movie gives everything you could ask for. Strong, memorable characters, witty dialogue, fantastic set pieces, exotic locations, great action, and a John Williams musical theme you could never forget. Indiana Jones is my favorite fictional hero and this movie is the example why I believe that.This movie has fascinating origins. George Lucas was writing this movie the same time he came up with the idea for Star Wars. He decided to pursue his space adventure instead to great success. In 1978, while on vacation in Hawaii, he ran into Steven Spielberg, who was coming off Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg expressed his idea of creating a James Bond movie. Lucas showed him his character, which was named Indiana Smith at first, thus creating a collaboration which would lead to this movie and two sequels and a prequel. The film also takes influence from the works of Edgar Burroughs Rice, 1930's serials, and a 1950's comic about a globe-trotting duck named Scrooge McDuck.This movie really has it all. With Spielberg and Lucas at the head, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan joined the project to help polish the script. Together they created memorable heroes in Indiana Jones, an archaeology professor who travels the world to protect or find ancient artifacts and his former girlfriend Marion who is strong female character who is able to protect herself. For villains, we have the horrible Nazis, drunken Sherpas, Frenchmen making alliances with the Nazis, and Jones's favorite animal, snakes! He hates snakes! For locations: we have the sands of Egypt, abandoned submarine bases, the jungles of Peru, the mountains of Tibet, and so forth. If you want a travelling experience from your own living room, look no further than this movie.I was impressed with the plot. The plot is simple and really is a framework for all the impressive action scenes and stunts there are. But in the end, everything is coherent and makes plenty sense. It is the year 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) learns from his good friend, Brody (Denholm Elliot) that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, a golden casket that was used to house the Ten Commandments. It has also been known that this arc is able to give power to those who wield it. Jones's mission? To reach the Ark before the Nazis do. He goes to Tibet to pick up Marion (Karen Allen) who has a medallion that has a secret to the location of the Ark. Together, they head to that location where they will try to beat the Nazis-and scheming Frenchmen at their own game.The performances are all excellent. What is funny that when Spielberg/Lucas did the casting, Spielberg wanted Harrison Ford from the get-go, but Lucas was against his casting because he did not want Ford to be is 'Bobby De Niro' which is in reference to Martin Scorsese always casting Robert De Niro in his films. In retrospect, I do not think anyone could have pulled this role off like Harrison Ford did. Ford was brilliant and created a memorable character with his iconic performance. He is kind and intelligent character, but he can be ruthless at times. However, he is charming. Charm may be the one word that can describe Indiana Jones. I really dug Karen Allen's performance. A strong-willed character with the ability to protect herself. I liked the villainous performances from the slimy Nazis. Paul Freeman as Dr. Rene Belloq as the scheming Frenchman who happens to be Jones's rival, and Ronald Lacey as the incredibly slimy Nazi, Toht.Even in today's cinematic world, the visual effects and the action sequences stand out. I honestly cannot say what I liked the most since everything was so well-done! The opening sequence set forth what to expect in this movie. That boulder chasing Jones is an amazing sequence. That chase scene is great as well, and it makes good use of an old, classic joke! Another sequence that stood out to me is when Jones and Marion are holding on to dear life in the pit of snakes. That was a scene that let you feel real horror. And don't get me started on the face-melting sequences! I am still in awe what the special effects team did with this film.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that spawned a franchise that is still going strong today. Adventure stories with some history mixed in are my kind of stories. I like travelling to these exotic locations through these characters. This film has a unique balance of comedy, action, stunts, and adventure. When Nazis are your villains, this is how they should be used. As slimy creatures that can get their butts handed to them by Indiana Jones.My Grade: A+",10,3,4,2 March 2019
Spartacus," One of Kubrick's Lesser Efforts, But Still.....
","It is really interesting to see why this film, Spartacus was made in the first place. Obviously, historical epics were massively successful during this time period. But this particular film was made as an answer to 1959's Ben-Hur. In fact, it was Kirk Douglas's answer to that movie. Douglas was originally set to star in that movie, but Charlton Heston was cast over Douglas at the last minute, giving Douglas a feeling of bitter resentment. Both films have a very common theme: one man rising against the mighty Roman Empire to fight for their beliefs. I think Ben-Hur is the better film, but there is much to admire about this film.The movie, based off the popular novel by Howard Fast, was written by Dalton Trumbo. Trumbo is a well-known screenwriter, not only for his writing talent but because he was blacklisted because of his associated ties with communism. Kirk Douglas and director Stanley Kubrick stood strong behind their screenwriter and they publicly announced Trumbo wrote their movie, instead of Trumbo hiding behind a pseudonym. I found that to be a very courageous move on the part of Douglas and Kubrick, because that could have easily hurt the movie's chance at the box office. Luckily, the film was a box office smash and was very popular with the critics and the audience alike.This film has a Roman slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) as the film's central character. Spartacus is held at a gladiatorial school ran by the amusing Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). One day, he starts a revolt because he became angered at the notion of fighting to the death for the entertainment of spoiled women. This revolt soon spread all across Italy, where thousands of slaves joined the cause. Their plan was for Silesian pirates to transport them away from Italy to new lands. Meanwhile in Rome, Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) schemes to have the slaves taken down by a Roman garrison. After they failed, his mentor Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) decides to lead his own army against Spartacus's slaves. Now Spartacus must face the might and power of the Roman army.Now compared to other epics of the time, I didn't like this film as much. It's certainly not a bad film, not even close to being so. The problem is the movie is a tad overlong and the story drags at certain moments. Some of the dialogue was cheesy too. By today's standards, the dialogue does not hold up very well and some of the words are laughingly bad. These complaints dragged the movie down, but only to a very small degree.There are many things I did admire about the film. There are plenty of majestic battle sequences and I liked them very much. I loved watching how the revolt started and I was cheering for Spartacus the entire time. I liked the political backdrop of the movie. Obviously, Spartacus uprising has a major political undertone which is revolution, a very appropriate theme. We also get to go behind the scenes and see how Roman politics influenced the war. It's a common fact that Roman senators always schemed against each other. The film also did something different, when compared to other epics. These other epics usually provide the normal happy ending. Well, that is not much the case with this film. If you follow history, you'll know the fate of Spartacus. But I'm not going to spoil anything for those who don't know. But the ending was very powerful and memorable. Speaking of powerful, my favorite scene was when a Roman general asked Spartacus's army where Spartacus was. Each soldier stood up and said, 'I'm Spartacus.' A very powerful scene showing the loyalty the slaves had for Spartacus and his cause.This film was the first big film of Stanley Kubrick's career. He was 30 when he directed the film, but he already had 4 feature films under his belt before this film. He masterfully directed the film, but it is publicly known that he disowned the film. It's his most straightforward film, and it was nominated for 6 Oscars (and won 4 of them). But Kubrick didn't like the film he made. He is one of my favorite directors, and you'll see more reviews of his films down the line.The film features fine performances from everyone involved. One of Kubrick's strengths is getting the very best out of his actors. Kirk Douglas portrayed Spartacus as a strong man driven by perseverance. Peter Ustinov, who won Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars for his role as Batiatus, does a wonderful job. He is consistently funny and he has a great screen presence whenever on screen. Laurence Olivier delivers a deep performance as Crassus, who is identified as bisexual in the movie. Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia, the wife of Spartacus. She delivered some emotional performances. Just watch the ending of the movie to see why I say so. Also, keep an eye on a meaty supporting turn by Tony Curtis as Antoninus, the man who loves Spartacus like a brother. Finally, Charles Laughton is great as the soft-hearted scheming Roman Senator, Gracchus.Overall, I liked Spartacus, but I didn't really love it much. It runs into some boring stretches and parts of the movie such as the dialogue and costumes don't hold up well. But I liked how the film strived to be more historically accurate than previous epics. This is a nice film to learn something about Ancient Rome. The film does feature wonderful, bold performances, great direction, good production design, and spectacular battles. Not the greatest epics ever made, but good enough.My Grade: B",8,1,2,10 January 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Film Is Nothing But Magic!
","1982's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is a movie for the ages and an instant classic. Watching this movie again gave me the feels of nostalgia. This film was an important part of my childhood and now as an adult, this movie is still nothing but exceptional filmmaking. This is a movie that is perfect for the entire family and it is a story that both adults and children can relate to. The central theme is about a lonely child finding a new friend. By the time the credits roll on your screen, there will not be a dry eye in the house. This is the kind of enchanting and magical film we have here.E.T was directed by the great Steven Spielberg whom we know as the director of famed films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He ventured into more family-friendly territory with this movie. He made the movie a parallel to his own childhood. As a child in 1960, Spielberg's parents divorced thus leaving him quite lonely as well as a tormentor turned protector toward his younger siblings-things that we see clearly in the characters portrayed on screen. Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison were able to take these childhood elements and effectively show how painful/wonderful growing up can be.The movie begins with a bunch of alien botanists on Earth, but they rush to leave when discovered by a human task force. Unfortunately, one little alien is left behind. The alien is now left alone to fend for himself on a very strange planet. He soon meets 10-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas), whose parents just separated. They soon become friends. E.T dearly misses his home and tries to send a message to his folks back home while becoming acquaintances with Elliot's mother, Mary (Dee Wallace), brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Soon, E.T becomes seriously ill.....and so does Elliot thanks to their special bond. When the task force finally intrudes, it may be hard for E.T to join his people again.I remember when first seeing the movie, I was not impressed with Henry Thomas's performance. Now years later, I come to appreciate his performance. As far as child actors go, Thomas is one of the better ones. Speaking of child actors, Barrymore is very adorable here. She became a big movie star, but this is the role I know her by. If E.T was played by a human, I would say this performance was excellent. The alien was voiced by Pat Welsh, who apparently smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, thus creating the perfect voice for E.T.I loved the look of E.T. The little alien looks perfectly grotesque but he also looks very cuddly. His eyes are a standout and I like the way he can raise his neck. The way the alien uses sound is also memorable. The catlike purring, those child-like squeals of surprise, etc. Speaking of the looks, the visuals of the film are fantastic! The one scene that stays with me in the bicycle chase/flying scene. Set to the sweeping, magical music of John Williams, you feel the magic as we watch E.T help the children avoid the cops chasing after them.E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is the reason why we go to the movies. To escape from our realities and join a world that is filled with magic and emotion. Steven Spielberg created a narrative achievement unlike ever seen before. A family film designed to make you feel, think, and get lost in this world. Every time I finish the movie, there are tears running down my face. Sorry Gandhi, but this film should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Solid performances, great visuals, an alien you will never forget, one of John Williams's best scores are just few of the many great things this movie has to offer. Also fun fact! Reeses Pieces became my favorite candy thanks to this movie! Thank you, Elliot for leaving trail of this delicious candy to use as bait for our favorite alien!My Grade: A",9,2,2,2 May 2019
Casablanca," One of the...if not the Greatest Films of All Time!
","Famed critic, Roger Ebert once held a mini debate about this 1942 classic, Casablanca. He compared this movie to a similar film, Citizen Kane. He claimed that Kane may be the better movie, but Casablanca is the more popular movie. I agree with Roger because Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made and it seems as if my opinion is a fact (although keep in mind all movies are subjective). There is just so much to admire about the film. The cast, the themes, the actual production of the movie, and the way the film influenced future movies just to name a few. We wouldn't get star-studded romantic epics like 1997's Titanic if this film bombed at the box office or was not even made. Fortunately, this movie was a giant success both financially and critically. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three of them including Best Picture which it is rightfully deserved. Where to begin gushing about the movie! I loved the themes of the movie. On the surface, this is a story about long-lost love. The movie is not just about love though. It is mainly about redemption. Major characters and minor characters receive their redemption. The one guy who receives his redemption the most and most often considered a hero is the main character, Rick Blaine played masterfully by Humphrey Bogart. Blaine believed he was abandoned by a woman, but she comes back into his life stirring up old feelings as he realized she always loved him. The movie could have taken the easy way out and have the two lovers back together forever, but instead Rick goes for the moral cause of beating the Nazis instead of acting on his feelings. That for me, is what made this movie so emotionally impactful and way ahead of its time. This is an incredibly thematic movie and the themes are always up for interpretation each time. During World War 2, anybody fleeing the scourge of the Nazis to the United States had to travel to Morocco where they needed to pick up exit visas. The place to go is a nightclub owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who happens to be a very cynical man. Blaine receives an enormous amount of pressure, but his club is still a safe haven for those searching for these exit visas. One day, his former lover Ilsa Kund (Ingrid Bergman) and her French Resistance husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) shows up. The captain of the police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains) informs Rick that he has been ordered by Nazi officer Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) to keep Laszlo in Casablanca. However, Laszlo will do all it takes to escape from the Nazis. One of the appeals to the movie is the A-cast. Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid were all stars at the time. They all happen to be magnificent actors, and each one of these actors might have given their best career performance. Apparently, this is Bogart's first lead role in a romantic film and you would not have known based on his performance. He also plays a cynic very well. Take for instance-one of my favorite scenes of the movie. Rick's nightclub musician, Sam is a mutual friend of both Rick and Ilsa. When Ilsa appears in the club for the first time, he plays 'A Time Goes By.' A song that defined the previous relationship of Rick's and Ilsa's. He angrily storms out of his office....and lays eyes on Ilsa. The acting he displayed there is tremendously powerful. Then we have Ingrid Bergman's strong performance as Ilsa. She tries to convince Rick she still loves him and still wants to be with him despite all the troubles going around in the world. The supporting cast is one of the better ones you will see in a movie of this time period. With the likes of Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre, this is truly an A-picture. I mentioned much about the themes and the acting/characters, but I also really adore the craftsmanship that went into the movie. Michael Curtiz flawlessly directed the movie and got very strong performances from his actors, and the bold script was written by Julius Epstein and Philip Epstein. Their goal was to show us that our main characters lived during an incredibly complex time and well they certainly met their goal. They also created the rich characters of the supporting cast that led to the moral decisions made by our heroes. The black and white cinematography aged very well. I also liked the use of music with the film. Casablanca is a very important film and is one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. I was blown away by the film's majesty. The acting, the music, the direction, the themes, the cinematography.....it all screams perfection. What also moves me is that much of the cast and crew were affected by Hitler's scourge of Europe. Many of these people escaped or have family suffering under his regime. I applaud the courage of the cast and crew who made this film that was released during the height of World War 2. If you are searching for a film that is a popular case study for critics and audiences alike or if you want to see a film that reminds you why you love movies, seek out Casablanca.

Chinatown," Example of Masterful Film Noir!
","Over the years, people have called Chinatown one of the best movies ever. I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.As I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.This movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.This film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.Even though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.My Grade: A-",9,4,4,18 October 2017
Stripes," Bill Murray Steals the Show!
","Stripes is everything I want from a movie involving the director/actor tandem of Ivan Reitman and Bill Murray. The movie is raucous, irreverent, and just a silly movie in general. Towards the end, the movie loses some steam, but I cannot deny how involved I was for the first hour or so. As a movie that pokes fun of the military and basic training, I was reminded of 1980's Private Benjamin which I was lukewarm on. That particular movie featured some fine comedic moments but Goldie Hawn's romance sidetracked the film. This film, however, stays true to the military from start to finish as it antes up the comedy level. It's not every movie that features explosive weapons where we can find hilarious, albeit questionable uses of kitchen utensils!If you went into this movie blind, you would be forgiven if you thought this was a National Lampoon movie. The same kind of raucousness you might have seen in Animal House is seen here. The writer behind that film, Harold Ramis happens to be one of the writers for Stripes. He took his experience from Animal House and Caddyshack and made it work here. When the film is at its best, the jokes are a hoot! The tandem of Ivan Reitman and Bill Murray return after the success of Meatballs (which I still need to see given the talent involved). A bigger budget allowed them to do bigger things here. Maybe the money could have been spent more wisely considering the third act of the movie.John Winger (Bill Murray) is having a horrible day. Within a few hours, he lost his girlfriend, job, car, and home. Having enough with his miserable life, he enlists in the army. He convinces his best friend, Russell (Harold Ramis) to do the same. They are clearly going to be the misfits of the military. When they begin basic training, they are paired with other misfits. The class is led by the hard-headed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates). As basic training moves forward, Winger and Russell keep finding themselves bailed out of sticky situations by Stella (P.J Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). After training ends, the men find themselves in Italy to test a new urban assault vehicle. When they take a test drive with the vehicle to visit the women, who were stationed in Germany, the rest of the platoon and Sgt. Hulka finds themselves in communist territory.Bill Murray excels at comedy to say the least. He was funny in Caddyshack, but he was even better here. My favorite scene with him is when he goes on a rant about 'Old Yeller.' Prior to this film, Harold Ramis was known only as a comedy writer and not as an actor because of his unconventional looks. Murray and Reitman made Columbia allow him to act on the project, as the studio did not like his audition video. It was an excellent idea to bring a veteran like Warren Oates to the cast. He traditionally acted in many Westerns and Reitman wanted to bring those strong sensitivities to the movie. There was a fine dramatic scene between him and Murray that worked well because of that and it allowed Murray to get his feet in the realm of drama. PJ Soles from Halloween and Sean Young have great chemistry. The supporting cast is loaded with talent. John Candy, John Larroquete, Judge Reinhold. A great list of household names!The movie does not completely derail in the end, but it is a small disappointment what happens. The movie has a very strong first half with the basic training and character moments. By some golden rule, every movie must have an extravagant third act. There is nothing wrong with that, but not every movie needs it. Stripes is a prime example of that. While the production was well-made, I did not think the whole communist part of the story worked well with the rest. I just wanted my basic training farce, which thankfully the movie spent a good hour plus on. Speaking of character moment, the one scene I loved took place in the beginning. This dude named Psycho is telling everyone that they would die if they touched his belongings. Sgt. Hulka's response? 'Lighten up.'Overall, Stripes is a good comedy that could have been better if the third act was changed. Bill Murray and his merry gang definitely had a great time making the movie as they know how to be funny! I loved the basic training material and although I was lukewarm on Private Benjamin, these two would make a good double feature. The movie was a great success for Ivan Reitman, Murray, and Ramis. The trio would reunite three years later to create one of the most successful movies of all time, Ghostbusters.My Grade: B",8,2,4,13 March 2019
12 Angry Men," One of Cinema's Best Courtroom Dramas!
","12 Angry Men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema. Even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. On the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. I was discussing in an earlier review (Dial M for Murder) about the use of a single location. Well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. Outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom. That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman. The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. Lumet later discussed how a 'lens plot' occurred to him. As the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. A very good technique I must point out.Another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don't know much about the case, only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on. All we know is that a Spanish-American boy is accused of murdering his father. Other than a very bored-looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case, we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors. In most courtroom movies, it's clear they like to come to a final verdict. This movie is very different because we don't know whether the boy is guilty or not, although we can assume based off the events of the movie. The movie is all about reasonable evidence, a very important study in criminal justice. Through the evidence depicted in the case, did the boy commit the murder or not? In the first few minutes in the jury room, it's clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty. However, there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision. The problem is that one juror, Juror #8 believes the boy is not guilty. This is where all the fun begins. The film is based on emotion, logic, and even prejudice to describe what is going on. This particular juror does not sway from his opinion, even though the other jurors are growing more angry, more restless. But as Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) describes why he believes the boy is not guilty, and he presents an admirable case why, people begin to agree with #8. There are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons. For example, Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is an extreme racist, as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. Then there is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with #8. Then there is Juror #4 (E.G Marshall), a man with wire-rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic. I think it was a wise movie not to give the character names. It makes each character much more powerful. I could actually remember the juror by their numbers, That's a testament for how great and unique each character is.In the 95 minutes the film runs, we become invested in each character very much so. Whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right, we truly sympathize with them all. That is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast. It's interesting, because there was only one bankable star here (at the time), and that was Henry Fonda who played Juror #8 very well. He presented his case as believable as he can be. The rest of the cast were some of the best actors of New York City at the time, such as Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Klugman, E.G Marshall, John Fiedler, Edward Binns, Robert Webber, and George Voskovec. They all perform very well in their roles. They need to be angry, and they certainly did get angry.Sidney Lumet is one of the best and influential American directors of all time. This was is first feature film, and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene. In each film he does, he always has something to say-usually something controversial. Not so much in this film, but in subsequent films. He does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people, and cause them to think and act irrationally. As some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out.12 Angry Men, based off a television play, ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made. It came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty. Despite the critical acclaim of this film, the movie actually wasn't a box-office hit when it originally opened. But enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is. It spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men, and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful, influential film.My Grade: A",9,2,4,12 December 2015
The Natural," My Favorite Baseball Movie!
","The Natural is my favorite baseball movie beating the likes of Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, and I love those movies as well. Could it be the iconic Randy Newman theme that brings me shivers every time I hear it at a baseball stadium? Could it be the stacked cast that includes Robert Redford and Glenn Close? Could it be the impressive direction from Barry Levinson? Or how about baseball being played with a religious overtone? Whatever is the real reason, its safe to say that I adore this movie with all of my heart. I've seen it a good number of times and it never grows old. Ever since hearing the theme played at an independent baseball stadium, my dad showed this movie to me and I'm glad he did.The film is based off a fictional story from Bernard Malamud. Barry Levinson, who smoothly directed the film, always claimed that the movie was not a direct adaptation of the novel. Many naysayers of the film criticized the film for not being faithful to the book. I have never read the book myself and I am not sure if I want to after falling in love with the movie. Apparently, the ending is vastly different. I consider the film's ending to be more open-ended and could be interpreted in a variety of ways. I liked that! I believe screenwriters Roger Towne and Phil Dusenberry created plenty of magic in their script.Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a middle-aged baseball player that came out of nowhere to lead the struggling 1930's baseball team, the New York Knights to the pennant. Years earlier, he was a rising star pitcher that was discovered by journalist Max Mercy (Robert Duvall). On a train ride heading to his new future, he meets the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) who has a thing for athletes who claim to be the very best....and that thing is shooting them. Hobbs career is in limbo after his injury but appears 15 years later with a magical bat made from a tree that was struck by lightning. Along with helping Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) take his team to the pennant, he also has to face schemes about controlling the team and his ex-lover, Iris Gaines (Glenn Close).Robert Redford gives a very subtle, but commanding performance. There is no shouting or no fiery speech, but his presence keeps your eyes glued to him throughout. Glenn Close likewise did an admirable job. She was actually nominated for an Academy Award and was part of the film's 'controversial' ending. No spoilers, though. The rest of the cast is excellent. Robert Redford as the scheming journalist, Wilford Brimley who is a great manager, Darren McGavin as the greedy, slimy person who wants complete control of the team.Critics who opposed this film (not too many, thankfully) have issues with the religious overtones. I think these overtones worked incredibly well with the film. Baseball is a healing sport, a sport of unity. Look at baseball right after 9/11. After the current coronavirus pandemic, people will look to baseball for healing. I knew from the beginning where Hobbs uses a bat from a tree that was struck by lightning and where his father died of a heart attack what kind of film we were getting. Of course, the themes hold up throughout the film. Glenn Close's Ira Haines appearing in what seems to be a divine, white light and the film's ending. Randy Newman's score also has an aura of religion about it. Caleb Deschanel, who is in charge of the film's photography, did very good work with the camera capturing these overtones.Baseball is America's pastime and The Natural gives us reasons why it is. Some people may find the film corny or unrealistic considering the type of home runs Hobbs hit, but not me. I found it to be a story about a man whose life is baseball and believes it's never too late to achieve his dreams. If I had a power bat like Hobbs, I certainly would follow in his footsteps. This is an unforgettable, powerful movie thanks to Robert Redford and company.My Grade: A+",10,0,1,22 April 2020
The Hustler," If You Like Acting, Watch The Hustler!
","If you are an actor of any sort, first-time actor just starting out or a veteran actor trying to hone in acting skills, look no further than 1961's acting masterpiece, The Hustler. Robert Rossen's feature is a clinic for acting. Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott, and Jackie Gleason all came to play. The characters they play are so realistic, that they can be referred to as touchstones. Even though this film features billiards, do yourself a favor and disregard any notion that this is a sports movie. The film itself doesn't care about the pool table or if any audience member even knows the rules of the sport. Although first conceived as a sports movie, Rossen decided to change the film into a character-driven drama midway through filming....and for the better. He wanted to focus more on a love story and themes such as redemption and the strengthening of character. That is a good thing too because I could care less for the actual sport and most likely I would have been bored to tears if this was an actual sports movie. Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a small-time pool hustler who displays an enormous amount of talent, but lacks the attitude to play with the big guys. His bravery causes him to challenge pool legend Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). It was a match with a lot on the line, but Eddie loses in heartbreaking fashion. With this loss, Eddie loses all confidence and hits rock bottom. He decides to team up with Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), the cold and ruthless manager to help him get back into the game. Along the way, he finds love in the form of a drunk Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), and that is what he may need to find character and redemption. As mentioned before, this is the movie to see if you want to be an actor. The performances are so different, but they work well together collectively as a group. This is Paul Newman's breakthrough role, and he feeds off the other actors very well. Even his boyish, handsome looks contrast to the cold, weathered looks of all the players which allows him to easily challenge people to pool. Jackie Gleason had only a few lines, but it's his presence that makes his character. He is built to be Minnesota Fats with his body language, intense facial expressions, and the way he shoots pool. This was only George C. Scott's third film, but he broke out in an enormous way. He is cruel, vicious, and calculating. He uses Sarah against Eddie multiple times, and he is the one who delivered the order for Eddie's thumbs to be broken, and that was one hard scene to watch. Piper Laurie is the struggling alcoholic who sleeps at a bus station and goes to college twice a week and she is the key that helps Eddie build a positive character based on their love. The four actors here are fantastic together. Also, there are some great supporting turns with Murray Hamilton as the millionaire Findlay, and Myron McCormick as Eddie's first manager, Charlie Burns. The movie and themes have been said to draw parallels with director Robert Rossen's own career. In the 1930's, he was involved with Communist Party. He initially refused to name names during Mccarthy's witch hunt, but he ultimately betrayed his fellow party associates/friends to keep working in Hollywood. The theme of betrayal is also prevalent in this movie. Rossen directed many solid to great movies, but his greatest work may have come with The Hustler thanks to his past. 
On the technical side of things, this film achieves many things. It was a great idea to film the movie in black-and-white. Eugene Shuftan's amazing cinematography was able to accurately portray the gloominess of the pool halls. Dede Allen's editing is a piece of art. She understands that the audience may not understand pool, so she cut the film as if pool is something we already know. Nominated for 9 Oscars and winning 2 for cinematography and art direction, The Hustler is a very good movie. The movie really works due to the acting and give the director credit for allowing equal screen time to all four of the main actors. The film can move slow at times and pool is not my thing, but I couldn't help but be entranced by the characters. For me, I loved how Eddie's character changed over time. He played two memorable matches with Minnesota Fats. The first one for the game of pool and the second one for the test of character. It doesn't get any better than that! Also keep an eye out for Jake LaMotta as a bartender!My Grade: A-",9,1,2,10 October 2018
A Bridge Too Far," Admirable Effort!
","An admirable effort. That is what I can call this 1977 Richard Attenborough feature A Bridge Too Far. This movie had all the ingredients to become a war classic. A great director, an all-star cast (and that is putting it lightly), a World War Two story that no one seems to know about, and the promise of Nazis being destroyed. The thing is, the film does not live up to its full potential. In that sense, the movie is a slight disappointment. I wanted to really enjoy the movie, but I mostly got mild entertainment. Based on from what other people say, my opinion seems to be what the majority thinks. A good war movie, but it could have been much better.Now why exactly isn't this movie heralded as an all-time favorite? I actually think the main reason lies in the story itself. The story is interesting, but it is about an Allied failure. People don't want to see that, especially since the time of this mission was occurring as the Nazis were loosening their hold on Europe thanks to the strong Allied efforts. The movie also pushes three hours long, and the movie moves very slowly at times. This war film actually holds the least action in any war film I can ever remember. That is impressive considering the running time of the movie. My main concerns are the constant repetitions and the long running time.That being said, there are some great things about the movie. Being a history film, the creators have the liberty to change the story to make a better movie. Not here. I value the historical accuracy, and I actually found it to be what kept me engrossed in the movie. It was a story I did not know much about, so I found this to be a learning tool. I also really enjoyed the performances from the cast. If you want a great cast, just check this film out. With a cast featuring Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, James Caan, Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, and Robert Redford just to name a few. At the very least watch the cast do a fine job, even if some of their roles are glorified cameos.So let's dive into a history lesson. This movie was about an unsuccessful Allied mission called 'Operation Market Garden.' It took place in September 1944 in the Netherlands and Germany. Basically, there were two sub-operations. The first operation consisted of Airborne forces being parachuted behind enemy lines to capture several bridges. That would allow the next operation, the ground forces to advance and cut off the heart of German industry. Mainly due to bad luck, poor communication, and bad weather, this operation failed at the Arnhem Bridge when the Allied forces at the ridge was overran, thus delaying an Allied victory.Despite some problems, I thoroughly liked A Bridge Too Far. I consider it to be a serviceable war film because it does the story justice. The movie had strong potential, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Strong performances are everywhere (especially from Anthony Hopkins and James Caan). The movie does have strong visual effects that thoroughly complement the story. So I guess that is another plus. I loved the admirable, ambitious attempt famed director Richard Attenborough did in trying to make this a masterpiece. I can see he tried so hard, but he does get somewhere with that effort at least. If you want to see a quality bridge film during this era, definitely watch The Bridge of River Kwai before this film. But if you're a sucker for war films, then this is a good one to watch.My Grade: B-",8,1,3,18 October 2017
The Terminator," An Iconic Science Fiction Classic!
","The Terminator is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic science-fiction movies of all-time. It may not be my favorite (it's still high up on my list), but there is no denying the influence the film had for filmmakers and moviegoers alike. The studio, Orion, originally saw this film as a flop, but it was moderately successful on a limited budget. It spawned a sequel that brought the property to a mass audience, which it turn created more sequels of varying degrees of success. Even in today's world, this is a beloved film that has a wide audience.The film brought forth the Hollywood careers of many people. The top of the list is director James Cameron. It took people time to see he was the real deal. With the tight budget given to him, Cameron was able to make most of what he had. His movie, which he also wrote, has some very dark themes. What will the world look like with the rapid acceleration of technology and what would happen if there was nuclear war? I think Cameron answers these questions very well, which may also be one of the reasons why the film resonates in the mind of viewers today.I love the look and the design of the movie. Most of the filming took place at night hence the darkness. The special effects may be outdated in today's terms, but keep in mind there was a small budget. Still, they are good enough to make the scenes believable. I still remember seeing The Terminator and Kyle Reese appear on screen, from the future, with those lightning bolts and Brad Fiedel's amazing theme. This could have been cheesy in the hands of a lesser director, but Cameron made it work. Unlike subsequent sequels, he made an incredibly wise choice to shoot the film like a horror thriller. Yeah, there are very intense, horrific moments here to behold. Those robots look really intense and scary.In the year 2029, the entire world has been conquered by manmade machines. These machines send a ruthless assassin, known as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 Los Angeles, where his mission is to kill the person who holds the key to the future of mankind; Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). The human resistance sends one of their own, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to 1984 to stop the cyborg from completing his mission. The Terminator will not stop until his mission is complete and he will destroy anyone and anything that stands in his way.The acting can be clunky at times, but it works in everyone's favor. Despite the success of Conan the Barbarian, Cameron was hesitant in hiring Schwarzenegger. The casting worked out in everyone's favor though. He only had seventeen lines of dialogue and they were delivered in a robotic voice, which is, you know, perfect for a robot. His intimidation and presence are what makes his character so unique. When we are introduced to him, we see him go up against the dumb punk leader (played by a wonderful, young Bill Paxton) and give him a much-deserved beatdown. That is how we know Arnold was the right man. This is Michael Biehn's first big role and he has some great moments of dialogue. I was on the fence with Linda Hamilton. On one hand, her character irked me in the beginning. But as the movie progresses, I warmed up to her character and was rooting for her by the film's end. There are some solid supporting roles from Dick Miller and Lance Henriksen.The music is another reason why we are enthralled and captivated. This is Fiedel's first film score, and Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd almost passed on him due to his inexperience, but he was able to show them how talented he is. The synth score and those drums combine to create one of the most iconic scores of all time. Yep, it is something that you can easily hum.The success of The Terminator surprised everyone in 1984. Should it really considering the talent of the people behind the film? Science fiction was not big on Hollywood's mind despite the success of Alien and Star Wars. The genre will begin to make a comeback thanks to the aforementioned films and this one. James Cameron rose to the A-list director list and Schwarzenegger became a superstar and his line 'I'll be back' is the line that everyone loves to imitate including myself. I really, really enjoyed this sci-fi action/horror flick. It is violent, has many great lines, zips along at a fast pace, and one of those films you will remember as an instant classic.My Grade: A",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Catch-22," Disappointing
","At this point in time, Mike Nichols was a rising star. As you can recall, he directed the hit 1967 film The Graduate. His debut feature put him high on the map of talent and everyone had high expectations for him. People waited with bated breath as his second film, Catch-22 made its way into theaters in June of 1970. I was a big fan of The Graduate, and his second film appealed to me based on the plot and the pedigree of the cast. Unfortunately, I don't have the greatest news about this picture. I was rather underwhelmed to say the least. As the movie faded to black at the end, I came away with a sense of disappointment. I was disappointed the film didn't live up to my high hopes. I am not saying the film is completely awful, as there are some genuinely endearing moments, but the picture is underwhelming on the whole.It's kind of hard to give a good description of the plot because I felt like the film was just a conglomeration of scenes mashed together. Scenes that failed to form a cohesive narrative. But I will do my best to describe what this film is about. This film is about a military captain named Yossarian (Alan Arkin) who has had enough of fighting on the Mediterranean front in World War Two. In order to get out of the war, he decides to do anything possible to label himself as insane. That includes driving everyone else crazy.What exactly didn't I like about this film? Well there were several things. I briefly mentioned the plot structure issues in my previous paragraph. The movie was strung together by a loose thread it felt like and the story barely made sense. That was obvious when it came to the tone of the film. It didn't know whether to be serious or to be funny. The first half of the film is trying to make you laugh, but suddenly the second half of the film turns into a rather dark drama and I was taken aback at the sudden change of tone. Now after Nichols sickened us with rather graphic war scenes in the second half of the movie, all the sudden we get an ending resembling the tone of the first half. It almost seemed like a ripoff of the ending of The Graduate and almost a cop out. Nichols was attempting to inject laughter in the audience that final scene, but not me. Also I had some issues with the script Buck Henry wrote. He adapted the screenplay from a very popular novel which was deemed unfilmable and that shows in the final product. The screenplay was essentially disjointed.As for the performances, I did think they were pretty good. Let me say right now that some of the actors here suffer from cases of overacting. Sometimes it was annoying, and other times it was amusing. Firstly, Alan Arkin delivers a delightfully zany performance as Yossarian. It was amusing watching him become a head case to his superiors. His performance introduced him to the eyes of the public. If there is a positive thing to take away from this film, it's watching Arkin being a crazy man. Jon Voight had a memorable performance as one of the soldiers in the film: Lt. Milo Minderbinder. My favorite scene of the film was his character blowing up his own base. Now that was something I was laughing at. The veterans of the cast are the ones guilty of overacting. I'm looking at you Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) and Brig. General Dreedle (Orson Welles). Although Balsam's opening scene with Arkin as Arkin is looking for a way to leave is quite funny.When the film was released, it was not successful both critically and commercially. Critics somewhat warmed up to the film over time, but many had issues with the plot and screenplay like I did. The film was widely ignored perhaps because 1970 was a year war films were popular (or in some cases, anti-war films). This can be labeled as a black comedy dealing with thematic issues of war, but the thing is a movie with a similar tone (and a better movie) MASH was released. Between MASH and Patton, and the ongoing Vietnam War, I don't think audiences were in the mood for another movie dealing with war even if the theme was decidedly antiwar.Now there are some good things to like about the film. The performances are fun to watch especially from Alan Arkin. There are scenes that are great ones such as where Voight's character bombing his own base and General Dreedle sending his own guy to be executed. The aerial sequences are also well-done. But they really don't make up for the disappointment of the rest of the film.I had high hopes for Catch-22, but it ultimately did not lead to my expectations. There are major plot and script issues and Nichol's direction left something to be desired. But this film can be part of his growing pains and he will come to redeem himself with future films. He did make a valiant attempt to make a black comedy about war. He wasn't able to pull it off as Robert Altman did with MASH. This is not an awful film, but its a rather disappointing film. But hey not all films can be like The Graduate.My Grade: C-",7,0,3,12 October 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Watch for Paul Newman and Robert Redford!
","I originally did not know what to think about 1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Considering people call this film one of the greatest Westerns of all time, I thought the film, although fine, was nothing special of consequence. The I kept thinking about it, kept thinking about it some more, and then truly took a long time to leave my thoughts. Only a very good movie has the ability to do that. After much debate, I still feel this film falls short of being the very best. That said, this is a fun movie that gives the audience some insight on two of America's most famous outlaws plus it has some great character interactions and dynamite performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford.This film was written by one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters-William Goldman. He recounted many times how hard it was to get this film rolling off the ground. He spent eight years researching these outlaws. Those who know basic American history should know that these outlaws spent a big chunk of their years in Bolivia. Many of the big studios insisted that Goldman did not include running away to South America in this picture because it defeats the point of a Western. Well, Goldman certainly did not listen. His script is one of the better parts of the movie. Great dialogue is abound in the movie from start to finish.If you think the trio of George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford sounds familiar, then you are right to think so. The director and his two actors teamed up in 1973 to create the superior The Sting, which is one of my favorite movies of all-time. But they connected together very well here. Newman and Redford show excellent chemistry together from start to finish. They were funny and definitely had a blast together. Katherine Ross, from The Graduate fame, plays the third wheel to these men and also does a fantastic job from what's given to her. I felt like her role was not fleshed out well enough.Robert Parker aka. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and Harry Lonabaugh aka. The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are known for their bank and train robberies. Eventually, one of the rich railroad owners had enough of their antics. He sends a posse made up of the best law enforcement team of the West after these outlaws. With the help of Sundance's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), the threesome travel to Bolivia to escape the American authorities....and to continue what they are good at.In my humble opinion, the first act is excellent but is followed by a second act that whimpers out but is truly saved by a memorable third act. The first act is where Butch and Sundance take down any opposition within their gang and delivered some spectacle with a great train robbery sequence. The second act to me is slow if not a little boring. But the final act where they face off against the South American authorities is violent, bloody, and very entertaining.Before I can finish the review, I must talk about the music. Burt Bacharach's score is one of the more defining scores of 1960's cinema. Also, I love that original song he included, 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head.' I never realized that song became famous thanks to this movie.I really had fun watching this movie, even during the slow second act. You can thank the iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford for that. These two gentlemen truly had a wonderful time on set. I was expecting something more gritty and serious from the two, so their jovial chemistry between each other certainly took me by surprise....but in a good way. The movie was also a pleasure to watch thanks to Conrad Hall's camera skills.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid may not be the best Western movie or my favorite film, but it is certainly an influential one.My Grade: B+",8,1,1,12 February 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant Dark Comedy!
","Dr. Strangelove is my second review of a Stanley Kubrick movie. Earlier I posted a review of his 1960 film, Spartacus which I generally liked, but did not love. Spartacus was a mainstream, straightforward film that he adapted from a novel. For this movie, it is an entirely different story. I loved every single bit of the black comedy which was written by Kubrick himself (which he adapted from the Peter George novel). This is actually one of the best films to come out in the last fifty years. It was a timely movie (for 1964's audience), and it remains hilarious for the duration of the film even though Kubrick told his actors to play it straight. It was the talent of Kubrick that turned this film into a film he wanted, a quirky black comedy.Kubrick is known to be a perfectionist in all of his films. He is involved with every detail including sound, editing, etc. He even has his own sound equipment and his own cameras. Because he wanted to be so perfect, it created tension between him and his actors. For example, Kubrick never got along with George C. Scott who played a major role in the movie. Kubrick used some trickery to get Scott, a very hard actor to work with, to get what he wanted and Scott vowed never to work with Kubrick again. Scott, however, did admit he respected Kubrick due to his chess skills, which they played on set every day.The movie plays out like a spoof, a spoof about the Cold War. At the beginning of the film, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes bananas and he orders his bomber planes to annihilate the Soviet Union. He has some crackpot idea that the communist nation is conspiring to destroy the Americans via their bodily fluid. Over in America, in the 'War Room,' President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) meets with his advisors to figure out what to do, and they are informed by the Russian Ambassador that if the Soviet Union is destroyed, that would unleash a machine called 'The Doomsday Machine' and that will destroy all of humanity.There are some interesting themes presented in the movie. The main theme is the Cold War, which was a silent war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The early 1960's was a tense era due to such events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cuban Revolution, in which the Soviets had a hand in. The movie is particularly interested in satirizing MAD, or the mutual assured destruction. Both sides wanted to destroy each other in a nuclear standoff, but they were deterred in doing so because all human life would be destroyed regardless. Another theme presented is a sexual theme, which Kubrick later admitted. The beginning with the airplanes going in to Russia is meant to be the start of the sexual process and Kong's (a character in the film) ride down on the missile and detonation is meant to be the ending of the sexual process.The film is famous for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons is Peter Sellers playing three roles. He played President Merkin Muffley, who was based off an American Midwesterner and a has a balding figure. He spoke in a tone that suggested he had a cold, an underlying weakness that Sellers wanted to give to that character. Muffley was played straight by Sellers, but I felt his character was actually hilarious. Sellers also portrayed Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only man accessible to the mad General Ripper. Finally, Sellers portrayed Dr. Strangelove, my favorite character in the movie. Strangelove is an ex-Nazi scientist who serves as Muffley's scientific adviser. I loved the accent Sellers used to portray the wheelchair-bound eccentric. I also loved how he had this thing called the 'alien hand syndrome' I just couldn't stop laughing when Strangelove randomly used the Nazi salute and called the President 'Mein Fuhrer' several times over the course of the film. I found it hilarious the Americans would employ former Nazis in the movie. Strangelove appeared to be a menacing antagonist of the movie, and a great one at that.There are also great supporting turns, mainly in George C. Scott's character, General Buck Turgidson. He was the adviser who alerted the President to the news and he was really funny. I loved the use of his facial contortions to display his emotions. He reminded me of Jim Carrey, who is famous for his extreme facial contortions as part of his comedy routine. There is one scene where the General was running in the War Room and slipped, then picked himself up again as if nothing happened. According to Kubrick, the scene wasn't planned but it worked perfectly with the movie. Sterling Hayden had a rather small role as General Ripper at the beginning, but it was a very memorable role. Finally, there is Slim Pickens who plays Major Kong-the leader of the airplane in charge of throwing a bomb on the USSR. Pickens reportedly wasn't told the film was a comedy, and he played his role straight. With the use of the heavy Southern accent, his role was still funny. His role was actually meant for Peter Sellers, but Sellers didn't want to do it because he had trouble with a Southern accent and he sprained an ankle and wasn't able to sit in the cockpit of the airplane.Dr. Strangelove is seen as one of Stanley Kubrick's best films and it is very easy to see why. Well, both this film and 2001: A Space Odyssey are his best films,and they share common themes. Manmade machines attempting to destroy humans. Nonetheless, this film was very fun to watch and it made me laugh constantly. As a Cold War farce, the movie does a wonderful job.My Grade: A+",10,2,2,11 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Worthwhile Conclusion To The Original Trilogy!
","After the first two Star Wars films became enormously popular with critics and audiences alike, the original trilogy closes out with 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI- The Return of the Jedi. I remember watching the movie for the first time all excited considering I thought the first two films were perfect (and still pretty much do!). I was wondering how this film would conclude the story arcs especially after how dark The Empire Strikes Back was. With Han Solo frozen in carbonite and the reveal of Darth Vader's lineage to Luke, I was very excited. Now I have seen this film many times since, but my thoughts remained the same. This is a very fun, satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. While it does not reach the height of its predecessors, there are enough highlights to make this one memorable sci-fi adventure.Just like in The Empire Strikes Back, creator George Lucas decided not to direct the movie. He teamed up with Lawrence Kasdan to write the screenplay, as well as executive-produced the movie. He also remained on set to assist his hand-picked director, Richard Marquand. Marquand worked very well with the actors, but this is Lucas's movie. An interesting tidbit is that originally, Lucas wanted Steven Spielberg to direct. Due to some issues with the Director's Guild, he was unable to. That is somewhat of a shame because the notion of Spielberg directing a Star Wars movie truly excites me.This is Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) movie. After the events of the last film, he is messed up psychologically. He wanted that urge to face his father again. But with the Emperor himself now in the picture, there is a chance Luke may be lured to the Dark Side. This time around, the Empire is near completion of a second, more powerful Death Star. This would certainly end the Rebel Alliance. Frozen in carbonite, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is now the prisoner of Jabba the Hutt, and so eventually does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). With the help of C-3PO and R2-D2, Luke goes on a rescue mission in the desert planet of Tatooine to rescue his friends. After this rescue, they join up with the Rebels to attack the Empire on the forest moon of Endor. There is a three-pronged attack with Luke, Han, and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) in charge. Unfortunately, Luke ends up surrendering to the Stormtroopers and is taken to meet the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)-which may spell doom for the entire galaxy.The performances remain consistently great. At the beginning of the film's production, it was not a given that Harrison Ford would return since he was not contracted for two sequels like the other actors were-which is why he was frozen in the previous film. But he was able to return, and Lucas was able to write him in the screenplay. I like how they dabbled with Luke and the Dark Side, and I really liked his quest to understand his father. Mark Hamill does an incredible job working these darker themes into Luke.The puppetry and the visual effects need some mentioning. Out of all the original Star Wars features, this film uses the most visual effects. Even in today's blockbuster filmmaking, these visuals do hold up well and are a feast for the eyes. These visuals go hand-in-hand with the thrilling action sequences we see in the last half of the movie. The Endor battle sequences are very well-made. I also liked the looks of these new characters/monsters that are introduced to us. I loved Roger Ebert's description of Jabba the Hutt-a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat. Spot on, Mr. Ebert! Then there are the Ewoks, perhaps the most controversial of all Star Wars characters (outside of Jar Jar Binks). They are cute and cuddly, but do they serve a purpose other than throwing sticks and stones at the Imperial Troopers? These creatures, while a pleasure to look at, may be the weakest link of the movie. I also dug the look of one of the Alliance's generals-Ackbar. Finally, although he does not have much screentime, it was nice to visit Dagobah and see Yoda again.Just like how Star Wars cannot exist without lightsabers, I can argue that Star Wars cannot exist without the magnificent contributions of John Williams. His musical compositions are very important and they remain so in this movie. Just listen to his work during the Endor scenes-very powerful stuff!Return of the Jedi may be no Empire Strikes Back, but it does stand on its own. It is a more fun, more adventure-like movie when compared to the last film. This movie still holds some darker themes, but Lucas was able instill a better sense of fun. Sure, those Ewoks may have been created for marketing and toy purposes, but we like cute creatures, right? The action scenes are very good as one would expect-just watch the final battle sequence. However, the rescue attempt from Jabba and Luke's climatic duel with Darth Vader also make for strong cinema. After watching this entire trilogy, I was ready to join the celebration as seen in this movie at one point.My Grade: A-",9,1,2,6 September 2019
MASH," Dark Comedy at its Finest!
","Now my fellow readers, we have moved into a new decade of film- a very memorable decade because many influential movies were introduced to the public. Many of these movies had something to say. This is my first review from the 1970's-the review of M.A.S.H which is about staying sane in the heat of war. The film came out when things were going downhill in Vietnam. People hated the involvement in the Vietnam War, but this movie was so successful despite the setting in 1951 during the Korean War. How could it be so successful? Well it was a funny and subversive movie and it was unlike any war picture people have seen. The adventures of Hawkeye Pierce and Duke Forrest stayed in the minds of many Americans and later on, it inspired a very popular television series off the title name. As for me, I found some moments to be uproariously hilarious, but I found other moments to be somewhat dull.Altman's film takes place in November of 1951. The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is ready to be surprised when Captain Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland) and Captain Duke Forrest arrive (Tom Skerritt.) Their duo of merry surgeons are joined by Trapper John McIntyre (Elliot Gould). They were all great surgeons, but terrible soldiers (in a good, funny way.) They deal with the effects of war by pretending they don't care. They use comedy in their lives to set their minds on other things that affects the camp in one way or the other. They pull of stunts such as getting rid of the really stupid Major Burns (Robert Duvall) after his 'public' affair with 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman). They help the camp dentist commit suicide (which actually is the best scene of the movie in my book.) It took me awhile to warm up to them, but I liked the performances of the film. The characters are rather interesting. When not in the surgeon room operating, they run around the camp making fun of other people. But they show a contrast when in the operating room. They are covered in blood, and they look so realistic performing such operations like sawing off a leg or closing up arteries and using such words related to their medical profession. Seeing the contrast between the two sides was very interesting. It shows they are serious when it comes to their job of saving lives, but in general are just goofballs. Donald Sutherland does a great job as the leader of the gang and Elliot Gould and Tom Skerritt likewise turn in good, fun performances. I also found Robert Duvall's brief performance as the idiotic Major Burns was a hoot to watch.The music in the film is also memorable. I liked the song that played at the beginning of the movie, 'Suicide Is Painless,' which was written by a 15-year-old apparently. But that song would become the main theme song for the television series. It continued the trend of using pop ballads in feature films introduced several years previously, but it's a song that I found very enjoyable.So just remember, the film uses dark comedy in the face of war. This movie may not be for everybody. I really didn't care much to see it at first because the tone turned me off, but it's not a bad little film. The scene where they are helping the dentist commit suicide is a classic scene. The scene reminded me of the classic Leonardo Da Vinci's painting 'The Last Supper.' If you saw the film, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. In the beginning, where they are giving hell to Major Burns was also very entertaining. I couldn't stop laughing when they got Major Burns and Hot Lips making love over the camp's loudspeakers. Just a brilliant scene. Also the use of those very loudspeakers were a main part of the story, and a plot novice according to Altman. These random (but often funny) loudspeaker announcements helped connect the 'episodes' in the film.I had some issues with the film. I liked the loudspeaker announcements, but I felt it gave the film a choppy look and that it wasn't edited that well. Also, the final act of the film is focused on a football game against a general. The football game itself was well-done, but I felt it ruined the tone of the film. It didn't fit with the first two-thirds of the movie. The game was meant to be funny, but the funny references are what only true football fans will get. I like the sport, but I wouldn't call myself a fan so some of these references went over my head.That being said, I rather enjoyed M.A.S.H. It is a different kind of war movie and I applaud the efforts of Robert Altman to bring his vision to screen. The performances are genuinely funny because of the characters and the situations they get themselves into. The movie took a bold move in portraying the story and it worked out. It shows there can be lightness during dark times. But the dark comedy, while very hilarious at times can be a little offensive. It is a good movie, and I can respect the kind of film it wanted to be.My Grade: B",8,1,2,18 October 2017
Alien," Jaws + Space= Alien!
","'Jaws in Space.' The perfect three words to describe 1979's unique Alien. If you look at it closely, Alien is very similar to Jaws. An abnormal giant creature is terrorizing a bunch of innocent humans, and even the introduction to each monster is eerily similar. I really dig the influences that Jaws made on Alien. I liked how they hid the alien until the end, where we finally get to see him in all his grotesque glory. The 1970's was a hard time for sci-fi. Not many science fiction movies were made in the midst of American exploitation films, but luckily Star Wars and Close Encounters changed everything. Because of the success of those films, one of the best sci-fi/horror classics of the twentieth century was able to get produced. I am not much of a horror guy but if you are able to add a science-fiction element to the horror and actually make it good, well you can count me in. I enjoyed nearly everything about this film from start to finish.One of the film's best strengths is its pacing. It moves purposely at a slow pace. People would expect the movie to be about the alien from the start, but the alien does not begin its reign of terror until the movie has been running for a good amount of time. But we are treated to wonderful characterizations (conversations on money shares), the silence of space, and the anticipation of what will happen next. But from the start, it's worth investing your time into the characters of the ship, The Nostromo. Another strength is the production design thanks in part to designer H.R Geiger. The Nostromo has a wonderful design to it and you can tell the influences from Star Wars. But what about the creature himself? My goodness, they are scary-looking creatures. From the harmless looking chest-burster to the killing machine that is called the Alien, they are visually disgusting creatures (in a good way). In today's day and age of movies, the visual effects still hold up very well. The effects actually won an Oscar.The Nostromo is a commercial deep-space vessel on its way home when it picks up an SOS signal from a distant planet. The SOS signal awakens the crew from their deep hypersleep way earlier than anticipated, The seven-man crew is led by Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and the rest of the crew consists of Ripley (Signourey Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). Once they get to the signal, they realize that this was not an SOS signal at all. It was a signal of danger now that a very dangerous lifeform is a stowaway on their ship. Will they be able to destroy the alien before they get destroyed themselves? Another reason why the movie works so well is the presence of a strong female lead character. So we have ourselves a 70's rarity: a female-driven science-fiction movie. Signourey Weaver's Ripley plays out like a character straight out of a 1950's movie and I love it. Ripley is a hero worth remembering in future movies. Weaver is the most important character of the movie, but let's not forget about the rest of the cast. I find the ages of everybody interesting. A typical horror or thriller movie has most of their characters between 20-30. Outside of Weaver and Cartwright, everyone is 35 or older. I liked that because they added experience to their characters thus making us care more about their fates. Ian Holm was the oldest cast member at 46, and is the second most important character. His character is actually an android and his profession is a science officer. So you might have the feeling he will play a pivotal role with the alien (and the humans) fates. I must give a shout-out to John Hurt for taking it so well the fate of his character, Kane. Kane happened to be the lucky fellow involved in the horrifying chest-bursting sequence. I've seen this movie several times and the shock value of this scene still remains at a high point.This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, whom would go on to have an impressive career in Hollywood. But this movie is where he was mostly introduced to the film world. He did one hell of a job directing the movie. This movie could have easily been a movie with cheap scares, but he grounded the movie. He made it much more than just the alien. In a way, you can count this as another similarity to Jaws. That shark movie began the mighty career of Steven Spielberg..just like this film did with Ridley Scott.Overall, I really enjoyed Alien so much. This movie spawned many sequels and spin-offs, but none of them impacted me like this movie did although 1986's Aliens is also a classic. The movie is scary and thrilling, but Ridley Scott's powerful directing and Signourey Weaver's acting prowess did much to elevate the movie. Then there was the impressive visuals, the good use of sound (a smooth mixture of silence and Jerry Goldsmith's score), the good script by Dan O'Bannon. This is really an unforgettable classic and its up there with Jaws (yep, I mentioned it again) as my favorite horror movies from the 1970s'. If these kind of films have a good story, then you bet I'll like them.My Grade: A",9,2,4,18 October 2017
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese's Defining Movie!
","Taxi Driver is truly the movie where director Martin Scorsese really comes into his own. 1973's Mean Streets did not really connect with me as it did with other people and 1974's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was a very entertaining road trip movie but it's not a classic. Now Taxi Driver is absolutely the definition of an instant classic. This film, about a loner with borderline homicidal tendencies, was well-received upon release and to this day, the movie holds up incredibly strong. There are many themes that can be applied to the film which we will get more into later, so this film is one of those rare ones that will challenge you to think; to make your own personal opinions about what is occurring on screen. Paul Schrader's screenplay is well-written and his words are easily brought onto screen with such effectiveness. Then again, I also think Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro helped bring those words to life.So the film focuses basically on one main character. His name is Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) and you might recognize the name because how iconic this character is. Anyhow, Travis Bickle is a Vietnam War veteran suffering from bouts of insomnia. He spends his days in porn movie theaters and his nights driving a taxi around New York City. Essentially, Travis is a man who is socially inadequate and he often thinks about what is wrong with the world-particularly in New York. He generally despises people, but he has a soft spot for Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works for the office of Senator Charles Palantine, whom he later wants to assassinate. Also important to Travis is helping an eleven-year-old runaway prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) whom Travis wants to protect from her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel).So who is Travis Bickle and what does he stand for? I ask this because this movie is all about him and it is effective it getting the audience to sympathize for this character despite possessing qualities of a bad human being. We are told he is a veteran from Vietnam and that he was psychologically affected from the experience overseas. His voice-over in the beginning of the film suggests very strong opinions about people of NYC. As he cruises down the city streets, he talks about the filth of the city. The pimps, the prostitutes, the robbers, etc. He mentions if he had his own way, he would clean up these streets. We also learn that Travis is a man with a quick temper and a violent edge to him. I loved how he pretended to know everything about the political candidate, Senator Palantine just so he can get the girl. My favorite scene (or one of my favorites) is when he drives the Senator himself in a taxi pretending he knows all about his campaign. And I wont do spoilers, but there is a certain connection between Palpatine and the mohawk on Travis's head.This is a film that requires powerful performances if you want to make this a good movie. But with Scorsese at the helm, everyone performs amazingly. Of course, Robert De Niro did an astounding job in making Travis Bickle his own. He performed the character with ease, though this must have been tough on the actor. But I truly believed this character as a loner who is violent and has very strong beliefs. I loved the rapport he had with the young Jodie Foster. Foster began acting at such an early age, and you can see how skilled she is when she holds her own against De Niro and both have strong chemistry with each other. The rest of the cast is rounded by the likes of Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd (who is a joy to watch as Betsy).I must say the cinematography and the score are standouts of the film. Michael Chapman filmed mostly at night and the picture has a gritty, real-time feel to it. The score was created by Bernard Herrmann, and this would be his last score before his passing. What a way to end a storied film career! His score yearns for the loneliness of Bickle's heart. The saxophone is synonymous with the empty shell that is Travis Bickle. It's a powerful, though often haunting score.The film does not go without its controversies. The ending was deemed way too violent and Scorsese actually had to de-saturate the color to get an R rating. Though I believe it plays an essential role of the film, I agree the film (especially the ending) is very, very violent. Essentially, the end has Travis going on a murderous rampage against Sport so he could return young Iris to her family. The film is also home to a political assassination, which was set up very well. Though this is a characterization piece, expects lots of violence and blood. In fact, The attempted murderer of Ronald Reagan, John Hinckley Jr. based his assassination attempt off the events in this movie.Taxi Driver, admittedly can be a hard film to watch. Though an iconic character, Travis Bickle is not a pleasant man. But one cannot help but root for him. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I found some interesting interpretations of this character. There are religious and social interpretations. He can be described as 'an avenging angel,' and I can see that point very well. I loved how Scorsese kept the movie ending up to grabs. In other words, each person may have a different interpretation on what happens in the end. The film wouldn't have worked unless it got excellent acting and powerful directing. And that is what we get. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro pulled off a cinematic gem. Although you might get a little depressed watching at times.

Barry Lyndon," Slow-Moving, But Kubrick Does It Again!
","Stanley Kubrick has returned after his 1971's controversial success A Clockwork Orange with his tonally different 1975 feature, Barry Lyndon. His last feature was a movie that was ultra violent and about a totalitarianism society. This movie is different by a wide margin. It has more of a historical value because it takes place in England during the Seven Years' War and we get a sense of English society at the time. It is also based off the works of famed nineteenth century writer William Makepeace Thackeray. This film also has a lovely atmospheric air to it. Kubrick, as usual, masterfully write this feature. You could tell that this is his pet project. However, the movie does clock in at over three hours and with the lack of action, there can be a dull moment or two to be had. After all, I feel the aristocratic world can get somewhat boring at times. That being said, we have Kubrick on the top of his game as he created a valued historical narrative that remains mostly interesting and our eyes are able to feast on perfect costuming and successful camera experimenting. Essentially, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott shot the film without the use of electrical light, and that is why the look of the film seemed a bit odd compared to other films.Narratively, I felt the first hour of the film was the strongest. I found the last two hours enjoyable, but it would be very hard to top the perfect narrative of the first hour. During theS 1700's in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a man who is in love with his cousin, Nora. After Nora gets engaged to the British Captain John Quinn, Barry challenges him to a duel. He wins the duel and he escapes to Dublin, but he gets robbed. Left with no choice, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War. He decides to desert the army, and he eventually gets forced to join the Prussian Army where he becomes the protégé of Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He soon marries the Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) , but downfall is the near future as Barry's obsession with nobility will become the downfall of his family and fortune.As Stanley Kubrick is wont to do, he developed a cast that not many people may be familiar with. But because Kubrick always know what he is doing, the cast somehow works out well. The biggest name here is Ryan O'Neal and he is not even that much of a household name. He opened eyes with his role in The Love Story, so that is why people may recognize him. I thought he did a really good job. I was invested in his character throughout the entire film. His character could have worked as a completely serious character (and there are some very serious dramatic moments), but I love how he interjected some humor into his role. I also enjoyed Patrick Magee's performance. Magee is best known for his work in A Clockwork Orange as the writer who gets robbed, and I thought his performance here was a really enjoyable one.I love Kubrick's taste of music in his films. Of course everyone knows about the famous music he used in 2001: A Space Odyssey and to an extent in A Clockwork Orange. So we know he has a passion for classical music based on his previous work. So it should come to no surprise he uses composers like Bach and Mozart to enhance his movie. A very good score which makes this movie even the more enjoyable.Overall, Barry Lyndon is another fine piece of filmmaking from the legendary director Stanley Kubrick. It's a bit strange because upon release in 1975, the film actually didn't do too well critically and financially. People called it a disappointment because it was a completely different movie than expected and wondered why he would make a period piece that has plenty of English tax lingo and people cheating on each other. The movie may not have been a financial success, but the critical steam has built up over time and nowadays, people rank the movie as one of Kubrick's best. It is not the perfect masterpiece as his previous films, but its still an enjoyable costume drama that tends to be a little stuffy and overlong. However, it has an excellent first half of the film plus the movie makes good use of music, costumes, set design, and everything regarding the beautiful visuals.My Grade: A-",9,3,6,18 October 2017
The Godfather: Part II," Perfect Sequel!
","Mike is the head of his family, but he is broken, angry man and no one can escape his wrath, not even his poor older brother. This film is a film that laments for loss and is full of bitter emotions.but this is also arguably one of the greatest sequels of all time to one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of favorite all-time films, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it better than the first movie. This movie excels at everything, especially when it comes to storytelling. and the devolution of Michael Corleone's humanity and morality. The film invokes emotion from us for many reasons from the sad but powerful score by Nino Rota, to the powerhouse acting from everyone in the cast especially from Al Pacino, a story that introduces the past effectively, a very shocking ending, tight editing, powerhouse directing by Francis Ford Coppola, and the list goes on and on. Sequels were not a commodity back in the day, and this sequel to the huge 1972 film The Godfather is one of the first of its kind. The success of this film is why today's movie business relies upon sequels to make money. Regardless, this is one of the greatest films of all time.This film continues the saga of the Corleone family as we continue from the events of the first film. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying to expand the family's business into places like Hollywood and Cuba. His character takes a dive as he clashes with his brother Fredo (John Cazale), his lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), and his sister Connie (Talia Shire). He is suspicious of his business associates activities such as folks like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and Frankie Pentangeli (Michael Gazzo). But this film incorporates another story into this story: the past. We meet Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) when he was growing up in Sicily and emigrates to New York City where be becomes connected with the mob life.I loved how the story is told thanks to the masterful storytelling by screenwriter Mario Puzo and director Coppola. They successfully tell two stories over the course of the movie without any trouble. Each story complements each other very well. The continuing saga of the present day family remains a high point. Of course the central character is Michael Corleone. The first film he was a man reluctant to take over the family business, but now he is turning into a control monster who trusts no one, not even his inner circle. It's a sad thing to watch as his morality crumbles and the final scene-one of cinema's most famous scenes, makes the case to show why Michael Corleone turns into a monster.I enjoyed the flashback sequences featuring young Vito. De Niro absolutely nails his role as Vito and he inherits the older Vito's mannerisms very well. It was fun to see how Vito turned into the man we knew him from the first film. The scenes in Sicily, where he is connected with a local mob boss is very powerful because Vito's mother was shot down. But that event helped turn Vito into the kind of man he was and to my happiness, Vito exacted the perfect kind of revenge. These scenes in Sicily and New York are beautifully shot and they really understood what New York was supposed to be in 1910.This is a film full of performances, all of them wonderful. Pacino excels as Michael Corleone once again. I really wish he won an Oscar for this role because he deserved it. His performance was effectively scary. Robert De Niro was absolutely amazing as the younger Vito and his role showed the kind of versatility this man has. Diane Keaton was effective as Kay. This film has Kay standing up to his man as she eventually leaves his side. Duvall is always great as Tom Hagen. John Cazale has a bigger part in the second film, as he tries to do what's best but simply does not have the brains and ultimately pays the price. His performance was a powerful one. Then we have the likes of the little known actors who gave an impression like Lee Strasberg who played the business partner Hyman Roth who wants Michael killed and Michael Gazzo who plays Frankie, a relative and associate of Michael's.The Godfather Part II is one of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather is an amazing film, but this one may just be a tad better. That is a rarity because 1.) Just look at the quality of the first film and 2.) sequels are rarely better than the original film. Speaking of sequels, this is the only sequel to this day that has won Best Picture at the Academy Award. Indeed, it's a very amazing feat. Although to be taken with a grain of salt, but on the website IMDb, this movie is ranked #2 of all-time. That goes to show the commercial value of the movie. I loved this movie for many reasons. From Al Pacino's wonderful performance to the chill-inducing score by Nino Rota. There was also a flashback sequence that hearkens back to the first movie as it brings back James Caan although Marlon Brando declined because he felt under-appreciated. Anyhow, Coppola does an amazing job with the first two movies in the series. That end shotjust wow.My Grade: A+",10,3,3,18 October 2017
The Killing Fields," An Utterly Powerful Movie!
","Wow, what a punch to the gut! If you are about to watch The Killing Fields for the first time, be prepared to feel the same way. It is an emotional tale that describes the horror of the Khmer Rouge reign. It is a thought-provoking tale based from the memoirs of a New York Times correspondent. The performances from the cast are excellent, especially from Haing S. Ngor, a doctor who never acted before. This is Roland Joffe's first film as director and he really understood the material. It is not only a movie that describes the horror of war, but it is a tale of friendship, loyalty, and love. David Puttnam, who produced this feature, actually said Joffe was the only man who understood what the film truly meant. Indeed he did, because this film is an emotional gut punch!As a history major, this time period is actually one I was not all too familiar with. I knew the Cambodian Civil War was in part due to the Khmer Rouge taking over the country. This film taught me how horrible these atrocities they committed. They killed over 17,000 people. They wiped out the intellectual population (such as teachers, doctors, etc). They banned western medicine and books. They wanted to turn Cambodia into an agricultural sector, and thousands starved as a result. In terms of crimes against humanity, this is about as bad as it gets. They were also known for their 'Year Zero' policy which outlawed all religion. One of the reasons why the film works because director Joffe, screenwriter Bruce Robinson, and cinematographer Chris Menges worked together effectively to bring these events to the screen. The film looked gorgeous thanks to Menges's exquisite camerawork. But sometimes it also looked brutal especially when we get a peek at the actual killing fields.The film is based off the eyewitness accounts of New York Times reporter, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston). He is covering the Civil War in Cambodia along with his intrepid photographer, Al Rockoff (John Malkovich). They team up with local journalist, Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) to cover the brutalities of this genocide. When the American forces evacuate, Pran sends his family with them. He, however, stays behind to help cover the truth of the war. When it is time for Schanberg to leave, Pran is forced to stay behind even with his family in the United States. That does not sit well with Schanberg. He uses all resources at hand to bring Pran to the states and to his family.Roland Joffe's casting decisions were interesting. He wanted to stay away from the big names which he felt would take away the emotional impact from the movie. Some names may sound familiar like Sam Waterston and John Malkovich, both of them had amazing performances. However, I want to focus on Haing S. Ngor. He won an Academy Award for his supporting performance, which was a very impressive feat. When he signed on for his role, he was a doctor with no acting experience. Furthermore, he actually survived the war that this film is based on. He spent four years at a forced labor camp, but eventually was able to escape to Thailand. He was only one of two nonprofessional actors to ever win an Academy Award. Very impressive feat and well-deserved because he did show amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. On a side note, this is actually Malkovich's first film role as well. He also did an amazing job!The Vietnam War and the conflicts in Southeast Asia brought some powerful movies like The Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now, but this story is a more grounded approach. It is about ordinary people being killed off just for the heck of it. The film threatens to become conventional at times as the story of a man going back into a war-torn nation to save someone dear to him is something that is done often. The Deer Hunter and Uncommon Valor are a few examples. That said, the film then throws that approach out the window when it decides to focus more on the Dith Pran's character. I liked that approach and it added more to the emotional impact.The Killing Fields is one of the best films of 1984. It is a very powerful film about love and friendship set in the backdrop of a terrifying war. If you do not shed a tear during the movie, you may not be human. The last lines of dialogue wrecked me. Perhaps, Mike Oldfield's score may have helped. The movie hits home the themes of friendship, but also how awful genocide is. This was an important history lesson for me, and I am glad to recommend this movie.My Grade: A",9,0,0,14 May 2020
Grease," Charming, Sweet, and Wonderful!
","1978's Grease, in many eyes, is a classic film. It is adored by all ages, and it seemingly passes down from generation to generation with love. This is one of the first movies I remember that have a sense of nostalgia. This movie plays well with the baby boomers because it hearkens back to the 1950's, when love was swamped in innocence. This movie got the feel of the 1950's correct, I have been told. The clothing, the background music, the charm, the acting, and the overall look of the movie. The actual songs are 1970's rock'n'roll style, and they are wonderful songs. The tone of the movie is upbeat, fun, and innocent. It may be somewhat predictable, but the movie itself was made well.There are a variety of reasons why I enjoy this movie. From the interpretation of the 1950's lifestyle to the wonderful tunes to the themes of true love-all of it elevates this movie into 'classic' territory. However, I am irked by a few things though. Mainly the age of the cast. Don't get me wrong, I think the performances are wonderful, but I despise when movies cast people in their late 20's or early 30's to play teenagers. Now some films can get away with it, but not Grease. You can tell that the people in the cast are not teenagers. Check out these ages at the time of movie release. John Travolta was 24, Olivia Newton-John was 30, and Stockard Channing was 34!!! But who am I to complain. This movie gave Travolta and Newton-John the career boost they needed.As for the story, it's nothing new. The story is one that has been told to death, but it is all about how a story is told that can make or break a movie. This love story was told with a passion thanks to the high-spirited screenplay from Bronte Woodard and the energizing direction from Randall Kleiser. This musical starts off at a California beach in 1959. Complete opposite personalities have fallen in love. Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and an Australian chick Sandy Olsson (Olivia-Newton John). After a summer romance expecting not to see each other again, both of them attend Rydell High unbeknownst to each other. They do their own things at first. Danny is a leader of a gang of greasers called the T-Birds and Sandy joins the Pink Ladies, led by the charming Rizzo (Stockard Channing). When they run in to each other for the first time, Sandy realizes Danny is a different man from the one she met at the beach. But will that stop her from getting back with Danny? Well, just watch the movie! Despite my concerns on the ages of the cast, I cannot deny how effective the performances are. In particular, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Travolta eventually became a major movie star, thanks to this movie. He knows how to sing and dance very well for an actor. It seems like he models his character off Elvis Presley. With the hairstyle and the black leather jacket, he seems to be Elvis-lite. He exerts fantastic chemistry with Olivia-Newton John. She also sang very well and her performance as the new girl in town is excellent. I liked the supporting cast very much. Stockard Channing did a solid job as the sex-happy leader of the Pink Ladies. Jeff Conaway as Danny's right-hand man, Kenickie. There are some veteran cast members who did a fine job particularly Eve Arden as Principal McGee and Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun.I was most impressed with Grease. I remember seeing it as a little kid and enjoying the music. But as a young adult, it resonates with me because it reminds me of my high school days. The music is great and most of these songs will stick in your brain for a lifetime. Such numbers to keep an eye out for are 'Hopelessly Devoted To You,' and 'You're The One That I Want.' The former song actually went on to be nominated for an Oscar. This film is all about song and dance. Two of my favorite sequences include the ballroom dance scene which was being filmed for national television and it features some slick dance moves. My other favorite scene is the ending dance sequence at the school's carnival. Very fun! On the whole, this film is upbeat, sweet, and a film to remember.My Grade: A-",9,10,11,18 October 2017
Footloose," Cheesy, but absolutely fun!!
","Off the bat, I'll admit that 1984's Footloose is pure, thrashy 1980's silliness. And.....I'm completely down for it. The movie holds dear to my soul because it is a big part of my childhood. My sixth-grade class spent a good portion of the year learning the songs, and our class trip was to see a play based on the hit movie in the lovely town of New Hope, Pennsylvania. The music is legitimately fantastic. Pure 80's music, but absolutely delightful songs. Who can resist the urge not to start dancing when the title song performed by Kenny Loggins comes on the radio, or Deneice Williams, 'Let's Hear It for the Boy.' These songs actually went on to be nominated for Academy Awards.No matter how preposterous the plot sounds, it's actually based on a real story. In 1898, the Oklahoma town of Elmore City outlawed dancing. A pastor from a nearby town was quoted saying dancing led to alcohol which would eventually lead to death. The city made national headlines in 1980 when a junior prom was awarded to the town and the city's council overturned the law....just barely. Screenwriter Dean Pritchard became very interested in the story, and did his due diligence with his research. He also wrote the lyrics to many of the original songs. Paramount boarded the film and then Herbert Ross (Weekend at Bernie's) was hired to direct the film.Taking forth the classic theme of rebellion, the film introduces us to Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon), a city boy who moved from Chicago to the oilfields in the middle of nowhere. He also loves to dance and listen to his rock'n'roll music. But he suffers a serious case of culture shock when he finds out they are banned in his new town. His misery is tested when he meets Ariel (Lori Singer), a very popular but troubled blonde. She is also the daughter of Reverend Shaw (John Lithgow) who came up with the law after his son died in a car crash because of the booze. The two have a troubled relationship, which is why Shaw's wife, Vi (Dianne Wiest) is the mediator. Now then Ren is in town, he is ready to rile up the town and bring back dancing!The performances are solid. Kevin Bacon is your quintessential 80's character. The hairdo, the dancing, the confident teenager and he brings forth plenty of charm as Ren. It looks like he is one amazing dancer, but fun fact! He only did some of the dances as four stunt doubles were used with Bacon. John Lithgow does well as the Bible-thumping minister who is the foil to Bacon's dancing habits. Dianne Wiest, as you may notice with all her roles, is a very soothing presence. As a normal routine for 1980's flicks, keep an eye out for future stars. Such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend and Chris Penn as Ren's friend.This movie may not be the best musical, but it's one of the more memorable ones. I mean who can resist the toe-tapping dance sequences or any of the music really. The movie throws an exorbitant amount of cheese at you and you have to be willing to suck in the cheese. If not, I have a feeling you may not enjoy the movie. Or you may be one of those who abhors dancing.Footloose was a major box office hit and one of the highest-grossing films of 1984. It became a cult classic considering how many people are devoted to it now. It's hard to believe this is based on a true story, but it most certainly is. The music is wonderful and never grows old. The performances are sweet. The script is cheesy, but what else can we expect from a 1980's teen musical. I certainly had a fun time!My Grade: B",8,0,0,5 April 2020
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Film!
","Over the course of his career, Alfred Hitchcock has made many highly-regarded works and every film of his was treated like an event. After a very successful decade of the 1950's which includes famed works such as Rear Window and Vertigo, Hitchcock closes out the decade with perhaps his greatest work, 1959's North by Northwest. After the dark erotic film that was Vertigo, Hitchcock decided to make something more fun, action/adventure-oriented, and something light-hearted in general. This film is essentially the first James Bond film, even though the first James Bond film would be produced several years later. This is an incredibly tense and suspenseful spy thriller that boasts two of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history-the crop duster scene and the dramatic rescue upon the rocks of Mount Rushmore. This film has lots of incredible talent working on camera and behind the scenes. In addition to Hitchcock, we have great acting from the likes of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The film was written by one of the greatest screenwriters of the era, Ernest Lehman. The film has a distinctive look because of Robert Burks's camerawork and texture is given to the sound of the movie because of the eerie score of Bernard Hermann's. This movie is a tense spy thriller, a screwball romantic comedy, and a tale about the Cold War/paranoia/government spying all in one movie. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a successful Manhattan advertising agent who is abducted by two strange men at the Plaza Hotel. Thornhill is taken to the mansion of a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) where he is believed to be an undercover federal agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill denies it, and he is forced to drink bourbon and to ride in a car down a twisted, winding road. He escapes the planned execution, and the police refuses to believe his story. He eventually gets framed for murder and now is on the run. He takes a cross-country train to make his escape where he runs into the mysterious, cold femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). It is unclear at first why she wants to aid him, but we later learn she may be more than meets the eye. From the train, we then head to those famous scenes involving the murderous crop duster airplane in the cornfields of Illinois and the harrowing escape from Mt. Rushmore. The acting is very good, but that really should not be a surprise given the names of the cast. To this point, Cary Grant had a very long career. This might be his best performance. The contributions he added to the film is wonderful. Eva Marie Saint, who made an impression acting opposite of Marlon Brando in 1954's On the Waterfront, adds elegance and class to the role of Eve Kendall. James Mason plays a convincing villain and he does seem like the prototypical James Bond villain. His henchman, Leonard is played by the wonderful Martin Landau. Landau would go on to have a wonderful late-age career, but let's not forget that he was in an Alfred Hitchcock film. There are so many Alfred Hitchcock films to choose from when it comes to naming his best film, but I can say without a doubt that North by Northwest is his most entertaining film. In addition to making the spy genre more accessible to the audience, Hitchcock and Lehman added a little bit of everything. We have quirky and funny dialogue, great action/chase scenes, and some lovely romance. Also, I really need to discuss the crop duster scene. That scene was made so well, and my heart wanted to explode because of how tense that scene was. I felt scared for Cary Grant's character. I am quite amazed at the technical achievement that went to making that scene, and even by today's standards. Are there themes/motifs behind the film? Both Hitchcock and Lehman said no. However, given the time of the film's release, there are some central ideas regarding Cold War paranoia and government spying. If you like James Bond films, you have this movie to thank. Come for the (multiple) twists, stay to see an entertaining spy thriller. My Grade: A",9,2,2,6 October 2018
Doctor Zhivago," A Beautiful Romantic Epic!
","The 1940's to the 1960's was the era that was famous for the production of numerous epics, famous for its lavish production design, colorful performances, and a story that can be told on a large canvas usually with some sort of historical background. Unfortunately, the era of epics began to die down around the release of this movie, Doctor Zhivago in 1965. In fact, many film scholars call this film the 'last great epic of this era.' That is not entirely true as films similar as Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur springs up every once in awhile. But there is no denying, that epics began to die off as the Hollywood studios began to change the content into more of a modern America cinema.Ironically, Doctor Zhivago was the first epic I have watched from this era and it was the film that brought my attention to these popular films. For the most part, I very much enjoyed it. It took place in a historical period I am interested in-the Russian Revolution that took place in 1917. The film used this revolution as a source to tell a great story. In the past, critics have been vocal in their points that the film fails to talk about the history with too much detail. But that is precisely the point. The film effectively uses the history as a background in order to tell the main story-the sweeping romance story. I am usually not the one to enjoy a romance film, but this film is beautiful, both literally and figuratively. The film features beautiful cinematography and the landscapes are gorgeous which is not surprising because the film is directed by the great David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai), and he is precise when it comes to art direction. Based off the bestseller 1958 novel by Boris Pasternak, this film is about love at the height of turmoil in Russia. The movie begins with a stern Soviet officer, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) describing some events to this worker girl, who may be related to the people told in the officer's story. Here is how the particular story goes. Lara (Julie Christie) is romantically attached to a man named Pasha (Tom Courtenay), one of the Revolution's leaders. She cannot keep up with his demands for the revolution. Also, her mother and herself were being victimized by this scoundrel named Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) who is a very political man. As Lara goes to shoot Komarovsky at a party in an act of revenge, that is where she meets the true love of her life, Zhivago (Omar Sharif), who happens to be happily married to his wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). Nonetheless, Zhivago falls in love with Lara. That inspires Zhivago to write poetry, mainly about his love of Lara. Meanwhile, all of this is happening during the events of the Russian Revolution where there is lots of blood and violence as the Russian peasants plan to overthrow the Russian monarchy.One of the film's strengths is the masterful performances from all the actors involved. Omar Sharif was seen in Lean's previous effort, but now he is a star thanks to his career-best performance as Zhivago. It is amazing what Sharif was able to as the title character. He was able to give his character a soul. Julie Christie put herself on the map in her marvelous turn as Lara. She gave her character depth and created a believable portrait of a woman who fell madly in love. Despite the strong lead performances, don't count out the supporting performances which may be even better than the lead ones. I loved Rod Steiger's performance as the rascal, Komarovsky. He really seemed to make his character soulless. We get a good performance from Alec Guinness, as the Soviet officer who narrates the story and he also happens to be the half-brother of Zhivago. I loved Tom Courtenay's performance as Pasha, the man devoted to a new Russia. Finally, I thought Geraldine Chaplin was okay as Tonya, but I felt Tonya was the only offbeat character in the film. She knew what was going on between Lara and her husband, but she takes that romance way too well to give such a believable performance. There is no way she could have been that understanding in reality.In addition to the sweeping shots of beautiful landscapes, this film features a magnificent score by Maurice Jarre. When first released, there were people who hated the main theme known as 'Lara's Theme.' It's a beautiful theme, but I believe it wasn't well-liked at first because it played constantly over the course of the 200-minute long film. But the fact remains is that it's one of the best themes and most well-known themes of any film in history.David Lean directed this film and it's clear that this is not his greater effort. Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai are masterpieces. Doctor Zhivago will just have to settle on being a great film. The visuals, the score, and the performances are perfect, but the story has some issues. The film is a bit clunky at times and there are moments where the romance goes to far. I would have loved to see more of the history added into the film, but I'm not too upset because the way it was used as a background to the story was excellent. I also wonder about the end shot, and so apparently have many others. I wasn't too sure if it fit into the context of the movie and if it was meant to be some symbol. But watch the film, and you can make the decision yourself. Not a masterpiece, but it's very close in being so. Featuring breath-taking cinematography, fine performances, and a sweeping romantic story, Doctor Zhivago is another film of David Lean's to add to your collection.My Grade: A-",9,1,1,11 October 2017
The Shining," Kubrick's Visionary Horror Film!
","Today, I will review the 1980 genre classic, The Shining. Directed by masterful director Stanley Kubrick, this film went down as one of the greatest modern day horror masterpieces. Although Stephen King will 'kindly' disagree. The movie is borderline sadistic in how it psychologically messes with the audience. The amount of twists and turns add up to one hell of a psychological thriller that made a mess out of my brain. The film maintains an eerie atmosphere throughout the film and it never settles until days after the end credits rolled. Jack Nicholson delivers another career-defining performance as Jack Torrance. The actor's charisma and scary demeanor matches the tone of the movie perfectly. However, Shelley Duvall quite literally took me out of the movie at times with her blubbering performance.I will explain the basic premise of the movie the best I can. There are so many different parts to the story, so many different interpretations and themes to make sense of, so the story can be difficult to comprehend once you go deeper and deeper into the story. Alas, one of the many traits of a Kubrick film! Jack Torrance (Nicholson) agrees to spend the winter as a caretaker at an old hotel named, 'The Overlook Hotel.' The hotel is known to have an angry, haunted past. These demons and ghosts slowly catch up with Jack as he becomes more angry, depressed, and drunk, thus effecting his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and son, Danny. Danny uses a special talent of his called, 'The Shining' to alert the outside world of all the events that are occurring in the hotel.One of the things that this movie is infamous for is how it made Stephen King loathe it. He wrote the book on which this movie is based on. It is safe to say that Kubrick took liberty of the source material and switched things around, which King was not happy with. As a reader of the book, I can say both mediums are different. As a rabid fan of movies, I do really like the movie for what it was. An incredibly creepy horror that messes with your perceptions. The screenplay, written by Kubrick, can sometimes be hard to follow. That being said, it is something that is open to interpretation. I have read thoughts ranging from simple themes such as effects of alcoholism to how this story alludes to fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretel and Three Little Pigs. There are other people asking, 'Is this real? Are these ghosts actually real or are they the figment of the Torrances' imaginations?' Everybody has their own interpretation. Just watch the movie, and you shall see.I mentioned before that Jack Nicholson delivers another one amazing performance. After his 1974 feature Chinatown, I would not think that would be possible. His demeanor is tough to start out with, but once he is driven to madness by the hotel, he becomes downright crazy and that was great to see. When he says that famous line, 'Here's Johnny,' you can see how unhinged he has become. On the other side of the spectrum, I thought Duvall was mostly terrible. Her constant screaming and crying sounded fake and quite honestly, made my ears bleed. Her performance took me out of the film at times which is disappointing because of Nicholson's amazing performance and Kubrick's stylish directing.The film maintains a consistent atmosphere of eeriness. The Overlook Hotel is an old-fashioned place set in the mountains and miles away from civilization which advances the creepiness of the story. Cinematographer John Alcott does a wonderful job making the film look creepy as it is. His use of the colors and production design was something special. Also that music created by Wendy Carlos was unsettling, which also added to the film. The ghosts were creepy too. Those twin girls? Enough said. Also, fantastic ending story-wise and visually.Overall, The Shining is a great psychological horror film and a modern-day masterpiece bolstered by Jack Nicholson's performance. This is one of the creepiest-looking films I have ever seen. I find it sad that I was abruptly taken away from the story from Shelley Duvall's acting which took down the final score of this movie a notch. But after the commercial failure of his previous film, 1975's underrated Barry Lyndon, it's nice to see Kubrick having mainstream success once more.'Redrum' 'Come play with us, Danny.

Apocalypse Now," 'I Love the Smell of Napalm in the Morning.'
","I have many ideas and thoughts about Apocalypse Now. Based off Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness, it is considered to be one of the best films of the twentieth century and one of the best Vietnam War movies ever made. I can generally agree with that assessment, but this movie is overly complicated sometimes. The movie has much to say on character and Darwinism. This movie follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he is tasked to travel downriver from Vietnam to Cambodia to assassinate a former American colonel, Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). But when Willard arrives to meet the Colonel, he realizes all is not what it really is. Kurtz has sided with the North Vietnamese for reasons of Darwinism and staying alive. He confesses how much stronger the Vietcong were than the Americans. They would go to any length to win the war and that is what gave them strength according to Kurtz. Kurtz was once one of the greatest soldiers in the American army and now after the reality of the war set in, he is taken over by madness and despair. This entire movie is about the journey Willard takes to understand what exactly Kurtz has gone through over the course of the war because Willard is going through the same ordeal.This movie shows both the joy and angst of filmmaking as director Francis Ford Coppola will say. This movie was a very hard shoot as it took over four years to film. (Actor Laurence Fishburne was 14 when he began shooting, and 18 when it ended and Harrison Ford filmed his part before Star Wars made him famous..and that was two years before this movie's release). The movie was full of complications ranging from sickness (Martin Sheen had a heart attack on set) to actors being very hard to work with (Brando being Brando). But in the end, this was Coppola's baby. Sure, he had The Godfather films but this is his heart and soul. With all the trouble this film had, it is remarkable how great this film is. Coppola really makes clear what he thought about the war itself and how hard it damaged the human psyche. He underlines the hell these humans have gone through over the course of this journey.One of the best supporting characters is Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (he said the opening quote of this review). His performance actually earned him an Academy Award nomination rightfully so. Talking about insanity, this man only cares about surfing and beaches. He only agrees to help Willard take a beach because that beach had great waves. Plus in the Redux version (which this review is from), Kilgore uses helicopters to chase down Willard on the river because of accusations that they stole their surfboards. He also uses his choppers as he plays Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' as he swoops down over young schoolchildren. It's a little over-the-top, but I guess that fits the insanity part very well. Another fun supporting character is Dennis Hopper's role as a photojournalist for Kurtz. He is supposed to be the funnyman and he incites poetry which he clearly heard from Kurtz himself.There is one thing that this film wouldn't work without and that is the opening song. 'The End' from The Doors is an iconic tune and it has a significance in the film. I can't imagine the opening sequence of the treeline being blown away working well without this song. Also keep an eye on the Oscar-winning cinematography from Vittorio Storaro. The movie is utterly gorgeous and he created some of the most beautiful sequences in cinema history.As well-liked this film is, it does have its share of controversies. Brando, whom was perfect for the role, had a salary of one million dollars (which was unheard of during its time). But there is a sequence in the movie that created even more controversy. The live killing of a cow as part of a sacrifice. Animals are supposed to be protected during movie-making, but this movie actually killed a cow for an incredibly gruesome scene. That is one scene that really appalls me due to an actual animal being killed.Apocalypse Now is an important movie. Following the success of 1978's The Deer Hunter, it proved there was an audience for Vietnam War movies after all. It took me several tries to realize what a monumental and influential film this is. It is a very long movie, but it's a journey about how humankind reacts to the horrors of war. You see Kurtz as a villain at first, but as you come to the end of the movie, that is where we gain some sympathy for the man after everything he has been through. Francis Ford Coppola created a very important piece of art-the biggest film of his career. This is a hard movie to get through, but I think it's worth watching in the end.My Grade: A-",9,3,3,18 October 2017
Gandhi," Powerful Movie About a Man with a Pure Heart!
","'I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you.'-Ben Kingsley (as Gandhi).The above quote, spoken by Ben Kingsley in the 1982 drama Gandhi, shows what kind of man Mahatma Gandhi was. In a harsh world filled with violence and racism, this one man became a prophet, a messiah if you will. He wanted to change the world for the better using non-violent tactics. He wanted to use nonviolence to end segregation against Indians in South Africa, to end British rule in India, to create a peaceful country for Muslims in a country today known as Pakistan. Through his methods, Gandhi achieved what only most people dream of achieving in their lifetimes. He was a man for the people and no matter who the person is or what kind of religion that person believes in, he loved you no matter what. In this long, sprawling epic, you will become a believer of this spiritual man. At least I did. This is the kind of man that we need in our world today. A man full of hope, compassion, love, nonmaterialistic-just to name a few adjectives.Director Richard Attenborough had been wanting to make this film for decades prior to the films release. Attenborough had meetings set up with and approval from various key figures to make this film happen-but it was never meant to be at first. Also, David Lean wanted to make a film based on Gandhi's life after he completed production on The Bridge on the River Kwai, but instead went to work on Lawrence of Arabia. Later on, David Lean met with Attenborough and you can see his influence in this epic. I saw portions of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago at times. Once Attenborough was able to get funding from the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi- he was able to make the film he wanted. Attenborough was the perfect director for the movie. He wanted to create a grand epic, but one with the feeling of a smaller film. He didn't care too much about the landscapes or the scope of the film. All he wanted to do was focus on telling a careful, level-headed story about the person who changed the world for many-and he was able to do thanks to his sure-handed direction.The film starts in 1893 with a young lawyer named Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) traveling first-class on a South African train. He was not aware of any segregation laws and thus was thrown off the train. To combat these laws, he starts a non-violent protest against segregation of Indians in South Africa. These protests led in many arrests and global attention for Gandhi, but he still achieved victory in the end. After he returns to India, he is asked to assist in the independence of India from Great Britain's rule. He agrees, but faces more issues such as imprisonment, violence against protestors, etc. But with England still suffering from World War 2, they granted India their freedom. However, there was still more work to do. There was internal conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. Gandhi declares a hunger strike to stop these groups from fighting, in which he does eventually succeed. In addition to making many followers, Gandhi also made many enemies and that might make him a target.The role of Gandhi was played to utter perfection by a newcomer named Ben Kingsley. Kingsley, who had Indian descent, was able to create the mannerisms and the style that made Gandhi one of the most important, influential figures of the twentieth century. This is one of the best acting performances you will ever see. Love it or hate it, there is no denying the power of Kingsley's performance-which led him to claim the Best Actor Academy Award. The supporting cast does fill out nicely around Kingsley. There are some excellent British thespians such as John Gielgud and Trevor Howard. Some Americans- Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen deliver strong performances, although their characters were pushed away somewhat. Also, keep an eye out for young Daniel-Day Lewis!Gandhi is a spellbinding tour-de-force epic with a lead acting performance that perfectly captures the essence of one of the most beloved and influential historical figures. The lush cinematography by Ronnie Taylor and the stirring music by Ravi Shankar adds an 'epic' feeling seen in films like Lawrence of Arabia, but Attenborough was able to perfectly capture the intimate character moments that we know this man of. Whether it is watching Gandhi suffer from his hunger strike or seeing his followers shot down by the British-there is no shortage of powerful scenes. The movie does clock in well over three hours and it can be felt at times, but in no way in this movie boring. It is a movie well-deserved of its Best Picture victory. To help see the good in themselves, this is the perfect movie to see.My Grade: A-",9,1,1,26 July 2019
Gone with the Wind," The Best Film of All Time?
","Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939, it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado, lets delve right into this masterpiece!
This movie is broken into two sections; pre-Civil War and post-Civil War. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a strong-willed woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing, she is put through a lot. However, she has feelings for Ashley (Leslie Howard). But Ashley is set to marry her cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new, mysterious man at the party, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. 
The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny; both economically (planting cotton and owning a lumber business) and sexually (going after the men she chooses). Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters, but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' comes from. 
 Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism, but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time, at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines, and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award. 
 It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately, both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the sky-high expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his party-boy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh, the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable, mesmerizing Scarlett. 
 One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them, but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also, the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner, we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores. 
 Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind is a majestic, sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face, will make you laugh, will make you shudder up with tension, and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long, this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story, and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz, 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film. My Grade: A+",10,5,8,22 May 2018
1941," My Least Favorite Spielberg Film!
","Every filmmaker has their own flops or mediocre movies, no matter how great the directors are. Martin Scorsese has New York, New York, Francis Ford Coppola has Jack, and the list goes on. In this instance, the great Steven Spielberg has 1941. It was crushing for critics and audiences because Spielberg wowed them with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, so everyone was eagerly anticipating his next project. I liked the idea behind the movie, but I felt it to be a misfire. The movie, of course, satires World War Two and the military, but it was not funny at all and that is the biggest failure of all. Jokes are thrown at you at the speed of light, but everything feels so forced. I merely chuckled from time to time, but I wonder if I did that out of respect. In addition to poorly-written jokes, the movie is loud, obnoxious, and has way too many explosions for this type of movie.Well, I had to get the bad stuff out of the way first. However, there were some redeemable qualities within the film. The film has a large cast filled to the brim with outstanding actors. Granted, many of them were not used to the best of their abilities, but the performances were still good enough. Spielberg did continue to prove himself as a capable director, as I thought his direction was good enough. Finally, the best part of the movie is the music by Spielberg's usual collaborator, John Williams. Spielberg always said that William's theme was his favorite out of all the movies they did together. High praise!The film was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale both of whom would gain fame in the mid 1980's with Back to the Future. Needless to say, the script they wrote was not their finest hour. The central idea they came up with is brilliant though. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor just happened and the state of California is on their toes since they are supposedly the next victims. When a rogue Japanese submarine appears just off the coast, we must ask whether or not Hollywood is ready for war.The cast has many great names and it was a pleasure to see these actors even if they did not live up to their full potential. Check out these names. Dan Aykroyd, James Belushi, Murray Hamilton, Christopher Lee, Ned Beatty, Warren Oates, Robert Stack, and the list goes on. Plus, there are some rather intriguing cameos by James Caan and Penny Marshall. Plus, John Candy and Mickey Rourke have minor roles. Some have more screen time than others. If there were to be a central character, it would be the character of James Belsuhi. If you liked his Animal House performance, then you will like this performance.I was quite disappointed with the movie especially with all the talent involved. This film was meant to be a slapstick satire, but I cannot help if this movie would have been received better if this was more dramatic. After all, Stanley Kubrick did suggest the same thing to Spielberg before it was released. Spielberg did later admit that after the enormous success of his previous two movies, he became a little arrogant and took this film as a lesson. That shows because his next two movies were Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial, two of the most popular movies of all time. Unfortunately, 1941 is an uneven movie with unfunny jokes. Everything is thrown at you for two hours, and it's hard to make out what is going on. The visual effects are cool and the score is amazing, but I wanted to truly like this movie as a Spielberg fan and a World War 2 buff. It's watchable, but only just.My Grade: C-",7,2,4,16 February 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," One of All Time's Best Epics!
","Over the course of six decades, Lawrence of Arabia have been given names such as 'the epic of all epics.' People always mention this film when talking about influential movies or favorite movies. In fact, this film gave way to famous directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Martin Scorsese. These fore-mentioned directors based their films off the style of this film. No one knew it in 1962, but this film would be one of the most influential films of all time. Believe it or not, I actually didn't think too much of the film the first time I saw it. I thought it was overlong and boring. I must have been in a bad mood that day, because I simply loved the film upon my second viewing. The scope of the film is incredible and I love the lush, gorgeous cinematography. The film is sweepingly beautiful and I still love seeing the shots of the desert sun. Everything in the film has a gentle beauty to it, even the violent battles featured in the film, so it's no surprise the film won an Oscar for its cinematography.The film itself is based off the historical adventures of T.E Lawrence. The movie begins with Lawrence's death at the age of 46 due to a motorcycle accident. Then it flashbacks to 1916 with Lawrence as a young intelligence officer stationed in Cairo, Egypt. Around this time, the Arabs began a revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Turkey. Lawrence is given leave to investigate the revolt. However, he creates an army on the side of the Arabs and he uses his army to fight against the slowly-weakening Turkish troops.Despite many people loving this spectacle, this film had its share of controversies. Mostly in the way of historical inaccuracies. For example, the Lawrence depicted in this film does not resemble the Lawrence of reality. The Lawrence in the movie, portrayed by Peter O'Toole, is taller, skinnier, has a very boyish face, and speaks in a sarcastic way. His mannerisms also are different, and the story goes that Lawrence's family found the film to be stupid and that it insults the memory of Lawrence. Also, new characters were introduced such as Sheriff Ali, who was a Arab soldier fighting alongside Lawrence in the movie. Other notable differences were in the movie, Prince Faisal, the Arab leader was depicted as a middle-age man when in reality he was barely 30 years old. Also, General Allenby, the boss of Lawrence, was depicted as cold and mean to Lawrence. But there is enough evidence to prove they actually may have been good friends in real life. Also there have been complaints that not all of Lawrence's exploits were mentioned in the film.Now what is my response to all these controversies? I think it's a load of bull. I am always for one for filmmakers to try to make their movie accurate as possible. But the bottom line is that the purpose of a movie is to entertain. If that means a film has some inaccuracies, so be it. If I needed to learn about a topic, I would watch a documentary. That being said, movies are always a good starting point to learn about a particular subject (in this case, T.E Lawrence).This film was directed by David Lean, a master when it comes to epics. We have already seen his 1957 feature, Bridge on the River Kwai. This film is his follow-up to Kwai's success, and it's interesting because this film is even more successful, critically and financially. Lean is an excellent director, although he is known for his old-fashioned methods and clashing with his actors on set. There is no denying he created a powerful, influential film. He created a straightforward narrative on the outside, but he raises complex questions on the inside.The performances are all wonderful. Peter O'Toole, although boyish-looking and does not resemble the real Lawrence much, does an amazing job. he does bring to life the eccentric ways of Lawrence. A powerful scene he brought to life is after a rather suicidal trek across the scorching desert, he goes back to help a fallen comrade and bring him to safety. Omar Sharif, a major star in Egypt, does an exceptional job as Sheriff Ali. I bet if you didn't see the cast list, you would have never recognized Alec Guinness. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't because he does an exceptional job as Prince Faisal, the calm leader of the Arabs. Guinness was very immersed in his character, which isn't surprising because he always gives his very best. Jack Hawkins does a good job as the manipulative commander in General Allenby. The whole cast does a great job; Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Arthur Kennedy as the American reporter who turns the exploits of Lawrence into a myth, and Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton.It's a wonder that Lawrence of Arabia was ever made. It was a 216-minute movie plus intermission. It was a film that had no love story (or women for that matter), not a lot of action, and was filmed in the desert. Usually, the big man with the money would have refused, but this film was given a chance and it was quite a chance to take. People adored this film from its release all the way to today. The performances and the cinematography are always singled out. I personally must single out the score by Maurice Jarre. He composed an incredible piece of music, and it's one of my top soundtracks ever. The film won 7 Oscars, including the well-deserved best picture. It's a beautiful film about an eccentric man who did a lot to help his country and to help developing nations. There are battle scenes, but the film is not about the action. It's about T.E Lawrence.My Grade: A",9,3,5,10 January 2016
The Elephant Man," John Hurt's Amazing Performance!
","'I am not an animal. I am a human being.' These are the heartbreaking words that John Merrick says when he gets fed up with people gawking at him and comparing him to an animal. David Lynch's The Elephant Man is a hard-hitting story about a real-life person who is an outcast due to his deformities. However, Lynch who also wrote the script, portrays this subject matter in a more positive light. Themes of courage, and the fact that everyone is human no matter the circumstances are brought to light here. Prepare to bring the tissues, because this story is an emotional story and I can guarantee no one will have a dry eye when the end credits appear on screen.I will go right into the thick of the story. John Merrick (John Hurt), nicknamed 'The Elephant Man' is a man with a wonderful personality, but is hated by the English society because of his deformed body. He was discovered at a freak show by a kind doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), and Treves gives Merrick the life and the treatment that he has never received before.The true story is a tragic and a heartwarming story. It makes you lose your faith in humanity, but then you believe not all hope is lost. There are caring people out in the world and the film gives you prime examples of these people. In addition to Treves, we have Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) who is Treve's understanding superior, Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who became a wonderful lady friend to Merrick, and Mothershead (Wendy Hiller) who took good care of Merrick in the hospital.David Lynch is a great director who is known for directing very strange films. When the film opened, and the disturbing montage of elephants and Merrick's mom giving birth appeared, I became worried that the movie would end up being some odd take on this story. Fortunately, this turned out to be one of Lynch's more straightforward stories he told on the big screen. He took a difficult and odd subject matter, and turned it into one of the most emotional stories I have seen.The performances are fantastic up and down the board. The one standout is John Hurt's mesmerizing performance as John Merrick that garnered him an Academy Award nomination. He was always a committed actor, and that really shows in this film. In addition to his wonderfully horrifying makeup work, you believe that you are watching 'The Elephant Man.' You feel his pain and his emotions as he tries to live with his deformities in an era where people like him are not accepted. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a strong performance as Frederick Treves. He came across as aloof, but kind-hearted enough to help Merrick. The film does a good job highlighting the relationship between these two characters.If there are any criticisms I had to make, it would be with pacing. The film portrays Merrick as a man who can hardly speak then in the next instant, he would be quoting Shakespeare with exact precision. I had difficulty keeping up with the timeline, and it caused some confusion at times.The Elephant Man also made some history. People in the industry were angered because the film didn't get the proper recognition for its makeup. That caused the Academy, in the following year, to create a category for makeup. The makeup artist, Christopher Tucker did an amazing job creating the real, authentic look of John Merrick. The work put into the makeup was grueling, and John Hurt has been quoted saying this is the film that made him 'hate' acting. That hard effort paid off! This movie is a wonderful, emotional true story about the man named John Merrick who went from a freak show performer to a man being recognized for the person he is with the help of some very good individuals. John Hurt's performance is one for the ages, and he has a bunch of wonderful supporting performances to work with. I liked Lynch's idea to film the movie in black-and-white. Freddie Francis's camera work is put to fine use in the movie. In a world with increasing darkness, The Elephant Man gave me a little hope.My Grade: A-",9,2,2,13 November 2017
Dog Day Afternoon," Another Committed Performance By Al Pacino!
","I have a confession to make. As I was watching Dog Day Afternoon for this review, I realized my DVD copy was scratched and it would not play the last half of the movie. But luckily, I have seen this movie before and I am fortunate enough to remember how the movie ended. Both times I watched the film, I enjoyed it very much. Given the talent behind and in front of the camera, that comes to me as no surprise. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director who directed incredible films such as 12 Angry Men and Serpico. Lumet reunites with his Serpico star Al Pacino to create a very fine portrayal of a real-life story about a Brooklyn bank robbery. The film is more subtle and quiet when compared to other Lumet films, but the film has an unexpected lighter tone. The film has some funny lines and I was surprised how much I laughed given the subject matter, but then I realized Lumet was not trying to make a serious film. The thematic issue of gay marriage gave the movie a political edge which also surprised me. I was expecting a straightforward movie about a bank robbery, but I got something more in-depth. There is motivation behind what the characters do and that caused me to sympathize with them, despite robbing a bank and holding people hostage. You may have figured by now, but I really enjoyed this film very much.Believe it or not, but this story is based off real events which occurred at the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York in 1972. The bank was held up by this gay man named Sonny (Al Pacino) and his dim-witted crime partner Sal (John Cazale) in order to get money to pay for Sonny's partner sex change operation. The manager and tellers agree to cooperate with Sonny, but things go south when Sonny realizes there is not anything to steal because the money has been packed up for the day. When Sonny gets in contact with Police Captain Moretti (Charles Durning), he gets nervous when he realizes the entire bank is surrounded by cops. Now he must negotiate a way to get what he wants without compromising the safety of everyone in the bank.Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors of all-time. He commits to every single role of his, even if the movie stinks. Obviously, this is not a stinker but it is impressive to see Pacino so committed to this role. I loved his performances in the two Godfather movies and Serpico. So it comes to no surprise I am impressed with this performance. This time around he brings an edge of comedy to his performance and it works spectacularly. The scene where he is being live broadcasted and he skips around in happiness telling people he's a star, that was a wonderful but funny scene. John Cazale does a fine job as Sal. I felt Sal's character goes hand-in-hand with John's character in The Godfather, but regardless it was still a fine performance. Charles Durning plays it tough as the NYPD captain as he should because it easily fits his persona. Finally, Chris Sarandon as Sonny's lover Leon does a fine job in his small role-a role that got him nominated for an Oscar.I thought it was interesting about the political angle given to this movie. Gay marriage would not be a major political issues until many years after the release of this film, but it was interesting to see the viewpoint of the movie given how gay marriage was frowned upon during this era. The movie played the sympathy cards for Sonny and Leon and it gave a motivation for Sonny's actions. The movie does not revile Sonny, but instead it makes him a deeply-flawed character.Overall, Dog Day Afternoon is a excellent movie. It has committed performances by everyone, especially by Pacino. Sadly, Pacino still did not receive an Oscar up to this point despite being nominated for every movie he was in until 1975 including this one. Sidney Lumet continues to bring his style into all of his films. I love Lumet because like auteurs like Scorsese and Allen, many of his films are about New York. Each individual brings something to their films about the great city of New York and they make these films even more interesting to watch. I like the way Lumet turned the film from just an ordinary crime film to a film that is intelligent, creative, and still fun to watch. This is another impressive film on the resume for Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino.My Grade: A",9,1,2,18 October 2017
Amadeus," My Favorite Film of 1984!
","Amadeus, without a doubt, is my favorite film from 1984. Looking in from the outside, the movie looks to be a dark, disturbing tale about the feud between legendary composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. In reality, while the film has some extremely dark moments, it is also light-hearted and quite funny. The casting is perfect. Tom Hulce as Mozart is one of the best casting of all-time, and it comes out of nowhere! The costumes are fantastic. Should I even mention the music? This film made me appreciate the fact that Mozart is one of the greatest minds in human history.In 1975, a movie was released called One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. That movie was one of my favorite films that year and also won Best Picture at the Oscars, just like this movie. Both films were directed by Milos Forman. Forman directed the heck out of the movie. Each scene was expertly staged and meaningful. Considering the world was entering the MTV stage, Forman took a giant gamble creating a three-hour long movie about classical music. That gamble paid off. I liked where he chose to shoot his film- in his native Czechoslovakia. Even though the film is set in Vienna, Prague had the scenery of what the world would look like two centuries prior.People question whether the film is historically accurate or not. From the beginning, Forman and writer Peter Schaffer made it clear that the film is only loosely based on history. Most of the movie is just a drama made to entertain. The central premise of the film is the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri. While sometimes competing against each other for commissions, the two men were actually good friends. Salieri is depicted as a loner with a religious heart but was actually a married men with eight children. So, before you decide to critique the film on its accuracy, well this what the filmmakers intended.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is in love with Wolfgang Mozart's (Tom Hulce) music. He finds it divine and out-of-this-world. Salieri, who resides on the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), desperately wishes he were as good as Mozart. As a devout, religious man, he believed his talent was to praise God. He receives the shock of his life when he discovers Mozart is actually a vulgar, and rather self-centered man. He asks God why this creature deserves even better musical gifts than himself. He takes it to himself to take revenge on Mozart...and ultimately God.The movie is a period costume drama and they can be somewhat dry and stuffy if not casted well. The casting here is absolutely genius and it makes the film fun as ever. If you seen Tom Hulce's performance in Animal House, you would not expect him to play a composer. Mark Hamill was originally considered but Forman thought his Luke Skywalker persona would be a distraction. Hulce's casting is genius. He played Mozart like a 60's punk hipster, and it worked so well. That laugh, though. Very unforgettable! On the flip side, F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri with such intensity. He commanded the screen each time he was on. Whether he was imitating Mozart's father (was played wonderfully by Roy Dotrice) or just giving the overview of the story whilst in the madhouse, just stay for his performance. I also liked Elizabeth Berridge's performance as Mozart's wife, Constanze.Do I really need to mention the music? When performed well, Mozart's music is like heaven. Mozart is a genius and it amazes me he was able to create such magic at a young age. Just to think in today's age, we get Taylor Swift. Who am I to judge? There is a reason why he is one of the greatest minds in history. If you like classical music or not, you will not forget Mozart. Forman did a wonderful job in making sure Mozart's music help tell the story.Amadeus is a film that asks important questions. If you know someone who is better than you, how would you react? How would you feel? Would you do anything? Such as murder the better person, as the film suggested Salieri did in the opening scene. Jealousy is the big theme that drives the movie and it allows us to feel for Salieri when the film ended. The character of Mozart is why the film is allowed to breathe with light-heartedness and humor. History remains to be seen whether Mozart was a crude person or not or had that infectious laugh (which I hated at first). Anyhow, this is my favorite film of 1984. It delivers a blend of emotions, is well-acted and well-directed, and the music is excellent as we should expect. Apparently, the Academy agreed.My Grade: A+",10,0,0,8 May 2020
Ghostbusters," My Childhood Favorite Still Holds Strong!
","I love Ghostbusters. The movie has always been a major part of life beginning with childhood. I'm very thankful I was introduced to this movie at such a young age. It is no surprise that the film was the biggest hit of 1984 and then some. The theater life was exceptionally long, but that is no big deal for a movie that helped in changing the landscape of feature films. This movie is considered to be one of Hollywood's first blockbusters. It also proved that special effects and comedy will work well together given the right ingredients (unlike Spielberg's disastrous 1941). These are just two of the main highlights that worked out in the film's favor.The film was directed by Ivan Reitman, the man behind comedic hits like Animal House and Stripes. He did have a say in the screenplay, which was first drafted by Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd has always been fascinated with the paranormal. His family wrote books on ghosts or were mediums. His first script was more horror-based, but Reitman convinced him to lighten things up. He brought Harold Ramis (who worked with Reitman previously on the aforementioned films) on board to refine the jokes and add some much-needed humor. The script wasn't entirely used the way it was intended since Reitman wanted his actors to ad-lib. The studio, Columbia thought the film was toast, but boy were they ever proved wrong. Reitman knew the movie was hit at the first audience test screening when they laughed and felt fear during the opening library scene. That scene, with the older librarian being scared out of her wits, is one of the classic all-timers.The performances are great (especially the deadpan comedic performance from Bill Murray), but the technical side of things were amazing. The editing is a thing of beauty. The film had a very short production leash, so Reitman and his crew had to edit as they go. In a film which could have gone horribly wrong, there is an even mixture of comedy, drama, action, thrills, and chills. In an age where special effects dominate each film, I was still impressed with the special effects. The ghosts looked realistic enough. The Marshmallow Man was giant and scary. The zombie cab driver. And, oh Slimer! Our favorite ghost! He was apparently modeled after the late John Belushi. Finally, the movie would not have been the same without the music. Everyone knows Ray Parker Jr's famous title song. I love that song, too!Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists who work at Columbia University. They are fired after their grant ends. They begin a business to hunt down and capture ghosts. Business is bad at first and the public derides them. When Dana Barrett (Signourey Weaver) notices strange behavior by her Central Park apartment, she hires the Ghostbusters to rid her place from evil. Apparently, the place is a gateway to another world. Her oddball neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) also notices these monsters. Now business is great, and they even hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) to their team. The EPA associate, Walter Peck (William Atherton) convinces them they are doing the city harm and gets them thrown in jail. When New York City is placed under siege by ancient Sumerian god Gozer, the mayor may have no choice but to release them from jail.This film also gave belief to the studios that its okay for television folks to star in movies. The main trio were all SNL stars and this movie made bank. Murray had the most experience with movies and he also delivered the funniest performance. It is a deadpan one and his one-liners are brilliant. My favorite is: 'human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria...' If you understand the context, you'll understand the humor. Aykroyd and Ramis, while not given as much to do as Murray, do their best to create memorable characters. The chemistry between the three is definitely the highlight. Signourey Weaver is an odd casting choice giving her dramatic past in films like Alien, but she nailed the comedy when inhabited by the Gozer ghost. Rick Moranis totally got his character and I was down every second. I want to go to one of his parties!Ghostbusters was a major hit for Columbia and a film that was influential towards culture. It gave studios more confidence that comedy-driven special effect films could work after all. You would not have fun, awesome films like Men in Black if Ghostbusters failed. If you studied New York City history, you'll know that the early 1980's was a horrible time for the city given its propensity for violence and fiscal damage. Reitman said this film was his love letter for the city. It gave the industry a much-needed boost that they could film their productions here. Nearly forty years after its debut, the film holds up very well. It's funny, scary, has great special effects, and it proved why everyone loves Bill Murray.My Grade: A",9,0,0,29 April 2020
The Longest Day," A Good War Film That Could Have Been Great!
","1962's The Longest Day is one ambitious, comprehensive war movie. The care that was put into the film making it as realistic as possible is very commendable. With that realism in place, I think the movie suffered just a tad bit. The movie is three hours long, and there are long stretches of build-up leading up to the famous Allied D-Day landing in Normandy. That said, the rest of the movie works well and I really liked the ambition put forth into the film. The film had the largest budget for any black-and-white film, a whopping ten million dollars (a lot for its time). It would hold that title until 1993 when Schindler's List came along. The film made use of many famous actors from all around the globe-48 actors to be exact!One of the things the movie does differently when compared to other films is that it is divided into different sections. Each section represented a different country and was directed by a person from that country. The main sections were the United States-directed by Andrew Marton, England-directed by Ken Annakin, and Germany-directed by Bernhard Wicki. Every section had their own actors. For example, the American scenes featured John Wayne. There are also some scenes regarding the free French resistance. Unheard of for its time, each of the foreign countries (Germany, France) spoke in their own countries and English subtitles were used. I think this format enhanced the movie as we see what both sides are doing and thinking regarding the war. It's June 1944 and Europe has been battered with an unusual amount of storms. The Allies made plans to invade France with Normandy as their chosen location. On the other side of the coin, Nazi Germany believes the Allies won't make any move because of the weather and if they do, they would land in the French town of Calais. The Germans think wrong, and General Dwight Eisenhower decides to make the move. I was impressed with the acting. Usually if 48 renowned international stars would appear in a movie together, things would get rushed. Give credit to the movie-the actors were used well. No one stood out-and that is the point! If I had to single out any actor for their performance, it would be John Wayne. Who can forget John Wayne going into battle on crutches. But listen to some of the actors in the cast: Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Kurd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, and the list goes on and on. On the technical side of things, The Longest Day works. Even though there are some long stretches of nothing, there are some great battle scenes. The Normandy landing is quite impressive and so is the parachute drop. This was a film that had assistance from people who actually fought in the war, so they filmed the movie to be real as possible. The sound and the visual effects are rather impressive. The movie was filmed in docudrama style and it would make a great education tool. Despite the impressive look of the Normandy landing, it will not hold well when compared to the D-day landing depiction in 1998's Saving Private Ryan. Overall, The Longest Day is a solid war movie. It could have been a great movie if it was not hindered by its length. Some tighter editing would have done the movie favors. The movie is based off the acclaimed bestseller by Cornelius Ryan and he also wrote the script which was a good one. I liked the tone of the movie and how ambitious it tries to be. If you like war movies, definitely give this film a shot. My Grade: B",8,4,4,12 October 2018
Patton," George C. Scott= General Patton
","For those who know a little history, you would know who General George S. Patton is. You would know that he is served in World War Two as one of the top American generals on the European battlefront. He was a very smart man, but also an eccentric man. His eccentric manners is what took him away from taking part of D-Day. But there is no denying the influence he had on the war. Without his leadership, who knows how the war would have turned out. In 1970, a movie about his life came out and it was well-received by nearly everyone who has seen it. The movie was worked on by close associates of Patton, such as General Omar Bradley. An interesting fact is the producers of the film contacted the Patton family for information..only a day after Patton's widow was laid to rest so it's a sad matter-of-fact that the producers didn't get any help from Patton's family. I remember vividly looking forward to this movie, and luckily I can join the crowd of people who adored this film.From the moment I see George C. Scott walking onstage as Patton to deliver his iconic speech in front of a sprawling American flag, I knew this was going to be a great movie. Every scene is captivating especially when Scott is in it, but the opening scene is the greatest, most powerful scene in the movie. The above quote I featured is part of the speech and immediately you can tell what kind of man Patton was. Patton was a man who took no crap from anybody and was a man who dearly loved his country. He spoke with such colorful language (although that idea was exaggerated in the film) and he had a way to make those words count. He was a man of perfection. You can see that during a scene where he slaps a soldier for being in a hospital for depression instead of battle injuries. That caused him a fall from grace, but you can see the man Patton was. The movie does an exemplary job in making Patton a lifelike character on the big screen.This isn't your typical birth-to-death biography. This is a biography that covers Patton during the wartime years. The movie makes a point in showing what a fine general he was and how he positively contributed to the war, but it did not hold back on showing him as an eccentric man. The scenes where he drags his very scared puppy around everywhere he goes is just one of those examples. The film begins with his conquests in Libya as he drives German general Rommel out of the country. Then we see a downfall of his due to his big mouth and incident where he slaps the soldier. Then we see a comeback as Patton commands the Allies on the European front mowing down Germans left and right as they move closer to Berlin.The main actor in the film, of course, is George C. Scott who delivers a splendid performance as Patton. In fact, this may be the best performance of Scott's long career and he had a wonderful career. The performance works on various levels. Scott is an on screen presence to be reckoned with and he follows the oldest rule in the acting handbook-to become the character. I felt I was watching Patton the entire time, despite the mannerisms of Scott. But also you can draw parallels between the two men. Scott is seen as a recluse in Hollywood because he was so eccentric. He had the extreme talent, but his personality made him like an outcast. It was a foregone conclusion he was going to win the Oscar for Best Actor (and he did), but the question was if he was going to personally accept the award. He did not stating he did not like the Academy or acting competitions in general. Scott and Patton would have been great blood brothers. Casting Scott to play Patton is one of cinema's greatest casting decisions ever. Scott delivered such a powerful performance. The other main performance was Karl Malden who delivers an admirable performance as General Omar Bradley, the man who gave Patton a second chance in the war.Patton is a long film as it clocks in nearly three hours long and Scott is in nearly every frame, but it works very much thanks to Scott's layered performance enhancing upon Patton's theatricality. The guy who possesses such bravery also loves to hear himself speak during his long-winded speeches. The movie has many speeches, but they are worthy of your attention. The guy gives such a commanding presence and I got the goosebumps during that opening scene. The movie sees the war the way Patton saw it and it's an exhilarating experience.The direction is also a highlight of the film. Franklin J. Schaffner is known for taking on ambitious projects and this may have been his most ambitious project he may have ever tackled. It's fun to see directors rise to the challenge and Schaffner took a mighty challenge here and won. Also a noticeable presence was the score by Jerry Goldsmith. He created such a patriotic score with the help of a pipe organ. Every time I think of Patton himself, the main theme becomes stuck in my head and that is a good thing. 1970 was a good year for war films. M.A.S.H and now Patton are must-see war films from that year. The former film was a spoof on the dangers of war, but the latter is about a man who dedicated his life to winning the war his style. And his style is very interesting to watch. A man who won't back down from anything. Because of George S. Patton, the Allies won the war.My Grade: A",9,4,4,12 October 2017
Caddyshack," Bill Murray, Where Art Thou Gopher?
","Golf is my least favorite sport. I think it's boring, and not fun to play. So you could imagine my trepidation heading into a golf film such as 1980's Caddyshack. I was pleasantly surprised by my reaction to this movie. The movie is really not about golf, but about the zany antics of the many characters in the film. The movie is crude and juvenile, but the humor really works. Not every joke is going to work, but there was enough screwball comedy to keep me chortling throughout the film.Caddyshack is Harold Ramis's directorial debut and he also written the screenplay along with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney. Ramis previously wrote one of my favorite 1978 comedies, Animal House. It is natural that he would bring the same type of humor to this film. As for directing, Ramis did a rather good job in his debut. There were some issues regarding connectivity of the characters, but I think he passed his first test.When coming up with the screenplay of the film, Murray and Ramis took experiences from their personal lives and added them to story. Growing up, they worked as caddies. So I liked how there was more of a personal touch to the movie than one would expect. One of my favorite scenes, the Baby Ruth candy in the swimming pool scene, actually happened for real at Murray's high school. Once you add the Jaws theme music, you have one of the best scenes of the movie.The plot of the film barely exists. What I mean is that the film is just a rapid series of comedic actions meant to make you laugh and in a screwball comedy, that is just fine. I will give you a basic outline of the plot. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a caddy working at the Bushwood County Club. In order to get himself a bright future, he wants to earn a caddy scholarship from Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the owner of the club. Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) is a rude millionaire who wants to purchase the club, but Judge Smails has no time for Czervik's attitude. There is Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) who is a charming golfer who helps Danny try to figure out his true life goals. Finally, we meet the groundskeeper, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) who is hell-bent on eliminating a gopher that is ruining the golf course.Hence here is where my biggest problem with the film lays. You may have noticed there was a lot jammed into the plot, even though there is not much of a plot to begin with. These characters are very entertaining in their own segments because they bring a different personality to the table, but they really are not connected. You would think that the actions of these characters would lead to some grand outcome that would connect them, but unfortunately that is not the case. The Carl Spackler chasing the gopher segment has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Although, those scenes are where I was most consistently laughing and Bill Murray absolutely rocked it as Carl Spackler.Each character has a different persona, and the actors did a great job portraying those personas. Chevy Chase is more of a charming, laidback golfer who is great at wooing in the ladies. Rodney Dangerfield is a witty, acerbic man who delivers rapid fire lines at the speed of light! Dangerfield was previously known as a comedian, and this is his first big movie role. I was impressed how he delivered his lines. His scenery-chewing, along with his insults and one-liners make him a memorable character. Bill Murray does wonderful as the self-absorbed groundskeeper, although it does make you wonder if this character is a remnant of Animal House. Ted Knight does a solid job as the judge, but maybe he is over-reaching just a little. Michael O'Keefe, who was so good in 1979's The Great Santini, delivers another strong performance here.I liked Caddyshack. Some people make it out to be a comedy classic of the ages, but I consider it to be an above-average screwball comedy that will make you laugh. The characters, even if they don't connect to the film as a whole, are memorable and funny. There are some quotable lines (thank you, Mr. Dangerfield). This is all light fun, and it does everything a comedy should do. It gets nothing but better for Mr. Ramis here on out. By the way, even that gopher is cute in an odd way.My Grade: B",8,1,3,9 November 2017
Annie Hall," Funny....At Times
","Annie Hall was 1977's Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I don't think it should have been. It was a solid movie for sure, but I couldn't buy the movie as the best film of 1977. While Woody Allen's Bananas was a screwball comedy, this film does mark Allen's most mature film up to this point. The comedy is still there, but the movie is deeper than in Allen's previous efforts. Allen cited advancing age for his more philosophical views (as he turned forty in 1975 which gave him strong opinions about death.) These philosophical views involves what it means to be romantic, Jewish heritage, the ideas of getting older, the banality of life, and of course as in most Allen's film, a love story to the great city of New York. It also has been told that the movie resembles the personal life of Woody Allen. I wouldn't find that surprising because he did date the star of the film, Diane Keaton at one point. I thoroughly enjoyed the philosophical views that Allen had in the film.That also comes to the crux of my problems I had with the film. All the philosophy is fine and dandy, but people don't realize how much this film is talking. People call this film a masterpiece, but they fail to see that this film is 121 minutes of talking and walking. I was mesmerized by Allen's incredible dialogue, but eventually the talk wore me out (which is hard to do). This is a major issue, but luckily for the film it was the only issue I had. Too much talk, but the words were incredibly fluid thanks to the thoughtful script by Allen. There are some memorable monologues, and I liked how Allen spoke to the camera. It is rare for a movie to have an actor speak to the camera in a successful way, but Allen made it work here. He created a romantic comedy that made people laugh, and also made people cry. It represented more of a mature side to him that people seldom saw before this. Sure his screwball antics are still here, but his maturity level was elevated by several notches.Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic stand-up comedian who reflects on the demise of his last relationship. He dated a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) who was an aspiring nightclub singer. Alvy reflects over the good times and bad times over the course of their relationship and also on factors that caused this relation to happen. He talks about growing up near C0ney Island, how he had sexual desires from a very young age, and how he always felt guilty about his Jewish heritage growing up.I've seen this movie twice. The first time, it took awhile for me to appreciate Woody Allen's acting in this film. This time, I was instantly brought in to the story by his inner monologue. Allen is essentially playing himself with lots of rapid intellectual dialogue. But I enjoyed watching him piece out the information on why his relationship failed. I really did like how be added depth to his character. He may be funny, but it's not all about the comedy this time around. Diane Keaton, whom we know from The Godfather, does very well in her role. Her character is somewhat based off herself she admitted. Her character is shy, insecure at times, but she's sweet and honest. There are some good supporting roles here too. We get to see a young Christopher Walken as Annie's brother Duane. We see two other women that Alvy got into relationships with and they were performed decently from Carol Kane and Shelley Duvall. Also, there are two blink-or-you-miss cameos in the film. Keep any eye out for Jeff Goldblum and Signourey Weaver! Overall, I enjoyed watching what is probably Woody Allen's most personal movie. He later admitted he was not happy with the film because it was not the film he intended to make. But that didn't stop critics and audiences alike all around the world from calling Annie Hall the best movie of 1977. Unfortunately, I do not share that sentiment. I do, however, think this film is a good watch. It's funny at times, but it is also a thoughtful film. I would even call it a semi-experimental film. It's a film that you need to pay utmost attention to or you'll be lost. The story is not linear because there are mnay flashbacks spread throughout. Only Woody Allen could create enough witty and strong dialogue where you wouldn't need action to complement those words. For that reason alone, this film is deserving of its Best Screenplay Oscar win. This movie is a solid watch thanks to a strong, intelligent screenplay and very strong performances from Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. However, it falls short from the masterpiece everyone claims it to be.My Grade: B",8,2,4,18 October 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Dare I Say Kubrick's Best Film?
","When it comes to discussing influential movies of all time, I'd call you crazy if you did not mention 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.One of the big reasons why we are supposed to feel a sense of awe is the music itself. You know, originally the film had an original composition by Alex North. Director Stanley Kubrick had a back up soundtrack he used to help him with the editing process. The problem is (in North's case) the music just worked too damn well with the film to not use it. He used various classical compositions such as The Blue Danube and Also sprach Zarathustra composed by Richard Strauss. The music played a huge role in the film. I feel as if it was used as the main dialogue. There is some dialogue of course, but the music tells the story and pulls the emotional strings. Kubrick's film has no dialogue the first and final twenty minutes of the film. It is all music, and the placement is right on the money.It's hard to describe what this film is actually about. There is no single plot line. Instead, the film and its themes are about the evolution of mankind. There are four main segments to the film. The first part takes place in prehistoric times. A group of apes discovered this shiny black monolith which of course is made by intelligent beings of some kind. Somehow, the monolith convinced the apes were able to discover that bones could be used as weapons. The next section takes place a few millennia later, and this is where we have the famous docking scene played to the tune of The Blue Danube. We are given a sense of realism of the docking because of the deliberately slow pace. After the docking scene, we discover a second monolith which delivers us to the next segment involving the spaceship Discovery and its intelligent mind, HAL. The ship is on a mission of some kind, although we don't glimpse many details. The final segment is the famous Stargate sequence featuring astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as he travels through some wormhole to some unexplained space.This is one of those rare films where acting does not matter. There are not many actors present after all. Sure, I guess you could call Dullea's performance good, but he doesn't seem to matter in the film. The computer system, HAL probably shows the most emotion of anyone in the film. His voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about to be unplugged for good. This is one of the early films to use the theme of man versus machine. HAL believes he has good intentions, but at the sake of the astronaut's lives. He has been holding back information and later on in the minds of the astronauts, he is believed to be the bad guy.Ah, now lets talk about the spectacle of the film. The visuals are amazing, even today after all these years. We are now in the digital age, where CGI looks consistently impressive (or in some cases, not at all). But the special effects, designed with the help of Douglas Trumbull, look very convincing because the film gives off an aura of being a documentary, and the effects follows suit. They just look very real for the setting they are in. The spaceship itself looks real and I loved the docking sequence. Towards the end, where we witness the vast amount of colors and the Star Child, I was basked in a glow of delight watching the effects come to life.What I like about all of Kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions. For example, this film concerns mankind and evolution. The film asks us who we are and what is life about. Kubrick never gave in to tell us what the film is about. He opened the film up for interpretation and every idea is a plausible idea, according to Kubrick. We are just not skin and bones, but we are intelligence. We live not on planet Earth, but amongst the stars. These are just some of the ideas Kubrick was trying to convey. There are many themes to get out of the movie, being such an abstract film.This is Kubrick's most ambitious and most likely his greatest film he has ever made. I loved his previous film, Dr. Strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film. This is not a narrative story in the common sense so if you've never seen this film, just heed my warning. I love how the movie opens up for debate/interpretation and to this day, people debate about the themes and just how influential the movie is. Featuring amazing visuals and musical cues, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest, most influential movies of all time.My Grade: A+",10,3,4,11 October 2017
The Graduate," Hello, Mrs. Robinson!
","'Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?' If there is a movie that can hit viewers of all age from this groovy decade of the 1960's, I would have to choose The Graduate. At it's base, the movie is a coming-of-age story and usually those kind of stories relate with people of all ages. The younger generation may be living through the same eyes as the characters in the story and the older generation gets nostalgia as they remember the days of old. In fact, this movie is a favorite of my family. They grew up in the era when this film is released, so they understand the struggles the character is going through. Also the movie is recognizable because it is a damn fine piece of art. It took me years to see the film, and I finally did so recently. It did not hit me as strongly as it did with my family or other people of their generation, but there is no denying how good the film is.I feel like I can relate to the film somewhat because I'm in the same boat of our main character, Ben Braddock. Ben is a recent college graduate, but is struggling to find a life after college. I know how he feels, because I have the same struggles in a much more competitive world. I can also relate to Ben's personality, because I had similar traits years ago. Ben, in the film, struggles mightily around females because of his awkwardness. Back in my teenage days, I had similar issues. Although I eventually changed and I never fell for any older women like..ahem.Ben does. But people adore this movie because of its very relatable themes involving post-graduation life.One of the popular things about the movie was its soundtrack. The film heavily relied upon folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel to provide the music, and provide the music they certainly did. One would say their most famous song is 'Mrs. Robinson.' Now you know where the song received its personality. Personally, I loved the music in the film but other people, such as the late great Roger Ebert had major qualms about the music. But everyone is subjected to their own opinions because everyone usually have different opinions about any single movie.This film follows around this kid, Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) as he joins the big, wide world after college graduation. Everyone expects great things out of him, especially his parents (played by William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson). At a homecoming party of his, Ben is asked to drive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home. Mrs. Robinson is the wife of his father's business partner (Murray Hamilton). After Ben drove the seductive older woman home, they begin an affair. But things take a sharp turn when Ben meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross).and falls in love with her. Now with two women in his romantic life with the affair unbeknownst to each other, Ben is going to have a lot of work to do.The film partly works because of its fine, naturalistic performances. Dustin Hoffman, despite being 29 at the film's release, convincingly plays Braddock as a shy, awkward kid who wants to take this time in joining the real world. Hoffman will become a big star, and this is the first piece in helping him do so. My word, I really enjoyed Anne Bancroft's performance as the seductive wife. She could have stolen any guy's heart with her portrayal. It's funny because she was supposed to be the older woman in the picture, but she's only six years older than Hoffman is. Those of you who seen the 90's sitcom, Boy Meets World, you'll recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels who played Ben's dad. He has some amusing scenes, and I particularly liked the scene where he forces his son to try on a scuba diving outfit much to Ben's chagrin. Murray Hamilton has a rather smallish role as Mr. Robinson, but I thought he did a fine job and likewise for Katherine Ross as Elaine, whom we don't meet until much later in the film.Mike Nichols was a well-known director who is known for his quirkiness and sensibilities in all of his films. He sadly passed away earlier this year, but he left behind a legacy of well-known works. The Graduate is his first feature film and boy what a way to introduce yourself to Hollywood. He does an amazing job directing this film and it's no surprise he won Best Director at the Oscars for his first film directorial effort. He told the story in a very crisp away and he never slowed down.The film works as a comedy and a drama, but its not funny in a way you would think. The comedy is more subtle, and that makes it refreshing. However, not everything meant as comedy I found funny. You can blame me living in a different generation for that. The movie also offers some unforgettable scenes. The very last scene with Elaine and Ben in a bus..just a classic scene and quite funny. Just watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean.Despite how much I enjoyed The Graduate, not all is perfect. The film feels outdated. What worked in the 1960's doesn't always work well today. Some jokes are not as funny and on the technical side of the film, it doesn't hold up well. As one would say, the movie has rusty pipes. But those pipes still work perfectly fine. Thanks to the music, the performances, and the themes, The Graduate is a lesson that all young people should learn and it's a movie that still appeals to the older generations. I enjoyed this film, even if other people enjoyed it more than I did.My Grade: B+",8,4,4,11 October 2017
Once Upon a Time in America," An Emotional, Thoughtful Masterpiece!
","In my humble opinion, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America might be one of the greatest gangster films ever made, if not the best one. People unfairly compare this movie to The Godfather, but each film is a masterpiece in its own different way. People even say this movie is one of the best films of all time. I would give credibility to those people because I wholeheartedly agree. This film, Leone's director cut at least, is in my top 100 list. One of the many reasons why this film is amazing is because is a deep, thematic film. Leone created a film about the American Dream. How it will lure you in with its promises and then betray you just as quickly. Sounds familiar, right? The film is also about friendship, loyalty, greed, love, and violence.The situation surrounding the film's release is a sad story. The film is incredibly long at 3 hours and 49 minutes, but Leone made sure each minute mattered in telling his story. It does require patience and focus, but you will be proud of it once the credits roll. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Festival to rapturous praise. It received a 20-minute standing ovation. The original version had a focused story with flashbacks and flash-forwards. Scenes from the 1920's, 1930's, and 1960's were interwoven with each other, but it all made sense. This is what the critics loved. This is what the European cinemas showed. America betrayed Leone and his vision. Fearing the length and the violence, they edited a good ninety minutes from the film and rearranged the movie to organize it chronologically. Leone's film was butchered. Many critics called the edited version the worst film of 1984 and a travesty. Leone was apparently so heartbroken, he would go on to never make a film again. It's really sad but at least his original version is out here for everyone to see. Do NOT see the edited version. See the one that Leone envisioned us all to see.The film tells the story of Noodles (Robert De Niro). He grew up in a tough Jewish neighborhood in the Lower East Side in the 1920's. His best friend was Max (James Woods). In the early 1930's, Prohibition was in full effect across the United States. Max has some business propositions for Noodles. They involve themselves in violence, greed, lust, and with the local gangsters. Noodles falls in love with Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern; younger Deborah played by Jennifer Connelly). In the 1960's, Noodles arrives as an elderly man figuring out everything that happened and what went wrong during his life in New York City. The movie is really about loyalties being tested and being betrayed by the American Dream.The film delivers a plethora of amazing performances. With this cast, is it hard to deny that statement? Robert De Niro excels in these kinds of films, so it is a given he would be excellent here. I sympathized with his character even if his character made some horrible decisions, including how he treats his women. I also liked his chemistry with James Woods. Woods is not my favorite actor, but he delivers a very moving performance. Elizabeth McGovern is great, and Jennifer Connelly was a real find! Joe Pesci is great in a small supporting role as local gangster Frankie. Everyone is on top of their game with this film.The film is emotional. and it can hit you hard with emotion. You might think that the film's music is a reason why you would feel emotional. With that mindset, I would say you have an excellent taste in music. Ennio Morricone is a film legend who created many memorable film scores, including this one. His theme, 'Deborah's Theme,' is a tearjerker. It's one of the more beautiful musical pieces you'll hear in any movie. It's a shame he was not nominated for an Oscar due to technicality issues.Sergio Leone is a director who is often underlooked and deemed too artsy. He was the man who brought the likes of Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson to the public eye. He was never really appreciated here in the states even after his Fistful of Dollars trilogy. That, in part, may have been the reason why this film was in the pre-production phase since the 1960's. In the end, Leone finally made this film. A triumphal directorial effort that remains his very best.Once Upon a Time in America is a very unique film that explores the lives of Jewish gangsters from childhood to old age. I also like how there is ambiguity here. Is this movie actually an opium-fueled dream by Noodles? Opium is known to give vivid dreams as one of its potential side effects. Regardless of what you make think, Leone made a movie where scene matters in the grand scope of things. If you are a patient cinephile or moviegoer, the rewards are endless. Be prepared for plenty of violence, nut I really loved this emotional, thoughtful masterpiece.My Grade: A+",10,0,5,27 April 2020
Chariots of Fire," A Truly Motivational, Inspirational Film!
","When the opening notes of Vangelis's iconic theme appeared in the very first scene of 1981's Chariots of Fire, I knew we were in for something special when I felt chills going down my spine. I put this movie in the echelon of great films because this movie meant so much and by the end, I had tears rolling down my cheek as I sat in stunned silence mesmerized by what I saw. People view the movie as a sports film, but it is way more than that. The movie is set with running in the 1924 Olympics, but it takes it on in a more spiritual, inspirational way. It is about the drive and determination of what it takes to be the very best. The two main runners portrayed-Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams want to win for different, inspirational reasons and not because they want to be the best runners in the world (although they were).Director Hugh Hudson and producer David Puttnam when through painstaking research and casting to make this movie the way it is. Puttnam wanted to create an inspirational story in the veins of 1966's The Man of All Seasons and thought something in the world of sports would allow him to do so. He randomly stumbled upon the story of Eric Liddell (yes, this a true authentic story) and immediately knew this was the story he wanted to tell.The movie begins after the end of the first World War. It focuses on two very fast runners-Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross). Harold is a Lithuanian Jew and he leads a decent life at Cambridge. But he lives in a society that is rather anti-Semitic. He uses his speed to show the world his worth and to prove Jewish people are not the people the world makes them out to be. Eric, son of Christian missionaries, was born in China. He is a devout member of the Church of Scotland and wants to use his gift of speed as a way to spread the word of God. Their lives will intersect at the 1924 Olympics where they will be faced with the ultimate test with the Americans Jackson Scholz (Brad Davis) and Charles Paddock (Dennis Christopher), each other, and themselves.The casting is ingenious. Hudson and Puttnam wanted to have a cast with unknown actors in the leading roles surrounded by a well-known supporting cast, and does it ever work! Ian Charleson was discovered in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Piaf. Cross was seen in the play Chicago and they really loved his musical talent. Surrounding these two leads, noticeable standouts are Ian Holm as Abraham's running coach, Sam Mussabini, Sir John Gielgud in a more glorified cameo as a master of Cambridge college, and Nigel Havers as Lord Andrew Lindsay. Ian Holm gave the more emotional performance and he dominated every scene he was in. The one scene where he celebrates a victory after 30 years in the business and not being allowed in the Olympic Stadium because he was a Jew swallowed me up with emotion.I really liked how the movie is not preachy. Yes, the movie is enveloped in spiritual themes, but it doesn't whack you on the head consistently with these themes and that made the movie more accessible for the mainstream audience. That said, faith and inspiration play major roles in the movie because they are the basic foundations of why these men choose to run. The movie is also a British film, and it does have some sharp messages against the British class system. There is also a very strong message against anti-Semitism. If you are expecting a historical accurate film, you may need to look elsewhere. Hudson took some liberties creating this movie. He wanted to give the main characters more time together despite their paths briefly intersecting with each other in reality.Chariots of Fire is a tour-de-force movie that you will not forget. From the moment the film began with the iconic scene of the runners on the beach running to Vangelis's masterful, haunting score, you know this is something special, something inspirational. Vangelis really created one of the most well-known musical scores of all time and it successfully establishes the tone of the movie. Running is not my favorite sport, but I came to care for these characters. I came to share in their emotions of joy, stress, defeat, inspiration, and glory. Instead of a paint-by-numbers about running, we get a movie that shows the best of human nature. The winner of 4 Oscars, including Best Picture, this movie is bound to give you inspiration if you need some! I certainly did!My Grade: A",9,1,1,12 April 2019
A Clockwork Orange," My Personal Kubrick Favorite!
","Stanley Kubrick is back! And he brings with him another controversial albeit delightful movie. In the 1960's, he directed two genuine masterpieces in 1964's Dr. Strangelove and 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both were fascinating movies that had something to say-usually things that stirred the pot. In 1972, his most controversial movie of all was released titled A Clockwork Orange. I absolutely loved this film and I am not ashamed to admit it. I loved the film's take on a bleak, dystopian future reminiscent of a fascist society. I loved the characters in the film despite their ultra-violence. I loved the music and the use of Beethoven and Rossini. Just every little thing about this film can be called a masterpiece. There were people who despised this film because of it use of violence. The kind of violence displayed in the movie was something that was very, very rare in 1972. Even in today's standards, this film is violent. Maybe it even glorifies it, but its hard to say.This film centers around a young man named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) who is a leader of a violent gang and to put it quite bluntly, a sadistic rapist. He is very violent to everyone, including his own gang members. One day, he murders a lonely old woman and is sent to prison for the crime. Whilst in prison, he hears of a program which would allow him to get back on the streets. This program is a form of aversion therapy-which would create goodness in him. He agrees to this controversial program and is released from prison after the procedure. Back on the streets, Alex finds it very hard to live a good life especially with all the violence he had a hand in creating.One of the things I admire about Kubrick is how he doesn't rely on a huge cast and he is always trying to find fresh talent to work with. In this case, Malcolm McDowell is the newcomer here. I'm not really familiar with his works, but he does an impressive job in this film. He plays Alex as a very tortured individual who feels violence is necessary to make him feel happy. He also has a huge knack for sex-whether consensual or not. But towards the end after the aversion therapy, it's kind of hard not to feel bad for Alex. He wants to lead a good life, but his criminal past comes back to haunt him and there is really nothing he can do. Patrick Magee does a good job as Mr. Alexander, one of the victims of Alex's crimes. I also liked the use of the English vocabulary. This film has a very weird dialect, but it's delightful to listen to.So you must be wondering what does this title stand for? Well, it has to do with one of the controversial topics in the movie. He goes under this psychology treatment under the totalitarian government to stop his immoral behavior. However, Alex is more or a less a robot after this treatment. This is one of the programs being instituted by the government to ensure total control over its citizens. To be a clockwork orange means you are an organic being on the outside, but on the inside you're just a machine. Kubrick himself called this movie a satire on such psychological programs. Nonetheless, this scene in the movie was a very hard scene to watch. It was well-done, but watching Alex break down to scenes of Nazi Germany was very intense.Speaking of intense, most of the violence in this film is displayed at such high intensity. Some of the violence was even too much for me, and I have a very strong stomach. But the violence is necessary to show because its part of Alex's daily life. Kubrick took advantage of a changing studio system to insert this violence in his movie. He would not have been able to make the film as it is ten years earlier. But there are some crazy scenes to watch. The beginning of the movie has a crazy fight scene between Alex's gang and a rival gang. Alex and his buddies were beating the rival gang just for fun and showing no mercy. A very hard scene to watch is when Alex broke into Mr. Alexander's house and raped his wife. There was also an interesting scene where it shows Alex having sex with two women in fast-motion. It's not hard to see why this movie caused controversy. It's a very bloody, violent movie and I'm glad Kubrick didn't do any foolish edits to the film.Music plays a big factor in the film. Early on, we understand Alex loves Beethoven. His ninth symphony is used throughout the film to great effect. Many of the fight scenes are set to the music of Beethoven or Rossini. Just like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick used music to speak to the audience. As with 2001, some of the music speaks louder than words. Also, this film brought an interest of Beethoven to me. He is a very good artist from the classical era.A Clockwork Orange is a violent, brooding movie set in futuristic England and despite all of the controversy surrounding it, it is a very unique film. It is also one of my all-time favorites. It is fascinating to see how people or even nations were affected by the movie. Upon its release, this film was actually banned in the United Kingdom. They didn't get to see it for the first time until maybe fifteen years ago. Once again, Kubrick gave us another movie to challenge our minds and thoughts. He is a very meticulous director, but his efforts are worth it. Based on a popular novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a must-see as a visually-impressive futuristic movie about a man whose life is made out of violence. But that will be changed.My Grade: A+",10,5,6,18 October 2017
Where Eagles Dare," Exciting, Action-Packed!
","Where Eagles Dare has been given the status of one of the best war movies ever produced. I think that statement is going a little too far, but I found the movie to be an effective war film and one of the better ones from an era in which seemingly hundreds of movies focused on World War II were released. Despite the acclaim it has received, it has received notice for historical inaccuracy. Personally I don't mind because the value of a movie is entertainment, not truth. On top of that, this story which was written by Alistair Maclean as a pet project for Richard Burton so it's a work of fiction, so history accuracy should not matter here. The movie is rather lengthy as it clocks in a tad over two-and-a-half hours, but I felt the time flew by quickly. There are plenty of action sequences and most of them are convincing and entertaining. Who wouldn't want to see Allied personnel lay waste to a bunch of Nazi scum? Despite this being a piece of fiction, I was washed over by a feeling of pleasure watching these Allied troops infiltrate a Nazi stronghold.During the war, a British aircraft was shot down over Nazi territory leaving only one survivor, an American general. The Allies are fearful because he knows all about the D-Day invasion, which holds the key to their success in achieving victory. They decide its best that he not divulge any information to the Nazis, so they plan a rescue mission. The team is led by Major John Smith (Richard Burton)-I know, such an original name right?, and his second-in-command, Lieutenant Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) who happens to be the only American in the rescue group. After the parachute drop goes wrong, it becomes clear to Schaffer that the mission is more important and more secretive than originally thought.The performances seem to be low-key despite the starpower in the main roles. You know, the one and only Richard Burton and the main famous for his manly scowl, Clint Eastwood. They all did well in their roles, even if their roles are not the best they have ever done. Burton does well in anything he does so it's no surprise he does so here. I like Clint Eastwood, and he puts his action chops to good use here. I read that he thought the screenplay was horrible and he wished to be given less speaking lines. So director Brian G. Hutton gave more of his lines to Burton and allowed Eastwood to focus more on the action. In the end, I think that worked out well.Where Eagles Dare is a very fun, entertaining movie. The movie has lots of muscle to it, but it surprisingly has a good amount of brains to it. That scene in the headquarters meeting room with Burton revealing some traitors, that was an incredible scene. Burton's character was messing around with the heads of everyone in the room, friend or foe. The action is consistent and they do a solid job. From the beginning with that parachute drop to the infiltration of the Nazi headquarters, to the grand escape with a bunch of Nazis on their heels-it was all good fun watching Smith and crew act smarter than the Nazi's. The movie itself is nothing special, but it's fun, entertaining, and a war thriller that doesn't take itself seriously. Not everything about the film plays off as rational, but does it really have to be? My Grade: A-",9,4,5,12 October 2017
Rocky," The Italian Stallion!
","Here is a good trivia question to ask. That question is, 'What was the first sports movie to ever win Best Picture at the Oscars?' The movie with that special honor is 1976's Rocky. This movie is an American classic and it's widely known to be one of the most influential sports movies of all time. This movie spawned many sequels and a spin-off movie. The character of Rocky Balboa remains to this day a heavy cultural presence. In fact, if you travel to the Philadelphia Art Museum, you'll be able to see a statue of Rocky at those famed steps. There is nothing special about the story itself. It's a by-the-numbers underdog story, but it's the underlying themes that make this movie so special. The themes of heroism and being the underdog really elevated this movie.The making of this movie is part of that underdog theme, and it took a very long time for this movie to make it to the big screen. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay and it was widely acclaimed in the movie industry. The studios felt it could have been a star vehicles for the likes of Robert Redford. But Stallone only wanted the movie to happen if he can act in the movie as the lead role. The studio executives thought that wouldn't work because of his lack of acting experience. But with a very low budget, MGM/United Artists was able to get the movie made with Stallone in the lead role. This is an example of those classic underdog stories that I love to see.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) nicknamed 'The Italian Stallion' is a boxer who is struggling to make the big-time. He earns some money by collecting debts for a debt collector. He gets his lucky break when heavyweight boxing star Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) arrives in Philadelphia to set up a match for show. In order for 'nobody' to become a 'somebody.' Apollo Creed chooses Rocky Balboa because of his nickname. Of course, Apollo believes he will win. But with the help of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and his oft-quiet girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire), Rocky seizes this opportunity to leave his struggles and bring a name to himself.The film is an American classic in part due to its iconic performances. Sylvester Stallone wasn't a name before this movie, so that makes it even more amazing the success of this movie. I previously seen him in 1971's Bananas as one of the hoodlums on the subway. But here, with his heavy physical presence and his instant recognizable voice, he brings himself into the public spotlight and forever, Stallone will be known as Rocky Balboa. Stallone drew inspiration from the likes of Joe Frazier and Mohammad Ali. He created such a tender performance in my eyes. He may act tough in the ring, but he had such a good heart otherwise. A classic example is where he would visit the very shy Adrian in her pet store job just to visit her. Speaking of Adrian, Talia Shire delivered a good performance as Adrian. Her character is vastly different than her Connie Corleone character from The Godfather and I appreciate that. Carl Weathers does a great job as Apollo Creed. The look on his face when he realized Rocky was trying to beat him was just a priceless look. Burt Young, who portrays Adrian's brother Paulie, also does a solid job. He was a very abusive brother and the scene where he destroys the house with a baseball bat because he was not pleased with Adrian, added more drama to the movie and it showed the kind of man Paulie is. Last but not least, I must mention Burgess Meredith in his incredibly powerful performance as Mickey. Meredith was cast against type and despite being an old man, he helped Rocky get into the ring against Apollo Creed.The movie has many iconic scenes to it. There is the training scene where Rocky is punching the meat carcasses. I loved that scene, but here's another trivia. That scene was actually influenced by the training of Joe Frazier. Then who can forget about the iconic scene of running up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum and punching the air to the tune of Bill Conti's 'Gonna Fly Now.' I loved that scene and I loved that music-both which remain cultural influences to this day. It's just worth watching Rocky just to see these awesome training scenes.Overall, I enjoyed watching Rocky very much. Admittedly, I am not much of a boxing fan. However, I was able to get engaged in the movie because it's not just a story about boxing. It's story about being a underdog, a true American hero. The story itself is a simple story and nothing that hasn't been seen before, but it does draw you in and it keeps you engaged. I enjoyed the underdog aspect of the film. To see Sly from collecting money to facing the heavyweight champion, a feat that most people can only dream of. If you watch this movie, you can see why this film remains such an inspiration for many-especially athletes. Keep an eye on the performance by Stallone. A very incredible performance. One that was so good, that Roger Ebert compared him to Marlon Brando. The film lacks originality, but it makes up for it in everything else. John G. Avildsen directed a wonderful engaging sports film and one that will live on and on.My Grade: A-",9,1,1,18 October 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," A Movie Ahead of Its Time!
","Upon completion of All Quiet on the Western Front, I had a myriad of thoughts flashing through my brain. The thought on the top of my head was, 'how on earth was this film made in 1930?' It is a film that is way ahead of its time, cinematically and thematically. The film is clearly an anti-war film that discusses the horrors of World War I, which only ended about a decade before. This is a powerful, thoughtful movie and its one that is relevant some ninety years later. This is one of the first war films in the sound era, and it really revolutionized how war films were made. Steven Spielberg later credited this film for his 1998 picture Saving Private Ryan, which is often heralded as one of the genre's best.Lewis Milestone's film is based off the controversial book written by Erich Maria Remarque. The book, which details the horror of war, was banned in many countries because of its anti-war message. The book and film were banned in Nazi Germany because the Nazis thought Germany was put into a bad light and of course, the Nazis considered themselves a proud, nationalistic political group. Regardless, the message of the movie is correct. War is a horrible thing. World War I was a total war that was a slog for many European nations. Trench warfare was a grueling nature. Being stuck in the trenches, with no food and consistently under enemy fire, often took its toll. Through the eyes of the main character, we see that there is no glory to be found under war.The one unique thing about the film, and still is amongst today's war films, is that we see the point-of-view from the other side. We see what unfolds from the eyes of Germany's new recruits, and keep in mind that this is an American film. I really liked that technique, but it almost backfired. The soldiers hardly seemed German. I could pass them off as American or British. Because the performances were masterful, the direction was excellent, and the message was clear- it does not really matter. It did take me some time to get used to it.The film follows a group of schoolboys who are talked into joining the German Army during the first World War by their war-loving teacher. Their teacher hammered home the point of heroism and lessons of humility to be taught during the war. War means glory! The German recruits, led by Paul (Lew Ayres), quickly find out that this is not the case at all. Death, pain, and suffering are all around them. Surviving this brutal war will be a hard task. If not being shot or stabbed, they may starve to death. There is a scene where Paul tries to save a French soldier in a shell crater. A very harrowing and emotional scene that details the consequences of this war.Lew Ayres gave a powerful, heartbreaking, and unforgettable performance in his role as Paul. He became a star after this performance and this role actually turned Ayres into a pacifist. His speech at the end made my eyes well up in tears. Trying to tell a bunch of kids, who want the path of glory all to themselves, is something no man nor woman would want to do. I also liked the performance of Louis Wolheim. Wolheim was noticeable for his brutish looks and his career took advantage of that. Here, he plays a mentor to Paul and he did a great job. He definitely deserves more recognition.One of the reasons why I questioned if this film was actually released in 1930 (and yes, I know it was) was the look and the depiction of war in the movie. There may be no actual big battle sequences (outside of a few shots), but we see the mortars and the shells exploding at a rapid pace. We see how easy it is to be killed under the line of fire. That scene in the crater provides a great example. Arthur Edeson did an amazing job showing the terror of war.If you like war films or films that are against worldly violence, I recommend All Quiet on the Western Front. It is a movie that will be relentless towards your emotions, so be forewarned. The film shows how ugly war is and also how the average person is lied to in order to join the military. There is no glory or fame. Just suffering and death. It is easy to see why the film was banned around the world, because it was sandwiched in the two World Wars. Each country depended on their citizens to fight these wars for them. But it ain't pretty.My Grade: A-",9,0,0,13 May 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," Just Watch This Movie!
","To Kill A Mockingbird has always been looked upon as an instant classic because of its very important themes dealing with race during the 1930's Alabama, a time where racism was rampant all across the United States especially in the southern states. The film itself, based on the popular and timely novel by Harper Lee, was released in 1962 which was during the civil rights movement. Some critics called this film an innocent film because of the time it was released. It was released back when people were more relaxed, but in the fifty years since then, society has gotten more uptight due to everything that has been going on. Despite a loss of innocence, this is a fantastic movie that has very important themes, even by today's standards. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.This movie can be divided into two mini-movies. One movie is a coming-of-age story told through the eyes of a six-year-old girl named Scout. Scout and her older brother, Jem play in the hot, hazy Alabama sun every day and they have adventures with their next door neighbor, whom they just met. They tell each other tales about another neighbor of theirs named Mr. Radley, whom rumor has it chained up his son, Boo every day. I believe this part of the story was told extremely well, and it returned the memories of my childhood where I used to go off on similar adventures.While the children play, their father named Atticus Finch goes to the courthouse every day, and that leads us on to what the other half of the film is about. This can also be perceived as a courtroom drama, an effective one to boot. The basic story goes that Finch is asked by the town's sheriff to defend a black man who has been accused of rape. The townspeople request Atticus, who is a white man, to stop defending the black man, Tom Robinson. But Atticus believes everyone has a right to be defended, so he decided to continue along with the case.The courtroom scene is the most powerful scene of the movie. There is no doubt about that. The speech Atticus gave talking about ideals and values to show why Tom was innocent of his accused crime is the most powerful speech you'll hear in any movie. I won't deny there were some tears running down my cheeks as I listened to those tender, powerful words. The movie made clear it was on Atticus's side. Through the evidence and the witnesses in the trial, it was clear Tom is innocent, But given this is Alabama in the 1930's, the all-white jury had other ideas. Another extremely powerful scene is after the jury gave its verdict. The black people were segregated from the white people of course, but as everyone cleared out, they all stood in silence watching Atticus. A sign of respect for what he did for their cause. It was only one man, but now it was clear that there were people out there who believed in equal rights. Not just people, but white people who believed.The first half of the movie was all about Scout and her adventures, before it transitioned to a courtroom drama. But after the courtroom drama ended, you would expect the movie to be over. Actually, we transition back to Scout who finds herself in trouble from a racist man named Ewell, whom her father gave a hard time during the trial. Ewell is actually the father of the supposed rape victim and he was doing anything to make sure Robinson was guilty. But this is the time where the mysterious Boo Radley comes into play, where he shows he is not the person the whispers across town make him out to be. This is the part of the movie where the title comes from. I really loved this story. It may be a clichéd story in today's world, but it was something fresh back in 1962. Despite all the clichés, it is all about story execution. The screenplay and the direction by Robert Mulligan are rather light, but I felt for each character. I rooted for Atticus, Scout, and even Boo the entire movie. You know a movie is great when that happens. In other words, I loved the proper people and I hated the proper people. Another thing to look at in getting to know the characters is how the actors bring them to life. In this movie, the actors brought Harper Lee's words to life and gave that life meaning. Gregory Peck won Best Actor at the Oscars for his wonderful, stirring performance as Atticus Finch. But his performance throughout the entire film was a reserved, quiet performance. A performance that resembled the real-life Gregory Peck. Mary Badham gave a terrific performance as the young tomboy, Scout. She gave the film a sense of adventure and she was very supportive of her father, despite her limited understanding of what was going on. She was an incredible part of this movie's success.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is a very powerful, effective movie that came out at a time where hope was in the air. Hope for the black people to finally receive equal rights. Thematically, this was a very important movie. It was one of the earliest movies to actually portray black people in a positive light from the view of white people. Looking at events occurring across the world today, the themes of this movie can still be considered important. The acting and the story received the most praise from me. But let's not forget about the wonderful black-and-white cinematography nor the beautiful piano score by Elmer Bernstein.

The Bridge on the River Kwai," David Lean's Masterful War Film!
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie that is often very entertaining, but it sets itself apart from other war movies. Unlike those other movies, this particular film is a provocative film that asks complex questions, but doesn't answer them easily. It is all up to the audience to believe what happened and why it happened. Of course, everyone may have different opinions and the movie seems to ask for that. Usually in war movies, they are concerned about the bigger picture such as who wins or who loses, which is all very fair questions. But the reason this film works more than most war films is because it poses questions that are deeper than the winner or loser. The movie talks about individualism. It's not all about who wins or loses the war, but who is in that war and how does war affect the individual.This film takes place in 1943, at a Japanese POW camp during the middle of World War Two. The Japanese have captured British soldiers, led by Colonel Nicholson. Nicholson and his soldiers are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate a railway. Nicholson convinces his soldiers to build the bridge for British morality and to show the Japanese what they stand for. But over time, Nicholson develops an obsessive disorder with completing the bridge, which is being seen as collaborating with the enemy. Unknowingly to Nicholson or Saito, there is a plot to destroy the bridge. An American named Shears, a former POW who escaped the camp, is part of the team that is tasked with blowing up the bridge.If you put the movie on about three-quarters into it, you would be forgiven if you thought Saito and Nicholson were allies. But the a good portion of the beginning of the film, it was quite the opposite. The film opens with Nicholson and his troops being led into the camp and being introduced to Saito. It became clear right away that each man's morale opposed each other. It also became clear that Nicholson possessed a brave spirit. He endured torture for the sake of his beliefs, and he risked the chance of being killed. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Nicholson took out a copy of the Geneva Convention out of his pocket (to prove to Saito that officers don't have to work on the bridge) and gave it to Saito, in which Saito used it to slap Nicholson across the face drawing blood. Then, he was dragged to 'The Oven,' a hut that stands in the fierce sun. But once Nicholson was released, that is when the two men began to work together, drawing up some interesting questions.My favorite sections of the movie was when Nicholson, played wonderfully by Alec Guinness was on screen. However, the other half of the film is based on the plot trying to destroy the bridge. Shears was a former POW, but as an escapee and at a local hospital imitating an officer, he is coerced into the plot so his imitation as an officer wont become public. I liked the slow, grueling pace of these scenes, attempting to reach the bridge because it shows what it would be like in reality. It certainly was no picnic. It's not nearly as convincing as the scenes in the jungle, but it's good enough.This film was the film that gave Alec Guinness his Oscar. He gave such an intense performance as the colonel who slowly begins a moral descent, perhaps the only thing that kept him alive. Guinness deserved his Oscar for his powerful performance. William Holden does an expert job in playing a typical American, Shears. He likes the booze and the women, but also is compelled by adventure even if the outcome seems a little murky. I also liked the performance of Sessue Hayakawa, as the strict Japanese commandant. He was actually one of the first Asian stars in Hollywood, from the era of silent film. So it was nice for the film to harken back to its beginning. Finally, the movie boasts excellent supporting turns by Jack Hawkins, as the leader of the crew headed to destroy the bridge and James Donald, the doctor of the camp and the man who questions the sanity of Colonel Nicholson. His expression on his face in the scene where Nicholson recruits sick and injured soldiers to help with the bridge was yet another powerful moment in the film.The film is directed by David Lean, who excels at directing these kind of big, explosive films. Lean is famously hard to work with. It is on record that Guinness and Lean did not like each other during filming, but somehow Guinness was still able to deliver a powerhouse performance. Despite his personality, Lean is experienced in such films. He delivered a film that is entertaining, but still was able to put important themes and messages in the movie such as what it takes to stay alive under times of duress (such as this war).Overall, The Bridge on the River Kwai is an incredibly powerful, expertly-made war film that shows how war can make people mad. From start to finish, I was glued to the movie taking in all the excellent performances and a excellent story thanks to the Oscar-winning screenplay by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson. One note to mention is this film is not based on historical truth. It's a fictional story, despite a similar event that actually happened. The only thing that is real is the harsh treatment of the soldiers in the POW camp. Everything about the film: the acting, directing, cinematography, score, and story just screams perfection. This is one of my all-time favorite war movies.My Grade: A+",10,4,6,12 December 2015
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The Nurse Ratched Show!
","I will say this upfront. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is my favorite film of 1975 and is in my personal top ten films of all time. It's an American classic that was beloved upon release and forty years later, it still holds up well in terms of relevance and quality filmmaking. There is just so much to love about the movie. Just watching Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher go head to head is a delight to watch. Those two actors, whom won Academy Awards for their performances, make this movie into what it is. They are very special performances. People call this movie a comedy, but I'm not sure if you can call it one. There are comedic elements definitely, but this is more of a drama. A drama about losing everything for the benefit of others. Thanks to exquisite direction by Milos Forman and a array of performances from a diverse cast, this movie is one that is necessary to check out. Like right now.J.R McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has a storied criminal past. He has been in prison countless number of times. After his latest crime, he is back in trouble with the law. But in order to escape prison, McMurphy pleads insanity and he is sent to a mental hospital. In the hands of the wretched Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), he witnesses abuse and degradation towards himself and the other wards. In true 70's spirit, McMurphy rallies up the other inmates in order to stand up against the wicked Nurse Ratched.This film is all about the performances and characterization. Without these essential elements, this film would be half the film it currently is. McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are two iconic characters that will live forever in movie lore. McMurphy because of his unique rebellious character who seems like an ass on the outside, but somehow becomes close pals with the majority of the inmates. Then we have the Nurse Ratched. She is not evil in the sense one would think of evil. She manipulates people and uses the flaws of her patients to gain power. Her motives are generally clear to the audience, but she uses such a deceptively calm voice which irritates her patients. There is one powerful scene where McMurphy wanted to watch the World Series, but she uses an unfair voting system to make it clear he cannot do what he wants. In a sense, Ratched makes the perfect dominatrix with her calm demeanor, fishy motives, and that shiny nurses uniform. We also have a variety of important supporting characters. There is Chief Bromden, an intimidating Native American who lives in a shell by 'being' mute and deaf, but he becomes a pivotal character for McMurphy. Then he have the likes of Billy Bibbit, a young man wanting sex for the first time (and has all the support of his mates), and Traber and Martini whom are more important inmates.The performances are wonderful. Everyone plays off each other incredibly well. The chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher was nothing short of brilliant. Jack Nicholson showed how talented he was in 1974's Chinatown, but here he really shines and does more than enough to win his Academy Award statue. Louise Fletcher held a commanding screen presence by being psychologically evil. She just may be one of the more memorable screen villains of all time. Up there with the likes of Darth Vader or Jaws. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job. We get great performances from many actors who would go on to have respectable careers such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif. Will Sampson was the man who portrayed Chief. I loved his character and how meaningful he was to the story. What he had to do for his pal McMurphy was an emotionally powerful scene which added greatness to the movie.One interesting thing to point out is the score of the movie. Scores are used to evoke emotion out of the audience and I think Jack Nitzche's music added something new and original. Apparently he composed the score with the aid of a eerie-sounding saw and some wine glasses. When you hear the score, you'll know what I mean. I didn't like it too much upon my first viewing, but it grew on me and I fell in love with it upon my second viewing.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a beautiful, beautiful film. This is a genuine American masterpiece and it features Jack Nicholson at his finest. His character embodies the stigma of loyalty, rebellion, and freedom. He wants to rid himself of evil, and in the process makes many friends. He endures everything from useless medication to shock therapy, but in the end his loyalty to others is what wins. McMurphy is the symbol of goodness. Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, is one of the greatest villains of all time. A mild complaint is how the film treats the women in the film. Not very well (outside of two girls used to give Bibbit the night of his life), but it works well with the plot. This film is expertly-written, masterfully-directed, and the performances are all genuine. Nominated for 9 Oscars, this is just an amazing piece of art.My Grade: A+",10,2,2,18 October 2017
Jaws," The Beginning of the Summer Blockbuster!
","Jaws is one of cinema's most influential movies of all time. This film did wonders for the movie industry. It brought about the advent of the summer movie season, it paved the future for blockbusters, it skyrocketed the career of a genius director in the form of Steven Spielberg, and of course this happens to be a damn good thriller. It is one of my favorite all-time movies and despite seeing this film multiple times, I always find watching the movie to be a wondrous experience. Steven Spielberg is considered by many to be one of best movie directors of all-time, and I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. Time after time, he creates movies that exhibit joy, happiness, and the most of all-magic. Even his lesser films have a hint of magic to them. Each and every single thing the guy makes is pure art. 1975's Jaws is just the beginning of his storied career. Now the production of the movie was often troubled, but the result was incredible. Spielberg often recalls that he thought he would never make a movie again because of his not-so-secret production issues. The film was over-budget, the screenplay was being written simultaneously with filming, the cast and crew were becoming tired and worn out, the mechanical shark they were using kept on breaking, and Spielberg was just a director whose lack of experience and his heavy ego made things even more complicated. But luckily, Spielberg persevered in creating a very fun, terror-inducing movie.So obviously we know the film is about sharks. But lets take a closer look at the plot. After a fatal attack by a shark off the coast of popular summer resort Amity Island, police chief Marcus Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the resort. But the mayor of the town, Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't want to close down the resort because it will hurt business. But after another attack, Vaughn decides to rethink things. With the help of a scientist from the Oceanographic institute Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a seasoned World War Two sailor Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody goes after the huge great white shark that has been terrorizing the denizens of Amity Island.The film has a wonderful cast-typical of a Spielberg film. They all bring their A games in the movie especially the three leads. Roy Scheider does a good job as Police Chief Brody who unsuccessfully alerts everyone of the danger lurking in the water. I liked Richard Dreyfuss's portrayal of Hooper. Hooper has intense knowledge about sharks and I liked that performance very much. I also have to give it to Robert Shaw for his wonderful performance. He created his own monologue about how he and his crew was stranded in shark-infested waters during the war and he was one of the few survivors. That monologue was very well-done because it gave me a good case of the creeps. Murray Hamilton as Mayor Vaughn was solid, but it's essentially Hamilton playing a role he always does.I liked the transformation this movie witnessed. Based off the wildly popular novel by Peter Benchley, this film was originally conceived as a straight-up horror picture reminiscent of a Ray Harryhausen picture. But as luck would have it with the mechanical shark not working well, this movie turned into something Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. They would show very little of the shark-maybe a dorsal fin here or there. By keeping the shark under the table for most of the film, the audience is shocked when the big reveal occurs. The final half hour when the crew is out in the waters hunting and fighting the shark, that was a very fun and intense time. But I loved the set-up. We see these attacks but we don't see the shark. We know the shark is there thanks to the fantastic underwater cinematography by Bill Butler and of course the insanely popular score by John Williams. One of the best scores of all time. That opening sequence for the first attack is a scene that was well-done and it immediately set the tone of the movie. This movie is terrifying at times and it might make you not go into the water for months. Beware if you want to show this to any young children. Don't let the PG rating fool you because there is lots of carnage and scary moments.Overall, Jaws is an influential movie that spawned three sequels and a special place in everyone's heart. I found it to be a very entertaining and fun shark thriller that never gets old. The shark itself may be questionable at times, but considering what happened during shooting, I'm very happy the way the shark turned out to be. I thought the screenplay would be a weak spot, but it was actually well-written and rather straightforward. The acting was fantastic, and the direction was fluid despite the production issues. Spielberg began his esteemed career here with the record-breaking box office and the popularity that still persists today. I loved the terror and the tension the film inspires mainly due to the Hitchcock inspiration and the menacing, terror-provoking score by John Williams. As soon as you hear the first notes from the tuba, you will immediately connect it with Jaws. This movie is a straightforward, old-fashioned thriller and if you are one of those rare souls who haven't seen this picture, please do.My Grade: A",9,1,2,18 October 2017
Halloween," The Horror Film That Started It All!
","1978's Halloween is the definitive horror film. Without this classic, there wouldn't be the 80's slasher flicks we come to know and love today (or do we?). There would be no Nightmare on Elm Street. Genre films are important in today's cinematic world, but would they be if John Carpenter decided not to direct this little tiny horror film? This film went on to spawn endless amounts of sequels and reboots and they practically all failed quality-wise when compared to this film (although the 2018 sequel that ignored the previous movies was very good).Honestly, it amazes me how John Carpenter was able to create one of the scariest movies ever made. The movie was made on such a low budget, $300,000 to be exact. The movie ended up grossing 47 million dollars domestically and an additional 23 million worldwide thus making the movie the most successful independent movie of all time. The film was well-received when it first appeared onscreen. In fact, esteemed critic Roger Ebert placed the movie in this top ten films of 1978 and he is often a vocal critic of slasher films.The movie itself is very scary and it works just as well as a psychological thriller as a slasher movie. There is very little gore and hardly any blood, which absolutely surprised me. The majority of the violence takes place offscreen. It is a testament to the uncanny craftmanship of director/screenwriter/composer Carpenter, lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis, screenwriter Debra Hill, and among others to create a franchise that made Michael Myers a forever legend.I mentioned earlier that Halloween was a movie that popularized the genre, thus creating similar slasher films in the 1980's and beyond. Besides that, this movie made many horror movie tropes we see today popular. For example, this movie had the final girl trope, it made a daring movie killing off any characters with a hint of promiscuity or substance abuse, and also Carpenter had scenes showing murders from the killer's point of view. The whole opening sequence involving 6-year old Michael Myers killing his sexually active sister was shown through the little peephole eyes of Michael's costume. Perhaps the most important is the portrayal of women. Critics are vocal how later slasher films are misogynistic and they blame Halloween. Even so, women are given a more stronger stand in this movie and in later movies. Prior to this film, women were helpless people that were saved by the strong male character. Here, Jamie Lee Curtis was able to fend for herself mostly without the help of any male character.It's a cold night in Haddonfield, Illinois in the year 1963. Michael Myers, a 6-year-old boy, murdered his sister in cold blood. He was taken away to the Warren County Sanitarium and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Dr. Loomis was able to see the pure evilness of Michael Myer's soul when no one else could. 15 years later, Michael escapes and Dr. Loomis witnesses the escape. Loomis heads to Haddonfield to warn the town because he knows that is where the villain is heading. Teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her friends may be the next victims of Michael Myers. Can they do anything to save themselves?The performances are excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis was an unknown at the time, although she happened to be the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Hitchcock was one of Carpenter's idols when it came to the making of this movie. Anyhow, Curtis was a revelation and ultimately gave a convincing portrayal of a quiet, small-town girl turning into a badass warrior in a way. Donald Pleasance added veteran poise to the movie as the male hero, and he had some fantastic scenes and memorable lines of dialogue. His quote, 'I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil,' may be the best quote of the movie as he describes what we are dealing with.Overall, Halloween is one of the best films of 1978 and it is the horror movie that set the ground for future horror/slasher films. The tropes we see in today's horror films were introduced in this film. The movie does not rely upon gore or blood as it more wants to play tricks with your brain. It's scary, visceral, and suspenseful. The acting, the direction, and music are what made this movie so good. The ever-famous score by Carpenter gave much suspense to the movie just like John Williams did with 1975's Jaws. Before Freddy Kreuger or Jason, we got Michael Myers. If you like horror films, this should be at the top of your list. If you do not like being scared, give this movie a pass.My Grade: A-",9,5,5,11 February 2019
Raging Bull," Perfection!
","Raging Bull is hands-down my favorite movie of 1980. It is also the best boxing movie ever made, and it is a movie that will forever be remembered by American audiences. Martin Scorsese's film tells the true story of the unhinged boxer, Jake LaMotta (who passed away last year at the ripe old age of 95). He was a boxer who punched hard, harder, and hardest, and he went all out in the boxing ring. Outside of the ring, he was a vulnerable man especially when it came to women. He believed women to be precious virgins for his own making, and only he can take away their virginity. The movie really went deep with his character, and I love how the movie is not afraid to throw punches. This was Martin Scorsese's big passion project. After the disappointment of his 1977 feature, New York, New York, he fell into a state of depression and that triggered his drug use which almost killed him. Fortunately, this movie took him away from those dark times. He was reluctant to make this movie at first because he does not like sports. With the help of Robert De Niro, Scorsese was convinced to make the movie. He made it clear that this was his movie and he was going to make it his way. We are glad he did, because this movie ended up being an all-time great that will forever be studied in film school. Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is a boxer known for obliterating his opponents in the boxing ring. Outside of the boxing ring, he treats his family and friends like garbage. He is a ticking time bomb, ready to destroy the people who love him. What could be the reasons? Is it because he is constantly jealous or paranoid? Is it because his women are cheating on him? Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin brings the true story of this very violent man to life with their hard-hitting screenplay. In addition to Scorsese, this is Robert De Niro's movie. In a career spanning nearly half a century, this is his role you will remember him by. His convincing portrayal of Jake LaMotta is one of the best acting performances ever, and it earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. I also loved his commitment to the role. He famously stopped production for several months so he can go on a binge-eating tour of Europe to increase his weight necessary for the role. Joe Pesci who played LaMotta's brother Joey was also great. Pesci actually gave up on acting prior to this role, but De Niro convinced him to play this role. I am glad because this also ranks as Pesci's finest performance to date. Another component I value about the movie is the look and the editing process of the film. The film is made in black and white and it adds realism to the movie. Scorsese also changed the way boxing movies were made. He was the first director to film the fight scenes inside the ring. That allowed us to see the emotions of the fighters. It also gave us a very brutal, unflinching view of the fights. Scorsese isn't afraid to show blood. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing ranks at one of the all-time's best. You won't find a better-edited film anywhere else. Raging Bull is one of those films that you will dissect in film school. There are layers upon layers to the film, and one could spend years trying to understand it. As much as I enjoy watching Ordinary People and its theme of PTSD, this is the film that ultimately should have won best picture. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro crafted one of those rare films that could be defined as perfect. My Grade: A+",10,4,6,2 January 2018
Blade Runner," A Visual Treat For Your Senses!
","I remember my first viewing of 1982's Blade Runner. From the director of Alien, the guy who starred in Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a science fiction setting that was marketed as some sort of sci-fi adventure in the vein of Star Wars, this couldn't go wrong, right? My young teenage self was in for utter disappointment. I did not expect a deep, thoughtful movie that explores what it means to be human. With hardly any action scenes, I was pretty disappointed. More than ten years later, I gave the film a chance with a more mature pair of eyes. I certainly was able to appreciate the wonders of the movie a lot more. This is one of those films that is always misunderstood at first, but people come back to appreciate it later on. Like this one particular viewer!Ridley Scott, coming off his highly successful horror sci-fi Alien wanted to direct something with more meaning and lyrical, so he was given Hampton Fancher's script to read. Based on Philip K. Dick's story, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,' the script tackles some dark themes and it ask questions like, 'should we value humans without emotions or androids with emotion?' The movie and the script borrows themes from classic Greek literature and from the Bible itself. Even with a narrow teenage mind, I was impressed at the overt religious overtone the film had. This film meant much to Scott because he wanted to tackle this kind of project after the death of his older brother. He did have to combat his producers and the studio over this project. For example, he was forced to add mediocre narration that took away from the story. Luckily, he took out that narration in the Director's Cut, released many years later.It is the year 2019, in the futuristic city of Los Angeles. (I really love how the movie portrayed the year we are currently in). The race of man was able to create technology that allowed them to make humanoids with short, fixed lifespans called replicants. These replicants were banned from Earth and sent to off-world colonies. The main character of the story, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner. A Blade Runner is a cop whose specialization is to hunt down any escaped replicants. When four replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) makes their way to Earth, Deckard has to hunt them down while truly discovering who he is himself.I thought the performances were very good. Harrison Ford also wanted to have a deeper, symbolic role and he was intrigued by the questions this film asked. He gave a meaningful, but low-key performance. It's a shame that he often clashed with Ridley Scott on set, but these two did not get along. Rutger Hauer delivered the film's best performance. With his striking blond hair and eyes, no one can forget his villainous performance that goes down in the history books as one of the best. I also liked Sean Young's performance as the replicant Rachael who believes that she is human. Keep an eye out for other great supporting performances from Edward James Olmos, M. Emmett Walsh, and Daryl Hannah.I was blown away with the futuristic design and the special effects. The look of the film was created by Douglas Trumbull, the same man who worked on the effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey. There is also a nice use of product placement in the film, which is the most memorable in my mind. Such advertisements from Coca-Cola and Atari were used. Fun fact! The sales of these companies dropped after appearing in the film, later known as the 'Blade Runner Curse.' Some designs that stood out to me, excluding the whole futuristic look, were the cop cars known as spinners and a lie detector test known as the Voight-Kampff Machine. Philip K. Dick passed away before the film began production, but he was pleased at the look of the film. The visions he saw matched the visions of his brain.Another important part of the movie is the music. Coming off his Academy Award win for his famous score for 1981's Chariots of Fire, he creates an atmospheric synth-based score. The atmospheric music complements the film very well, and who can forget the tenor sax love theme. If anything is wrong with the movie, it is definitely not the music!Many film buffs call Blade Runner one of the best science-fiction films of all time. In my own humble opinion, it is definitely one of the most important films to the genre, but maybe there have been better movies, quality-wise. That said, this is still a very good film. My biggest issue is the pacing and the off-hand narration, but Ridley Scott directs this film like an expert. It is a character-driven, theme-based movie that asks many important questions. I do like how they leave many of these questions ambiguous. Of course, the biggest question of all: Is Rick Deckard a replicant?My Grade: B+",8,2,3,29 June 2019
Ben-Hur," A Beautifully-Made Epic!
","In 1956, The Ten Commandments was released to a massive success around the world. It had such a worldwide appeal due to the story being well-known everywhere. Three years later, another wildly successful epic was released in the form of Ben-Hur. This movie seems like the first cousin of The Ten Commandments. Both are stories based off biblical events, and Charlton Heston plays the lead role in both films. Heston wasn't nominated for any major awards with his 1956 film, but he was nominated and won an Oscar for his amazing portrayal of Judah Ben-Hur, an influential man amongst his people.If I had to choose what my favorite epic was from this era, I would have chosen Ben-Hur. It has such a fascinating story as it's about a man who wants what is only right for his people. His people are conquered by the Romans, and he wants a better life for them. The movie goes into so much detail on the man Judah was. He was alive for the teachings of Jesus Christ, although he was not seen to be an ardent supporter. However, one of the best scenes in the movie was Judah and his family watching Jesus being marched with a cross on his back on his way to be crucified. That scene did admittedly tear me up.Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a rich Jewish merchant whom resides in Jerusalem. An old childhood Roman friend of his named Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives to become commanding officer of Jerusalem. Both men are extremely happy to see each other at first, but their friendship becomes divided over political issues. When the governor arrives during a welcome parade, a tile falls off the roof accidentally injuring the governor. Messala takes advantage of the incident and the broken friendship with Judah to send Judah into slavery and his mother and sister into prison. Judah makes a name for himself in the galleys and becomes a Roman prince. Now Judah comes back home and he vows revenge on Messala for how he treated his family.Charlton Heston had the fortune to appear in what are the two most famous epics of all time. He was able to convince me in his performance as Moses. Now in this film, he even more so convinces me as Judah Ben-Hur. Both men want to do what is right for their people, but they are two different men. Heston does an amazing job in this role and I believe he deserves his Oscar victory. Stephen Boyd does well as Messala. Both Heston and Boyd have excellent chemistry, which makes the broken friendship even more gut-wrenching. We also get strong supporting performances from Cathy O'Donnell and Martha Scott who portrayed Ben-Hur's mother and sister respectively. They mostly spend their time in the film battling leprosy, which is a very gruesome disease. The makeup department did a very good job in accurately showing the symptoms of leprosy. I also liked Hugh Griffith's performance as Sheik Ilderim, who turns out to be a useful ally for Ben-Hur. He provided some comedy, especially when it came to offering Ben-Hur his daughters to marry. Finally, Haya Harareet does a fine job as the love interest of Ben-Hur, Esther.At the time of the film's release, it had the largest budget of any film released. It had a price tag of around fifteen million dollars, or 123 million dollars when adjusted to today's standards by inflation. I believe the budget was spent properly. The epic is beautiful and is home too many large, grand scenes. The most famous scene is the well-known chariot scene, which would hold up well in any movie released today. The race itself was epic and it features some hardcore chariot racing. The chariot race takes time to complete, and I'm glad it does. It's my favorite sequence of the movie and it's arguably the most action-packed scene of the 210-minute film. When one thinks of Ben-Hur, they will always bring up the chariot scene. It is a very influential scene on future movies.There were some other scenes I loved to such as the scene in the galleys where Judah rescues a Roman general at sea during war and he becomes an adopted son of the general. Whenever Judah and Messala appear on screen together is always worth watching. Judah's search for his family is also a powerful section of the movie. The movie looks gorgeous and the production design is wonderful. Ancient Rome actually looked authentic, which is hard to say of movies released during this time period. Jerusalem also looked authentic too. I also loved the score by Miklos Rosza. It was a beautiful score to listen to and it works very well with the movie.Overall, Ben-Hur is a flat-out great epic. The movie does run into pacing problems, but that can be expected at a movie clocked around three-and-a-half hours. Everything is consistent with the film ranging from the acting to the special effects (no CGI of course) to the wonderful direction of William Wyler. Without Wyler's consistent tonal direction, who knew if this film would work. As a history film, this film may not always be accurate. But they did get the tone mostly right. A winner of 11 Oscars including Best Picture, this is one of my favorite epics to watch.My Grade: A",9,1,3,10 January 2016
The Deer Hunter," Hard to Watch At Times!
","1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However, there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of 'God Bless America.' I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later, I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD (post-trauma syndrome). But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best, but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.You can call this movie a symphony of some sort. I sort this film into three major segments. The first segment is the longest because of its lengthy and effective characterization. We meet three Pennsylvania factory workers: Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (Christopher Walken). They enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam. Steven decides to marry before going off to war and this wedding also serves as the farewell party. This section is eerily reminiscent of the opening act of The Godfather. There is lots of partying and dancing. And we essentially get to know these characters. These men are hard workers who get drunk at the party because they deserve a night for themselves. After the party, the trio of friends along with another friend Stan (John Cazale) go into the mountains to hunt for deer for one last trip. Hence the title of the movie. I found this section to be incredibly effective in character-building. Director Michael Cimino took his time with his part because it was important to understand these men before they go into the horrors of war.The second movement of our symphony is the actual war. Just like that with a loud noise, the film instantly changes its tone. From the foggy mountains of Pennsylvania to the tropical war zone of Vietnam we go. In one of the most terrifying sequences ever made, the three men are taken prisoner and are forced to play Russian roulette while their captors are betting who will win and who will die. Just seeing the men's faces as they are waiting their turn in the rat-infested cages are undeniably scary. One of the film's controversies is that roulette was not actually played in Vietnam. According to Cimino, he read articles saying they did play roulette although any of this has not been confirmed. But it's one hell of a way to add tension to the movie. You can also take this as a symbol for the war overall. Roger Ebert puts it perfectly in his review, 'Anything you can believe about the game, about it's deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply it to the war as a whole.' Essentially, this violence stands for the war itself and what these men face. Now our final act of the symphony is what happens after the horrors of the prison camp. Michael becomes a prominent character here as he returns home and is welcomed as a hero by his townsfolk and his girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). But Michael does not feel like a hero. Steven is in the hospital after losing his legs and Nick is somewhere in Vietnam still. Michael eventually goes back to find Nick who happened to take his roulette experiences to heart by playing this game professionally. This section is incredibly sad and moving as here we see what exactly war can do to strong-willed men. It was horrible to watch this transformation on screen. To see these characters we got to laugh with in the first part to seeing them play with death in the final act is sad to see. We also get to see an act of patriotism (or is it?) when the survivors join in a ragged rendition of 'God Bless America' in the very end. This movie has a very strong cast, although the only star at the time was Robert De Niro. De Niro instantly became the film's leader and he played Michael very well. He became a bona fide star after his work in The Godfather: Part Two, and he put that stardom to work here. Christopher Walken had some of the strongest scenes in the movie because of his involvement with the deadly game of Russian roulette. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses ever to grace our screens, and this was one of her first big roles. We end this paragraph with a sad note. This would be the last movie John Cazale would play because he was suffering from terminal cancer and he died before the film was released. He was very good as Stan, but you can tell in the movie that he was really sick.Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a incredible movie about the horror of wars and it effective covers themes ranging from PTSD to male bonding and friendship. It was one of the first movies to successfully cover the Vietnam War, although I'd say this film may not be the most accurate regarding the actual war. I do commend its effort on conveying the themes of general war though. This film was nominated for nine Oscars and it won five of them including Best Picture. Walken took home the statue for his amazing and tense performance as Nick. The film may be controversial and it may be hard to watch, but it's one you'll remember forever.

Rear Window," Incredibly Suspenseful and Tense!
","Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most important auteurs and every motion picture release with his name attached was a big event. The sharp-detailed director had two movies released in 1954. The first was the thrilling, perhaps a bit minor Dial M for Murder. His second film is the subject of this review, Rear Window. Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best, if not the best thrillers he has ever made. The story is simple enough, but the film envelopes you in a world of nonstop tension. I was biting my nails from start to finish, and that is habit that rarely comes out. Good job, Mr. Hitchcock! The story, written by John Michael Hayes seems quite simple, but I love the complexity that is given to the film. Just like Hitchcock's other 1954 feature, most of the film takes place in one location-the apartment of James Stewart's character, L.B Jeffries. The one set based off Greenwich Village in New York City, that Hitchcock built on the set of Paramount studios is very elaborate and it really works well with the film. Did you know that he even created a drainage system that would allow the water used as rain to drain? One thing that Hitchcock excels at in each film of his is his excellent sense of detail. L.B Jeffries aka Jeff (James Stewart) is confined to his apartment after his breaking his leg. He has two women coming to his apartment to take care him: his wisecracking nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his beautiful longtime girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who works as a fashion model. To save him from boredom, Jeff decides to spy on his neighbors with his binocular. There is Miss Lonely Hearts who cooks fancy dinners for imaginary guests and there is Miss Torso who entertains various males just to name some of the people he sees. One rainy night, he notices a neighbor named Thorwald (Raymond Burr) leaving a with a trunk three times and that his nagging and invalid wife is no longer present. That leaves Jeff suspicious of his neighbor and he believes a murder took place. Along with Stella, Lisa, and his police lieutenant friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), Jeff begins to put the pieces together to find the truth. When there is only location, you need great direction and great acting to make up for that closed location. We already know Hitchcock directed the hell out of the film, and he earned an Academy Award nomination. What about the acting? I can happily report that the acting is phenomenal. James Stewart really crushes it here, considering his character is immobilized the entire time. Pre-war, Jimmy Stewart was known for his comedies, westerns, and taking nice guy roles in general. After WW2 ended, he began taking more complex and darker roles. Hitchcock exploited that side of him not only with this film, but in 1958's Vertigo as well. He does well with the coldness of his character. Grace Kelly, who appeared in Dial M for Murder, does well here. She is cool and elegant and is more than just the beautiful blonde. She also does some unexpecting stuff such as sneaking in the apartment of the suspect-and that scene is dripping with tension, I promise! There is a lot that goes behind Hitchcock's head. One idea he prominently displays here is the idea of voyeurism. The basic definition of voyeurism is taking pleasure in watching someone unobserved. The term can be used in a sexual way, or it could be used in a way that watching someone else's pain relieves the watcher of his/her pain. Also, what about us viewers of the movie? Are we not taking pleasure or interest in watching the pain or emotions of these characters? Voyeurism is the central theme at play here. There are also themes that can be discussed regarding impotence of male figures and how women are just not supposed to be seen as beautiful, but how they can be regarded as puzzles or even threats. For such a simple story, there can be much to think about!Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. It really thrills you from start to finish and I am not talking about any of those cheap thrills. The characters are built up so well that by the time we get to the payoff in the end, do we really care about that payoff? I mean that in a positive way! With only one set location, the use of diegetic (natural) sound outside the main titles, this really is a thriller to behold. I can't be sure if this is my favorite Hitchcock film as there are so many masterpieces, but this is up there!My Grade: A",9,2,2,24 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Birth of a Cultural Revolution!
","A cultural revolution. That is what perfectly describes Star Wars: A New Hope. Movie historians have longed said that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas gave cinema a rebirth. The early 70's were a period for American and art-house films, but these two men allowed movies to become fun again. According to Lucas, who created THX-1138 and American Graffiti, the purpose for this movie was just for movies to become fun again. What he did for cinema today, well we have this man to thank for it. This small low-budget sci-fi film spawned six more movies with many more to come. Star Wars has now spread across three generations, three generations of love. I love hearing stories from people who saw this when it came out in 1977. They tell me how much this cultural phenomenon impacted their lives. My father is a mega Star Wars fan, and it's safe to say this is one of his favorite movies. How could such a small movie impact the movie business the way it did? Well, it helps that it's a fabulous movie. The movie features an iconic villain named Darth Vader who is known for his deep breathing noises. We have two incredibly memorable heroes in Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The two most famous robots in movie history are C-3PO and R2-D2. We have everyone's favorite scoundrel in Han Solo, the pilot of the Millennium Falcon and his favorite sidekick Chewbacca, a bear-like Wookiee. So what I'm trying to stay here, is the film has instantly memorable characters. This film pushed new ground with visual effects. Luca's own company, Industrial Light & Magic worked very hard in creating never-before-seen effects from the humming of the lightsabers to the robotic language of R2-D2. The film looks impressive for a 1977 feature, and that could have attracted scores of people. Most of all, this is a fun movie. Why do I love this film? Firstly, it's a very engaging story. A simple one, but an engaging one. I love science fiction films, so this film would be in my wheelhouse. Maybe it's because of Star Wars that I love sci-fi so much. George Lucas had to go through so much to bring his vision to cinema. He had his ideas early as 1971, but it look many years to get Alan Ladd Jr. of Twentieth Century Fox studios to back his vision. Despite the lack of great direction, the performances were still sharp as I will discuss later. Memorable performances from everyone. I mentioned in earlier reviews on this site that composer John Williams is my favorite composer. Well just listen to this mighty impressive score and you'll see why. The movie was fun to look at and to listen to and it enhances the story in a very positive way. The planets and their landscapes are wonderful to look at. I was impressed with the scale of the desert on the planet of Tatooine. There is a scene located at an intergalactic bar and it's just amazing how good practical effects looked with all of these aliens together. (This bar also happened to be where the controversial scene where you wonder who shot first. Han Solo or the bounty hunter, Greedo?) Believe it or not, I hated Star Wars as little kid. Luckily, that has changed as the years went on.So without further ado, let's go into the story of the film. It's a very simple, but well-defined story. The characters are simple ones, but they are given such deep characterization. This film follows a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he sets out with his older, wiser Jedi mentor named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and a scoundrel pilot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as they set out to rescue the Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the evil second-in-command of the Empire, Darth Vader. (David Prowse, but famously voiced by James Earl Jones). They also must destroy the Death Star, a moon turned into a planet-destroying weapon, if they have any chance in stopping the Empire. See how wonderfully simple this story is? It's incredibly easy to follow, but there are layers to everything in the story.Which such a wonderful story, there has to be good performances right? Of course there are amazing performances! Career-defining performances in fact. Harrison Ford later stated it was because of Star Wars that he had such a great career. Shoulda not talked thrash about this movie during filming Harrison, huh? Well, despite Ford talking crap, he delivers the goods as Han Solo. I loved his cocky attitude, but deep down he was a man who is caring (if you count his love towards Leia) and someone who had no love for the Empire. Mark Hamill is great as Luke. His performance is shaky at first, but he grows as the film moves on. Carrie Fisher is great as Leia. A powerful heroine, which is something not seen in many 70's movies. Alec Guinness added a veteran presence as Obi-Wan and he truly embodies his character. Of course then there is Darth Vader. He is played by David Prowse, but is voiced by James Earl Jones (an iconic voice for the villain). Wonderful performances all around.So to sum up my feelings about the movie, I just about loved it. I have this movie to thank for giving me my undying love for the science fiction genre. I appreciate what this film did to change the way movies were made. Starting in 1977, summer blockbusters were going to be very prominent. Star Wars is a series that will live on forever and ever. This is something that everyone loves. But way beneath the implications, the film is a low-budget sci-fi film that only wanted to deliver fun to audiences worldwide. It certainly did that. One of my favorite movies of 1977. Thank you, George Lucas, for creating Star Wars.My Grade: A",9,1,1,18 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!
","In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his 'wounded ego' attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ 'No, I am your father!' (Vader to Luke) 'Try not, Do, or do not!'

The Breakfast Club," Different Backgrounds Being Brought Together!
","When people talk about teen movies, most minds stray to John Hughes's 1985 classic, The Breakfast Club. Like his previous feature Sixteen Candles, Hughes attempts to explore the teenage mind. Just like that film, this film is a relatable teenage character study. Each of the main characters are vastly different in terms of image and personality, but they eventually share a common interest; a seething anger for adults, mainly their Principal Vernon. The film is a little on the talky, philosophical side but John Hughes made every word count with his screenplay and style of direction. Hughes made each one of the characters relatable for the people who have been through high school, even downright likable at times.Believe it or not, Universal was highly skeptical of the film. When shooting began, Sixteen Candles was not released yet, so the studio was still dealing with an unproven director. Hughes was able to calm the film's investors. After all, his feature had a very small budget of a million dollars, and it was shot in one location. Hughes, being the efficient director he is, was able to concurrently shoot this film and his next one, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Universal definitely made a bang for their buck. I think the film made forty times its budget domestically. Profitable it was! That definitely proves how the younger generation related to its teenage characters. Maybe the adult characters are one-dimensional, but does that really matter?The film's beginning is awesome. As the great 80's anthem from Simple Minds, 'Don't Forget About Me,' is playing, the teenagers are introduced one at a time. Each of the teenagers are in for a special treat: an eight-hour-long Saturday detention under the supervision of their mean principal, Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason). The five personalities are the jock Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the brain Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the criminal John (Judd Nelson), the princess and prom queen Claire (Molly Ringwald), and the insecure basket case Allison (Ally Sheedy). These five have nothing in common and do not associate with each other outside of class. Vernon makes each teen write an essay about what do they think of themselves. In the beginning, they may have thought they knew. As the day progresses, maybe they will learn more about themselves...and each other.The performances are all excellent. They deliver Hughes's dialogue in their own unique way. Judd Nelson was the least known cast member, but he was the glue that anchored the characters together. He was fantastic as John Bender. With Sixteen Candles in production, Hughes wanted Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall to appear in this film and they obviously agreed. Their characters here are a bit reminiscent of their characters from the aforementioned film, but Hughes did make subtle differences to give their new characters fresh air. Ally Sheedy as Allison is my favorite character though as she is the most relatable. She hid herself behind her hair and clothes...in a way not unlike myself. The adult characters are one-dimensional, but the actual performances are great. Richard Vernon is not shown in a positive light and Paul Gleason embraced that. John Kapelos plays the school custodian and philosophical dude.This film is heralded as one of the best teenage films of the 1980's and the reason is the relatable characters that John Hughes created, and the actors brought to life. Yeah there is a bunch of talk and philosophy, but its very important to hear what is said. These are five different personas and backgrounds that are brought together. Although there was not a sniff of curiosity in the beginning, they started to grow closer and closer. A universal theme that is very important, especially in today's world. Hughes did a wonderful job bring that theme to the screen. This is a well-acted and well-directed movie. The majority of the soundtrack may be forgettable, but not the Simple Minds theme song. Don't forget about this movie, folks!My Grade: A-",9,0,0,29 May 2020
The Birds," Iconic....and Scary!
","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is another strong film in a filmography that is nothing but strong films. This 1963 horror thriller is Hitchcock's second horror film after the chilling 1960's Psycho. This movie is the weaker of the two, but that is nothing to scoff at. This film's imagery of the birds swooping down and attacking the folks of Bodega Bay is iconic. Hitchcock enjoyed bird-watching as a child and he was fascinated what would happen if birds were to turn evil. I do not believe that Hitchcock added any messages or allegories in the film, but some people suggest the attacking birds are actually Greek Furies attacking those people who dwell in evil. The movie may not be as good as other Hitchcock movies like Rear Window, but the movie has this eerie tone that works, the acting is solid thanks to newcomer Tippi Hedren's soaring performance, and the visual effects are especially great. I could do with less of the oddly tedious love story and the change of tone (screwball comedy to suspense/horror) jarred me just a tad bit. The movie starts in the city of San Francisco where criminal lawyer Mitch Brennan (Rod Taylor) means the attractive socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) at a pet shop. He plays a prank on her trying to have her act as a store clerk to purchase lovebirds, despite him knowing exactly who she is. She decides to return the favor by traveling to Bodega Bay, his hometown after she purchased the lovebirds. He lives with his overbearing mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his school-age sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). He also remains close to his ex-lover, the schoolteacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). When she arrives, she is attacked by a seagull. Also, on the day of her arrival, the citizens of Bodega Bay are also attacked by these birds. The performances in the film are great. Tippi Hedren does very well in her debut on screen and she fits the model of a Hitchcock woman-an icy blonde. I would even go as far to say that she has a likeness towards Grace Kelly. Rod Taylor is the central male figure of the story, and he feeds off the women in his life. I always loved Jessica Tandy as an actress because she plays the strict, overbearing type of woman so well. It is pleasing to see that women are important in the film here as they all have major roles. They may come across as unlikable at times, but that is the point of these characters. The one thing that distracted me from the movie was the love story between Mitch and Melanie. It had some good moments, but some parts were too cheesy. For instance, Lyndia does not like any of his female companions because she feels as if they will love him more than the love she brings him as a mother. That is quite....odd. Also, I was very curious about the relationship between the ex-lover, Annie and Melanie. Annie does not seem to mind Melanie pursuing the man she used to love. Interesting!The build up to the birds attacking was well-made. I understand the reasoning behind the shift of the film's tone, but I felt it to be jarring. In the long run, it does work. The birds attacking the town is not only iconic, but legitimately scary. The birds going around killing people had me thinking strangely about birds for weeks after viewing the movie. Who would think a grown man would be so afraid of a pigeon? Kudos to the visual effects team making these birds so realistic. Not only the visual imagery works on a high level, but so does the unique sound. Hitchcock decided to forgo the traditional score in order to focus more on sound effects. Basically, the sounds birds make is the score. That added to the consistent eerie feel of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a must-watch, especially if you like horror films. It may not rank as the auteur's best, but it might be one of his most iconic films. Hitchcock left the door open to viewers about what these birds may mean as there is plenty of speculation out there. I just believe these birds are just the subjects of a horror film and the director did a fine job turning these innocent works of nature into fearsome creatures of prey. After watching the movie, you may not look at birds in the same way again. My Grade: A-",9,1,1,16 October 2018
All the President's Men," The Watergate Scandal Re-telling
","Let me tell you readers something about newspaper movies. They are generally about the excitement of the events that is occurring, but seldom do these kind of movies allow the audience to know that the majority of retrieving information is dull and tedious. In 1976's All the President's Men, that is exactly what it's all about. This is a newspaper movie that takes you through the finer points of the newspaper business accurately as possible with very little action and mostly dialogue. I see that as a good thingand a bad thing. See, there are some movies that should be accurate as possible and this is one of them. This movie is about how the Washington Post uncovered the Watergate Scandal and accuracy is about the best you'll see in any film. But does that sacrifice the entertainment value of the movie? It depends on the moviegoer you are. If you like movie with lots of exposition, then you'll have no problem. I think it also depends on your historical knowledge of the film and the more you know, the more interesting it can be. That being said, the movie has a reputation of being one of 1976's finest films. I may not think so, although I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The story lends some historical value and it can grow tense at times. This film needs strong acting and it received excellent performances from everyone down to the last man. We can also credit the director for the relative success of the movie. William Goldman's screenplay is all dialogue, and director Alan J. Pakula was able to take those words and bring them on screen while keeping the movie's tempo at a fast pace and getting performances out of all his actors.So to understand this movie means you need to understand what led up to the infamous Watergate Scandal. That is essentially the plot of the movie. Heading up to the 1972 presidential elections, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford)-a reporter for the Washington Post, uncovers what seems to be a minor break-in at the Democratic Party National Headquarters. He grows suspicious when he sees that top defense lawyers are on the case already. The editor of the Post, Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) wants to run the story and he assigns Woodward and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) to do so. As they uncover more information, they see how high up the Republican Party is involved in this cover up.Another reason why this movie worked is because of the charm and pedigree of the cast. The movie is given an unusually stacked cast given the time period of the film. What I really liked about this cast is how they become so immersed in their roles. I wasn't watching Robert Redford or Dustin Hoffman, but instead I was watching Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They truly became reporters on screen, and that is the mark of a good actor. To become the person the actors are playing. Redford and Hoffman were outstanding and they show great chemistry with each other. Let's not forget about the smaller characters though. Jason Robards did an excellent job as the executive editor Ben Bradlee who always shown support in his reporters even if things went south. Martin Balsam does a solid job as the managing editor, Howard Simons. Then we have Jane Alexander as the woman who provided the men with their best leads. Last but not least, we have the great Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, the mysterious source of the men. Everyone was able to take the words from William Goldman's screenplay and make it their own words, which it's very hard to do in the movies.On the whole, All The President's Men is a fine movie. Although I feel this could have been an instant classic that could have been destined for greatness. In some eyes, it is. Given its long length, this film could have been overly dull and tedious, but the cast, Pakula's incredible direction, and a really interesting story were able to make this a taut, entertaining thriller. We get to learn about the journalistic process given that its repeated in several cycles, which can grow tiresome at some point. I liked this movie enough to give this movie a recommend, especially if you're interested in seeing how the Watergate Scandal came to be with the utmost historical accuracy. Also this movie is just a good vehicle for the starpower of Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.My Grade: B",8,2,2,18 October 2017
The Wizard of Oz," An Unforgettable Classic!
","The Wizard of Oz, is no doubt, a cinematic class that breathes new life with each generation. Despite the film being released 76 years ago, it is still one of those rare gems that clicks with today's audience. Sure it has a rather simple story, but it's a resonant film that features groundbreaking visuals (that famous twister scene, anyone?), themes that can relate to anyone (courage, having a heart, etc), famous music that became a part of pop culture lore, and just a simple fantasy story that is fun to watch and is suitable for all ages. The story itself has the feel of a 1939 movie, but those visuals are still mightily impressive. The twister scene is just amazing, and it still fathoms me to see how they created all the flying objects seem realistic. The production design is amazing as well, as we get a very colorful film. Keep in mind that during this era, most films were black and white. The yellow brick road is a delight to look at, especially occupied by the central characters. The story is simple enough to follow, and it's one for all ages. Dorothy is whisked away from her Kansas farmland by a tornado, and it transports her to the magical land of Oz. Dorothy desperately wants to go home, but she is tasked with finding the wizard of Oz in Emerald City. She must follow the yellow brick road, where she finds allies in a talking scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion. But she also must avoid the Wicked Witch of the West if she wants to get home safely. The film is full of pure, magical performances. Judy Garland, a well- known name in 1939, was transported to stardom after the success of this movie. Her acting method is different by today's standard, but she effectively carries the movie as the kind-hearted Dorothy. Margaret Hamilton's performance was very scary, and rumor has it that much of her performance was edited due to it being scary. I imagine what her performance could have been if there was no editing. I also liked Ray Bolger, as the scarecrow trying to find a brain, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion looking for courage, and Jack Haley as the tin man looking for a heart. Everyone delivers praise-worthy performances here. While not an instant box-office success when first released, the Wizard of Oz delivers magic, wisdom, and just a great movie to the audience all around the world. From the magical tunes of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow,' to the interplay between Miss Gulch and Dorothy, to the experience with the Wizard of Oz, we have ourselves an unforgettable classic, which began with the writings of L. Frank Baum. I have seen this film many times, and it is still a fantastic delight to watch. Once I'm transported to Oz, 'I'm no place like home,' as Dorothy so kindly tells Toto, her dog. Once again, a classic movie for all ages. My Grade: A",9,6,7,3 August 2015
From Here to Eternity," An Acting Tour-De-Force!
","Before watching From Here to Eternity, I thought I was getting an action film set in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. Instead, I got a romance drama with the aforementioned event in the backdrop. Despite that 'disappointment,' Fred Zinnemann's wartime epic is a well-acted film which also has one of the most famous love scenes of all time. Maybe the script does not hold up very well and the dialogue is quite cringy, but this is still one picture worth watching. It was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won eight of them including Best Picture.This film is based off a controversial novel written by James Jones. Jones's novel was very provocative, especially for the time period it was published. In order for Daniel Taradash's script to be approved by the censors and the Army, it had to undergo some major changes. For example, the book has venereal diseases as an issue for bad marriage. You might recall the scenes between Maggio and Fatso, who was in charge of the jail? The book portrayed extreme violence between the two, violence that was only mentioned in passing during the film. When it comes to film history, the changes made is why this film is well-known. It is a little surprising how effective the movie was considering the changes that were deemed necessary to make. Still, the Army and the Navy banned this movie from being shown to their soldiers. They hated the Army's depiction in the book...and the movie. They originally did have the Army's support since training material, the ability to film at Schofield Base, and the use of Pearl Harbor stock footage was needed.Fred Zinnemann (A Man for All Seasons) was in the director's chair. He decided to cast actors that were against type, a very risky decision considering when the film was made. It worked out very well because his five main actors went on to be nominated and even win the big awards. Zinnemann himself worked very well with his actors.It is 1941, and the world is at war, with the exception of the United States. Although Japan has other things on their mind. Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) has been transferred to Schofield Air Base in Hawaii. Captain Holmes (Philip Ober) requested Prewitt because of his exceptional track record in boxing and could use his talent in the boxing tournament. Prewitt declines, and that allows Holmes to make Prewitt's life miserable. Holmes's second-in-command, Sgt. Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) wants to be transferred away from his outfit but falls in love with Holmes's wife, Karen (Deborah Kerr). Prewitt's friend, Maggio (Frank Sinatra) has troubles with the stockade sergeant, Fatso (Ernest Borgnine). Prewitt also falls in love with one of the local girls, Lorene (Donna Reed) who works at a social club. Little do they know that their problems are minor compared to what is about to happen.The reason to watch this is because of the acting display given to us. Every actor did an absolutely fantastic job. The standout is Frank Sinatra as the violent, drunk friend of Prewitt's, Maggio. Unlike the book, his character is given depth. This role also rescued Sinatra's career. Rumors were abound that he only received this role because of his alleged ties with the mafia. Montgomery Clift is known for playing sensitive characters, so is his role here a surprise? Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr radiated intensive chemistry with each other. Zinnemann did not even want Kerr, but eventually was won over. Like most of the actors, she was casted against type and knocked it out of the park. Donna Reed won an Academy Award for her performance as Lorene, and she deserved it. Borgnine and Jack Warden have smaller roles, but they are good. In short, this movie is an acting tour-de-force. And yes, Lancaster was amazing as usual.I did not get the war film I was expecting, as I quickly discovered that From Here to Eternity is a melodrama, perhaps a bit outdated. Any thing that happens with Pearl Harbor is towards the very end. Before that, the actors interact and socialize with each other and that makes good viewing. I knew about the romantic scene with Lancaster and Kerr on the beach and it did not disappoint. If you want to hear a lovely blues song, there is a good one to listen to here. Not the best screenplay (in modern terms), but everything makes up for it especially those performances.My Grade: B+",8,0,0,17 May 2020
The Godfather," 'I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse'
","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film 'a long, boring piece of crap.' Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, 'never take sides against the family.' That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-",9,4,4,18 October 2017
