Blade Runner 2049," A pale shadow of the original. Slow, brooding, and not a filling meal.
","This film is slow as dripping molasses. Very little suspense. Most of the film is spent developing the Gosling character. He is great as usual. The problem is he just did not have that much to work with. Most of the stunning visuals from the first one, are missing. Even Altered Carbon is more fun to look at. It just looks like a very heavily polluted version of Beijing, with a bit of LA thrown in. It appears that little money was spent on the sets, costumes, or decor. When you consider how dazzling the original was, one has to wonder why so little effort to replicate at least some of that magic?K's in love with Joi (Ana de Armas), an adoring hologram who places a simulation of a steak on top of K's real dinner-a plate of drab microwave noodles-while Frank Sinatra croons on the speakers in the background. It's painfully clear that K wants to be an American man, though this cozy image of tranquility is as illusory for him as it is for the people who feel the American dream has left them behind. K isn't human (or is he?), isn't living with someone, and his anonymous apartment is locked off from a neighborhood engulfed in poverty. Everything in this world is impersonal and corporately manufactured. Where Deckard used to buy noodles from a vendor, K gets meals on the run from a vending machine. Human jobs are rendered obsolete whenever possible, further detaching us from a centralized society and ironically sending us scurrying to our phones and computers for refuge.The premise of this film is not enough. And Harrison Ford is absolutely wasted in this film. Not even sure why he was included, nor what the scenes with him were meant to represent. He is inept, incapable, old, tired, and just not up to the task at hand, which is hugely disappointing. And the ending. What a terrible ending. For a director as talented as Villaneuve, this is a surprising result. I watched this film again last night, as I was very unimpressed the first time around. Figured I might pick up on some subtext, some subtle hints, some secondary plots. Nothing there. This film is as empty as the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia. Not much there. I say this as a major sci-fi buff. Not much there.",4,3,6,25 July 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Lacks anything a good film contains. An empty cinematic vessel.
","This absolute turkey was right on time for Thanksgiving. Do not go to see this, unless you are under 15, or an absolute die hard fan of the franchise. She plays the weakest superhero since Tobey Mcguire in Spiderman. This film is painful to sit through. Very, very little story. Although in general I like Jennifer Lawrence, in this film she really missed the mark. She displays little in the way of power, dignity, grace, or inspiration. It is very poorly written, the characters are becoming very tired, and the entire enterprise lacked inspiration. I could not more heartily encourage you to avoid seeing this turkey. It was very hard to sit through.",1,29,45,27 November 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Trite, mind numbingly boring, and hard to sit through
","I have to start by admitting, I am not a star wars fan. I have only seen a few of them. Also, I have to admit I am not a comic book fan either. So, that makes it hard to sit through a movie like this. There were some decent characters. And some of the creatures or aliens were kind of cool. But, somehow with a film like this, you expect that. And more. It just did not deliver. It was boring, trite, ineffective, and somehow very, very unexciting. Let's break it down: dull, repetitive, unsurprising, under-characterized. This tale, placed chronologically between episodes three and four, has no reason to exist. We know the rebels will get plans that let them destroy the Death Star. So, who cares how they did it, when the storytelling is so uninteresting and pathetically boring.The series cannibalizes its own mythology. A child with incipient Jedi powers (Felicity Jones) loses her parents and gets raised by a surrogate the Empire brands for death. She teams up with a freewheeling fighter pilot (Diego Luna) and a comical droid with an English voice (Alan Tudyk) to go against the Empire; she's advised by an older Jedi with amazing gifts (Donnie Yen); she learns her father (Mads Mikkelsen) is highly placed in the Empire himself. The main twist is that he built the Death Star against his will and installed a flaw that will blow it up, if his daughter finds the designs after his death. So, I guess he is not so bad after all. Redemption. Oh my. It's as if the whole cast had been culled from understudies. Jones, so good in dramatic roles, looks like a last-minute substitute for Daisy Ridley. Luna's a lightweight Oscar Isaac. Mikkelsen scarcely works up a passion, yet he is such a terrific actor, in films like the Salvation, The legend of Michael Koolhaus, and many others. Yen, star of the 'Iron Monkey' and 'Ip Man' series, pulls off deft martial arts moves but lacks Alec Guinness' charisma. The main villain (Ben Mendelsohn) remains whiny and ineffectual, and other than the diabolical acts he commits, he just does not have much oomph. And as far as Darth Vader goes, he just need to be retired, once and for all. How long can the darkness last?",2,19,38,21 December 2016
Us," Peele has lost the plot
","It seems like the same sort of degradation that happened to the doppelgängers populating this movie, might have happened to Jordan Peele. How you can go from a movie as good as Get Out, to this utter piece of slime ball garbage is utterly beyond my comprehension. My guess is that he had the budget to work with, and like David Lynch, did not exercise much in the way of discipline, and man oh man did this thing spin out of control!I will qualify this by saying I enjoy horror films, zombie films, vampire films, etc. But this? What was this? Can anyone even define it?PLEASE, do not waste your time. After about 40 minutes, I sped through the rest of it, and thankfully watched the balance of the film in about 6 minutes. I am so grateful I now have that extra hour of my life.",2,3,5,9 September 2019
The Irishman," A lead bellied, slow moving turkey
","The cast was great. The direction was good. The story was great. The production was amazing. So, why did this movie leave me cold and why have I forgotten it after just two days?It was ridiculously indulgent on the part of Scorcese. There were at least five or six scenes that were way too long. It was 210 minutes long and that was how long it felt. I think it would have had alot more impact had it been 150 minutes long. I kind of lost interest.",5,11,33,16 November 2019
Spotlight," Extraordinary filmmaking, great pacing, amazing performances.
","I was astonished by this film. It is so rare that I see a film that is so competently directed. The entire production was outstanding. Great writing, for adults. How refreshing is that. I admit, I made the huge mistake of seeing The Divergent: Allegiant, the day before, which was horrendously bad. So, I was so relieved to view a good film with an adult plot. It is an important story, and the film captures the suspense and the sense that these guys were onto something big. Michael Keaton is just getting better. This is perhaps the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, in some time. And he is a great actor. Rachel McAdams, and Live Schreiber were also great. As well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, and Billy Crudup. The exteriors in Boston were authentic, as well as the interiors at the newspaper. It reminded me of the days when newspapers were an important part of daily life. And that was not long ago. I highly recommend this film, as long as you are not a big fan of Transformers, and Fast 7. Wow. This is a relatively rare occasion Hollywood gets it right. Nice to see they are still interested in, and capable of making films for adults.",9,2,3,12 March 2016
Deadpool 2," Another comic book leap of faith
","Granted, the theme of Deadpool requires a leap of faith. And the humor requires a fourth wall kind of suspension of sensibility. But this was way too over the top. There was something fresh about the original and very stale about this one. If you feel like an amusement park ride, go for it. I could not sit through it. It was inane.",3,0,4,3 March 2020
Youth," A film of astonishing grace, beauty, elegance, wit, and charm.
","I do not think it is possible I could have liked this film any more than I did. I was watching it for the second time. The first time I loved it. But, I did not understand what a masterpiece it was. It is absolutely pitch perfect. The direction of the film is stunning. Hollywood should take notice. Few films come out of Hollywood like this lovely gem. This was entirely directed and produced by Italians. It has a magical realist quality to it, and some of the cinematography was positively mind boggling. If you look at some of my other reviews, I am often tearing films apart. Most of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days leave me cold and unsatisfied. However, this film was written and shot for adults. I do not think the current crop of kids, that is fueling the boom in nonsensical action films, and comic reboots would get this film at all. Way, way too refined. Too much character development. Not enough action for the kiddies.There are some great scenes of the writers on Kietel's film, where they are brainstorming the script of the film they are writing. It is a wonderful irony, as the script of this film is a thing of beauty. This film centers around the characters of Michael Caine, and Harvey Kietel. Both very successful men. Caine a retired composer, and Kietel a movie director, nearing the end of his career. Wryly observing them closely, and striking up a friendship with Fred, is a movie star played by Paul Dano. The younger man is debating whether to escape his burdensome identification with a robot character in a sci-fi franchise with a drastic change of pace by playing Adolf Hitler in a movie. There is a wonderful scene where Miss Universe shows up and pays her respect to the Dano character. The dialogue is not at all what one would expect. Then Fred gets a visit from his disaffected daughter and personal assistant (Rachel Weisz). She's here to announce that her husband, Mick's feckless son (Ed Stoppard), has just dumped her for real-life rock star Paloma Faith, playing a parody of herself that stars like Mylie Cyrus, Brittany Spears, and many others would never be capable of. As in Sorrentino's 2013 foreign-language Oscar winner 'The Great Beauty,' the plot is less important than the characters and the opulent settings, which are populated with eccentric, magical characters in the background. This is a movie for adults. And this movie is a masterpiece. A simply stunning bit of filmmaking. Watch it with patience. Watch it with adoration. Watch it with respect. Watch it and yearn for the days when films of this caliber were more common.",10,3,6,11 January 2017
Begin Again," Really a pleasant surprise - delightfully not full of cheese!
","I was expecting a cheesy film. I am not into musicals so was hesitant to commit to this film, in a theatre. But, I was pleasantly surprised. I find some of Ruffalos work, like Now you see me, to be hard to sit through. I did not dislike that film, but I hated his performance. Part of it was how vapid the character was. In this film it is the opposite. He is charming, roguish, creative, and delightful to watch. Quite frankly I did not think Knightly was up to this either. Was I ever surprised. She was great. Well written, well directed, and very good overall. In these days of Hollywood losing its edge, and producing more and more low quality, derivative work, it is refreshing to see a film like this one. And I did not even need to use my earplugs. Transformer this film was not. Thankfully.",9,70,94,11 July 2014
Doctor Strange," I am so tired of this genre. If you like cartoons, you will like this movie.
","I went into this movie, knowing I do not usually care for movies, based on cartoon characters. Sorry, but my intelligence demands at least a mild level of plausibility, and though I am willing to take substantial leaps of faith, this one required leaps of mind boggling degrees. Let me start with my chief complaint. After this misanthrope gets into his accident, and decides to go to extreme lengths to recover his lost powers of surgery, he travels to a monastery in a mysterious kingdom, which even a 12 year old will realize is Kathmandu. He then hooks up with the 'ancient one', with a minimum of effort. And the straw that really broke this camels back, is that seemingly within days, or perhaps a couple of weeks, he is a 6th degree aikido sensei master, with the ability to bend time and space, and control energy. I suppose in the comic book, he had all of that innate ability, and it was simply dormant, and waiting to be released. But, in the movie, it came across as just another attempt by Hollywood, to make us believe something extraordinary, without giving us the background, nor the character development required to allow us to believe it in a natural fashion. My friends, who really liked this film, talk about the Inception type special effects. Frankly, I did not see the charm in those effects, though they were cool looking. A planet bends, building get turned upside down, but there are no casualties whatsoever? People just continue working as usual, while their building is on it's side, or upside down? Maybe a lot of 12 year olds do not break things down like that. But, there were some adults at the movies too. A continuation in the abuse cycle that Tinseltown continues to inflict on it's adult audiences.Am I the only one who walked away from this mess of a movie wondering what I had just saw? How it has gotten such high marks can only be because of the charisma of Cumberbatch. There really is no other reason. The plot made no sense and was completely illogical. Thankfully, the seats were comfortable. Perhaps I didn't like it because I'm a reasonable man, and I realized what a good movie it could have been. A couple of laughs, a couple of gee whiz special effects, but nothing else. I walked out with about 30-40 minutes left in the film. I just could not subject myself to one more mind numbing fight scene. In conclusion, if you are a real comic book fan, who enjoys seeing comic book movies, and are able to completely suspend your intellect and sense of reason for two hours, this film is for you.",2,10,21,29 November 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Stunning. Wonderful. A very well written satire on the industry
","I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. Sanberg nailed it. It was very well written, and the performances were great. The number of cameos by major stars was astonishing. It felt like a total parody on inane, goofball stars like Justin Bieber, or Brittany Spears. For a while it seemed like he was channeling Bieber, one of the most ridiculous stars of our generation. The movie's view of the pop universe is so comprehensive. In the hands of creators with less intimate knowledge of the music industry, Popstar would have been a Bieber-inspired spin on the emperor's new clothes, and indeed it seems like no coincidence that at one point Conner is literally disrobed in front of all his fans. But the message of Popstar isn't that pop stars are self- absorbed, out of touch, and lacking talent, it's that pop stars are self-absorbed, out of touch, and some are actually very talented. (Popstar reprises one of the more memorable images from Never Say Never when it shows Conner performing a drum solo as a baby.) When things go off the rails, it's when pop stars lack equally talented collaborators who will help them check themselves lest they wreck themselves. (It's not that the emperor has no clothes; it's that sometimes he needs someone to tell him that gold-encrusted onesie is a bad idea.)This was a very, very entertaining movie. Kudos to the filmmakers, and the crew. Well done. Very well done.",9,0,2,22 December 2016
Baby Driver," A horrific wish mash, with tedious lip syncing to Lionel Richie!
","I do not even know where to start, to describe this so called entertainment. I admit, I am not into musicals. My guess, is that the filmmakers were trying to capture some of the magic of La La Land, a film I loved despite the fact that it was a musical, because it was such a damn good film. This turkey on the other hand, had a lead actor, who was kind of an idiot savant, wounded twerp, muted sort of guy. Who, all of a sudden came to life, when in the presence of a cute waitress working in a diner. Wait a minute. He was holding in all of that charm, just waiting for the right waitress to light up his heart? Pure, unadulterated silliness and nonsense. On their first encounter, at a laundromat, where all of the clothes in the machines were color coordinated, they display the kind of chemistry only Romeo and Juliet enjoyed.This guy drives in a way that would shame Lewis Hamilton. His skills behind the wheel are nothing short of Houdini, combined with Michael Schumacher, and Sebastian Vettel, with a little bit of Valentino Rossi thrown in for good measure. The first sequence is quite impressive, though ridiculously over the top. But then that's it. Baby Driver still has another hour and 40 minutes to go, and it never reaches that level of breezy magnificence again. Not even close. Not visually, and not thematically, either: the insouciance of laid-back criminals gives way to tedious angst and handwringing. I can't recall ever before seeing a movie that gave up this early: usually they wait till the last act to pop out on us, to run out of ideas and steam. Perhaps the only truly original thing about Baby Driver is its astonishing pivot from gripping opener to rote plot full of totally unsurprising clichés: Baby doesn't really want to live a life of crime, but boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) is blackmailing him. Baby is so tormented, so haunted by the memory of his dead mother. Get over it. Of course it was traumatic. But, you were a kid. And now supposedly you are a man. Act like one. Please.The worst scenes are the ones where he is dancing and grooving to the music he is listening to on his vast selection of iPods, including one with pink glitter, that Richard Simmons or Freddie Mercury, would not be caught dead using. In one scene, he is a junkyard, dancing and lip syncing to a Lionel Richie song! Unbelievable. Kind of a rehash of Flashdance, without the gorgeous lead actress. Who on earth does that? Does anyone even remember Lionel? And if they do, do they have his music on his iPod? This film tries so hard to be hip, and it fails miserable. The lead is not hip, his moves are not hip, and they portray him as this savant, who hears the sounds of the universe all around him, in the forms of singing and silly songs. Inane. Dumb. Unconvincing. Contrived. Nonsensical. I walked out after an hour. I just could not take any more abuse. If you are under 13 you might enjoy this film. It does have sort of a teeny bopper quality to it.Kevin Spacey was a caricature. A totally comic book character. His lines were stupid. This is a really bad film. I just do not get all of the good reviews. I think audiences are getting a lot more tolerant of nonsense.",2,6,13,22 September 2017
Control," A powerful study of a disturbed, creative genius. Really worth watching.
","This was a truly outstanding film. Granted I am a huge fan of this genre, period, and feel that some the music that came out of the UK in the 1970's and 1980's was hugely influential, important, and absolutely timeless. Of course, there is no arguing the influence Joy Division had, and their subsequent follow up act, New Order. Curtis was able to evoke such emotion, such power, more than likely due to his state of mind, and the chaotic emotional state he had to endure.Shot in gorgeous, classic black and white, the Ian Curtis biopic doesn't seem to care if you like Joy Division, the influential post-punk band Curtis fronted. It simply presents a taut, emotionally wrenching narrative. And I never really got the post punk genre title. Is that the best they could do? How about pre-electronica? Or crazy inventive. Or mind numbingly stupendous? Joy Division released only two proper albums in its short history, but the group disproportionately influenced the music that followed. Fans will enjoy the re-creations of seminal shows and recording sessions, staged with authority by director Anton Corbijn, who photographed the band and its peers in the '70s and '80s.But even non-fans will appreciate the cinematography and note-perfect performances, which seem to evoke a certain dread of 1970s working-class England. We see young Curtis, played with appropriate understatement by Sam Riley, worshiping David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed in his bedroom in Macclesfield, England, in 1973. He tries on makeup, smokes endless cigarettes and carefully organizes his darkly poetic writing into binders. Who knew what an extraordinary songwriter he was to become?Riley's performance immediately sets the tone, his giant, uncertain eyes rejecting our sympathy and attempts to reduce him to an archetype. He marries his high school crush, Deborah (Samantha Morton), at age 19 as his band (first called Warsaw) slowly ascends.Curtis' inner life, rendered through rich, stifling close-ups, is wracked with guilt and self-doubt, whether it's for cheating on his wife with the beautiful French gal Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara) or dealing with his worsening epilepsy and obsession with mortality. He is obviously in a lot more pain that we know, and does a reasonably good job of showing it.The film is a quiet study. It is ponderous at times. But, in the end, it is a strong, self assured film, that really hits the mark.",9,1,1,31 August 2017
The Favourite," A good movie, blessed by amazing performances
","This was not an exceptional movie. The soundtrack was beyond annoying. Johnnie Burn totally missed the mark. It was not innovative. It just fell flat. That nasty ticking sound, was supposed to establish some suspense. It was a $10 sample. That was it. Nothing more. And beyond annoying. The performances are what saved this otherwise average movie. The script was good. The lead performance by Olivia Colman was great. The two supporting roles were very good. But, we have seen this character from Rachel Weisz before. This movie won 144 awards? Was I watching the same film? I would say this movie was rather a bit disappointing. Was Queen Anne really that pathetic a character? Wow.",6,0,0,7 March 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A lovely feel good adventure. Stiller nails it yet again.
","This movie was quite magical. It had moments that rival the best of them. And to think Stiller directed it? What can't he do? It was what I would describe as magical realism, but without the nonsense. There were a few scenes that were a little far out there, but the leap of faith required was not beyond the pale, which is a lot more than I can say about most Hollywood films, that have any level of action, these days. It was a very creative endeavor, and I give Stiller a lot of credit for it. The cinematography was wonderful. The locations were amazing. The spirit of adventure was admirable. The characters were believable. Some great spoofs, especially the boneheads with the beards. And Kristen Wiig was believable, sincere, funny, and charming. In all, the cast was great.Considering that the last film Stiller directed was Tropic Thunder, which was hilarious, this guy has some real talent behind the lens too.Many are knocking this film, as being too positive, too optimistic, too lighthearted, or too insubstantial. I just do not get all that. It is a feel good film. I suppose, in this day and age, for some that is just too much to deal with. For some of us, it is just really good entertainment. Have we really degenerated to the level where that is not OK anymore?",9,6,10,8 September 2016
1917," An epic film. A stunning work
","This film surpassed my expectations and they were high! The direction, sound, costumes, sets and pacing were spot on. The cinematography was astonishing. Great writing too. This film was on par with Saving Private Ryan. Not as much character development. But not required for the telling of this story. A simply spectacular film.",9,0,0,19 February 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," See this film only if you are a comic book freak, or under 13
","The productions values were good. The acting was good enough. The film got off to a promising start. I had quite a few laughs, as it is quite funny. But, it just wore me down. After about 45 minutes I did not care about these cardboard cutout characters, with no emotional depth, background, or substance. I admit, I am not a comic book enthusiast, and therein lies the problem. Movies like this one are hard for discerning adults to sit through. The writing was pretty mediocre, at best. Comical at worst. I wanted so badly to walk out, but I went with a friend who wanted to stay, and he regretted that move also. So, see it if you love comic book characters. If you don't, avoid this bloated behemoth.",3,15,42,12 August 2014
Mudbound," An outstanding depiction of white fear, racism, and hatred. And black dignity.
","This is not an easy film to sit through. The characters who portray the most ignorant among men, are very well played, especially by the venerable Jonathan Banks, who plays a man of such ignorance, it boggles the mind. He is the kind of father it is impossible to love. The uneasy contradictions of the time period cut through skin and hit bone. During Jim Crow, a black man could go to war, liberating nations from Nazis in the name of the American ideal, and return home in uniform to find his flag-waving countrymen now shoving him out the back door of the general store. This happens in Mudbound, with the defiant yet vulnerable Jason Mitchell at its center as the WWII veteran Ronsel Jackson, and the stark hypocrisy depicted in the scene hits you in your gut. It foreshadows actual violence in the story, the kind that recalls Ronsel's real-life parallel Isaac Woodard, and that still reverberates today through Charlottesville and as far as the White House, where a man of such profound ignorance now leads the nation. Mudbound makes its point by taking its time. You have to be patient with it. There's no drama in Mudbound. This is no 12 Years A Slave or Django Unchained. This is a quiet depiction of family life, about daily endurance and survival. And it is powerful in its mundanity. During the film's first hour, we observe strands of love and hatred thicken between the two families. Across their shared land grows a bond between the two mothers, Laura and Florence, played by Mulligan and Blige; a friendship between two sons home from the Second World War, Ronsel and Jamie, played by Mitchell and Hedlund; and a hatred for Ronsel boiling in the cruel heart of Jamie's father, Pappy (played by a formidable Banks), the senseless white supremacist who ultimately finds no logic beneath his bigotry.The action, what there is of it, revolves around the elements: the sun, rain and flies, which are so oppressive they become characters in themselves. As does the mud. The families work on it every day. The mud is their livelihood. They are mudbound. The heavy sludge of the earth weighs upon the narrative and eventually becomes symbolic. The mud is suffocating, just like family; just like love; just like hate; just like racism. The mud, and Pappy's hate, bookends the film, which begins with Pappy digging a grave, and ends with workers lowering Pappy into his own grave. Into the mud.",9,1,4,28 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Unbelievably juvenile. Ridiculous story.
","Not even sure what to say about this one. Kong was 950 feet tall. And sweet. So sweet. Unless you threatened him or made him angry. Which they managed to do. I think pretty much anything that Samuel Jackson is in these days, must be avoided like the Bird flu. He is a compromised actor of extreme proportions, and will literally do anything for a buck. He is so tired. His routine is so old. Here he plays an army officer, who of course has no respect for nature, animals, or the earth. Hence the environmental statement. It is a statement that feels like it was written by a 5 year old. Hollywood being the nearly culturally bankrupt institution it is, seems to be incapable of a balance, nuanced, elegant statement of any sort. So, they keep producing this kind on inane garbage.Why did 14 helicopter pilots, when faced with a 950 foot tall Kong, who has a wing span the size of several football fields, fly within swat range of this beast? Was it not possible they could have done any better than that? Does Hollywood really need to continue to insult us at every possible opportunity? The only redeeming quality this movie had was John C. Reilly. His comic touch was all that kept me from walking out on this turkey. Hollywood, you can do better than this. You need to stop catering to Chinese teenagers. This movie was terrible.",2,546,911,17 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A truly horrific piece of film making
","This absolute turkey of a film, was barely entertaining. I wanted to walk out several times, and only the presence of a few tolerant, long suffering, and bored friends kept me from doing so.The entire cast was wrong. Branagh was an insufferable detective. Dench was a dreadful princess. Cruz was entirely miscast, as some sort of anti fascist. Johnny Depp was barely there, though he did remind me a bit of a kind of impotent Dillinger. This film was truly awful.As is suggested by the title, one of the first class passengers is brutally murdered. Poirot, hoping for some rest and relaxation, is pressed into service. One of these supposedly respectable passengers is actually a murderer, etc. Thus begins a mystery that is at turns plodding, irrelevant and completely suspense-free. If you remember the famous third act twist it doesn't even really matter; by that point in the movie the narrative has become such a limp pretzel of halfhearted knots that the big revelation comes off as a whimper and not a bang. This is less a whodunit than a who-the-hell-cares.Branagh was more interested in the Shakespearean drama than dazzling visual effects.With 'Murder on the Orient Express,' he has created a contraption that is wholly devoid of cleverness; a thriller without any actual thrills. He seems chiefly concerned with technically virtuoso camera movements that mean incredibly little both in terms of narrative or character, as well as how to showcase himself (as an actor) completely in any given scene. Seriously, Kenneth Branagh shoots Kenneth Branagh like Steven Soderbergh shot Julia Roberts in the first 'Ocean's Eleven' – lovingly, with every moment suggesting this is what a movie star looks like.Sadly, for all of his pomp and forced eccentricity (his walrus-like mustache, his Belgian accent, his protruding belly), Branagh's over sized Poirot can't enliven the movie very much. The same goes for the cast of characters, some of whom have been excellent in other, far better movies this year ('The Florida Project,' 'Victoria & Abdul,' 'mother!'). Some, like Daisy Ridley, have the look on their faces like they signed up for something that ended up being altogether different. And no matter how great you are as an actor, it's hard to stay away from the story's inherent stagings, especially in the third act, when Branagh assembles his cast like the participants of the Last Supper. It doesn't feel like a dramatic centerpiece, it feels like a promotional photo shoot. And that's a problem for a movie that should, had it succeeded, built tiny, laser-focused vignettes of suspense out of exchanges of dialogue, camera movements that tracked up and down the train and casual interactions between passengers.Instead, Branagh presents something like an attractively wrapped present with nothing inside. Ostensibly, it's a well-made movie, with first class production and costume design and some very talented visual effects artists working on very unconvincing visual effects. Even composer Patrick Doyle, one of Branagh's key collaborators, delivers a score that is, like the rest of the movie, both overbearing and tension-free.Overlong and joyless, it's the cinematic equivalent of a giant, opulent express train trapped in the snow, heaving and off balance.",2,5,10,28 November 2017
Black Panther," A kids film - barely watchable for this adult
","Without a doubt this is a culturally important film, one with an important message to tell its audience. We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact. Wakanda is, in essence, an African fantasy, one in which the continent is able to withstand white oppressors and consequentially has the power to build an empire off Vibranium, a natural resource that is more powerful than steel. And many of us enjoy seeing people of color on the big screen. After a century, Hollywood may be waking up to the fact that Black heroes are actually bankable. Surprise!Wakanda is hidden behind clouds and mountains, and a fantasy rain forest canopy. But wait a minute. It is a sci fi film with advanced aircraft. Doesn't that mean the world possesses radar, and satellites? Well, then why have the clouds and rain forest kept this place such a secret for so long? DO NOT ask questions like these, of this film. If you are the kind of individual who can suspend your reason and intellect for two hours, and just watch, you may enjoy this. Personally, I felt alot of pain while watching this film. I might put it in the category of Lone Ranger, and Wild, Wild West. It really stank, as a story. The capital is from the evils of white colonizers, but any sort of imagination is left in the back seat when it comes to this emerald city onscreen. It's a missed opportunity on the part of Coogler because, after all, this is an MCU movie set in Africa! I wanted to see the savannas and the fantastic natural sights and beauties that come with this fascinating and colorful continent, but instead, there's an over-reliance on fake digital backgrounds rather than real on-set locations. This is detrimental to bringing any kind of humane connection or absorbingly artful feeling to the film, which quite frequently feels artificial and computerized rather than lived-in and three-dimensional.To sum it up, if you like comic book films, you may like this one. I do not like comic book films, and I really, really did not like this film.",2,110,234,19 March 2018
Any Given Sunday," Not a bad film. Could have been alot more
","When you look at the cast of this film. You realize that had it been expertly directed It could have been really great. The biggest problem with the film was Stone's insistence on using frantic cinematography, and frantic editing in order to give you a sense of the intensity of the game. What it ends up doing is just giving you this rather incomprehensible mishmash. As a viewer you barely know what's going on. At any given moment, much less any given Sunday. It's a decent film considering the fact that Stone hasn't done much good work for the last two decades. It's, you know, probably up there with Alexander, an maybe Nixon in terms of decent work. It's passable entertainment, that is about as far it's about as I would go.",6,0,0,19 April 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A mediocre child's movie, at best
","What did I miss here? A brainwashed Hitler youth, realizes that Jews do not actually have horns, and becomes friendly with one. OMG. So incredibly profound. I have no issues with making a comedy about the Nazis. Just make sure to get a decent writer, who has some understanding of humanity. Not much here, i am afraid.",3,0,8,26 February 2020
Lucy," A spectacular film- visually stunning - very through provoking
","Unless you are nearly brain dead, you will find this film stimulating. If you are a sci-fi buff like me, even more so. A film like this reminds me of how starved some of us are for films of this sort. This film was brilliantly directed by the French Maestro. Beautifully acted, by Scarlotte Johansson. While the transformation is happening, we see Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) giving a lecture on the capacity of the human brain. He says people generally use only about 10 percent of their brain's capacity. (Yes, it's an urban legend, but you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more if you ignore that fact and just go with it.) Norman, an authority in this field, has no idea his path will soon cross with Lucy's.Lucy accidentally ingests the drug and her neurons begin firing. Her brain begins to grow ever-more powerful - so powerful that she's able to easily disarm any captor and figure a way out of any situation she's in. She needs someone who understands brain function to help her while a team is hot on the trail to dispense with her. The film moves at such a frantic pace and provides such mind-boggling visuals and fascinating concepts about time and existence that it's impossible not to be entertained. Besson also throws in some brief but exhilarating nature scenes to emphasize Lucy's vulnerability (at first) and then to expound upon what she is learning.Somewhat improbably, it's also an ideal culmination of a sci-fi trilogy Johansson may not have even realized she was making. In Her, Under the Skin and now Lucy, the 29-year-old veteran has not only delivered some of the finest work of her career, she's found a trio of characters in conversation about what it means to be human through the eyes of an outsider, be it artificial intelligence, alien or an accidental superhuman. In fact, it's near impossible to imagine Lucy without Johansson and her perfectly calibrated performance, a crucial component to investing in the story's inherent silliness.The action was a little over the top at times. The Chinese gangsters were perhaps a metaphor for the Chinese Politburo. Perhaps the world's ultimate criminal organization, that will stop at nothing to achieve it's ends. What you'll find here, is a well-crafted science fiction yarn that might make you think more than you bargained for while you enjoy the shoot-ups and vehicle crashes.",9,63,88,4 February 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Three good films in past two decades?
","If you really break it down Lee has done three good films in the past 20 years. 25th hour. Black KKKlansman, and Miracle at St. Anna. This one does not qualify. On any level. It's a historical mishmash, a wannabe PC Black lives matter film. Very little substance. Too much patchwork. Unbelievable flashbacks with 70 year old men as 20 year old soldiers. Fake Comraderie of guys that haven't seen each other for decades. A really, really bad soundtrack. And what seemed like very poor direction. If you're a huge Lee fan maybe, otherwise just can't recommend it.",4,3,5,19 June 2020
Warcraft," So much potential, so little satisfaction
","I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story, with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene. I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were probably the best part of the movie. But, the movie was so overwrought, so chock full of hundreds of different elements, it would have been nearly impossible for even a top director to bring all of that together. It turned out to be a wish mash, a jumble of elements. Toward the last 45 minutes it was nearly entirely incoherent. I had no idea of who the players were, and it became a tangled mess. At the beginning of the film, I thought there were enough elements, to create a satisfying story. At the end of the film, my two friends and myself all looked at each other, and felt the same way.There were several occasions during the last hour that I was compelled to walk out. The only reason I stayed, is that I am currently overseas, in a location with few theaters, and few English films available.",3,81,153,14 June 2016
