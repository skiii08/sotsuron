Alien 3," Dark and depressing
","A very well done movie, the atmosphere of which is so dark and depressing as of none of its predecessors. However, what the film lacks is the perfect continuity. The most diverse thing is the presence of an Alien egg on the ship SULLACO. At the end of ALIENS we witness the Alien Queen right on the ship, but she was there for a too short time to be capable of laying an egg /and from the Alien 3 it is clear that the eggs must have been at least two - one which attacked Ripley`s hibernator and one which attacked the dog on Fiorina 161./  In ALIENS we saw that the Queen used a special tube or pipe to lay eggs, but as she went on pursuing Ripley she deprived herself of it, so in my opinion she was not capable of laying eggs in SULLACO.",8,0,4,18 December 1998
Aliens," Thrilling, but the ending...
",ALIENS is no doubt the best and most magnificent part of the Alien saga. It is a pity that the publishing company has not released the full version of it /with the episode about the life of the colonists on LV before the attack of aliens/. What I find a bit diminishing about this great movie is the ending of it. I cannot imagine such a huge alien queen to be capable of getting on the 'plane' just behind Ripley. The queen could not have caught it. And one more thing - Ripley climbing the ladder while the outer door of the spaceship being open. That`s really funny.,9,0,0,5 January 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A horror classic...
","The 'Nightmare' has been recently on in our TV and I must admit that even after those fourteen years it made a deep impression on me. I saw the film for the first time in 1989 and at that time I was scared because I was just a teenager then. But now, I can see that the film has got something unique, which makes the film different from other horror movies. I think it`s down to the basic idea of this film - dreams and everything that can happen in our dreams sometimes become true. The authors of this film did not have to be bound with the need to stay realistic and that opens a free way to their wildest imaginations. Charles Bernstein`s music in this movie has become clasic and we can hear the basic melodic motive in some of the sequels. Original music composed by different authors in the sequels to this first Nightmare stays far far behind Bernstein`s masterpiece.",10,118,143,7 January 1999
