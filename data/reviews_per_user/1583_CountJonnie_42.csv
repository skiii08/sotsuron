Blade Runner 2049," 2017 style over 1982 substance
","This sequel added nothing of substance to an already amazing and balanced original. Can't compete with the dystopian feeling of the original, aided by presence of a brilliant Rutger Hauer.The sequel tried to be chilling and original, by adding slow scenes, filled with nothing or forced symbolism and an uninspiring villain, awkwardly portrayed by Jared Leto who has nothing to work with. Still a 6, thanks to Ana de Armas who singlehandedly put a soul in this movie.",6,1,1,20 October 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," Very entertaining movie, on various levels
","10 Cloverfield Lane is not a sequel, but more a tie in, or a side story. Like the original it builds on claustrophobia and not really knowing.A woman (Winstead) gets into an accident and wakes up in a cellar in the ground, owned by John Goodman. Goodman welcomes and helps her, but doesn't intent to let her go, because happenings outside that sound to crrazy to be true. This gives the feeling of a creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere, where that which is safe, feels dangerous. There the cat and mouse game begins, and Winstead is a prisoner hellbent on escaping, while trying to keep Goodmans thrust. The question is raised, will she be able to go, and if she does, what will she encounter?The movie works as a horror movie and a thriller. Goodman is perfect as the crazy guy with good intentions. Winstead is strong as the empowered victim. Together they carry a movie where for a long time nothing happens, but with palpable tension. And although movies like Cloverfield Paradox will make you stop wanting to see more about Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane will make you ask for more.",7,0,0,13 February 2018
It," I was never afraid of clowns, until now
","This movie succeeds on more levels than I could imagine. I was a fan of Stephen King, the book version of IT, and the original movie. Stephen King captures the spirit of children, childhood fears and growing up, while Tim Curry's acting did the rest.As a lover of classics, I wasn't happy with a lot of remakes and reboots. Same with IT. But watching the movie changed this. The opening scene immediately reminded us of the gruesome start of the original movie. This also showed that the remake pays its tribute to the original by respecting both the book and the original movie. The first moment you see the clown, is where you'll see how they deviate from the original movie. The clown is scarier, not because Skarsgard adopted Tim Curry's ways, but by inventing his own. For example by using a psychiatric approach and consulting a body contortionist. But also by not shying away from exposing children to violence. Where the original used practical effects, the remake uses some CGI, but never too much or too obvious. So the movie relies on the acting of the clown, and the acting of the Losers club and they do great.The success of the original depended on the amazing chemistry of the kids. Something the older actors were less capable off in the original. But the child actors and Skarsgard stand firm. We hate to admit it, but we were scared a few times during the first 30 inutes, thanks to good, unexpected and original horror moments. A lot is suggested (rape, sex, abuse) but never shown completely so it'll create an eerie atmosphere, effective, relying on your imagination, but never crossing a line. Instead they depend on subtle tricks instead of 'in your face' horror.Fun fact: We decided to watch the original a week before the remake. I can honestly say that the original is still a great movie, but it didn't pass the test of time. The remake does, with respect to the original, and it will make you hunger for a sequel. But please, not prequel, we heard the rumors and didn't like them.",8,1,2,30 October 2017
Hereditary," Truly scary horror, thanks to decent actors
","Horror movies greatly depend on shock effects, scares, some gore and of course sound effects. But this movie relies more on the brilliant acting skills of the whole cast. But it's mainly the lead actress: Toni Collette, who is genuinely scary, just by using her facial expressions, making her fear and other emotions palpable.The story itself, is not so complex. It's kind of a possession movie, with a family struck by grief due to a horrible loss. But the main cast (father, mother, two children) carry this movie like real pros, after a slightly slow start, straight to a terrifying climax.",8,0,2,13 March 2019
John Wick," Story: 3 minutes; Entertainment: 101 minutes.
","It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.",7,318,449,17 January 2015
Train to Busan," Collision course with zombies.....and emotions
","Train to Busan is a decent zombie movie that focusses less on horror/gore, and more on people and emotions. Without a real intro, the watcher is thrown in the middle of the movie, already overrun by zombies, while a group of survivors try to escape by train. But the horrors continu on the train, as it seems that zombies are not the only monsters.The effectiveness of this movie is thanks to the great actors who portray the spastic and quick zombies, without relying on gore. Another effect is the amazing acting by father and daughter, pregnant woman and boyfriend, and the 'evil' rich man who doesn't care about others. The movie obviously focusses on humanity, choises and effects.That's also the flaw of the movie. After a while it becomes repetitive and the roles become cliche. The 'evil' rich man becomes a cliche to a point that it becomes caricatural. This doesn't bring the movie down, because the pacing is so fast, that you'll never get bored or stuck in a situation. Train to Busan is still one of the better zombie movies in years.",6,0,1,17 February 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unnecessairy, but it builds up what TFA broke down
","The original trilogy still stands its ground, while many fans may ask if the next trilogy was necessary. Storywise it was, in a saga that holds more than 3 movies can contain. TFA ruined that with a story that added nothing except disappointment, being a sequel that turned out to be a blatant remake, and thus an insult.Rogue One however, connected between the 1st and 2nd trilogy. It didn't have the annoying lead characters, the rushed story and the horrible acting that came with TFA. Rogue One almost stands on its own, while connecting some loose ends and introduces characters that are almost memorable, and certainly not bad or useless.And it succeeds in (re)introducing Darth Vader, in a way that Revenge of the Sith couldn't. Not a classic, but a respectable effort and a decent follow-up that might ease the pain after TFA.",7,0,3,23 March 2017
Captain Marvel," Not essential, but still very entertaining.
","Captain Marvel received mixed reviews and lots of hate on imdb. None of the hate is justified. Captain Marvel is an entertaining partially standalone movie, that mostly serves as a prequel to Avengers Endgame, if you watch the post credits scene.Some people blast it as not funny, or too much forced as a female superhero movie. But that's so far from the thruth. Captain Marvel is an action movie, an origin movie, and offers enough subtle fun moments, thanks to great chemistry between Larson and Samuel L Jackson. And besides that, it has one of the most visually perfect jokes ever in cinematic history (something with a cat). It also has enough depth to make you care about the characters, and that includes the Skrulls who are so much more than just thugs and conquerors.The movie is not 'in your face' like GotG, or overly funny like Thor 3 or Ant Man 2. And that makes this movie refreshingly deserving of a solid 7.",7,1,2,1 May 2019
The Babadook," A bit of everything (horror, thriller, drama) and it's all good!!
","I try to watch every horror movie possible, desperately seeking for a scare, often appalled by how bad or cheesy they are. To give you a taste: I liked Jeepers Creepers, Descent, VHS, Insidious and Cabin in the Woods.After so many clones of 6th Sense, remakes and sequels, I didn't know what to expect. But unlike many other movies, the atmosphere in Babadook grabs you within the first minutes and won't let you go. Within those same minutes, you'll grow to either love or hate the main characters (mother and child), only to realize that it is because of their flawless acting.The characters are worked out perfectly, in a genuine creepy and almost claustrophobic setting. The horror is lurking from the shadow but doesn't ruin the movie with predictable scares. Obviously the scare work is not done by clichés or effects, but by atmosphere, acting and not knowing what to expect. The movies also uses symbols and metaphors which I can't explain without giving stuff away, but they don't overuse it in the way they did with 'Only God Forgives'.This is a movie you need to watch one times for the delightful scares, and than one more time to make you think. Now that makes this movie special.",8,8,16,22 November 2014
Creed," A sequel that devolves into nothing more than a useless reboot
","Many people will probably watch this movie just to follow the evolution of Sylvester Stallone. It is a pleasure to see Stallone grow as an actor with his age.Having said that, this movie is nothing more than a weak remake, with Michael B. Jordan replacing Rocky. The fact that he is a 'Creed', adds nothing to the story, just as much as Jordan doesn't add anything to the character.It's exploitation of a unique icon, that was shining in the 70's, brilliant in its simplicity, and now it's copied without a character. As enjoyable as it MIGHT have been as a stand alone movie for the new generation, it's a letdown for people who actually know the character that should've stopped after Balboa (part 6!!!!!).",5,2,3,15 March 2017
Aquaman," James Wan kickstarts the DCEU with his Aquaman
","Sure, Aquaman has its flaws, being full of cliches and predictability. What else do you expect with a story about a man who is caught between worlds, and has to face his family, in order to unite the worlds? (LOL)Other than that, Aquaman is a brilliant superhero movie, playing in a newly created world, which is a wonderful combination of Lord of the Rings, Abyss and Avatar, and perfectly matching sound effects. Despite the story being predictable, and being loaded with effects, Aquaman never becomes superficial. It offers enough background and soft moments, to make almost every character, even those with little screen time, interesting, believable and likable. On the other hand it offers enough action and speed, not suffering under special effects, to be continuously entertaining.Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it the best superhero movie? No. But it's a movie that never feels rushed, contains all necessary elements including some well timed comedy, and is perfectly balanced. This makes this movie incredibly entertaining, and the first movie that can actually compete with Marvel, and is hopefully a promise of more to come. Having said that, the only real bad parts were Amber Heard who is little more than eye candy and may remind you of Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire. Dolph Lundgren may thank his lucky stars for being in this flick, but should focus on Expendable sequels.Aquaman is an epic and fun visual spectacle. Thanks to James Wan, a director who knows how to handle this and various other genres!!",8,1,2,29 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Hilarious, but lacks the charm and attention span of the 1st Deadpool
","Deadpool is back and teams up with Cable and a few X-Men, in order to stop a young mutant who becomes a threat in the future. While doing so, the movie provides us with various cameos and jokes.Deadpool 2 is a funny movie with more jokes than you ask for and they keep coming, but it lacks the witty charm of part 1. Reynolds is always fun and the timing is near perfect. Unfortunately it's also too much and over the top, which makes the movie less coherent and feel more like a collection of clips, with characters that are downgraded to glorified cameos. Except for Cable, who brings a welcome seriousness and has good chemistry with Reynolds.This doesn't mean DP2 is not enjoyable. Although it lacks the charm and surprise element of part 1, we went in with the right expectations and some beers and we had a great evening full of laughs. I just hope part 3 brings more than jokes and cameos.",6,0,2,14 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Decent, but 'too much', not unlike GotG2.
","Cap. 1 and 2, Thor 1, GotG1 and Avengers 1 were refreshing. Just as the superhero market seemed repetitive, Marvel gave us a very refreshing Doc. Strange and Ant-Man. And now Thor 3, which is fun, but far from refreshing.Thor has a background rooted in mythology and themes such as responsibility and family. Something that shines in a well developed relation between Thor, his father Odin, and his half-brother Loki, aided by the simple and likable Hulk who was more of a character in this movie, and not just a fun gimmick.Also in Thor 3, the focus is on family again. This is well explained through the under-used Odin, and even in his few scenes, Anthony Hopkins steals the show. So does Tom Hiddleston who shows his internal struggle, but also provides a lighter note. It is Hela (Blanchett) however, who carries this movie on her back, through a menacing and convincing performance as a new villain and a page out of Thor's family history. Unfortunately Thor himself was not well developed. The writers had the chance to make him grow into a more mature and godlike person, with the changes he does make. But unfortunately that process gets buried under the countless jokes, one-liners, slapstick and buddy humour, added with countless pointless cameos and a Grandmaster who was more a comedian, than a menacing, mysterious entity.As perfect as some jokes are, as brilliant as the timing is, it is a pity that this downgrades a beautiful mythology into a (still likable but also) silly comedy, only to rise above that mediocrity every moment Hela and Odin appear on screen. Especially Hela who shines in dialogue and in action. I hope to see more of her in future installments.",7,1,3,1 December 2017
Ready Player One," A great topping on a mediocre dessert
","RPO is a movie about a very possible future, where rich dominates poor, and VR dominates reality, but also about the power of belief and friendship and love, which is supposed to be more valuable than money and fame.This is a simple premise that could've been given substance, if they focussed more on characters, their background, and their development. Instead, the movie focusses on effects and a lot of cameos. The effects are amazing, the action is pretty entertaining and the cameos from games, movies and superheroes are very recognizable and funny if you lived in the 80's and/or 90's.But after the 1st half, the cameos are no longer surprising, they become gimmicks. The action gets repetitive, and the acting becomes flat. The message becomes too obvious, stretched out and in your face. The movie loses its momentum especially because the lead bad guys seem unmotivated and two dimensional. The movie could have been so much better, if only they invested more in the characters and their motivation. Great effects can not inflate that which is flat. And that is exactly what this movie becomes, after the 1st half.That doesn't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, if only you care enough about the many cameos that might make this movie worth watching a 2nd time, and play beer games.",6,6,14,31 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Great Spider-Man character, decent but not great Spider-Man movie
","Spider-Man deserved a new movie, simply because (a) the previous reboot failed, and because (b) the new Spidey (after Cap. America 3) set a new standard for the cinematical version of the superhero.In his cameo in Cap. 3 Tom Holland held his own, thanks to gimmicks that tied him to The Avengers and Tony Stark. With respect to the previous movies, the makers made the smart move to NOT make this an origin movie, which would have slowed everything down. Instead they focused on his younger years at school, developing relations with other teens and Stark, and a brand new enemy that steals every scene.The good part: Tom Holland as Spidey AND as Peter Parker. Other good parts are the action, Michael Keaton as the villain, and Spidey discovering his suit (instead of his powers). The interaction with his school teens, and the impact of his superhero-part on his relations.The not so good part: by not doing the origin, they gain speed and momentum. That same speed is lost by dragging the clumsy part. Spidey is shown clumsy as a kid learning the responsibility as a hero, but they drag it on like forever. After a while, we get the message. Spidey is a kid, strong enough for more, but not yet mature enough. Great message, now move on.All in all, a very fun movie, but not as brilliant and charismatic as the original Spider-Man 2. Maybe that movie can't be topped.",7,2,8,26 July 2017
Justice League," So they didn't learn anything after MoS and BvS ??
","DC is trying to expand its universe, like Avengers does for Marvel. They bring together a band of 6 heroes who were introduced with MoS, BvS and WW, to face a new foe (Steppenwolf) that requires a team of superpowered people to be defeated.All the tools were present. Diverse heroes, backgrounds, powers, villains, but still it fails to deliver. Why? For several reasons. Each reason itself shouldn't be a problem, but all together in one movie is too big a pill to swallow.Batman is a hero that can carry the whole of DC on his back, but not in a team. Batman himself is the personification of anti-social disorder in something that should feel like a team of friends or colleages. It also doesn't help that Ben Affleck seemed uninspired, as opposed to BvS. Wonder Woman has the advantage of mythology, but other than that, Gal Gadot (WW) and Jason Momoa (Aquaman) can't act for sh*t. Not sure if this is because of their acting skills, or because of a flawed script, because their lines where at times cringeworthy. Not too mention the villain. The good voice work is overshadowed by nothingness. The villain feels unknown, uninspired and uneffective. He never feels like the ultimate villain that might bring the apocalypse. After WW and BvS they AGAIN took the risk of having a CGI villain. Sometimes it works, but apparently not in this movie. More background information in order to be able to relate or to understand might have helped.This doesn't mean the movie has nothing to offer, because there are several good parts. First of all, what the movies did right was offer a glimps of more to come. Hints of Steppenwolf, Apokalips and Darkseid instead of showing too much. I hope DC will show more of Darkseid, with a proper introduction. Superman himself was never more interesting than here. He was not introduced as the most powerful hero, but as powerful and potentially very dangerous man. His turn from confused to good was rushed, but that is not Henry Cavill's fault. Cyborg's background sounds like the most generic one, but Ray Fisher's acting shows Cyborgs human conflicted side in a very robotic and alien body. Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill were the only ones in this movie who properly understand 'less is more'. Flash was also a welcome addition. Although sometimes misplaced, his comedy was what was lacking in the previous movies and it was never too much, although sometimes a distraction. Every team needs a lighter note.And finally the action. Although the CGI was at times obvious the action was a delight. It felt as if they let go, and gave every hero the chance to shine. The only thing lacking was an enemy that you could actually care about, but that doesn't diminish that this superhero movie is also an enjoyable action movie.Even with the good parts, this movie is flawed. It absolutely works as a standalone action movie for kids or for a new generation. But as a build up for a universe to expand on..... well, there is nothing that feels worth expanding on, due to the lacking of interesting backgrounds and connection.The lesson to be learned here: Even if all the tools for success are present, without chemistry and introduction, there is no decent end product.",6,0,1,29 December 2017
Cast Away," Speechless
","What an amazing performance, by Tom Hanks, who takes the viewer to a remote island. Hanks is able to portray a character that gets broken down, and rebuilds himself.With hardly a set, hardly a supporting cast, a minimum of dialogue and expressions, but with a hurricane of emotions, a credible and breathtaking Hanks keeps the audience at the edge of their seats from the beginning till the end, in this masterpiece of a movie.",8,2,3,6 March 2019
Split," Shyamalan is back.......without improving. The biggest twist are the positive reviews.
","Shyamalan built his reputation on two, maybe three movies. His trademark is his originality and twists, and his many failed attempts to recreate them.Split is about a man with various personalities. McAvoy succeeds into playing various interesting persons, but that is the only good part of this movie. The girls who get kidnapped, their acting is atrocious. Seeing them try, you can only blame it on the script and the directing. Same goes for the therapist, who makes certain decisions that will only make you cringe.As the movie struggles to stand, it builds up to some semi- supernatural ending, which is so stretched out, that all credibility is lost and even McAvoy can't tie all lose strings anymore. Shyamalan does succeed into creating a nice atmosphere, but fails in the simple basics: an understandable plot, believable characters and coherent conversations. All three are missing.The best thing you can say about this movie is that it isn't as bad as The Happening, or Lady in the Water. But it is far worse than the rest. The biggest twists are the reviews that pretend that this is a decent movie.",4,9,24,26 March 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Perfect as a farewell, but slightly flawed as an action film
","End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage.",8,2,5,2 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The Thanos Quest
","Everything has been building up to this. Every hero has been on screen, had his action, made his jokes. Considering that, for the heroes this movie doesn't offer much besides repeating tricks. What this movies does offer, is the breathtaking performance of Josh Brolin's Thanos.Not unlike the comic Thanos Quest, this movie is about Thanos manipulating his way into godlike power, until his power is cemented enough to put himself amidst the action. Besides being a brilliant, tactical, philosophical being, Thanos is also in pain because of the terrible choices he has to make. This movie is not just about Thanos' battle against the heroes, but the internal quest he has to make, to fullfill a destiny.That's why it's easy to forgive this movie for the lack of character development among the heroes. the relation between Wanda and Vision, Wakanda, the motivations of the Children of Thanos etc. Everything and everyone is little more than a stepping stone for Thanos. But with a character so well written, Thanos deserves nothing less.",8,1,7,26 April 2018
Get Out," Builds flawlessly on tension and anticipation
","This movie probably fools everyone with the opening scene, after which you'll be guessing what the real genre, horror, thriller, drama etc. is. After that beginning, the atmosphere changes back to getting to know the characters. Without too much development, it keeps a perfect pace, to keep you wondering what's next.A likable but not overacting or bland character, in a new environment that will keep everyone still guessing, will end up in a situation in which the viewer will rapidly realize what 'the sunken place' is, without losing all credibility.One creepy party and one revelation later, the viewer will finally know what genre, and what kind of movie we are watching. A movie that reinvents creepy movies, with the only small flaw being that after the twist, things go (too) fast. Everything else, acting, characters, surroundings, works perfect!!",7,10,18,3 May 2017
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great movie, no cliché!!!!
","I loved part 1 and 2 already, for being more serious and mature than movies such as the great Spiderman and the awful Hulk and Daredevil (however I DID enjoy all of them).X-Men has a good and bad side. There are too many superheroes. This results in getting to see many of your heroes, but some of them don't get enough screen time. This does NOT make the movie less fun to watch.I can tell the directing is good, the effects are great and subtle, the storyline is terrific and is a good conclusion to part 2 and the action was wonderful.But what I liked the most was that there were no clichés. Spiderman and Daredevil are loaded with clichés such as 'no heroes get killed', 'no blood & gore', 'family values', 'speaches', 'hero gets girl', etc.In X-Men 3 however, without the gore, people GET killed. People DO dislike each other (Cyclops & Wolverine). No speech before and after the fight. Just a great fight. Etc....I liked X-Men 3 just as I liked Spider-man 2. Only with Spiderman 2 I kept saying: 'Please get it on with.' / 'Hurry up.'",8,0,1,23 July 2006
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Brilliant and motivating
","Ben Stiller is Walter Mitty, a man who looks as if he does nothing, is nothing and is perceived as nothing. Except for during his little fantasies in which he is a hero, but during these weirds moments in which he dozes off, others write him off.Until he finds a goal in life, which puts in him adventurous situations by accident, which transform him in the man he always was. A unique individual, an adventurer, a dreamer who fulfills his dreams and finds the appreciation he needs and deserves. But the appreciation doesn't come from other, but from himself.What the movie does brilliantly, is make the watcher feel connected to Walter Mitty and feels with him. You'll find him goofy, but likable. Your respect for him will grow with every minute, and at the end of the movie, you'll love him. Maybe you even recognize your own milestone moments, mountains you have climbed, seas you have sailed, so we all are bigger than we are perceived, as long as you have that respect and confidence from within.Props to Ben Stiller. Jim Carrey had his Truman Show, Will Ferrel had his Stranger Than Fiction. Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty should be in that group.",8,34,38,20 July 2018
22 Jump Street," A simple and loud copy of #1 and they even admit it.
","You don't need to be a fan of the original series, but it does help to enjoy the movie. Part 1 succeeded in being different enough and still respecting the source material. Not saying it was a good movie, but still enjoyable.Now part 2 is not much different, yet it is. At the end of part 1 and the beginning of part 2 they even admit that this is going to be the same movie. But instead of adding something that might make this movie somehow original, they decided to make a movie built out of jokes that seem incoherent. Jokes work for 10 minutes, but they get old in this movie very soon. What doesn't help either is that they repeat the 'relation-joke' over and over, without adding real characters or development.Personally it felt as if they didn't really write this movie, but just crammed the leftovers of part 1. Leftover; that is exactly what this movie is. The only relief are the bad guys and some comedic guest parts, because the others seem to have given up halfway this movie.",5,0,1,5 January 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Jack Sparrow, nothing more than a gimmick
","PotC 1 was a unique movie that took cinema by storm. The adventurous tales, the overacting and the atmosphere made the movie a delight for old, and also for young, even with the horror elements. Depp's phenomenal acting combined with the fairy tale feeling of the movie made it a delight for us all.The sequels proved that even a unique feeling will suffer when the underlying script or motivations are messy, and PotC drowned (or should've drowned) after part 3. Somehow a life raft saved what became On Stranger Tides. Maybe Jack Sparrow has 9 lives as long as he was cursed to do standalone movies, that escaped from the complexity that killed part 2 and 3 from the original trilogy.Alas, Salazar's Revenge offered none of what On Stranger Tides delivered. After a moody and atmospheric opening with links to open ties from the trilogy we (too soon) get to know Salazar who is a ghostly adversary, locked away from land. Nothing wrong with Javier Bardem's acting, but his introduction and later the 'escape' of Salazar, take away anything that was threatening or frightening.A little later, Jack Sparrow enters the scene, which reminds us of every reason to not let this series continue. Funny as Depp is, with perfect comedic timing, Sparrow has become nothing more than a background gimmick who has no reason to be on screen any moment during the film and has become a parody of the brilliance and subtle genius of comedic stars like Buster Keaton. Halfway the movie you'll have forgotten that Bardem and Depp should've been the main focus. No charm, no charisma, no masterful screen presence.The only redeeming factor is that at the end, they tie a loose end from the trilogy in a feel good way. But even that is ruined with a post credits scene that suggests that more is to come, for no reason or explanation. PotC has become like Transformers: fillers for cinemas.",5,0,2,18 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Yes it is flawed, but it's not the disaster the fake negative reviews claim
","This is the first time I realize how fanboys, haters, bots and trolls influence public opinion (on false grounds). I grew up with the original trilogy, and the new trilogy didn't do much justice. As much as Rogue One was a surprise, TFA was nothing more than a copy from ANH, which is why I believed the negative reviews about TLJ and I went with little to no expectations to the cinema today.The movie follows Rey and Fin, each on their own mission to help the resistance and to find Luke Skywalker, in an attempt to create a fighting chance against the armies of Snoke and Kylo Ren, in a time where there are few Jedis left. One of the just criticisms is that it copies ESB. Not only that, but it also copies RotJ. Another just criticism is how they handle Snoke in this movie, including some guest parts that might feel too short or wasted.One of the criticisms I don't agree with, is that their was too much comedy. The movie indeed starts with some humor, but it is never too much or misplaced. I also fundamentally disagree with that the movie has a bad story or characters. Although the movie does copy elements from the original trilogy, it deviates enough to form its own base for new characters and stories. Without spoiling too much, it is safe to say that this movie pays its respect to the original story and original stars and characters, but it's main goal is to pass the baton to a new batch of heroes and villains, who are interesting, vulnerable and charismatic enough to make connection to each other and the audience. And if that is indeed the goal, than the movie succeeded in its mission, and deserves a decent finish with it's upcoming 9th installment.",7,1,4,27 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A fun movie, but not the hit people claim it to be.
","Sure, the movie made the numbers. But is that the proof for a good movie? I don't think so. What we have here, is superhero movie number..... (lost count). Movies such as Spider-Man, X-Men etc. are for everybody, and especially people who read the comics 10...20 years ago. So it's not just about being good, but about recognizing things from a long time ago, pleased with wonderful cameo's and teasers for more to come.But especially this movie, it lost the touch we got with the first Spider-Man, Cap. America and Iron Man. Those movies, even with effects, were subtle to a point and had at least SOME character development. The people were interesting with AND without mask.But in GotG we don't get better effects, but more effects. We don't get better characters, but more characters. We certainly didn't get better acting. What do you expect when a lead part is given to a wrestler? The acting was bad. It was acceptable, because it came with humor and good timing. But humor in that way should be scarce. Instead, we now got it for 2 hours. Humor, shooting, yelling, laughing. So many characters that it felt rushed, at the cost of likable characters and development.I hope in time people will see this movie for what it is. Popcorn entertainment with above average effects and below average acting. Because if not, it means the end of good movies and the welcoming of more Transformer (kind of) movies thanks to people who vote 10 just for the sake of it.This movie should get a 6,5 or a 7. Nothing more, nothing less.",7,5,12,24 August 2014
The Imitation Game," A potential boring movie, turned into a compelling drama by Cumberbatch
","The Imitation Game is a drama about the efforts of Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) to break the Enigma Code, which plays a significant role in ending WWII.The Imitation Game has the elements to be a boring drama, with standard cliches and some story elements that feel rushed. Turing is portrayed as an autistic person, unable to work with a team and unable to have social relations. So of course a big part of the story is how he creates a relation with his team and future (ex) wife. Needless to say there are elements of betrayal. Such as Turing ending his relationship because he is gay. Sarcificing soldiers in order to protect their decoding success. And of course the spy who leaks to the Russians. All these parts are rushed and don't add to the story, partially because of historical inaccuracies.The reason why that doesn't bother the movie, and why I still rate it an 8 is for the simple fact that Benedict Cumberbatch is nothing short of brilliant. Rarely have I seen anyone playing such complex emotion in a person who is unable to emotionally connect. Cumberbatch acts with his body language, words, voice, eyes, stutter, and with compelling silences. Cumberbatch, and Cumberbatch alone is the reason why the movie becomes compelling and interesting from the start to the end.",8,0,0,28 May 2018
Logan," Jackman and Stewart steal the show. A solid 7 !!
","Many might agree that Jackman is a perfect Wolverine, which he showed mainly in X-Men 1 and X2. Those same people might even agree that X-Origins: Wolverine and 'The Wolverine' might be terrible movies. The filmmakers defied the odds and made 'Logan', an homage and farewell to the one and only Wolverine we know and love.They made the brilliant move to stay away from the past and deal with the here and now (which is the future - no pun intended). Few mutants are left, but they created one brilliant and memorable part, flawlessly portrayed by Patrick Stewart: an old, sick and vulnerable Professor X.The filmmakers gave Prof X and Logan more character and more depth, than any X-related movie has ever done before. The story is not complicated, but delightfully simple and focuses on character development and final choices.Small spoiler: The only flaw in this movie, is that the real villain besides a hunky (and weak) Donald Pierce, is a clone from Logan. Logan himself has a variety of fan-favorite villains, such as Sabretooth, Sinister and so many others. I wish his farewell would have been a fight against one of those.Even with the lack of that opponent, Logan is one of the better and more honest and watchable superhero movies of today.",7,2,6,27 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Hilariously funny, which brings us to the problem
","Where GotG1 took us by surprise, in a time where cinemas are overloaded by superhero movies, GotG2 fails to do the same. GotG1 built on characters who were lesser known and succeeded in making them likable by combining background stories, with a decent build-up and great comedy thanks to flawless timing, while staying connected to the mainstream MCU.GotG2 had the opportunity to build further upon the stepping stones that GotG1 laid out. Since the backgrounds are now known, GotG2 had the chance to pick up the pace where GotG1 sometimes felt slow and chaotic. But instead of picking a pace, GotG2 chose to focus on comedy which was there abundantly. After 45 minutes of jokes, you get the drift, but the movie doesn't. Star-Lord is witty and funny, Rockey is sarcastic and funny, Drax is dumb and funny, Groot is cute and funny.During the 2nd half where the movie tries to turn to action and character work, while feeding us bits of information as a promise to part 3, the audience's patience may already have worn out after countless jokes that hurt the pace. The heroes are funny but offer nothing more than they already have. The villains feel empty and pointless. The plot is rushed and so disconnected from the mainstream MCU that his movie feels as a filler that could have been let out.The only character that rises above it all is Michael Rooker as Yondu, who single handedly provides more character and more development, than all the other characters do, despite the messy script. So is it a bad movie? No it isn't. Should you skip it? No you shouldn't. But IF you skip it, you won't miss very much.",7,0,3,28 May 2017
The Witch," More contemporary drama with great character work, than thriller/horror
","The Witch is a praised movie, that falls under the horror genre. We went into this movie with different expectations, which helped us to enjoy this movie. Although there is a witch, and although there are supernatural elements, that isn't what this movie is about.The movie is about a family of outcasts who try to maintain a living on their own, when natural elements are threatening their life (food, animals), but also their faith in God. Their faith is such a strong foundation and source of love, that when their faith is seemingly threatened, life and sanity start falling apart.And that is what this movie is about. A pretty natural reenactment of how life was in that period. The surrounding, the clothing, the acting, the lines are a very loyal representation of life and values in those times. That alone makes that the movie can feel like a thriller. The brilliant acting and character work will make the viewer feel like he's in a thriller, because the threat comes from the inside, from lies and from naivity.Thank God those times are over, but also thanks for giving the viewer insight in those times, strengths and weaknesses.",7,3,6,2 June 2018
War of the Worlds," Good direction, terrible to watch
","This post will contain spoilers, because I have to give examples on how and what I think is bad in this film.To start with something; the direction, acting and effects are wonderful, but that's all. Spielberg's preview and trailer promised us a film that deserved the world WAR in the title. But there was no war.The first mistake is Tom Cruise. He was supposed to be a jerk, which explains why his kids don't like him. Obviously Spielberg chose him not because of his ability to be a jerk, but because they're friends. From the start to the end, Cruise was a hero, mostly unintended. Nobody can fix a car, but he can. Nobody sees the birds on the tripods, but he can. Tim Robbins is way stronger, but Cruise can beat him.Even worse than those moments are the family problems. Though the movie is called War of the WORLDS, it's all about the constant yapping of Dakota Fanning against daddy. Worse, she bounces from a yapping brat to a kid who talks as if she's 30 years old. This changed the genre from action/war/sf to drama. Good acting is important, but the drama dominated the movie.I will NOT explain how the movie ended. I can however say that somewhere in the middle something 'terrible' happens. And everybody who can spell 'Spielberg' and 'cliche' knows now how it ends. If all of the above mentioned problems were forgiven, the ending'd still ruin the whole movie. I left the cinema being disappointed. I miss Spielberg's old work, Jaws, Duel, Indiana Jones, etc.",4,1,2,23 July 2006
Joker," The Joker is not a person, but a movement, an inspiration
","A brilliant move to make this movie stand alone, and not a true Joker origin movie. What the movie tells the viewer, is that when society strips away your money, love, medical care and truth, all that's left is madness and despair. And anyone who embraces that, can become the Joker.Joaquim Phoenix is brilliant as a pathetic and abused person, spit out by everything and everyone, willingly and unwillingly turning into the madman who becomes the inspiration to the many who feel unheared, with the viewer unsure if Phoenix is a villain, or an anti hero we don't deserve but desperately need.A must see, for those interested in some form of an origin story, but even more for those who need a movie that dares to challenge society as a whole.",8,1,5,22 December 2019
It Chapter Two," How did Pennywise become a minor character???
","There you go. So much expectations, because chapter one somehow made Pennywise a more interesting character, and the movie more scary than the original. But chapter two didn't live up to it.Chapter two picks up where the 'adult' part begins, in a race to the final battle with Pennywise. But chapter two made the fatal mistake of having zero character development, and becoming nothing more than a series of failed attempts to scare the viewer.The acting was less, the story was gone, the CGI was poor and Pennywise himself was completely uninteresting. People refuse to learn that chemistry is more important than flat scare effects. The child actors captured that chemistry. The adults didn't. The only other thing to do, was to focus more on Pennywise, which the book did. But that didn't happen here either. What's left is a hollow movie, that started promising, end ended like most sequels..... flat and boring.",5,2,2,27 December 2019
Kong: Skull Island," A remake that stands on its own
","I prefer sequels over remakes, because sequels are a continuation of a storyline you like or love. A remake just erases everything which sometimes is an insult to fans of the original. Unless, the remake stands on its own that it's entertaining for 'old' fans, and 'new' fans.The movie stands on its own and succeeds on various levels. First, the characters aren't as annoying as in the 2005 version. 2nd, it mixes character work and action, and doesn't offer to much of either. 3rd, the humor is not too much, and it's well timed. 4rd, it doesn't waste time with a (useless) build up, or side stories. It's a straight forward movie. And finally, more women will fall in love with Tom Hiddleston who is surprisingly well in action movies.Enjoy it!!!",7,1,3,18 April 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A stellar cast and setting can't hide an empty and superficial story
","Branagh shines as Poirot in a beautiful surrounding in which he has to solve a murder case on a train, while showing that his talents are a bliss and a burden at the same time. Within minutes he gets to showcase his detective skills in an amusing way. Not much later, the movie turns out to be loaded with a stellar cast. After some forced introductions the movie starts to feel rushed. There is no build up, no development, just a quick introduction to a group of so called interesting people and it's done.The movie is beautiful, but a great cast can't hide the fact that the movie is rushed, superficial and hollow and doesn't do honor to the fine details that made the original story richer.",6,2,5,18 February 2018
Wonder Woman," Wrong time, wrong place
","It may be the right time for some heroes, but it's the wrong time for some stories. Superheroes in the cinema are as common as they were in the childhood of many (30+) viewers. A mostly male scene, deserves a female counterpart. Those are Wonder Woman, Black Widow and more to come.But apart from being the hero we (or female fans) deserve, the superhero genre more than others, needs a story, more than a pretty face. Luckily, the director gave Wonder Woman more than just heroism, super strength and bravery. They chose for a hero who is conflicted with her own kind, but also with mankind, making her lonely in more than one aspect.The mistake however is also making her young and naive. Being young and naive could be the right choice if there was more time, or if it was through flashbacks. Being a hero is often a story about growing up, maturing, letting go and accepting responsibility. There are 2 red threads: the hero that doesn't choose his path but has to (Superman, Spiderman), and the hero that does choose his path and wants to (Batman, Captain America). But that has been done before, and too many times. As stated, Spider-Man, Captain America, etc.What sets Wonder Woman apart is her special heritage. The director could've chosen to focus on her childhood, her development, her mythology, but that's the part that was rushed. The director could've chosen to focus on her relation with other heroes, to make her a part of the bigger DC universe. But unfortunately she chose the familiar path of a hero that decides to go to the war (sounds familiar), gets confronted with something that's bigger than her, and finds a way to defeat it. With that path, the movie falls flat as it fails to set itself apart as different. The well timed comedy, the lessons about humanity and the good job by Gal Gadot couldn't save this from being standard.",6,0,9,18 September 2017
Black Panther," A movie that feels irritatingly slow and rushed at the same time.
","A Black Panther movie was inevitable, after the appearance of this titular hero in a Cap. America movie. Chadwick Boseman breathes life in a charismatic way, into this character who brings class in the MCU, being a hero, but also a king of the beautiful country of Wakanda. These are the only redeeming qualities of this movie that is otherwise a stinker and shows that the MCU has more failures than just Incredible Hulk and Inhumans.Black Panther is about T'Challa who takes the mantle as a king, unites various tribes, hides from the world and comes to oppose a villain in Killraven, who wants to expose Wakanda to the world, and use vibranium as revenge for years of oppression and abuse against his ancestors. T'Challa has to face this challenge and make peace with his own ancestor's mistakes at the same time.I can't see how this movie has high ratings. Besides Boseman and Freeman, there is not a single decent actor in this movie. The acting is horrible. Andy Serkis is trying, but his overacting gets annoying after a few minutes. Michael B. Jordan has showed the worst of acting in Creed and FF, and repeats this here, unable to convince the viewer of his nature and motivations. Other characters were random and rushed, so they couldn't fill the holes. Because of this, the movie never engages, making this feel slow from the beginning to the end.The effects were slightly entertaining but also over-used. The suit is never interesting, the way they did with Iron Man. Vibranium is rich and interesting, but never treated with the respect it deserves. And the action is so random, fast and CGI heavy, that it never convinces or entertains. It just confuses and makes this movie feel rushed. The mixing of slow-paced and fast-paced makes the movie feel uninteresting and unbalanced.Wakanda is as beautiful as a fairytale brought to life. But that can't save the other mistakes that turn this movie into a stinker.",5,2,3,20 May 2018
Life," Stands firmly on its own
","One of the trivia says the movie is based on Alien (1979). That wouldn't be respectful to Life. Life indeed is in space, but in closer orbit to the earth, but also with a more realistic threat that feels close to home.But the real surprise is that the actors carry the movie, and not the alien. The threat is real, looks real and feels real, but never turns this movie into a science fiction / horror movie. The movie is a thriller/drama that evolves with the choices that people have to make, their vulnerabilities, naivity and bravery. And as the characters evolve, so does the alien.So as much as the alien is a threat to all of humanity, it also brings forth the humanity of all people on screen. And they do that with limited props, limited space and limited screen time. Therefor this movie succeeds in what other movies couldn't.Life is claustrophobic, scary, intense, and all too human and all too real. You'll believe the characters and dangers, which will both keep you on the edge of your seat.The only minus is the ending. Personally I'd suggest to consider it a 'what if' ending, and don't ask for a sequel.",7,4,10,11 June 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," One long enjoyable action scene, but adds nothing else
","The 1st John Wick was and still is a gem. Not too much story, and lots of action without burying it beneath over the top acting or (sub)stories.Part 2 does the same thing, in a good way. The most brilliant move is to make Reeves a tormented man with not too much lines. He indeed is the silent boogeyman in every shadow, who hates what he does, but also does it best.The acting and lines are left to others who carry it better, such as Ian McShane, Lance Reddick and Peter Stormare. But at the moment they introduce Laurence Fishburne, the movie falls flat. It's exactly than and there where Fishburne performs a piece of overacting that was so well avoided in part 1 and the 1st half of part 2.John Wick is a man who wants out, but the only way to do that is to get in. Which is the same way the movie ends and promises us a part 3. At this moment, the movie becomes on long fight scene and for me that was the moment to realise it should've ended after part 1. Enjoyable, fun, great ride and unnecessairy.",6,0,0,19 June 2017
Annihilation," (Self)destruction.
","Natalie Portman is on a mission to enter the glimmer. A strange area that deforms nature, from which no one returns, except her husband who is changed. Now Portman goes in, to search for the extra terrestial cause and to stop the expansion of the area until it covers everything, and changes everything, including her.The movie works in an abstract way, but if you look past the visuals, the message is simple. Total destruction, by self destruction. If nature doesn't kill mankind, than humans will. This becomes obvious when the alien object starts copying people's looks and behaviour. It copies movements, including attacks. Which means that it attacks humans, not by choise, but merely by copying human attacks at it. Eventually, when the transformation is almost complete, the alien even self destructs by 'accidentally' setting everything on fire, destroying the glimmer and the cause.Every act of horor in this movie (except for a few mutated animals) can be brought back to human behaviour. Even the alien who starts copying human behaviour has a human cause of destruction. In that way, this is a rather pessimistic movie, with an almost realistic message, in a beautiful package that makes the message looks more attractive than it really is. And the acting by Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac is near flawless.",7,3,7,5 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Legacy Tarnished
","It might help to watch the first Alien. It was made in 1979, with simple but effective props. But what it mostly had to offer, was a sensation of claustrophobia. The fact that the monster was just there without too much explanation, added to the mystery and dread.After 4 movies it was a good thing that this epic story ended. Still, it was time for a prequel and we got Promotheus, which was part prequel, part completely different movie with aliens crammed into it. Considering the movie an unnecessairy remake, it was enjoyable to see the hommages and consistencies with the original movies (warning signal, claustrophobia and an android). What Prometheus added to the mythology, was the origin of mankind, but without much further explanation so what it did was create more loose threads and raise more questions. That alone was a good reason for another sequel/prequel, which is now Alien Covenant.Unfortunately it didn't deliver. Instead of continuing the story, it retold an original satisfying story in a different unsatisfying way. But the biggest flaw, besides that the crew seemed amateurish and the alien nothing more than a prop, was that they almost completely ignored the new mythology of the creators of mankind. That part was rushed over, and they focused completely on the humans and android, degrading the real alien to a side effect, nullifying the claustrophobic feeling.Instead of steering away from the humans, the focus is completely back on them, ignoring the new mythology, and disrespecting the old mythology. The movie fails in making the humans human, and it tries too hard to make an android too human. In that way, the movie is like a handbook of distorted human relations and the destructon that comes from it.In hindsight, not knowing the origin of humans and aliens would have been better, but we're past that. No more unknown dangers, mysterious signals and unseen aliens lurking in the dark....so it is indeed an end, of Alien as we knew it.",4,7,15,2 June 2017
