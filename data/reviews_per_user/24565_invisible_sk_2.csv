Blade Runner 2049," No longer trust reviews. Boring, dragged on, flat story. Good visuals.
","I'll keep it short, unlike the unnecessarily long movie. It's simply too boring. The whole movie, the story can actually be done and dusted within less than an hour if it wasn't unnecessarily extended and dragged on, and if the characters weren't always moving so inexplicably slow.Sure the visuals and cinematography is great, but a movie isn't just a photography slideshow, or a TV demo. I mean, had it been called that beforehand we would all know that's the only thing we're in for.Also learnt for the last time not to trust the reviews anymore, especially for new releases. I've seen time and time again that it's not as reliable as it used to be. I predict the rating will fall in time (actually has since I've seen it). Back to pre-internet days where word of mouth is more reliable.",4,80,167,19 October 2017
The Shape of Water," A potential masterpiece that starts great but is utterly ruined.
","I feel like Del Toro rewrote the movie around act 3 to suit the current time's issues and agendas to be a part of the bandwagon and thus ruined what was originally destined to be a true masterpiece.There are movies that were originally meant to be about a female group (sex and the city, the devil wears prada), a character or a relationship was meant to be gay or lesbian (brokeback mountain, gigli) and they fit, or even a love story of completely different worlds or species (beauty and the beast, casper) and it isn't forced or out of place. It isn't uncomfortable or vulgar, they were not made to jump on a bandwagon, to solely fit the current global agendas or issues, they were purely about the art and the story they told. They were great movies and depicted a proper portrayal and a true image of the concepts they told the stories of.In contrast we now have movies that are solely created to jump on the bandwagon, to fit an agenda or forcefully incorporate them while uncomfortably out of place, all female reboots (Ghostbusters, Ocean's 8), gay and lesbian relationships forced into scripts with almost no true chemistry of love or affection between them in countless shows and movies, and movies such as this where interspecies relationships are depicted so out of place and distastefully, so vulgar and lacking true chemistry that it's simply uncomfortable.I am all for LGBT rights. But it's very obvious this movie wasn't meant to be about that, but somewhere along the line Del Toro seems to have steered the movie off it's original course to be a part of that bandwagon and it's very obvious how they were forced. You see, your likelihood of winning oscars skyrocket when you fit the current agendas set by the industries involved.That's exactly what happened here.Beauty and the beast did it right, this movie did it distastefully and uncomfortably.A potential masterpiece of art ruined by external agendas.Shame on you Del Toro.",5,2,5,28 March 2018
