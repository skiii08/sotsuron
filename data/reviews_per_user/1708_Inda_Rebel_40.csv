The Avengers," Ok
","Just ok. It's a serious drama a majority of the film. Not fun. I don't like how Disney have developed The Avengers. Should be lighter, funnier and fun. Can only be accessed by teenagers, not accessible for children. A Superhero film that kids won't understand? Superhero films are supposed to be universal.",5,0,5,24 April 2020
It," Er...
",No back story of why and how the clown is doing what he is doing. No basis for what is going on is mentioned. Thin plot. Not enough story. Didn't enjoy it.,4,2,4,14 May 2020
12 Angry Men," Don't believe the hype!
","Doesn't allow you to guess the end! Introduces evidence that the audience isn't aware of at the end of the film! Poor writing, what a bore.",2,1,13,20 February 2018
Spider-Man 2," Quite good
","Quite good, much better than the original. More emotional content, more fun and humour.",6,0,1,29 April 2020
Chicken Run," Fun

",Good reboot to the series. Lighter and more fun than the Avenger films. Enjoyable.,7,0,1,27 April 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Borin
","I love Peter Sellers. The Pink Panther films, and Shot In The Dark are brilliant; amongst the best comedies ever made. I have grown up watching them. They remain as tight as when I first watched them. The Party is another classic. Two Way Stretch great. Wrong Arm of the Law good. Murder By Death Brilliant.I am a massive Peter Sellers fan and have recently been watching films of his on the net that I haven't seen yet. This one is a waste of time. Not funny. The last three I have watched for the first time have all been crap. This, the Lady Killers and I'm Alright Jack. They are a waste of time. Not funny. Not ones I'll be arsed watching again. Just simply not funny.I've rated these 3 films 2's out of 10. 2 just cause Sellers, and respect for him, but on all the lists I've read about him, This always seems to rated as the best. That's not true.",2,6,16,2 June 2013
Interstellar," Ha!
","What a waste of time!Don't believe the good reviews, this is rubbish!I was expecting a film like Prometheus, with a good storyline about humanity's future endeavours. This is poor. The ending is really bad, and doesn't make any sense. Very unbelievable. Very overrated. Ha ha, ten, Best film ever, ha ha!",4,5,20,16 July 2019
Oblivion," Hmm...
","Looks great...Great special effects..
It is a promising premise...Quite a confusing story...I think the protagonist narrating could have explained the story more clearly..It doesn't really develop that emotional connection you should have for the characters in the film..A let down by the end.",5,0,0,25 March 2020
Watchmen," OK
","Left underwhelmed. Not very engaging.6/10 = DI only recommend films that are a
7/10 - C or above.10 - A+9 - A8 - B7 - C6 - D",6,0,11,24 July 2019
Man of Steel," Average movie
",Just average. Not as good as the original Superman movie. Not lots of plot. Too much fight scenes. Not enough character development. Not that emotional connection to the characters.,5,1,8,23 April 2020
The Thing," Ok
","It's OK. Interesting premise, keeps you engaged for most of the film, although could have had a bit more narrative to keep you more engaged throughout.Suspenseful at times, but again could be a little more suspenseful throughout.Not the best alien Sci-Fi film. Ok.I'd rate it a 6 = D",6,0,2,24 March 2020

X-Men: Days of Future Past," Very good
",Very good. Really enjoyable. Engaging. Well done 20th Century Fox!,8,0,0,27 April 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Ok
","Too serious. Too much drama through most of the film mixed with action. It should be more fun, lighter, funny too. Aimed at teens and above, kids should be able to understand it. Spider-man coming in adds some lighter fun at least.",6,1,4,26 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Ok
","The usual serious drama superhero film from Disney aimed at teenagers and above. Should be more universal. I'd prefer it to have a lighter more fun tone to it, like Guardians of the Galaxy achieved for an ensemble cast of heroes.",6,2,9,26 April 2020
District 9," Great Sci-Fi
",Great Sci-Fi. Funny. Good plot. Action and adventure. Keeps you engaged. Very enjoyable.,8,1,1,25 March 2020

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Hmm
","Another serious drama superhero film from Disney aimed at teenagers and above. Should be lighter, fun and funny. Children should be able to watch and understand it, it's a Superhero flick! Should be more universal. Disappointing",5,1,3,26 April 2020
The Dark Knight," Good
","Good, engaging. Good series of Batman movies. Good action.",7,0,0,26 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Fantasy not Sci-Fi
","Yea it's more fantasy than sci-fi because it's about memories, and dreaming within them. It's unrealistic to be dreaming consciously within a memory. That's fantasy. I didn't buy that they could meet in such a random type of encounter. Maybe if they lived in the same building, worked together or something plausible then maybe. Didn't really engage me.",5,0,0,26 April 2020
There's Something About Mary," So funny!

","Good action film. Kevin Nolan seems to have opted for the dramatic action genre for his Superhero films. Quite long, but keeps you engaged.",7,1,1,6 April 2020
Iron Man," Ok
","Just ok. Not a very likeable protagonist. You don't develop that emotional connection for the characters. Heard it was funny, but it wasn't. Good effects. Story was a bit predictable. Average.",5,1,3,19 April 2020
Identity," Stupid...massively overated.
",Really stupid. How can you make all the personalities meet at once? Let alone make them kill each other? Ridiculous.,4,0,2,30 May 2020
Fantastic Four," Fantastic!
","This is a a really good action-adventure comedy. I have watched this countless times. It's definitely a rewatcher, like the Incredibles, the Jurassic Parks or Jumanji.The disfunctionality of the group is good to watch. Very underrated.",8,4,5,28 February 2018

","It's very slow, story is poor, again a very overrated film. Don't believe the high reviews. A let down.",4,1,3,7 October 2019
Alien: Covenant," Great follow up to Prometheus
",Great follow up. More of a linking movie to Prometheus than a direct follow up. More narrative is explained about mankind's origins in this film.Great Sci-Fi.,8,0,1,26 March 2020
