The Equalizer," An average action movie
","Nothing more than a 7/10.How many times did we see this scenario. One guy with AMAZING martial arts skills goes 1v100 against a whole Russian,Albanian mafia and kills them all.It is really packed with good action scenes and for the people who love action movies this is the real one for you. Denzel gave an amazing performance once again. But still, with these kind of movies, he will not make it in the top 250. Too much cliché in one movie.For a conclusion, if you love action movies this is the one for you. But if you don't love Action and so much cliché and unreal killing, please do not decide to watch this movie. There are plenty of other movies that deserve to be watched. :)",7,1,2,15 December 2014
Creed," Creed is the cherry on top for the whole Rocky franchise
","I still can't believe that I gave a 10 for this movie because I only gave 15 10's in 600 movies but this movie is so much more than an average boxing film. Creed does carry a great, phenomenal background story but it delivers every special moment that the whole franchise ever had. It just touched my heart because as a little boy I loved watching Rocky fighting. But the past Rocky movies weren't that good individually like this one. This isn't just a boxing movie and that is what I liked the most. It had a nice romantic moments. It had some many tensions. And it had a twist that I never expected. Creed was just unexpectedly phenomenal. I never thought that I would give a 10 for this movie but this 10 is for the whole Rocky franchise that made my childhood and Creed just summed it all up in an exceptional way.",10,1,4,25 December 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A pain to watch, Too much overrated...
","I do not get you people. What did you really see in this movie? I watched the trailer, watched the user reviews and the IMDb rating was also great. Those were the reasons to watch it. But in the middle of the movie I wanted it to end immediately. It was a real pain to watch it till the end. Nothing funny for a comedy and nothing good for a good movie. I trusted in this film because of Norton and Brody but I started cursing at the end and the IMDb rating is not the one that the really deserves. One of the most overrated rating on IMDb. Please, I recommend you all not to watch this.",6,6,11,15 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," An Amazing Hero with an Amazing and Powerful Romance
","I watched a lot of superhero movies and this one is in my top 3 along with The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. I see all the bad reviews saying bad things about spidey, about Andrew Garfield and comparing this to Twillight. I really do not get those people. Let me tell you why.Firstly because Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the role of Peter Parker and also does Emma Stone for Gwen Stacy. A real, honest love between these two characters. It is so powerful that I felt it when they look at each other, talk to each other and in every other romantic scene. I know you expect a great superhero movie with a lot of action, with a good villain but this movie is something more than just a superhero movie. This is a really great romance that in the end it almost made me cry. Another thing about this movie is that I really like the villain and Jamie Foxx was really good at being Electro. Not much action and battles between spiderman and Electro but that is what makes this superhero movie so special.And the last thing may contain a little spoiler(do not read it if you want to watch the movie for the 1st time). It has an really amazing twist at the very end when Gwen dies and like I said it almost made me cry. So I can not wait for the 3rd movie of this trilogy.",9,29,50,25 February 2015
Deadpool," One of the most unique films ever..
","Super, crazy, fun movie. It is just so unique. It made me laugh so much on the opening credits. I watched dozens of movies and I never laughed to a opening credit of a movie. Al tough the plot was cliché and predictable, the movie was so damn funny. A lot of great and smart jokes. That avocado joke made me laugh so hard. Not only the opening credits were funny but also after the ending credits we have a scene that was also funny. I was going to exit the cinema but the employee told me to stay and that it will be worth it. So I did and I laughed one more time and that scene convinced me that this movie is a comedy masterpiece. It is a definition of a comedy although it isn't a comedy genre.I watched it with my girlfriend on Valentines day and it was the best valentines day movie ever. Thank you deadpool for a great and fun time! I never expected that I would give a 10 to this kind of movie but Deadpool did really deserve it. And my last words: Best Marvel movie ever!",10,5,14,13 February 2016
The Godfather," Most overrated film along with Pulp Fiction. Nothing but average..
",I gave an 8/10 just because of the respect for the IMDb rating of the movie and for the year of the release also. I do not know what did you see in this movie. It is just an average crime story with no major actions. Just talk talk and talk. Nothing more than an average organized crime movie. It was so hard to watch. 3 hours of boredom. My head started to hurt me. I give respect for the acting. That is the best thing about this movie. Marlon Brando and his brilliant talent in acting. I had extremely high expectations for this movie but it disappointed me very much in the end. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. DO YOU people know how good is 'The Shawshank Redemption' compared to this. It does not deserve to be the second best movie on IMDb. It barely even deserves the top 250. 8 out of 10 just because of the respect for the year that this movie has been released. But today you have a dozen movies like this one or even better. Nothing more than an average organized crime story...,7,1,3,6 January 2015
