Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Fun, but not without flaws
","I'm not going to give you a scene-by-scene critique, just a few observations about this fun but flawed movie. It's been said that the second Sherlock movie lacks the witty banter of the first and is too frenzied for its own good, and I have to agree. The banter isn't terribly memorable and what little you get is jammed into action scenes that border on incomprehensible if not preposterous. The pace is breakneck, but I suspect it was necessary to cover up plot holes and distract viewers into not paying too close attention. The first movie was fast too, but not as frenzied and really allowed you to lose yourself in all the steam punk majesty of the art direction and score, which is evidence here as well. I just wish Ritchie would allow the audience to check out the details that are wasted on fast-cut flicks like this one.In the first movie, we were treated to some really funny, smart homo-erotic bromance scenes, but in this movie you get a tarted up Holmes in drag encouraging Watson to get on top of him. Oh, how droll. What seemed subversive in the first movie, just seems like shtick in the second.Then, we have poor Noomi Rapace (the original Lizbeth Salandar) who is completely wasted in the role of a gypsy fortune teller who rarely gets any lines.Yet despite these shortcomings I still enjoyed the movie as popcorn entertainment, and I'm likely to watch it again if only to catch some of the stuff that flew by so fast the first time.",7,1,2,23 January 2012
Inception," Outstanding but flawed
","I really looked forward to this movie, knowing that Nolan does wonders with high concepts. I wasn't disappointed in that regard. I found Inception to be highly engaging, fiercely intelligent, meticulously designed and superbly executed. I knock it one star because the emotional content is overwhelmed by the conceptual content. Leo and Marion certainly try hard to give the movie heart, but ultimately their relationship just doesn't feel real. That said, I think Hans Zimmer's score does an outstanding job at providing an emotional undercurrent to the action. In some ways, he's the most valuable player here after the writer/director himself. I'm deeply impressed with this movie, but I wish Nolan would've established the central relationship in a more concrete way before thrusting the viewer down the rabbit hole. I'm not sure there was an easy way to do that, but it might have helped.",9,0,1,26 July 2010
