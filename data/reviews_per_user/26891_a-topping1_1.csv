The Mask," Carrey at his best!
","A great mad-cap film full of laughs! Down on his luck guy finds mask that transforms him in to a superhero, sounds normal enough, doesn't it?! This film allows Jim Carrey to perform at his best, and he takes full advantage. He shows, I believe, why he is one of the best comedic actors around today, he seems to have no boundaries and is so full of energy he could make your head spin, but they're good things! This film also introduced the world to Cameron Diaz, and what an intro!! She doesn't really shine in this film, but as her first, was probably never expected to do so, she's a nice bit of eye candy for the guys, and I'm sure they don't mind! There are plenty of really funny moments and a bit of sentiment too, in all a great film!",8,0,0,16 April 2005
