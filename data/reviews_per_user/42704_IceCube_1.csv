Captain Phillips," Very exciting and very realistic, but not high-class.
","I went to the movie with some skepticism. Tom Hanks in tiny story. The film comes straight to the point, Captain Phillips at home, then off to the ship. Similarly, the pirates, their situation at home, then off to the sea. The tension is built up very good. A few security exercises on board and even the pirates are sighted for the first time. Tom Hanks certainly can not show his whole skill, because the film does not offer enough depth. But as a conservative principle faithful captain he comes across credible. The roles of the pirates are convincing. They seem quite realistic and are not really the bad guys. Very clearly is the hopelessness of the characters that sit between their bosses who sit on land likely to take most of the money , the supposed colleagues in the pirate crew and the starving family - it's like an emotional no man's land. The United States does not appear as heroes, you can see sometimes they are helpless too - a football field large aircraft carrier vs. small orange lifeboat. My Conclusion: Great film , because exciting and realistic, from time to time a few lengths, but the 130 minutes go by really fast.",7,2,3,13 November 2013
