Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not up to par
","Even in the year 1999, over 20 years after 'Star Wars', the special effects could not 'wow' me enough to buy into it the way I have for it's predecessors. Even so, it RELIED on those effects and had little else to offer. The scenes moved too fast, and it lacked any kind of depth. I didn't care about any of the characters, and that Jar Jar Binks was akin to fingernails on a blackboard. It looked like it was written in a week and thrown together only to make money, counting on the 'Star Wars' name to draw the audience in. But what then? I think the fans deserved better.",7,1,2,15 April 2000
United 93," Riveting and well acted
","Films that promote thought, discussion and change are the best films. I had chills watching and was completely fixed on the screen every second. For a movie that we all know the ending to, it was still one of the most dramatic I've seen.The acting was very believable, especially from the family members on the other end of the phone calls. It is exactly how any one of us would have reacted.That is what is so compelling about United 93. We can put ourselves in their shoes and know we would do and feel just the same. It connects us all on a human level.I don't think we need a movie to remind us of the events of that horrific day. But it doesn't hurt.",9,1,3,9 May 2006
Mulan," Entertainment for the whole family!
","What makes Mulan a great movie is not only the story, but the script and terrific songs written by the latest Disney lyricist David Zippel. Inspiring, touching and wonderful. Eddie Murphy steals the show with some of the funniest lines ever written and delivers them perfectly. We were all laughing out loud. And I'd forgotten how much I loved Donny Osmonds singing. (And the villains were so creepy looking too!) Animated or not, there should be more movies like Mulan...a film for the WHOLE family. 9/10",9,1,1,12 February 2000
Amistad," A Much Needed History Lesson
","A powerful and moving tale so gripping, that at times, one can forget it's only a movie. But is it? Knowing it was in fact an actual event, makes one weep for the brutal inhumanity to fellow man. Spielberg does what he does best directing another superb drama. Maybe one could nitpick at the acting, overacted by some, underacted by others, but that would be missing the bigger picture here. And the people playing the captured slaves weren't even actors! An emotional experience for anyone being able to put themselves in the shoes of those that had to suffer this humiliating, brutal existence. Films that teach us are truly the best films there are.",8,0,1,8 February 2000
The Usual Suspects," Modern masterpiece
","One of my all time favorites! Usual Suspects has a gripping plot, is well paced and has one of the best endings in filmdom. The cast is spectacular, the direction flawless, and what a story. At the risk of repeating myself, this is a truly great film that I could watch again and again. Sooo worth renting if not owning your own copy. Can I tell you I love it? I love it!",10,0,1,6 February 2000
Saw," Glad I Finally Took the Plunge
","I had been terrified to see this movie based on it's gore but, I was pleasantly surprised when it also had a nail biting storyline and some decent acting. Sure it was bloody, but it was cleverly done and I liked it much better than Se7en. The ending had me completely fooled! I love it when that happens. I'll never be afraid to see a movie again. ('It's only a movie') Thanks Mr. Wan!I must say, I am unhappy with IMDb's new minimum length for comments. I have written dozens of comments that are succinct and to the point, and hardly 4 lines. The above 6 was plenty, I thought. But it wouldn't 'go through.' Why force users to commit to 10 lines? Don't they realize most people read shorter comments than longer ones? Even in the newspaper. Keep this in mind when threatening punitive actions on faithful IMDb users. Yes 2 or 3 lines is too few, but let's not get carried away.",8,0,1,22 February 2006
The Untouchables," Good Not Great
","While the movie has some great scenes, they are few and far between enough for boredom to set in. But don't fear, Brian De Palma's trademark blood and guts (And yes even brains) should be enough to make you squirm. De Niro traditionally bulked up for his role, but doesn't seem to have his heart in it, as much as in other roles anyways. Costner plays Ness well, if Ness was in fact an unemotional stiff. Connery saves it from being unwatchable. Is also filmed in sepia tones, to give effect of 1930's. Only added to my declining interest. Basically, a 'guy's movie'. Women beware.",6,1,5,8 February 2000
Die Hard," Willis does what he does best
",An attention holding action movie with a pretty good plot. Bruce Willis has some of the best lines (that are also quite memorable) in what is in my opinion the best in the series.Have seen this movie sooo many times and just keep on watching it. Is a classic whether anyone cares to admit it or not. Have been in chat rooms where peeps can recite scenes and scenes of dialog verbatim! I give it a 9/10.,9,0,0,2 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," Interest holding suspense
","'Surprise Ending' was all I needed to hear to figure this movie out in the first 5 minutes. The clues were there and I saw them. I find it hard to believe that nary a soul even suspected what was going on, as the producers and director claim. Still, a very interesting drama that was well done. But anyone touting it as the 'greatest psychological thriller ever' has apparently never heard of Alfred Hitchcock.",8,0,0,15 April 2000
The Matrix," The stuff dreams are made of
","The great trailer for this one got me there, and it didn't disappoint. Eye candy at its finest. If you're thinking of waiting for this one on video...don't. It really should be seen in the theatre. In fact, I hope that it is re-released someday just to have the experience again. But most likely it will change how films are made and other great 'matrix' like movies will come along. Great effects, great soundtrack, great everything. It's not your father's Oldsmoblie.Don't be too hard on Keanu...he was born to play this role. Would have given it a 10 but not for that goofy ending.",9,0,0,9 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," The Emperor has no clothes
","Having seen thousands and thousands of films in my life, I am slightly insulted at the theory that to not like this film is to not understand this film. This is simply not the case. I understood the film, and the introspective story it tells. It is trying to be bigger than it is. I go to the movies to be entertained. I don't mind thinking, but I don't think we need to think that much. The pace was too slow in any event. Would have made a better mini-series on television.",6,0,0,20 February 1999
