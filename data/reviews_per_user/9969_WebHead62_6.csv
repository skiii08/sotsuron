The Avengers," Fun and well acted
","Going into this movie I was afraid there would be no plot and mindless action, and the characters wouldn't have enough screen time because there were too many. Surprise surprise the plot was pretty non existent, but that didn't really stop this movie from being a lot of fun. I give most of the credit to the actors. If you care about the people you are watching you will automatically enjoy the movie more. Every single character in this movie is played to perfection by their actor or actress which makes you care about the characters which helps make up for the lack of plot because lets be honest, the entire movie takes place on a flying aircraft carrier with the superheroes arguing with each other just waiting for the big finale in New York. Mark Ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the CGI hulk was pretty bad ass. Tom Hiddleston is an awesome Loki. He's not as good as he was in Thor, but I'm not sure that was even possible. Even supporting actors like Clark Gregg who plays Colston plays his part perfect. It could have been better. It's predictable and maybe the first hour is a little slow, but it's funny, well acted, and the action scenes are great so its worth a watch.",9,2,4,14 December 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," For Fans of the Book
","Finally Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play their characters almost perfectly, and they're not the only ones. Billy Burke who has always been good has some great moments with Kristen. They seem to know their characters so well by now and it's wonderful to finally see. The much talked about sex scene was very sweet and romantic, the birthing scene was not as gruesome as I'd have liked it to be, but Kristen's performance in it was great.I felt her pain. Robert is also great in that scene. Vampires can't cry, but you can feel his loss. Taylor doesn't really bring anything to the movie. He pretty much walks around sulking throughout the movie. The only part I have a problem with is when Jacob separates himself from the pack. I felt like I entered a cartoon movie with their booming voices. It worked in the book, but in the movie they probably should have been human for that scene. The movie was definitely not rushed, and I can understand how someone who doesn't like twilight that much would find it boring and too long, but for hardcore twihards this is a pretty perfect adaptation of the first part of the novel.",6,0,6,5 June 2012
Avengers: Endgame," Terrible Ending to a 22 movie Arc
","I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU 'isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?' Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line' to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to.",1,451,811,3 June 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Nice Trip Back to Middle Earth
","I was 15 when return of the king came out and have been waiting 9 years for Peter Jackson to take us back to Middle Earth in The Hobbit. It's finally here and it doesn't disappoint. I had my doubts when I heard that Jackson was going to make three movies out of one book. I was worried it would get kind of slow and possibly boring. It is very long and slow in some parts, but never boring. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo and all the cast members from the lord of the rings slip back into their characters like there hasn't been a decade between movies. The best scene is between Bilbo and Gollum. I won't spoil it for those who didn't read the book or see the movie yet, but it was great. It was almost exactly like the book and that's what you hope for when there are three movies for one book. For most people it was probably too long for 1/3 of a book, but if you love lord of the rings and being immersed into that world then there can never be too much of it. The one scene they could have cut out was the rock fight. You'll know what I mean when you see it.",7,3,10,28 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Was this George's plan all along?
","George Lucas is truly a genius. After seeing The Last Jedi I will never again mock Lucas' vision for Star Wars. I will watch the prequel trilogy with a new appreciation. I won't roll my eyes at the lame humor, or laugh at the horrible acting, or mock the bad CGI and Jar Jar Binks (okay, I'll probably still do that). The Last Jedi has done what I believed to be impossible. It made me long for another George Lucas Star Wars movie. Right now I would give almost anything for his version of episodes 7,8, and 9. I can't help but think this was George Lucas' hope from the start. He somehow knew the only way to win back the fans (and make a quick buck) was to have someone else ruin Star Wars worse than he ever did. And that is exactly what happened. Now George will be remembered as the hero, and Disney will be remembered as the villain who gave us The Last Jedi, aka the worst Star Wars movie of the bunch (and there are some clunkers in that bunch). On a more serious note, TLJ is truly a dreadful movie. It sucks out any of the magic that was left over from The Force Awakens, and left me feeling indifferent about Episode IX, which is something I never thought I could feel about a Star Wars movie. When the Force Awakens came out I did not enjoy it as much as other people seemed to, mainly because I hated the way the movie destroyed everything won in the original trilogy. No one else I talked to seemed to notice this because the movie WAS fun, and exciting, and it was Star Wars again dammit, who cares if (spoilers) Han Solo was killed by his own son, and Luke was off on some island doing nothing? Star Wars was back! Well, it's back again, but this time the movie lacks all of the fun, humor, and mystery of The Force Awakens and it is hard not to notice how atrocious this movie treats the Star Wars lore, mythology, and most especially Luke Skywalker's character. Staying true to it's predecessor, TLJ continues destroying the original trilogy one scene at a time. Luke might as well be a new character, Chewie and R2 are in about four scenes total, the force is used in ways that are questionable at best, laughable at worst, and I'm left wishing Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill never agreed to be in these movies. But TLJ does not just ruin everything about the original trilogy, it also ruins everything good about The Force Awakens. Instead of building off of the foundation the first movie created, Rian Johnson (who is somehow getting his own Star Wars trilogy after this mess) decided to take a bulldozer to it. If you had any questions after watching TFA, you will probably be disappointed by something in TLJ. Legitimate plot points have been glossed over, or literally tossed aside as if Disney were mocking their own audience's anticipation. This is mostly done for the sake of shock value, and while there was at least one scene that was genuinely surprising, it just rings hollow because this movie gives us no reason to care about anything. Where is the heart? The plot of the movie is nonexistent, and the 'new trio' we all liked in TFA is split up for 90% of the film. Finn's character, who had such promise, is wasted in a pointless story-line and paired with an unnecessary character. Poe, who seems more and more one dimensional, is pitted against another unnecessary character (Are you seeing a pattern here?). Even Rey does little more than chase Luke around on an island for most of the movie. Rian Johnson seems much more interested in Kylo Ren than any of the heroes. He does his best to make Kylo sympathetic, but it's too little too late. The scenes between him and Rey come across more comedic than anything else, and in the end the story-line turns out to be just another wasted opportunity to explore something interesting. But you would think there must be something interesting in a 2.5 hour movie, right? Wrong. The movie could have been under an hour once all of the pointless scenes were cut. Why this movie was aloud to be so long is beyond me.To sum this all up, I can no longer feel anything but fear when I think about all of the future Star Wars movies Disney is making, and I really wish George Lucas never sold his creation. In a heartbeat I would go back to the days when all we complained about was who shot first, and why the 'yub nub' ewok song was taken out and Hayden Christensen was put in. Most of all I want to go back to a time when The Last Jedi movie did not exist.",1,94,145,24 December 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Overrated
","This is by far the worst of the three movies in one of the most overrated trilogies ever. The first two were very good but lets not go crazy people. There is no way these movies deserved to be in the discussion for a best picture nomination or to get a supporting actor win for that matter! (Heath was good, but he played a completely crazy guy with no motive or character development). They were good comic book movies. Yes that's right they are comic book movies. They are not based in reality or a step above many other comic book movies. People just think they are. On that note lets discuss the decent at best Dark Knight Rises. After this movies big pointless opening scene I knew I was going to regret buying my ticket. Christian Bale's voice is terrible and unintentionally funny as usual but this time we get a villain that we also cannot understand. The best way to describe the plot to this movie is stupid. The walking on the ice, getting healed and jumping across the ledge, robin, the way bane is killed, the worst death scene ever (you know who I mean), and the ending. It's all stupid. Another thing about this movie is batman just shows up out of no where to talk to people. How the heck does he know where all these people are going to be? A lot of this plot doesn't make sense or is predictable. I don't hate this movie. I hate how good everyone else thinks it is. It was a decent comic book movie that's it. Nothing more nothing less.",3,4,9,10 December 2012
