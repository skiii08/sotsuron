Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie SUCKS!!
","I really tried to like this movie, but it's hard to like crap! I don't know what people see in these kill bill movies? These movies are bad! They are know where near realistic! My imagination can only bend so far! If this was animation, then it wouldn't be a problem. Come on -punching out of a coffin and digging your way out of the ground?! And how many times will they not kill her when they have the chance, just so she can magically survive and kill them?! These movies are insane. I hate this crap!! Again, if this were a comedy I would give it a higher score, but since it is not then it gets a 3/10 (only because I did laugh). I didn't like Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2 is not better.",3,1,5,8 October 2004
Antz," Cool movie.
","This movie was pretty cool.  It starts off cool and it ended cool.  The story was fun and the 2 singing scenes they had during the movie weren't annoying!!  A good movie to watch with the kids on a nice, cool, summer night.",9,0,0,5 November 2000
Blade," This movie ROCKS!!!
","This is a great movie.  The best vampire movie I've seen since the Lost Boys.  Blade is played great by Wesley Snipes!!  Once again, vampires are cool.  After this movie, you either what to be a vampire or go out to kill them.  This movie is a must see!!",8,0,1,5 November 2000
Snatch," This is not a porn!
","This movie is great.  It's full of lies, stealing, murder, and comedy! This movie is about nothing, but at the same time; everything.  Brad Pitt's character is freaking awesome!!  This film is very funny in a britishly smart way.  It's a must buy!!",10,0,1,23 February 2002
The Fast and the Furious," I don't understand why people love this movie.
","I've tried.  Oh man, I've tried.  I just can't help but not like this movie. It's just not good.  Maybe it's me.  Okay, the cars were cool, but the rest of the movie was just bad.  There's no way to look at it.  If you love cars (or Vin Diesel) then you will love this movie.  But, if you love a good movie with substance, then stay away from this movie no matter how many people tell you it's great.",3,1,3,7 August 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Don't believe the hype!
","Was this movie suppose to be good or even taken seriously?  This was not a good movie.  The worst thing about it was the plot, which sucks to high hell.  I haven't seen trash like this sense the early 90's.  This movie has action and some drama, but it's all so predictable.  Don't expect to be surprised.  I feel so sorry for Rodriguez for doing to film.  She's a pretty good, but she's had much better parts than this.  So, if you like movies about people fighting over who as the fastest car, car stunts (computerized car stunts), and a 'Point Break' story line, then you will love this.  For the people out there who want something fresh and exciting, stay away from this garbage.  So many people told me this was their favorite movie.  What have they been watching?!",3,0,1,15 October 2002
Resident Evil," Best video game to movie so far.
","I'm going to get to the point on this one.  This was a good movie.  But if you're a fan of the video game and you're one of those nic-pick and this and that, than just stay away from this one.  The truth is that NO MOVIE WILL EVER BE LIKE THE VIDEO GAME!!!  Resident Evil movie is the video game like X-Men movie is to comic.  If you're a fan than take this movie for what it is:  a movie.  Save that 'that can't happen' or 'that's not the way it is in the video game' for your friends who care.",8,0,0,25 July 2002
The Transporter," It's an okay movie.
","The Transporter is pretty good.  This movie as action and a good bit of comedy.  It's almost like watching a b-movie with a better budget.  It's not anything too special, but it's worth a watch.  There's an all right plot and enough action to keep you entertained.  It's fun to watch and I enjoyed it. I give it a 7/10.",7,0,0,18 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great Movie!!
","This movie is great!!  I don't have the words . . . Beautiful, just beautiful.  All I can say is, 'Go see the movie now.  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the best movie of 2002.'  I can't wait to see the final movie.",10,0,0,1 January 2003
Ghostbusters," This movie was pretty cool for it's time.
","Ghostbusters was a pretty good movie back in it's day.  It had an original story, lots of comedians, and a cool soundtrack.  This movie is still good, but a little outdated.  The only thing going for this movie is it's original story.  But, it's worth seeing at least once.",7,2,3,5 November 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Disappointing! Don't believe the hype!!
","I'm going to get to the point: Kill Bill is a let down.  I heard & read great things about this movie, so I was very disappointed while watching it. The story is nothing special.  Lady wants revenge on the people who ruined her life.  But, the story isn't the problem.  No, the problem with this movie is the same thing that the hype is about; the action!  Bottom line: the ACTION SUCKS!!  I've seen a lot of action movies (I love japanese samurai & chinese kung fu movies) and Kill Bill is not great!  Hell, is barely good!  Everything is so exaggerated!!  The action gets so bad that its laughable.  While watching Kill Bill, I would say to myself, 'This is so ridiculous!  It's like watching a bad samurai anime!'  The best part about the movie was the anime part.  That was tight!  I could watch that part over and over.  I don't know what people see in Kill Bill.  Maybe there are millions of people who're just ignorant to the fact that thousands of movies like Kill Bill are out there, that have the same kind of story & action, but do it a hell of a lot better.  If you like Kill Bill, then you are in the majority.  But, for those out there who have seen lots of martial art movies, Kill Bill is a nice movie to make fun of!! Score: 6/10.  Not terrible, just not good neither!",6,1,6,18 July 2004
Saw," If you like Se7en, then you will like Saw.
","I liked this movie. I enjoyed the story, acting, and the suspense. This movie is like Se7en, because its about a psycho who chooses people that are involved in one vice or another and tricks them into killing themselves or others; leaving them messed up for life and maybe better off dead. The main gripe I have about the movie is the Killer's reasons for choosing his victims was pretty weak. But, this lack of a decent reason for the complicated design for madness the Killer put his victims through, also made the killer more interesting, mysterious, increased the belief that any average ordinary person could be next. I was surprised about the ending. It is the reason why this movie got a 7 instead of a 6. I went to see this movie hoping to be disturbed. I didn't get disturbed, but I was entertained. Saw should be seen at least once by all (except children).",7,0,0,8 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," This movie was surprisely good!
","Let me start off with, I don't know jack about Harry Potter!  I went into this movie thinking, 'It is just a kids movie, so what's the fuss all about?!'  It wasn't what I expected.  There were lots of kids in the theater, but this is not your everyday kid movie.  This movie was pretty cool and if you don't know anything about Harry Potter, you will.  This is a serious movie (no useless dancing or singing just because they can * cough * disney).  Harry Potter is also long, so make sure you go to the restroom before it starts.",9,0,0,19 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Lots of action!
","Reloaded is a cool movie.  There's a ton of action, cool characters, and the plot was a little bit hard to understand (for me).  I talked with a few friends who thought the story dragged on and was dull, but if you like movies that go over your head the first few times you watch it, like I do, then this is for you.  If you just like action movies, then go see X-Men 2, but if you want a story that's out of the ordinary then go see The Matrix Reloaded.",8,0,0,18 May 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautiful, absolutely Beautiful!!
",This movie is the bomb!!  Great Movie!!  I don't have enough thumbs to recommend the Shawshank!!  Great actors in a great story.  This is a great movie to sit back with your girlfriend and just chill out.  It's just superb.  A must have in anyone's video collection!!,9,0,0,5 November 2000
The Breakfast Club," This is one of the best movies to come out of the 80's!!
","If you like 80's movies, then you've hit the jackpot this The Breakfast Club!  If you grow up in the 80's, you can figure out what find of person you were in the junior high or high school.  It's a pretty serious movie, but it's also a lot of fun.  This movie is a collector!!",10,0,1,5 November 2000
