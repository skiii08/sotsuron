Love and Death," The title says it all
","Two of Woody Allen's favorite topics makes up the title of the last film of his 'screwball' phase.  'Love and Death' is basically the assassination plot of 'Sleeper,' only this one is set during the Napoleonic wars as opposed to the year 2173.  The sets and costumes are elaborate but this is still the wisecracking, slapstick Woody Allen from Bananas and Sleeper.  The relationship between Woody and Diane Keaton in this movie seems a bit like a precursor to the in-love, out-of-love relationship they forged in Annie Hall two years later.  The movie is entertaining and a nice cap to the first period of his long career, although the first half is more quickly paced and funnier than the second.",Null,0,0,25 November 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Speechless
","Like others, I walked out of the theater speechless and my emotions were tangled up.  This is the finest 'anti-drug' film I have ever seen.  What makes it great is that it shows, in graphic detail, the effects of drugs, on the mind, body and spirit.  And it does so without getting preachy.  The cinematography was a bit unnerving at first, but crucial to the film's message.  Like the last great movie about drug users ('Drugstore Cowboy'), it is an exciting independent film that does not glamorize its subject, and its final minutes are actually optimistic (I kept waiting for 'Spring'). Could be the best of the year.",Null,0,0,1 November 2000
Spartacus," Gladiator 1960
","Fans of Gladiator really owe it to themselves to see this movie, which is not one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces (at least in my opinion), but still rousing entertainment.  The differences between the two movies are clear:  Spartacus features no posturing by its leading man; no computerized effects; and a script which is a lot more intelligent and has a sly sense of humor (Gladiator just took itself so damn seriously!)  Kubrick came on board after the movie started shooting, and did not have final say in the product (this was Kirk Douglas' baby).  So it doesn't really FEEL like a Kubrick film.  However, movie fans should see it, and on a big screen if they can.",Null,0,1,24 August 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick lets his hair down
","Anyone who thought that Stanley Kubrick was a cold and humorless director needs to watch this movie again.  All that's missing from the wild plot is a pie fight (which apparently was shot for the end of the film but cut from the final product---perhaps it exists somewhere).  Some of the situational humor seems dated (the Cold War paranoia) however the movie remains a comedy classic because of its characters.  Sterling Hayden's General Ripper is a screwball version of the Gunnery Sergeant in Full Metal Jacket.  Slim Pickens' 'riding the bomb' is a sequence for the movie time capsule.  And of course Peter Sellers--all three of his characters are comic masterpieces, demonstrating his ability for playing deadpan comedy and broad slapstick. Easily one of the funniest movies of all time.",Null,0,0,10 September 2001
Barry Lyndon," A Work of Art
","Barry Lyndon, perhaps more than any other Stanley Kubrick film, is more of a work of art than a motion picture.  Kubrick was arguably one of the masters of the cinematic art form, however this particular movie is more like an exquisite still painting.  In fact, if you are lucky enough to own the recent digital transfer of this movie, you can freeze-frame any scene of the movie for proof of this--whether it's a great landscape or a more intimate scene of human interaction, the stills are breathtaking.  The story contains a lot of passion, despite Kubrick's trademark stand-offish characterizations.  Ryan O'Neal's performance seems to get better with age (who would have thought that?)  The three hours never drag.  This is definitely one of Kubrick's best, and most underrated, films.",10,2,4,22 August 2001
Full Metal Jacket," A different kind of Vietnam film
","Stanley Kubrick's second war movie is divided into two parts.  At first, I thought the Paris Island segment was more engrossing.  It contains intense acting by R. Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio, who play a memorable game of 'mental chess'.  The Vietnam segment originally bothered me because it seemed so stagy.  (It was filmed on London sound stages).  And I thought Matthew Modine was pretty unconvincing. I didn't care for this movie when I first saw it.  I preferred Platoon, like many other audiences.  But it is interesting that I yearned to see it again after a few years, yet I really have no desire to see Platoon again.  The same can be said about the two big Vietnam pictures of the '70s:  Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter.  As much as I liked The Deer Hunter, it was more of a statement about the war and a human drama than a work-of-art.  Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket are works of visionary filmmakers and have stood the test of time.  I now believe that the second half is better, despite my original feelings.  Like Coppola's film, it has a surreal quality and its images (Cowboy's death, the background fires, helicopter sequence) are unforgettable. And Matthew Modine's performance grew on me.  Another 'one misunderstood, now legendary' late Kubrick film.",Null,0,0,16 January 2002
The Shining," Once misunderstood...now a classic
","Like many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, The Shining was misunderstood when first released.  I remember hearing about it when it came out in the summer of 1980, and how fans of Stephen King's novel were disappointed with the film version.  King himself has been outspoken about it--he hates it. So much in fact that he filmed his own version in 1997, (a made for TV movie with Steven Weber).  But this is Kubrick's film, not King's film, and it remains one of the most intense horror films I've ever seen.  The film has a terrific build-up and Kubrick's touches (the music, the sound effects, the 'date and time' title cards, etc.) add to the experience.  It is not a film for viewers who love quickly-paced slasher movies.  The horror comes from the build up and the atmosphere.  There is little bloodshed (except for Mr. Halloran's demise--a scene Kubrick put in the film to compete with Friday the 13th, perhaps?) What the viewer remembers most about the film is not the hammy acting by Jack Nicholson (his performances in his later hits like The Witches of Eastwick, Batman, A Few Good Men, and even As Good as It Gets can be traced back to his portrayal of Jack Torrance), not the much-maligned but brave performance of Shelley Duvall, and not even Kubrick's now-legendary camerawork behind Danny's Big Wheel.  They remember the Overlook Hotel, arguably the most eerie setting in the history of horror cinema.  I still avoid hotel rooms numbered 237 because of this movie.  King's 'approved' TV version just pales in comparison.  And how can Steven Weber even attempt to play Torrance when Jack Nicholson will always be Jack Torrance?  This is one of my favorite horror movies, and one of Kubrick's greatest works.",Null,1,1,16 January 2002
American Beauty," Still great
","When this movie came out, I wrote on 9/22/99 the following: 'American Beauty may well be the last great film of the century, and this is perfectly fitting. The film, on the surface, examines a dysfunctional family in a 'perfect' suburban environment.  But the film actually wants us to look at ourselves.  Things need to change.  We need to change.  Or we will become 'plastic' or 'sedated' like Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey's characters. The movie is about the dehumanizing effects of 1) repressing feelings and 2) pretending that everything's 'spectacular.'  The only 'real' characters were the daughter (Thora Birch) and the guy next door with his camera.  And they're constantly branded in this film as being 'weird' or a 'psycho.'  The movie really impacted me to the point of actually developing a different outlook on life.  It's that good.  The ending is perfect.  The film borrows from other movie sources like 'The Ice Storm,' 'Happiness,' 'Ordinary People' and even 'It's a Wonderful Life' and creates something wholly unique, funny and extraordinary.  I doubt I'll see a better film this year.'Well, over two years later, after everything that has happened since September 1999, the film still works.  Although the romantic side of me wanted to change my life like Lester Burnham after watching this, thepragmatic side of me said 'be careful.'  But it's alright to fantasize, and live vicariously through Lester Burnham (who did pay a price for his 'freedom,' of course).  This film, which closed the '90s, and 'Joe Versus the Volcano,' a tremendously underrated movie that opened the decade, actually work as bookends for me.  The films have many similarities, despite their tones (dark and cynical for American Beauty and light and romantic for Joe). Both are about unhappy men who find comfort in death (or dying, in the case of Joe).  Lester and Joe both take extreme steps to improve their 'situations,' and watching their stories unfold on film continues to give me great pleasure, even after the 10th viewings.  Both films are lyrical and quite beautiful, and both require the viewer to 'look closer' (to borrow American Beauty's tagline).  This is especially the case for Joe Vs. the Volcano, which has been trashed as a 'silly trifle' by many but is just as deep as American Beauty if you do 'look closer.'",Null,0,0,15 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," Another ride down Lynch highway
","Lost Highway runs into Mulholland Drive:  This movie is just as ambiguous, frustrating, and occasionally hypnotic as Lost Highway, which was one of the few films I've seen that I could not talk about without seeing again.  The same may apply to Mulholland Drive.  Is a movie successful if you have to see it twice to 'get it?'  There is a lot more humor in the new film, and it doesn't seem to be as hard on its female characters (relatively speaking, of course, as this is a David Lynch movie).  I suppose this is one of those movies that can be interpreted on many different levels.  I found myself squirming by the final half hour yet I could not stop thinking about it for the next several hours.  And that haunting soundtrack is staying with me. Recommended?  Not sure....I need to get the strength up to see it again (which may take a few years).",Null,0,0,27 September 2001
Annie Hall," Phase II Begins
","Annie Hall marked the second phase of Woody Allen's career, and today remains his most accessible movie for non-fans.  It seems to be a favorite for movie lovers only.  When I ask friends and people I work with whether they've seen this movie, most say 'no,' and then talk about what an original, great romantic comedy 'When Harry Met Sally' is.  I shake my head in disbelief and walk away....how can you argue with someone who says that? I had an instant disliking to 'When Harry Met Sally' because it was TOO MUCH like Annie Hall (and other Allen films).  Even the opening credits smacked of Woody Allen.  Since Rob Reiner is a talented director, I'm sure he made the film as a Woody Allen homage, but don't tell WHMS fans this. So much has been said about Annie Hall by others on this site, and the general MOVIE LOVING public in general, that I don't need to repeat any comments.  The film is still hilarious and what Alvy Singer and Annie Hall go through seems real, despite some surreal touches in the film. Allen's method of breaking the ice on a first date by asking Annie for a kiss so they can 'digest their food' is absolutely genius, and I'm sure other Allen fans have tried this on their first dates.  I haven't tried it myself, because I assume (perhaps incorrectly--see my aforementioned thoughts) my date has seen this movie. The film is a timeless masterpiece and ranks second on my list of favorite Woody Allen films.",Null,0,0,12 January 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," #49???
","As of 8/22/01, this film is ranked #49 in the IMD Top 250 list.  As much as I enjoyed Star Wars as a kid, I really have no desire to watch it again. 2001, on the other hand, I could watch every year (and actually have, since 1987).  The most fascinating thing about this movie is how it still sparks lively discussion and debate for everyone who watches it.  It is impossible not to discuss afterwards.  Spielberg tried to mimic this with his adaptation of A.I., and succeeded to a lesser degree.  This is a film in movements, and watching the newly restored DVD, I was somehow able to transport myself back to 1968 and watch the film from a new perspective. The new DVD even has the 'intermission' intact.  If you don't have the new DVD, get thy to a video store TODAY.",Null,0,3,22 August 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Perverse Pleasures
","What can be said about A Clockwork Orange that hasn't already been said? Any movie made before 'Jaws' that inspires a tee shirt must have some impact on culture.  Like all of Stanley Kubrick's films, this one seems to get better with age.  What I like most with this film is its irony, with the classical music backing the brutal images on screen.  I've seen the film many times now and other people I've seen it with are offended by it...this was the first film that polarized his audience.  I believe it is Kubrick's masterpiece, and I never get tired of viewing it.",Null,0,0,22 August 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Captivating
","Stanley Kubrick's final movie should not be judged against other domestic dramas or thrillers.  It must be compared to his previous films, and you must also take into consideration Kubrick himself.  He must not have been well while he made it, and he left behind, a few months after his death, a film that many have called 'unfinished.'  (Perhaps he meant to put some different music over the 'piano piece' that is remembered by most people who've seen this movie). The film is like a dream; not much of the central orgy passage makes sense in relation to the events before or after it, but the film is gripping nonetheless.  It is basically about what lack of communication between two people can do to a marriage, or in the case of Tom Cruise's character, one's sanity.  His 'odyssey' that leads to the Long Island mansion is the result of what happens when a husband takes a wrong turn, and acts on pure impulse, after an argument with this wife and turning off his emotions, when he should have been upfront with them.  Much has been said about the central orgy sequence, which for me recalled The Wicker Man (a movie that also featured a stranger infiltrating a cult-like event, with participants in eerie masks and costumes, with tragic consequences).  The final irony of this misunderstood film, though, comes from Nicole Kidman's last line in the movie.  The final line in the final Kubrick film is nearly as memorable as the film itself, and darkly funny to boot. Give this movie a few years, and it will be re-evaluated and designated a masterpiece, like many of Kubrick's films from 2001 to The Shining.",10,0,1,17 April 2002
Titanic," What's Going On?
","I feel compelled to be the 900th or so person who's probably commenting on this movie.  Right now, this movie is about as popular as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack was in 1981, and to this I say:  Hogwash.  No one seemed to mind in 1997, when people were lining up to see this movie three or four times.  Now the same people are trashing it.  Urgh.  But it doesn't surprise me.  When it comes to movies, we tend to get brainwashed by other movielovers and critics, and if they imply 'we made a mistake--this movie is really awful,' we tend to believe it. I watched Titanic in its entirety again the other day and I must go against the current grain and say that it is a great movie (or should I say, still a great movie).  People who have not seen this movie on a large screen cannot say that they've seen this movie.  Period.  So go away.  I will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad (and the movie did not pick up any Oscars in the acting category).  James Cameron may be an arrogant jerk. And the screenplay is corny.  But the sheer awesomeness of the film is what I remembered when I saw it on the big screen in 1997.  Cameron, despite his personal faults, took us on that doomed luxury liner, literally transporting us back to 1912.  Yes, it could be argued that movies like 'A Night to Remember' were better examinations of Titanic's final hours, and IMAX productions like Titanica had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic.  But Cameron's 'kitchen sink' approach to telling the story, which includes a trite but still rather sweet fictional love story,is what captivated audiences in 1997.  Give this movie twenty years.  People will rediscover its magic after the predictable backlash has worn off.  Hey, even Alice Cooper is admitting today that Saturday Night Fever is a great album.",Null,2,4,17 March 2002
Mystic River," Somehand please hand me a revolver
","I just would not know whether to use it on myself, or on the characters on the screen.  This movie is awful.  It is poorly written, badly acted and unbelievable from the get-go.  It seems that our friends in South America may agree with me, based on some of the comments I've read.  I really wanted to like this movie--some of the best reviews of the year, I think Tim Robbins is great, I enjoy most of Clint Eastwood's films as director (with the exception of another overrated pile of rubbish, Unforgiven).  POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  Sean Penn and Robbins' characters are supposed to be as close as brothers, so the finale by the river was just not believable.  And what exactly was Laura Linney's character cause for her sudden amount of hatred towards Robbins' character?  The inclusion of Kevin Bacon's and Lawrence Fishburn's characters were distractions, at best, and did not do anything for the story.  Now I have no problems with downbeat movies that require an amount of thinking by the viewers (examples of recent movies in this category that I really enjoyed are Requiem for a Dream, The Ice Storm, and Happiness).  But I don't enjoy movies that shamelessly manipulate the audience into caring about characters with no appealing attributes and are unconvincingly portrayed and caricatures at best.  The 'great' acting in this movie consists of the actors breaking down in tears every five minutes or so.  And the Boston accents--just ridiculous.  Especially Laura Linney's. So I'll close this by saying that, on the plus side, the direction is rather good (although I still prefer the understated direction Eastwood used in his recent movies like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and older ones like Play Misty for Me). I still have a lot of respect for the actors, despite their performances in this movie--but I'd like to see Sean Penn get nominated for something totally out of character for him (heck, I preferred him in I Am Sam over this).  Save your money.",2,1,2,17 December 2003
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Influence Part III
","Paths of Glory is Kubrick's third 'official' movie (his first two 'unofficial works,' Day of the Fight and Fear and Desire are sadly unavailable on video or DVD), and it is one of the greatest war movies I've ever seen.  Later movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, The Deer Hunter and Kubrick's own Full Metal Jacket, are regarded as being 'anti-war' movies, while Paths of Glory is a full-blooded war movie, as we don't see how the war affects the outside lives of the protagonists.  The film is a heartbreaking account of the hypocrisies that exist in any war, and the fact that the American actors are playing French soldiers really doesn't matter (Kubrick did not allow his actors to sport fake French accents, and thank God for that). Kirk Douglas gives one of his great performances in a rare (for Kubrick) sympathetic hero role.  As the three doomed soldiers, Timothy Carey (who played a hateful criminal in 'The Killing') and Joseph Turkel (who would later show up in The Shining as Lloyd the bartender) are especially memorable, each displaying a different set of emotions (sorrow or anger) when they realize their hopeless fates.  And the film's climactic bar room sequence manages to be chilling and very sad at the same time.  An absolute must-see.",Null,0,0,14 November 2001
Sweet and Lowdown," Proof that Sean Penn can really act
","The two movies that come to mind when I think about Sean Penn and his acting ability are not Mystic River and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. They are Carlito's Way and Sweet & Lowdown. In both of these movies, he immerses himself in the characters, while in most of his other movies, including the art house hits like 21 Grams and Hurly Burly, he plays more or less the same type of person. Sweet and Lowdown has Penn playing a self-absorbed classical guitarist who obsesses over a world-renowned guitarist much in the way Woody Allen obsesses over things in his other movies. Woody himself shows up as a commentator (this, like Zelig, is presented in mock documentary fashion). It is amusing, if slight (and a sign of things to come in 2000-2002, with Small Time Crooks, Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending). Samantha Morton won a justified Oscar nomination, but Uma Thurman and Gretchen Mol are wasted (Uma got second billing over Sean Penn, and is hardly in the movie!) Not a Woody Allen masterpiece, but fans could do worse.",Null,19,30,9 September 2004
