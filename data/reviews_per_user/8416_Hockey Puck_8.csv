Gremlins," 12:40 AM
",'Don't feed them after Midnight!' The movie Gremlins will keep your eyes glued to the Television set. Rand Peltzer purchases Gizmo in China Town. Two rules are broken in this movie 1. Never put water on Gizmo (that made Gizmo multiply) and 2. Never feed the Gremlins after midnight (that created the Gremlins). Gizmo did not get fed after midnight so he remained the same. Because these rules are broken the Gremlins are terrorizing the town (and at Christmas too). One night all of the Gremlins decide to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and that's when Billy sets the Theater on fire. Every Gremlin was killed except for the leader (who is later killed after looking at Sunlight). I liked this film because it combines computer animation with real life. There is also a lot of action in the movie and that is what keeps my eyes glued to the T.V.,Null,1,3,30 June 2001
Antz," Vary well done
",I think that Antz does a remarkable job in telling you about struggle and paradise. It shows just how visious struggling can get (it causes wars). After the war everybody is dead and it shows the Z (main character) holding Barbatos' head (his body was lost but his head was alive but Barbatos soon dies). Then it shows paradise 'insectopia' which every ant dreams of. Everything there is happy. Z has struggles of his own with General Mandible. Z falls in love with Princess Bala who was supposed to marry General Mandible. Mandible hates Z and all the other 'worker ants' and wants to kill all of them. I think that this movie does a great job using computer animation at the end of this movie. It show all of the worker ants getting together and making an ant ladder and escaping through the top of the anthole. Luckily for Z and the rest of the worker ants Colonel Cutter turns from bad to good and stops General Mandible from causing the ant ladder to collapse and kill all of the worker ants. I like to watch this movie because it is an adultlike cartoon movie!,Null,0,0,8 June 2001
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Better than Space Jam
",I have seen both Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Space Jam and I can say that Who Framed Roger Rabbit is Space Jams 'Big Brother' in movie ratings. Sure Space Jam is a good movie for kids but Who Framed Roger Rabbit is good for kids and also it is more of the adult kind of movie as well. I also think that Who Framed Roger Rabbit has a better story line. In Space Jam they just base a basketball game on saving the day. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit it is more original; Eddie Valiant defeats the enemy and 'saves the day'. I would 'highly' rate Who Framed Roger Rabbit over Space Jam.,10,0,0,12 March 2001
American Beauty," Clearly Unusual
","I knew that American Beauty would be unusual when it showed Lester Burnham (dad, main character- played by Kevin Spacey) gratifying himself in the shower. The thing that I did not like and or agree with in this movie is the fact that Lester didn't get along with his wife or daughter but he fell in love with his daughters school friend. That is simply unnormal. You will see a lot of strange parts in this movie including the parts when Ricky (neighbor) stalks Lesters daughter. At the end of the movie Lester is shot in the head by Rickys father because he thinks that Ricky is having an affair with Lester (that is another sick thing about the movie in my opinion). There are a lot of things that I do not agree with about this movie but I would, however, give it a good rating because it is very unpredictable. I like it when I do not know what's going to happen next.",Null,0,0,15 June 2001
Ghostbusters," 555-2368
","Who ya gonna call GHOSTBUSTERS (555-2368)! I think that Ghostbusters is just a bunch of non-stop LAUGHTER! I cannot say what I like best about this movie because their is just too many things that I like about it including the song Ghostbusters (by Ray Parker Jr.) and all the other hilarious parts in the movie! Parts like Bill Murrey getting SLIMED by Slimer (for some reason my favorite character in the movie) at the hotel, when Rick Moranis (the nerd) goes runs crazy through the town, and when Dan Aykroyd chooses a big marshmellow giant as a god. This movie will definately make you fall out of your chair laughing! So sit down, take a load off, and watch Ghostbusters!",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," December 25 and October 31
",This was a 'dark' movie but I thought it was a cool one! Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King) was hilarious. Jack is the central character in the movie who gets tired of the 'same old thing' (life in Halloween Town) and decides to visit Christmas Town. He gets a taste of the jolly environment and decides to take over Santa's job. Santa is captured and held hostage by the 'Boogie Man'. Sallie (Jacks love who has to repeatedly escape from the Mad Scientist) knows that Jack is up to no good. Jack goes to Christmas Town and delivers terrifying presents to the children. When the town realizes whats happening they go after Jack. Jack is shot down from the sky by a missle. That's when Jack realizes that he was wrong and want's to make things right again. He then returns to Halloween Town and Rescues Santa from the Boogie Man. That's when Santa gets to return to Christmas Town and bring joy to all of the children again. This is where the 'Happy Ending' comes in. I liked this movie because it is dark but simply hilarious film. I rate this film 10 out of 10.,Null,0,1,18 July 2001
A Bug's Life," Xtreme cool
","Even though A Bugs Life got a half star less than Antz I like it better because it is funnier in my opinion (comedy movies are my favorite). At the beginning of the movie Flik (main character) caused the grain to fall in a creek and the ants did not have enough food for the grasshoppers. Their leader Hopper gave the ants until 'the last leaf fell' to get 'double the order of food'. I enjoy to watch Fliks adventure to find 'warrior' bugs to fight the grasshoppers and save the ants. Unfortunately Flik came back to 'Ant Island' and with circus bugs. They were a combination of insects like a Lady Bug (Francis) a Black Widow Spider (Rosie), and others. Flik found out about this misunderstanding and the circus bugs were about to leave but when they saved Dot (Queen Ants little daughter) they decided to stay. About half way through the movie Flik and Princess Atta fall in love (that was cool). Flik comes up with another plan to build a bird (Hopper is afraid of birds) and scare Hopper and the rest of the grasshoppers away. Soon after the bird was complete all the other ants find out the truth about the 'circus bugs' (because of P.T. Fleas big mouth) and Princess Atta orders Flik to leave and never return. Flik was sad but he and the circus bugs came back to the Ant Island when Dot told flik that Hopper was going to kill the Queen Ant (the grasshoppers came back to Ant Island and the ants did not have enough food). When Flik came back and put the built bird plan to action it scared off all of the grasshoppers except Hopper who found out that the bird was fake. He went after Flik in a rage. When Princess Atta took Flik away from Hopper they ended up right by a birds nest. That was the final showdown between Flik and Hopper. Lets just say that Hopper got fed to three baby birds. In the end the circus bugs returned to the circus, Flik and Princess Atta are together, and everybody live happily ever after. I enjoy to laugh and watch the all the adventure in A Bugs Life and I never get bored of it!",Null,0,0,9 June 2001
The Iron Giant," Enormously Cool
","This was a very cool cartoon movie to watch because it is not a silly cartoon. It's not like those other cartoon movies like Doug's First Movie or Recess. In the Iron Giant there are some serious parts like when the Iron Giant saves the town (Rockwell, Maine) from a huge missle or when Hogarth saves the Iron Giant from being electricuted. I doesn't seem to be a real kiddy cartoon but at the same time it is funny. Hogarth Hughes is hilarious especially when he put a little something in Kent Mansley Coffee to give him have diarrhea. You need to see this movie, you will enjoy every second of it!",10,1,2,2 August 2001
