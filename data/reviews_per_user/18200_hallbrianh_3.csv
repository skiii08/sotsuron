The Lobster," Shallow absurdist 'comedy'
","Apparently it is fashionable to take a bizarre premise, preferably involving a humorous animal, and spin out the consequences without regard for logic or reason, even though the characters behave as if they had no choice but to follow the 'logic' of the situation. While superficially similar to Wes Anderson's films, this movie is no where near the quality of Anderson's films. Anderson's movies use a cartoon world to emphasize the humanity of the characters. This movie creates characters that operate by cartoon logic in an all too real appearing world. No humanity, a few humorous scenes, and a lot of gratuitous violence. The characters teach us nothing. Watching this movie was like being trapped in the nightmare of a very sick writer. Even the violence felt contrived - which is all the more disturbing.Skip it. Life is too short.",3,7,9,16 March 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A surprisingly strong sequel
","'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' - part of P.K. Dick's incredible legacy, became the inspiration Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, which ranks with Metropolis, Forbidden Planet, and 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the most important SF films of all time. Combining Dick's ideas with a technical and artistic mastery created a movie that is watchable over and over for the richness of its details and the poetry of its dialogue. Sequels rarely live up to the original. So, it was with great trepidation that I went to see a sequel of such a masterpiece. I am happy to say that although Blade Runner 2049 doesn't reach the level of the original, it is an excellent film in its own right, as well as a sequel done right. With a myriad of subtle references to the original -in music, visually, and obviously plot, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable by those who intimately know the original and those who don't. You could probably even watch them in reverse order without losing much. Set 30 years in the future from the original and made 35 years later, the aging actors fit the sequel perfectly, The evolution of the setting in California fits the logical conclusions of the original. The evolution of the Replicants also fits perfectly. Most surprisingly, this is not just a rehash of the same ideas, but an extension of the problem of human vs 'more human than human' and how the two will interact. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is that there is no '11' for the original.",9,1,5,23 October 2017
The Holiday," Pathetic writing, atrocious editing, horrendous acting with 1 exception
","Music, images, dialogue, camera shots, soft focus, scenes like the lifetime achievement award bit -- all supposed to make the audience do the one thing the Cameron Diaz character can't do...cry. Unfortunately, I caught her problem with this movie. Try as I might I couldn't find any real emotion in this movie, other than nausea.Nancy Myers self-indulgent look into her own fantasy of life that no-one else could possibly care about. With the one occasional exception of Kate Winslet, I didn't believe a word from any of these characters. Explain how the Jude Law character is supposed to be such a perfect father that he goes out regularly to get drunk and spend the night unexpectedly at his sister's house while I guess his kids fend for themselves?!!! Why does every character jump up and down like a 6 year old. OK, I did believe the cameo and unintentionally apt line of disgust from Dustin Hoffman...'can't go anywhere...'' Take all that and multiply it by 136 excruciatingly long minutes and you might find something to cry about after all.",1,17,31,14 March 2007
