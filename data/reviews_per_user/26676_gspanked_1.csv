Skyfall," Not your typical Bond flick
","Saw it last night at the Hollywood Cinerama dome. Long, dark, very Chris Nolan-esque. Not your typical 007 flick with adventure, intrigue, Bond girls and gadgets. While I enjoyed it, a part of me was disappointed with these missing elements that made me long to be a spy when I was young. I think this is the first film where I found myself glad I 'wasn't' him.I personally didn't care for Javier Bardem as the villain. I found him more creepy than menacing.Fans will cheer a few homages to the classics and how well they wrapped things up at the end.Go see it. {8^)>",7,3,13,8 November 2012
