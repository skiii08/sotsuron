Blade Runner 2049," Not by a long shot...
","When you compare the first movie from 1982 with this, the first movie still rules on all levels. It captures everything perfectly accompanied but tailor made ambience and music.It is not a terrible movie but 2049 struggles on all levels. Acting is very stale and slow to a point where you stop believing in then as characters and start to see the actors and then you can no longer be immersed in the story. Story is thin, no 'scientific' backing up and just-is and you think ok why not but it's more like lets get on with it and see if the movie will deliver.They've used models instead of CGI for many of the shots which to begin with looked refreshing but the shots were so poorly made that even the first movie and movies like the first Star Wars movie gets it better. Felt like flying through a Lego-landscape.Movie has no 'life'. The first movie was bustling with extra casts, sounds, you could even picture the smell of the food in your mind. 2049 feels like it was shot at 6am in a place where a handful of people live. Yet another thing that makes you not get immersed.There's very little music, or ambient background noise at all, just a lot of wind and silence. They should've used filters to deepen and darken the picture, it's too crisp and too bright and you feel a bit like you're watching people in a hospital for many of the indoor shots.This is not a bad movie, nor is it really good, it's one of those you put on when you need to pass some time and watch something sci-fi-ish. The first movie, and then the original cut with the voice-overs which are true to the noir genre, will still be my favourite as even today it is masterfully made. Perhaps there will be a directors cut of 2049 where they make up for what didn't come of the original version. There's always hope.",Null,1,3,26 December 2017
Dunkirk," Fails to capture the grand scale and drama of what happened
","This movie should've been called 'What happened to a handful of men at Dunkirk' and be labelled a documentary at best and History Channel would've made a much better documentary of it. I guess they tried to go down to a up close view to intensify but it just falls short. It's too slow to captivate, there's too few things happening considered the grand scale of the Dunkirk operations. It feels like a few hundred men were trapped on a beach and a dozen boats that came to rescue them. I can not even begin to describe how disappointed I am in this production, the only relieving factor was it not being longer than 1h 39m otherwise my head would've imploded.",Null,24,42,6 December 2017
Resident Evil," Sloppy filming and sloppy action
","I've played the games and I had high hopes for this movie, though I didn't expect them to be 100% true to the games. First off the whole mood was lessened by the darn microphone that kept bobbing in from the top middle of the picture a 20-some odd times, very nice... Second, it seemed like this was a well over 2 hours movie that had been cut down to 90 minutes by someone very drunk. This movie could've been so much better with just a little more work, but it was sloppy. Is it worth the money for a cinematicket ? No. Is it worth renting as a video later on ? Maybe, if you're hung over. Is it worth watching for free ? Sure, why not.

The Butterfly Effect," A very good film, Donnie Darko-ish
","Never mind the upstuck people giving this film a hard time, this is indeed a good film.  I doesn't have any particular famous actors, you just seen them around, and that is good. The acting quite good, and the plot is mesmerizing and fun as it twists and turns. I can in some ways be compared to Donnie Darko, but unfortunately it doesn't have Donnie Darko's excellent music.  It does however deliver some scenes that are quite on par if not a bit better than what Donnie Darko was. Watch this move with a bunch of friends, then break out the redwine and discuss existential and scientific view on life, our movement through time and you'll have one freakin' cool evenin' ahead.X.",Null,1,2,6 April 2004
Windtalkers," Guns, guns, guns and crap.
","This movie reminded me of another crappy movie, Black Hawk Down. Very thin story and honestly too much shooting.  In the end one just wishes the movie to end, and some even left the cinema before it ended.  Even the attempt to include a lovestory fails, the acting was ok I guess when you consider most lines were 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!', 'I'm hit!' and other memorable frases like that.  If you wanna see a well made war-story then get hold of Band of Brothers, now there is a golden egg for you.  If you on the other hand want mindnumbing, idiotic entertainment then by all means it's your money. Me, I wished I'd set fire to my money and watch it burn, would've been way more entertaining.X.",Null,2,2,8 July 2002
