Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," impressive Sherlock Holmes
",I am not a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.But I watched films of Sherlock Holmes.I watched this movie in December of 2011. I like character of RobertDowney Jr very much. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. If I was to say something about this movie it would be that it is really good quality. The effects that were used very moving. The costumes and props were also very interesting I still can not over how good it is. This is perfect entertainment and no disappointments.I'm looking forward series 3 of this film. I can recommend this movie to people wanting to watch something interesting. In general I found this too successful.,7,0,0,24 March 2013
Life of Pi," I didn't like
","I have just watched the 'Life of Pi'. My friend proposed this film me before watching. They said 'Good film.' But I think this film is bad. This film isn't good enough for watching. Also boring movie. I don't find logical. A child stay for year in boat. And he life with lion. This event too interesting. I disappointment about this film. There are all animals and storm scene is amazing. The child choose which religion doesn't know. This state is engrossing. Because children believe that their parents religion. So the child be curious about different religion is good. How ever the child has stayed in ocean for a long time. I don't understand ocean has got a lot of light. But the child doesn't afraid anything. If I were he, I afraid. He went a big and interesting island. He likes this island. But than him idea change. Generally I think this film not impressive enough.",3,2,6,6 May 2013
