Ghost," Have a nice life. Have a nice death.
","I was walking across a busy Manhattan street when a woman in a tank top and jeans comes up to me and yells my name. She insisted she knows me and in repetition she announces my name over and over . What does this crazy woman want ? For the life of me I couldn't recognize her. The persistence continued as she started to name members of my family and my parent's home address. Who is this person? I never felt so vulnerable. I guess that's how celebrities feel when fans approach them. The woman in question was dead on correct in her claims but I still was dumbfounded, puzzled to her connection with me. The movie 'Ghost' deals with the afterlife, murder and a touching love story of a different kind. Banker Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) stumbles upon a bank account with a huge sum attached. Sam confide in his discovery to his co-worker Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn). That evening Sam and his artistic live in girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore) are walking a deserted downtown street after seeing an off-Broadway play. Oblivious to their surrounding, Sam is shot and killed by a mugger , (who also steals Sam's wallet), as a horrified Molly leans over Sam's dead body. Meanwhile the metamorphosis of afterlife take place as a stream of light appears before newly deceased Sam. Sam ignores heavens call and remains along side Molly. Dead and frustrated Sam sees that his love Molly is now in danger as our murderer, Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) comes back to Molly's loft the next day. With the help of Molly's cat our murderer Willie flees. Sam follows our scoundrel back to his Brooklyn flat. Sam stumbles upon a fortune teller business featuring two sisters and their clairvoyant Oda Mae Brown (Whoppie Goldberg). During one of Ms. Brown's sessions Sam interrupts a disingenuous seance as he gives his take on her fraudulent ways. Oda yells , 'Who said that?' Oda apparently can hear every word Sam says even though she can't see him. Sam spends the rest of the time coaxing Oda to be a go between so he can warn Molly of the impending danger of the murderous Willie Lopez. The early stages of the film focus on the frustration of Sam not being able to move objects and speak to people. Oda as the interpreter give some comic relief during the entire film. Great music score featuring the sounds of 'The Righteous Brothers'. Some notable performances by renown character actor with distinguished features Vincent Schiavelli a agitated ghost constantly kicking Sam off his subway train. Great special effects showing the anomaly of the after life as Sam gets a lesson from our disgruntled Vincent. Nice twisting plot which takes you to a peaceful ending. The connection between this movie and my non recognizable person reminded me of Oda Mae trying to convince girlfriend Molly that she is actually in contact with her dead lover Sam. Molly is skeptical like I was telling her to leave. After a few minute It became clear to me who this woman was and it was my Father's personal nurse Angela. As the movie Ghost unfolded it became clear, this was quite a movie.",5,0,2,9 September 2019
The Notebook," A lifetime of Love! Personal connections throughout this movie.
","For years I've lived with my second Wife and as time goes on I've truly learned the real hidden meaning of love . It's something you can't describe in words but the effects are there. As a youth my judgement was clouded with looks and lust. How much does love at first sight really work. I tried that once and was awestruck by this girl who worked in a store across the way. I wanted her in the worst way . There she was a vision of loveliness in tight jeans and those gorgeous eyes. I walked over to the store where she worked the counter. Each step closer was like an eternity as my legs felt like lead weights pushing forward. I reached the counter and there she was . I was so nervous and petrified. If she says yes what do i do? What if she says no? Anyway I boldly introduced myself and she was insensitive to my presence. I said some stupid things, 'Do you work here? Alot of weather we're having lately.' I was rambling out of nerves as she was getting perturb. I cut to the chase and said my peace. 'Will you go out with me? A mediate response of no came out and I was crushed . My response was 'Why?' I wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to panic as things went from bad to worse as I said, 'I must have you and we are meant to be together.' She said, 'Get lost smuckie!' Over a three year period I tried many attempts to sway her. Each attempt ended in predictable failure. The movie the Notebook struck a cord for me in many ways and conjured up old memories of lost loves and Ill health. First the comparison to the part of lost loves. We start at a retirement facility where we see an elderly bespectacled distinguished man named Duke (James Garner) who asks the aid if it's a good day to read to this elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) . A picturesque sunny day is the setting as Duke sits down and opens his notebook as he reads the story of two young people in the late 1930's. We don't know the relationship between the two retirees at first. As Duke reads; the film flashes back in time. Noah (Ryan Gosling) a tall,lanky fellow who works the lumber mill in a sleepy seaside town somewhere in the Carolina's sees the vision of his dreams on the street. This vision is the young and lively Allie Calhoun (Rachel McAdams). Noah pursues her as he climbs the Ferris wheel at a carnival and wants to date her. Allie finally caves in and the two bond quickly. All is not right in the social corners as Allie comes from a wealthy family and Noah is just a poor lumber worker. Joan Allen plays the snobbish mother of Allie and explains that Noah can't possibly give her the life she's accustomed to. Periodically the movie shifts back to the present day on the nursing home lawn where the Gray haired woman wants to know more. Duke reads on as Ally and Noah break up over a war of words. Allie goes off to school in New York as Noah deep down wants to rekindle the relationship as he sets out to write one love letter a day for 365 straight without a response from Ally. A distraught Noah has bigger issues as fate would have it. Noah and World War II sidetrack our story. War ends and Allie meets another man who is wealthy. Noah has a significant widow for company but he still has Allie on his mind. Noah purchases a dilapidated old mansion and fixes it up sparkling new. This house renovation brings the two lovers back together again. The scene on the lake with the ducks reminds me of the night I proposed marriage to my wife. Now the connection on ill health. We learn that the gray haired woman has the beginning s of Dementia, Alzheimer disease and has sporadic memory issues . Some heart wrenching scenes with Garner and Rowlands as her memory comes back but fades quickly. I remember the old days of a young dashing confident James Garner playing the gambler Bret Maverick on my old black and white TV. Nothing stopped in his way but today we see an older version of Garner popping pills and telling his friends 'I keep trying to die but they won't let me.' But in this film we see a caring, sensitive, vulnerable man in the autumn of his years reading the love story of yesteryear from his notebook to his Woman. I think back to my own personal experiences with my Mother-In-Law and her mental deterioration. From the initial phone calls from her office as to why she isn't doing her paper work to wetting herself or opening a car door while in motion. Then lashing out violently hitting my cousin and smacking my daughter for no apparent reason. Then finally lost, not knowing what to do next. The success and following of this film touched many viewers. From Love at first sight to the realities of mortality. But sustainable love between two people and a life time of affection for each other is the real hook in this romantic journey. After films end I'm wiping the tears from my face.",6,0,2,18 January 2019
That Thing You Do!," The Wonders on the verge of stardom, Failure Forthwith!
","Ah the fabulous 60's. The days of AM radio and which musical group will produce the number one song in the country on the top 40 survey. Garage bands were commonplace as the Fab Four (The Beatles) set the standard for music in that colorful era beyond Camelot and the Kennedy's. Much like the movie Radio Days, Woody Allen's period piece from the War years, this film acts like a time capsule as we look into the past and get a taste of what it's like to be alive in the 1960's. Tom Hanks does an outstanding job re-creating an era of rock and roll groups aspiring to cut a record and go on to greatness. The music industry was at it's paramount in that period with endless artists taking a grab at the brass ring. Our story originates from Erie, Pennsylvania in 1964 as a jazz drummer/ appliance salesman in his father's store Guy Paterson (Tom Everett Scott) is asked by his friend Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) to join his group because his current drummer broke his arm.The other two members of the band The ONE- DERS are an obnoxious guitar player Lenny (Steve Zahn) and a soon to be Marine base player. The group enters a local talent show as Guy suggests to his bandmates to quicken the pace in their tune. The result; a hit song is born. They win first prize, a gig at a restaurant. At the venue the One-Ders sell their records as a local talent scout takes notice Phil Horace (Chris Ellis). Phil takes that song and puts it on the radio as the group hires him as their manager. Phil books the boys for a Rock & Roll show in Pittsburgh. Phil introduces the group to Mr. White (Tom Hanks) Playtone Records representative and takes over as their new manager. The boys join a cross country tour with the Playtone cavalcade of stars doing mostly State fairs. I was totally blown away with the endless creativity of the fictitious Artists and their music. Besides our main attraction the One-ders, you have this suave debonair Freddy Fredrickson (Robert Torti) singing Mr. Downtown and the lovely vocalist Diane Dane (Chaille Percival). Fifteen original songs were written for this rock and roll fairy tale. Four of the fifteen songs were written by our jack of all trades Tom Hanks who did it all among-st the ranks of Orson Wells, Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen as a five toll producers of films, .The Playtone troupe travels westward state by state. In Ohio the Boys now re-spelled the WONDERS are dressed in red jackets to match the Buckeye colors and in Indiana beige wheat colored blazers are the norm. Wisconsin the Yellow jackets are worn to resemble cheese as Mr. White give his repetitive complimentary remark, 'Did I tell you you guys look great in Green!' As the tour progresses Their song rises on the top 40 which Mr. White suggests they get off the tour and head out to Hollywood to bigger things. A cameo in a Beach Movie and radio interview conducted by Clint Howard. Meanwhile there's trouble in paradise as the boys have first class accommodations at luxury hotel with know it all doorman attentive Lamarr (Obba Babatunde) giving advice when needed. Jimmy clashes with Mr. White about writing his own songs while the bass player wanders off to Disney never to return. Guy ends up at a jazz club to meet his Idle Jazz artist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs) who gives him advise telling Guy to save his money and look out for fast women.Del goes on about the industry and it's pitfalls. Silly Lenny plays cards with some locals and falls for a pretty receptionist. The first of many. Things unravel further as Faye (Liv Tyler) Jimmy's girlfriend who's relationship has been one sided on Faye's part realizes that her beau is self absorbed in his music and has no intentions of Marriage. So many cameo appearances by familiars in the industry. Charlize Theron as Tina, Kevin Pollock as the Pittsburgh MC , old friend from the TV show Bosom Buddies Peter Scolari as the Host of the Hollywood Showcase and Alex Rocco as Sol Siler the pastrami eating Playtone CEO. So ingenious. The movie shows how fragile holding on to success can be in the entertainment industry. Can't wait for the next one hit Wonder!",7,0,0,25 May 2017
Ed Wood," We Don't Have A Permit. Run!
","Owning and running an Ice cream store in Queens,New York reminded me of the movie Ed Wood. I felt like Ed striving to make a success out of the business and all the while collecting employees and friends of employees and the weird camaraderie I established with those unforgettable characters. In one of her last Interviews the Original Vampira (Maila Nurmi) who was a host on KABC's late night Horror show back in the 1950's was quoted as saying,' Birds of a feather.' about how endearing the real Ed wood was to his close friends and colleagues and he wouldn't stop at no expense to help them. Transvestites , dope addicts and misfits were all assembled in the Ed Wood World of movie making in post WWII Hollywood so authentically depicted by Director Tim Burton. Johnny Deep captures the enthusiasm and integrity of this cross-dressing alcoholic and winsome wannabee director of the cinema. Wood would go to great lengths to get the picture done without permits, stealing props and even getting his entire cast baptized in order for the church to fund his movies. Martin Landau was delightful as the Iconic Bela Lugosi with a spot on Hungarian accent yet Landau's performance was never to upstage the real actor as thought by Bela Lugosi's real son who did eventually watch the movie and paid tribute to Landau for portraying his late Father. So much so that they became friends. Furthermore Landau won the Oscar for best Supporting Actor for this role. To me this move was about loyalty, creativity although questionable by higher standards Ed Woods methods and practices were at the very extreme with the one goal in mind, to get the picture done his way! So many characters. Bill Murray as the hopeful sex change recipient. Criswell played by Jeffrey Jones as the master of outrageous predictions. Sara Jessica Parker as Ed's first significant, Dolores Fuller who constantly complains and wonders what she's doing with this non- conformist cross-dressing film Director. Juliet Landau who cons her way into an Ed Wood movie who is allergic to water. George the Animal Steele as the Hefty Tor Johnson. Vincent D'Onofrio as the portly Orson Wells in one of my favorite scenes in this movie when a frustrated Ed Wood chews the fat about the problems of producing movies in Hollywood. I thought it was the actor's voice and kudos to D'Onofrio but the Wells voice was lip-synced. The real voice belonged to Maurice LaMarche. Great film for all those sentimental 50's Sci-Fi schlock movie aficinados. Where giant lizards and mutated humans not to mention UFO aliens were the norm and being produced in huge numbers annually throughout the decade, Ed Wood and his troop of lovable faithfuls put together some of the most forgettable movies ever produced which over time became a new art form of film obscure. Ed Wood hoping with each film project that this will be the movie he'll be remembered for. This movie is a tribute to all those hopefuls out of film school and it's not bad movie to watch if you were ever afraid of horror movies. Bravo Mr. Burton !",7,0,1,7 March 2017
Taxi Driver," Hopper? Yeah, you know, like a rabbit. Hip- hop!
","An old acquaintance named Ira was a cab driver. I wanted to know what it was like driving a cab for one shift so I gave it a try. This was not the life for me. Belligerent customers and horrible tippers were the norm. Some patrons liked the air conditioning on high. Others made me turn it off. Impromptu traffic snarls and pot holes drove me crazy. Went to see this movie with my friend Neil during my college years and why not, It features violence, sex and foul language. Filmed on location in and around New York's majestic Manhattan streets, (displaying familiar landmarks) i.e. Time Square, Bellmore Cafeteria. But the main focus of the film exposes the underbelly world of prostitution, mainly sex trafficking. Sleazy hotels and rows of movie houses showing sex films along 42nd street of the 1970's. Conversely the film shows us the disconnect with the politics of the time featuring a political campaign. Robert DiNiro play Vietnam Veteran Travis Bickle who is basically a loner looking for employment. Travis lands a job as a New York City cab driver. The cinematography (Michael Chapman) is of excellent quality showing steam coming up from the streets as our yellow cab slashes through water puddles giving it a feel of realism. The camera gives you a sense of actually riding in the backseat of Travis's cab. I know like most passengers who have ridden in cabs, we focus on the meter as we watch the numbers tick higher as the ride progresses. I don't ever remember a movie featuring a taxi meter before. Basically you see the diverse cliente Travis picks up in his cab from violent pimps to a squeaky clean cut politician. Travis, though lonely, is bold enough to ask a extremely attractive political campaign staff member Betsy (Cybill Shepard) on a date which fails. Travis goes one step further in a different direction as he intercedes an underage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis explains that this is no life for a 12 year old and that her pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel) only has bad intentions for her. Iris is not influenced by Travis' remarks in the least. Travis takes matters into his hands as he purchases weapons and ads deadly devices to insure severe torture. Travis's loneliness manifests itself during the film with rage and anger. The mirror scene is an iconic moment in cinematography history. Travis (DiNiro), is the narrator. Travis voices his negativity about the city through most of the picture. The film predictably ends up to a crescendo of violence the viewer will never forget . Kudos for the musical background provided by Bernard Herrmann with ever present saxophone sounds throughout. Just one of those movies you just can't get out of your mind as it's value remains the same after all these years. A timeless piece from Martin Scorcese.",6,0,3,10 June 2019
Dirty Dancing," Pack up the Car, follow Route 17 to Kellerman's
","!963 The height of the Borscht Belt, the Catskills . A mountain range in upstate New York when Hotels, motels and bungalow colonies sprung up up like dandy lions in an abandoned field. Some say the Idea or origins of the Catskills region was the location and natural setting just a couple of hours away from New York and Philadelphia areas where Jewish families could relax for a couple of weeks at affordable prices. In the 1930's and 40's Jews were denied vacancies in other hotels do to anti antisemitism. Jewish oriented luxury hotels, Motels, Bungalow colonies and Sleep-away camps of every description accommodated Jewish clientele in every price range. This made for a quick fix to rejuvenate the senses before the fall season/ school commences. Enough with the History lesson. On with the review. It's 1963 The Kennedy's lived in the White House and Rock and Roll filled the air waves with the sounds of WABC and Bruce Morrow at the mic, known as a DJ (Disc Jockey), who talked between songs . Song artists the likes of Jan & Dean, The Four Seasons, The Beach Boys and Lesley Gore performing as the teenage multitude tried to master the latest dance steps such as the FREDDIE or the FRUG or maybe the MASH POTATO or the SHIMMY? This brings us full circle to our story of loyalty, trust and for a lack of a better word, judgement. Dr. Houseman (Jerry Orhbach) and his Family arrive at Kellerman's resort in the heart of the Catskill Mountains . Along with Mrs. Houseman (Kelly Bishop) and their two Teenage daughters Lisa (Jane Brucker) and our centerpiece of this story Frances ,AKA,' Baby' Houseman. The family settles in on this country setting at Kellerman's Resort run by the chubby, lispy Max Kellerman played by character actor deluxe Jack Weston. Max Boasts about his Danish being pure protein as he assembles the patrons for the daily routine of dancing lessons during the day light hours. The help or dance instructors are basically teenagers or of college years. One stand out is the tall auburn haired, beady eyed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is curious about the crowd beyond the main bungalows and is taken by Johnny Castle. Although Johnny comes from a humble background Baby is taken by his charm and elegance as Johnny regular partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant and to complicate things further has an abortion. that renders her bed ridden and infected. Baby takes her place and practices as Johnny and Baby become a dance team working side performances at competing Hotels unbeknownst to her doting Father. Johnny and Baby are trying to master the famous swan catch. Diversions of infidelity and false accusations thicken as Dr. Houseman and Max Kellerman accuse Johnny of wrong doing. Fine performances by the obnoxious full of himself Neil Kellerman (Lonny Price),the Bosses son and the insidious, philandering Robbie the bus boy, (Max Cantor) add to this piece of Borscht Belt nostalgia. This Movie strikes a distant cord with me as I fall into a trance of past experiences going to the mountains with my parents. Homowack Lodge and Davos ski resort bring back a ton of wonderful memories. Just a bygone era captured on film. The success of this film is how the story captures the atmosphere of bungalow life. Moreover,what it was like to experience a day in the.: as my BUBY would say: 'Day in the mountains!' And to quote our proprietor Max Kellerman, 'So lets join in in one last chorus, visitors, staff and guests. What we've shared won't be forgotten, old friends are the best!",6,1,3,27 February 2018
The Dirty Dozen," The opposite of a 'Chick Flick' Let's call it A MALE TALE!
","What surprised me the most about this movie is that my Liberal, forthright politically correct Mother loved this film. Then I realized the Lee Marvin Character's name in the story is Major John Reisman. That's my Mom's maiden name. Britain 1944 a few months before the D-Day Invasion, A.S.C.D.Advance Section Communication Zone a branch of the U.S. Army under the direction of Major General Sam Borden (Ernest Borgnine)who has special orders for Major Reisman. General Worden assigns Major Reisman a very unusual mission, Codename, 'Amnesty', involving the Dregs of the military in a suicide mission somewhere in France. Reisman Has to train some of the worst convicts ever assembled selected especially for him. After Reisman Witnesses a hanging in a British prison he meets with the 12 convicts some have lengthy sentences with (hard labor) others by hanging. Reisman has the Dozen construct their own barracks and training facilities. Each man had a special characteristic as Franco John Casavetes was the loudest of the bunch complaining about lack of water during training as the group would be called the 'Dirty' Dozen. Telly Savalas plays a twisted mentally unstable rapist named Maggott,The semi-cowardly Posey (Clint Walker), A tower of a man who killed a man with his bear hands is reluctant to fight Reisman in a training exercise but gets knocked down despite his size. Jefferson (Jim Brown) shows his athleticism as he displays his speed setting off hand grenades. Charles Bronson plays Wladislaw who ends up pairing with Reisman as German Officers during a the attempted raid on the Castle. The Training went on as Reisman whipped those malcontents into shape as they proved they could handle any mission thrown their way from War Games to actual war time the Dirty Dozen was prepped and ready for action. I loved the symbolism as the boys have their meal before their final mission which looks like the portrait of Jesus with all his apostles around. The catchy rhyme the 12 recite so things go right on that ominous night.HEY, THAT RHYMES!!One of the few times in American films you witness American soldiers committing war crimes against the German's. Just a macho movie for the guys to enjoy.",5,1,4,2 August 2017
Ghostbusters," The Ghostbusters appeared on the couch of The Joe Franklin Show , WOW, they made the big time!
","During the 80's I owned and operated an Ice Cream store in Queens, New York. The hours were long and I would usually arrive home around midnight where I would watch TV to all hours of the morning. I found myself watching the same shows almost every evening for decades. One show I watched religiously was the Joe Franklin Show on WOR TV. Joe was shown locally in the New York City market. Moreover Joe Franklin was the longest running late night talk show in American history, some 47 years. Joe was coined the 'King Of Nostalgia' or 'The Wizard Of Was'. Joe would flash old movie posters and have forgotten film stars pop in from time to time reminiscing about the old days. Joe had a wide range of guests from world renown artists Salvadore Dali and the Beatles John Lennon. From local celebrities to the famous names in Hollywood, i.e. Sinatra and Bing Crosby. President John Kennedy sat on the famed couch back in the early 60's. Enough about Joe and on to Ghostbusters, I first learned about this phenomenon by also listening to the nationally broadcast all night Larry King show out of Washington, D.C. along the Mutual Radio Network. Between Franklin and King I had a thing for nocturnal media. Larry King also personally promoted this ghostly, comedy, action film mainly because he had a cameo in the film. The publicity department At Sony/Columbia Pictures did a phenomenal job promoting this film especially with children. The popular Ray Parker theme song with the famous catch phrase 'Who you gonna call?' hit the air waves of the radio medium. Ghostbusters is unique in the fact that special effects and comedy are a slippery slope to combine . Special effect require precise timing. As for comedy it's usually spontaneous. In this film the two styles meld well together. I noticed the fine tuned editing in the Capra style making the movie less choppy. Having a nice flow.. Our story begins with three Columbia professors Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Ray Stantz, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egon Spengler who delve into the paranormal with experiments of a different nature. Venkman asking his female subject is she menstruating? Well the time has come as our scientist's government funding runs out and they are banished from the University. Out on the street pounding the pavement realizing that there is negative energy in the way of Ghosts and the unexplained, People complain about haunting s from their premises. The three realize there is a need for ghost busting. People will pay at any cost to eradicate these paranormal beings from their property or the ghosts in and around New York. The Three go into business and call themselves the Ghostbusters. The three purchase an old firehouse and hire a receptionist (Annie Potts). Annie does a fair job with her New York accent. The three promote their business on TV and are summoned to a Hotel ballroom . They travel in a makeshift ambulance and enter the lobby in jumpsuit uniforms with back packs and laser guns ready to take down a green goblin. They catch the creature and suck him into a box and store him away in there nuclear chamber at the firehouse. The E.P.A. finds out about it and tries to shut them down. Meanwhile on another front; Venkman has eyes for musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who live in a detailed elaborate 20 story apartment with gargoyles on the roof located on Central Park West. Dana calls Venkman to inspect her re-fridge as she claims it haunted watching eggs fry in the case. Dana would eventually be possessed by a ghost. Nerdy and meek Neighbor accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) is throwing party as a tax write-off. One of the stone structures comes to life and ends up chasing Tully out of the apartment and into Tavern On the Green. Evidently there apartment building is a conduit to the next world. Tully eventually becomes possessed as the Ghostbusters are log jammed by the avaricious E.P.A. investigator William Peck (Walter Atherton) who earlier lets out all the Ectoplasm and Ghosts.at their firehouse headquarter having no regard for their service, calling it a hoax. The ghosts and goblins terrorize New York including a hot dog stand. The mayor of New York concedes giving the Ghostbusters permission to resume and restore order in this Ghost ridden city. The screenplay is chock full of funny lines provided by the genius of Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd. Bill Murray has his share of punchlines, (mostly ad-libs) to round out the dialogue. Honorable mention for our fourth member of the Ghostbusters, Winston played by Ernie Hudson who tells the mayor, 'I've only been with this company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I've joined these men, I've seen s--t that will turn you white!' In my opinion I wouldn't consider this movie scary at all.. Bring your kiddies along for the ride. If your all alone pick up the phone or stay up and watch re-runs of the Joe Franklin Show at the conclusion of this movie.",5,0,3,11 July 2019
Kelly's Heroes," But for 1.6 million dollars we could become Heroes for three days!
","Growing up I was always a fan of Mr. Warmth the renown comic of insults Don Rickles. The comic who's spur of the moment insults and outlandish quips would tickle audiences coast to coast with laughter as long as you don't sit in the first row. Lieutenant Kelly questions a captured German Officer with a
shiny single bar of gold. This opens up a Pandora's box of adventure and war time comedy. I can't believe I had just written that line. Fact of the matter is Kelly's Heroes is the lighter side of war. Coming off two westerns Two Mules for Sister Sarah and Hang Em High, No nonsense squint eyed Clint Eastwood was thrown into this Anti-War comedy with a plethora of characters who seem to have you want to sign up and join the military. Eastwood plays an Ex-lieutenant who was scapegoated for a failed infantry attack captures a Nazi Colonel who in his possession has several Gold Bars. Eastwood gets the Wehrmacht Colonel drunk who becomes a klatschbase of information about a French town 30 miles behind enemy lines that houses almost two million dollars in gold. Kelly with nothing to lose wants the gold. Enter supply sergeant 'Crapgame ' Don Rickles who will supply the guns and ammunition needed for their journey east. Over hearing their plans is our scene stealer Donald Sutherland 'Oddball' as the Gypsy type Hippie Tank commander with his band of renegades. Gavin McCloud as the skeptical Moriarty and always with the negative waves against the aloof and carefree Oddball is timing delight. The bridge scene is classic. To round out the search for gold invasion is the critical, cynical Telly Savalas as Big Joe who takes his troupe along. Rickles and Savalas argue more than a married couple throughout this film and it's a wonder those two didn't make more movies together. The most enjoyable part for me personally is riding along with the crazy Oddball with his tanks shooting paint and playing country music as they head into battle destroying a railroad depot. Sutherland's character as Oddball is an anachronism. Oddball is more of a Vietnam soldier than a World War II tank commander. In his Verbal expressions i.e. calling Big Joe an anti-social type. Three days of traveling and the advance of Kelly, Big Joe and Oddball caught the eye of the flamboyant General Colt (Carroll O'Connor) overhearing their walkie talkie broadcasts. Colt couldn't wait to ride in his jeep and decorate each and everyone of this renegade soldiers thinking they have good intentions of advancing to Berlin in final victory when in truth it's all about the Gold. Sutherland's performance is comical genius and in my opinion his best work. Weird to have Clint Eastwood in the middle of all this labyrinth of comedy but it works despite the negative waves. I grade this movie 6 mortar shells of laughter.",6,2,6,17 April 2017
Life Is Beautiful," Despite everything, Life is Beautiful
","Ever find yourself in a dire straights? You wonder how you will overcome the odds of being in an adverse situation? Basically handling a physically challenging problem. With shear guts and determination you will it through to the end. I'm not talking about playing or participating in a sporting event. I'm referring to the game of survival. Life is Beautiful was a breathe of fresh air to me personally. At this time in my life I was working at a job I dreaded immensely. Director/actor Roberto Benigni adaptation of his Father's Holocaust experience is portrayed in such a tasteful and comical way despite the harsh realities of the Nazi atrocities. This story takes place of course in Italy as slight tidbits of racism appear behind the beautiful backdrop of the Italian ambiance during World War II. My first take on this movie which I watched in Italian (with subtitles in English)Our Star Guido is romancing his love from afar Dora or as he coined her moniker Pricepessa (Princess)played by actress/Wife, Nicoletta Braschi. I thought this movie was going to be about a light comedy filled with slapstick and romance but as I mentioned earlier you see subtle racism with (Negozio Ebraico) spray on random store fronts. Roberto's charm and physical dexterity are slight reminders of those silent screen giants Lloyd and Chaplin. Dora is supposed to be married to a snobbish, full of himself individual. An engagement party is held in the Hotel where Guido works. Dora bored and dubious about her future with this man is instead taken with Guido's charm and laughter. Love the scene with the decorated painted horse which Nazi sympathizers painted racial remarks on the animal.Out of a scene from Sir Galahad Guido rides into the elegant hall breaks up the party as the two whisk away on the steed to the angry potential In-Laws plus Dora's Mother as the center piece goose egg falls and breaks over the Fiance's head. Dora and Guido wed. Five to six years have passed. Enter our third shining star there adorable son Giosi (Giorgio Cantarini). Bright and Cheerful with a wondrous curiosity the boy is down right adorable on the screen. Giosi is a little entrepreneur running the family business(A bookstore) to the delight of Dora's estranged Mother who visits her Grandson for the very first time unbeknownst to Giosi. The relationship between Father and Son is uplifting despite Giosi's refusal to take baths. These are ominous times of war torn Europe. The Nazi now flexing military muscle are rounding up Jews throughout the town. Wife Dora is Christian and is spared but the realty of Guido, his elderly Father and son entering a cattle car north to a concentration camp takes our story into a dark place. Dora tells the Captain of the guard to hold the train as she can't bear being separated from her family. She gets on and sacrifices her freedom just to be close with her family even though she'll end up in a neighboring camp. Upon their arrival the Grandfather is separated and sent to a termination line. Meanwhile Guido makes light of everything around him. Pretending to translate German Instructions from the German Officer in charge of the barracks. Conjuring up a mythical story about a contest involving an army tank telling his son, no matter what, obey his orders or they will lose the contest.

The Da Vinci Code," More to Christianity than meets the EYE!
","The Vatican 1966 My Maternal Grandparents went on a world wind tour of Europe via the prized fleet luxury vessel ' The Queen Mary'. Quite a reward for their lifetime of Marriage raising 4 successful children. My Grandparents went on a tour of the Vatican City when my Grandfather felt ill. He told the guide that he felt dizzy and nauseous. The guide told my grandparents to sit in a church and rest . Out of nowhere a Cardinal showed up and asked my Grandparents if they needed some assistance. The Cardinal in his broken English detected a Polish accent by my Grandfather. The Red Clad man of the clothe put his hand on my Grandfather's shoulder as he asked in Polish 'Mowisz po polsku?' 'Do you speak Polish?' My Grandfathers' blue eye lite up as he responded, 'Tak, urodzitem sie tam!' Yes I was born there!' Which town? asked the Cardinal. My Grandfather said Lodz and the Cardinal's eye also went aglow. The Cardinal went on, 'I gave my first mass at Holy Name of Jesus Church on Sienkiewicza Street.' My Grandfather knew the area of that city well and they broke into conversation in their primary tongues. The Da Vinci Code was a wonderfully written book by Daniel Brown. A great mystery thriller involving the Catholic Church. The book opened my eyes about the origins of Christianity. From the bloodline of Jesus himself to current descendants caused a mass controversy among Christian readers. That being stated, I wondered how Director Ron Howard would cram those many pages into a two and half hour film? On surface the cinematography was superb with location shots around Paris. Our story on the out set grabs your attention with Murder and a chase for the Holy grail. Our two main characters are Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) work well together but strictly business here as romance takes a back seat to religious answers dodging authorities. The most recognizable character in all of this the Albino Silas played by Paul Bettany. The Louve curator is found dead lying in a position of a Vitruvian man. Harvard Professor of religious studies (Langdon) is summed to the site. The police Captain Fache (Jean Reno) tells Langdon about the cryptic message left by the body for decoding. To make matters worse The police tie Sophie to the murder of her grandfather the curator and Langdon and Sophie ditch the police and the chase is on which ends up in London. I personally would have preferred a mini series on television but Hollywood has a way of straying, once again, from the narrative switching characters intentions to shorten a screenplay to accommodate time restrictions. Other players to watch for. The versatile Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa and a pivotal player in our story veteran actor Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing. As for my Maternal Grandparents and their visit to the Vatican, My Grandfather told the Polish Cardinal that he felt queasy so the Cardinal blessed my Grandfather with the sign of the Cross against his far head and short prayer in Latin. My Grandfather apologized and said it wouldn't work, I'm of the Jewish faith. The Cardinal replied, ' Where all G-d's Children!' The Cardinal left and all of a sudden My Grandfather felt better. In-fact no complaints of nausea the rest of the trip.",4,0,1,9 April 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," After the War James Stewart hasn't lost his touch!
","During the decade of the 1980's It's a Wonderful Life was aired constantly on television during the month of December. I really wasn't interested in the film but the power of repetitiveness and boredom or lack of an alternate shows made me take notice as I gave this movie a viewing. The movie starts with angels, (not shown) focus on the life of George Bailey (James Stewart). The angels or heavenly brethren discuss the self sacrifice George goes through his entire life starting in childhood from saving his brother Harry from falling through the ice to catching his distraught, drunken Pharmacist boss Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) from filling a lethal prescription. Onward George attends Harry's (Todd Karns) Senior prom and meeting his future wife Mary (Donna Reed). On the way home George learns that his Father died and he has to sort out his Father's business affairs with his savings and loan. George saved up to see the world but the irascible Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants to dissolve the savings and loan to avoid future competition. The board of director's vote to keep the savings and loan on one condition. George Bailey runs the operations with the help of his absent minded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell). Another sacrifice as the world tour is quashed. George also gives his college tuition to his younger brother Harry in hopes of Harry taking over in four years. Four years later Harry has a better offer to work for his future Father-In-Law as he introduces his fiance to the Bailey's. George agrees to stay on and run the savings and loan. George and Mary wed and plan a huge world Honeymoon trip but the stock market crashes and there's a run on the bank. The Baileys dole out their wedding money to their customers with a whole two dollars left over. Another sacrifice. As time goes on George builds up his business and developed' Bailey Park affordable housing. An alternative for residence of Bedford Falls who currently live in the slum rentals provide by Old Man Potter. Potter attempts to lure George to work for him for an annual salary of $20,000 but George tells Potter bristling with anger to forget it. Meanwhile World War II is in full swing as Younger Brother Harry joins the Air Force and is decorated the Medal Of Honor for saving a Transport of troops from a Kamikaze fighter plane. The story is printed in the local paper on Christmas eve as Uncle Billy brags to Old Man Potter in the bank as he makes out a deposit slip for $8000.00. Absent minded Uncle Billy drops the money in Potter's lap as he goes off to the teller's window without the cash. Meanwhile back at the savings and loan the Bank examiner shows up to check their books. When Uncle Billy tells George he lost the deposit. George goes into panic mode with rage and despair. George comes home to his family in a disturbed manner. Then George runs off and our story takes a dark turn as George tries to kill himself but is intercepted by angel Named Clarence (Henry Travers). George wishes he was never born and Clarence grants that wish. What George witnesses is a lesson in the human spirit wondering how one human life can affect,touch another. In an interview with James Stewart toward the end of his illustrious life remembers being apprehensive in continuing his acting career at the conclusion of his part in World War II as he was highly Decorated for numerous flight missions over Europe. Director Frank Capra and co-star Lionel Barrymore wanted the down to earth prowess of Stewart for the role of George Bailey in this film. Jimmy didn't disappoint despite lack luster receipts at the box office this movie improved with age and is a classic film for the holidays. This was also Donna Reed's film debut as a leading lady. Honorable mention for some cameos in the picture. Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer as Mary's original escort. Frank Faylen as Ernie the cabbie. Ward Bond as Bert the cop. Gloria Grahame as the flirtatious Violet . Sheldon Leonard as Nick. Beulah Bondi who usually plays James Stewart's Mom in numerous pictures as Mother Bailey.",6,1,1,12 January 2018
Jersey Boys," As Close to the Broadway Play as Possible!
","I had my trepidation's along with Frankie Valli about movie adaptations from the Broadway stage productions but Jersey Boys does not disappoint. From the Get go Jersey boys has an energy and a fast pace avoiding drawn out Chatty scenes as seen through the eyes of Tommy DeVito (played by Vincent Piazza),the street smart full of himself tough Jersey youth. Enter our main star Frankie Valli,(John Lloyd Young), a young green 16 year old hair dresser, dripping behind his young virgin ears and into the life of Petty theft, Mob bosses and Nightclubs.Our third character of the group is Tommy's best friend and sidekick, lanky and soft spoken Nick Massi. This a journey into the world of Rock and roll working small seedy venues throughout New Jersey, Brill Building and finally meeting with flowery record producer Bob Crewe who gave those three a foot in the door. The final piece of the puzzle was a creative unassuming clean-cut songwriter Bob Gaudio played by Erich Bergen. Guadio's lyrics seemed to click as the Four Seasons recordings take off to the young masses. Fame and fortune comes swiftly to the boys but unbeknownst to the group Tommy gets involved with mob ties and money trouble as the story unfolds. Another beautiful aspect of our tale is the observance of our lead singer Frankie as we watch him develop from a young boy from Bellville,New Jersey to a top notch performer/celebrity. Frankie's ongoing problems during his career was like all singers/musicians was juggling family and work.Another bright spot in this movie is new-comer Renee Marino who acts like a seasoned veteran actor. Battling alcoholism and fallout with troubled daughter Francine shows the hardships and reality of having a famous parent.Despite all the to molt, the story has a nice flow. Christopher Walken adds some comic relief as the local Mafia Don and surprise cameos by Barry Livingston and Billy Gardell give this story some texture. How does this movie end? With some applause!!",8,2,4,14 July 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Glutton; shear excess
","Comedian Lewis Black once said,'How much S--T do you need?' In a reference to the Adelphia cable scam in one of his HBO specials. We watch the rise and fall on one of the most prolific and glutenous individuals in the world of stock trading Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). Director Martin Scorsese goes to no expense to grab your attention and hold you through the rise to Mount Everest and the fall to the depths of the Mariana trenches. Watching our leading man was like watching a real life cartoon character who escapes serious injuries and drug overdoses and always comes back in the next scene minty fresh. Belfort's second Wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) with eye popping sex appeal despite the heavy NEW YAUK accent makes you think twice about the significant your with now. Love the scenes with the Naomi holding a cup of water ready to splash it in Jordan's face during a morning argument. Other characters in the film are Jonah Hill (Donnie Azoff) as Jordan's second in command at the brokerage house. Jonah portly and known for his reserved demeanor in most of his works shows a completely out-of-control character who is a Quaalude addict and gold fish swallowing spontaneous lunatic. Pratt falls and chocking scenes show the demanding physicality of that role as your waiting for Azoff to have a massive heart attack at any minute.Another example of a cartoon figure who after every death defying scene bounces back and always regains normalcy in the following scenes.Another player in the film is the suave Swiss banker Saurel played by Jean Dujardin who is sweet as Swiss chocolate at the beginning of the film but at the end throws Jordan under a Swiss bus. Finally we come to another surprise guest in the picture as do my eyes deceive me? Patsy from the British Comedy Absolutely Fabulous.Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma who is strangely related to the unpolished Naomi makes her grand entrance (but a bit tardy) at their Wedding reception. Jordan takes a shine to her but only as beard to deposit money from the firm in a Swiss bank account under her name. Joanna looks like a fine aged wine despite the years. lovelier than ever with an elegance to match. Great direction in a make out scene between the very young DiCaprio and Lumley. So many twists and turns you wonder if it all happened. Guaranteed, you'll be pinned to screen throughout the movie wondering how anyone survived this money roller coaster ride. I give this one 6 stocks out of ten!",6,2,4,21 March 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," There are places in the world that are not made out of stone
","Before I review this fascinating tale of abuse, intrigue and resourcefulness taking place in a penitentiary, let me state the following... 'Bad things happen to good people.' The movie starts with a court trial for the murder of a banker's wife. Our defendant is Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) accused of this crime and all the evidence or lack of points in his direction. Found guilty Andy and other recruits (little fishes ) are bused over to Shawshank Prison. During the ride, a portly (FAT ASS)Frank Medrano starts to whine about the fact that he's not suppose to be here.The rookie cons are greeted by the Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who chillingly affirms at the end of his speech, 'Welcome to Shawshank.' Fat Ass continues to moan about being in jail but Captain Hadley (Clansy Brown) wanted to hear no part of his whining.Meanwhile the prison inmates where placing bets on which rookie con will crack under the strain of a first night in prison. As the neophytes walked down the main corridor to a loud bunch of inmate hecklers as they yelled endlessly,'Here fishy fishy.' Veteran Con Ellis Redding AKA Red our narrator played by Morgan Freeman bet two packs of smokes on Andy Dufresne. Meanwhile the majority bet on Fat Ass to crack under the taunting and teasing of the hardened inmates. The mocking was too much for poor, hysterical Fat Ass as he screamed for his Mommy as Captain Hadley beat him endlessly with his night stick as he laid lifeless on the cement floor. Prison life was presented in all it's harsh realities right from the start. The next morning Red was amazed that Andy made it through the first night without making a sound. As the movie progressed Andy needs a rock hammer to make Chess pieces. Red being the prison hustler/scrounger can get mostly anything from the outside, magazines, liquor and posters. Red and Andy develop a friendship/bond. One day the Warden offered volunteer work for the inmates to tar the roof of the guard house. The names where picked at random and Andy and Red were among the chosen for the task. The first day as the men were dipping there mops into tar buckets under the hot sun, Andy overhears Captain Hadley complaining of an cash inheritance. The other guard congratulates him on his new found cash but Hadley says the government will tax him on every penny of it. Andy takes a u-turn toward Hadley and Says, 'Do you trust your Wife?' Hadley enraged, grabs Andy and is ready to throw him off the roof. Andy in breathless desperation replies, There's a way to gift your spouse tax free and I'll can show you how to file the papers and it's perfectly legal for a small price of three beers for each man working on the roof. A few days later it came to pass as his fellow inmate looked on at Andy as they were swigging suds on a hot roof. The Cons at least for a little while felt like men thanks to Andy and his legal advise. Andy had won the respect of his peers. Despite doing curry-favor for the guards, with W2 forms and retirement advise Andy wasn't protected either. Being constantly harassed and beaten by Boggs and his pose (The Sisters). Boggs wanted Andy for sexual favors and I'd like to tell you Andy put up a good fight but the truth is Andy ended up in the hospital infirmary while Boggs laid in the hole of solitary confinement for a month. Word got out about Andy's nemesis to Hadley and the guards and they didn't want their personal Banker harmed any more. Boggs was beaten to a pulp and the Sisters never laid a hand on Andy again.The movie continues and shows the hopelessness of an innocent educated man adjusting to an institution. Making friends and gaining respect with his knowledge in a world of maladjusted criminals. Building a library and fudging the books under the direction of the Warden. This shows how a person entering the criminal system become institutionalized on a positive side and a negative side. Veteran actor James Whitmore give an impressive performance as Brooks the original weathered Librarian. Also notable was the performance by Tommy (Gil Bellows) who takes this story in a different direction. The appeal of this movie is how everything ties together in a hopeless situation and comes out clean on the other side. The original book (Stephen King), was at best, ho-humm by critics standards but the magic of the screenplay brought this story to new heights. Kudos to the screen writing of Frank Darabont. Never get tired of this movie.",9,0,0,23 January 2017
Goodfellas," A Cornucopia of Mobsters
","What a feeling of fulfillment when you beat the system. The thrill of getting away with something with the presence of malice. Back in the 1970's I met a friend in Junior College who was a huge hockey fan. He lived in East Meadow, New York adjacent to the Nassau Coliseum which was the home arena for the New York Islanders ice hockey team. My friend wasn't made of money yet he attended all the home games. He invited me to one and I witnessed his underhanded operation of sneaking in to games. It didn't stop there. Not only did my friend sneak me inside,, He would go right back out and bring other people inside for a small fee. The patrons were not promised a seat but at least they had entrance and could watch by sitting in the aisle and hallways throughout the hockey match. The ticket takers were in on the scam as well. These employees of the coliseum were basically moonlighting for a second income. Our personal ticket taker was a Math teacher, we called him Mugsy. My friend was in his eighth grade math class. That's how the money making operation started. Between the second intermission we would meet at gate #9 and dive up the loot we collected and the scheme was born. We were thinking small so we expanded to all events rock concerts and basketball etc. We had it all and enjoyed the profits. Goodfellas is about a journey through the eyes of an impressionable young Henry Hill (Chris Serrone). We follow his journey into the underworld from his deficient living conditions in a poor Brooklyn Neighborhood watching his Father struggle financially, taking the Subway to work. From his bedroom window Henry discovered a new and exciting world watching the Mobsters at the Taxi stand across the street. He saw these fellows in business suits who parked their cars anywhere they wanted . Played card all hours of the night and controlled the neighborhood more efficiently than the cops with numbers and betting sheets. Henry was introduced to Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) the head of the crew. Paulie had his hand in everything from high jacking trucks and stealing precious cargo at Idlewild Airport. Henry would accompany his rotund Brother Tuddy (Frank DiLeo) who also ran the neighborhood pizzeria. Henry worked himself upward in this world of gangsters. Henry was so involved that he quit going to school. One day Henry's Father received a letter from the school that Henry hasn't attended in months. A ballistic Mr. Hill beat up his son giving him a black eye. Henry intern went to Toody and said he has to quit. Toody and some fellows waited in front of the local post office for Henry's Mailman to return from his route. Henry Picked out the postman and they grabbed him and throw him in the back of their car drove over to the pizzeria and put his head in the oven. No more letters from school, No more letters to the house. It got so bad that Henry's Mother had to go down to post office and ask for her bills. To earn his keep and acclaim to the mob Henry would vandalize cars, sell bootleg cartons of cigarettes and accompany Tuddy on using outside telephones. Bar tending for Paulie in which he meets an out of control Jimmy Conway (Robert DiNero). Jimmy takes a shine to the young delinquent. Henry watched how Jimmy carried himself by hijacking trucks and downright stealing. Jimmy teams Henry up with another helper Tommy DeVito. Henry wins over the trust and honor of the mob by a recent bust by the FBI as they grab Henry for selling illegal cigarettes. Henry is acquitted of all charges from being a first time offender. Henry thought he failed them by getting caught but Jimmy tells a teary eyed boy the facts about loyalty. He didn't rat on his friends by not saying anything and telling them nothing as he slips a bill in his shirt pocket to the ovation and delight of the gaudy clad mobsters. Henry grows into adulthood Played now by Ray Liotta,working mostly with Tommy Played now by Joe Pesce working the airport and planning a huge heist. It was a glorious time with wiseguys and mobsters everywhere . One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the regular frequented mob restaurant as Henry narrates all the wiseguys in the joint. From Nicky Eyes,Pete the Killer, Freddy No Nose, Anthony Stabile and who could forget Jimmy Two Times. This movie continues through the corrupt life and slow down word spiral of organized crime through the eyes of Henry Hill. From his first big score to his marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco), his carousing and brief stint in the joint. Finally dealing in cocaine with his Pittsburgh connection. Honorable mention to actor Chuck Low as the Wig salesman/bookie Morris Kessler who I found very amusing throughout his scenes. Joe Pesce also with a violent performance along with Robert DiNero makes this an addiction in watching the wiseguys do their stuff. The film is enticing to any impressionable kid who wants life in the dangerous lane. The editing and period music adds to the charm of the life of the Goodfellas who had it all for the taking, so they thought! Meanwhile we used the Coliseum for
profit at least 10 more years before we were caught sneaking people inside. Our operation was finally shut down and an expensive court case followed as we were fined with malicious mischief plus lifetime banishment from the Nassau Coliseum.",7,0,1,2 March 2017
