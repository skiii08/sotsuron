Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mock-Umentary
","Excellent movie, highly recommended for most audiences. I gave the movie a 9 out of 10 because there is always room for improvement (although little for this film!) The movie is so dumb that it is actually clever. Sacha Baron Cohen, takes this role so seriously if you go the web-page for the film, it is set up as if it is a government web-page for Kazakhstan Borat's naive ignorance of cultures out side of his home country of Kazakhstan makes this film very funny in a satirical way. If you take everything too seriously and do not have a sense of humor than this is not the best fill for you to see. This is the ultimate movie to shut your mind off and have a great laugh through the entire film",9,2,9,5 November 2006
