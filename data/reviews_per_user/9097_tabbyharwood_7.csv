Casablanca," Lost love in the middle of World War II
","Casablanca is a movie full of suspense within a period of time when individuals were fleeing for their freedom. The setting of the movie being in Africa in the middle of World War II provided the sense of the characters within the film to represent what was actually happening in real life.Individuals flock to this lounge, owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) to find freedom from the Nazis. The Nazis invade the lounge to find criminals or those that are looking to free themselves.A lounge full of corruption turns into a draping love story from past love. You see from within the film how the reappearance of the Ilsa Lund changes Rick Blaine from his calm character into a character overpowered by love.The use of lighting throughout the film gives you the sense of feeling what the characters are feeling. From the sense of hiding from the Nazis and the dim lighting of music being played to portray a sense of love being felt.The use of the camera using slow moving motions to create a suspense and uncertainty kept my interest throughout the film. The use of characters and their roles within the film was used brilliantly and help set the tone for each scene within the film",7,0,2,21 October 2014

","Chinatown was a great film directed by Roman Polanski starring one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Nicholson.

The Grapes of Wrath," Family Land Taken
",The Grapes of Wrath is a touching movie of poverty and how the Great Depression had an impact on families. Families had land taken away from them even though it was owned for over 50 years. Companies came in and took the land from families leaving them with no where to live. They struggled to feed their children. They had no choice but to leave their land and find a new home. Some traveled all the way across the country to find a new home. Lives were lost along the way due to illness or sickness. The darkness of the film gives you the realization of how depressing those times were. How some homes were occupied by 20 plus family members all trying to survive. The way that individuals had to suffer to get to a free land of living was gloomy situation. The part when the kids were all playing in the dumpster and then fighting to get soup was real touching and portrayed the struggle of families trying to feed their children. People lived in tents and they got used to the struggle of survival. People just wanted to work and provide for his family and they worked for pennies just to feed their children. This movie helped me to realize the little things that we take for granted today. How land could be lifted up from under people and they were left with nowhere to go. Families that stick together can get through anything.,5,2,4,10 November 2014
Annie Hall," Chaos of Love
","Although, I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan, this movie was directed in a way that was chaotic but kept my interest. The movie was about a man (Alvy Singer, played by Woody Allen) searching for love while not believing in love. The woman (Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton) was a bipolar woman unhappy with life wanting more that what Alvy could give her.Woody Allen uses a lot of speaking to the audience from within the film to discuss what is actually going on in the film. I personally don't like these type of interruptions in the movie but for this specific movie it went with the meaning of the movie.I did enjoy how on the screen writing was used to show how the characters were actually feeling compared to what they were actually saying, that was very interesting.I liked how back flashes were used throughout the film. It gave us a look on how Alvy's current situations stemmed back into his childhood.The chaotic love story of a man fearful of death and a woman who was bipolar exploring love with one another was interestingly directed. The ending of the movie was one of the best parts on how he was shown directing a movie while using the total different plot of really happened in his life.",6,0,0,4 December 2014

Singin' in the Rain," On Screen / Off Screen Love
","This is the first time that I saw this movie and I have to say that it was absolutely wonderful. I loved the entire movie from the beginning to the end. There were a couple of drawn out scenes that could have been eliminated or shorten but overall it was great.Although a comedy it had a dramatic meaning and plot of deceive, love and power. Gene Kelly played a magnificent character or Don Lockwood an actor trying to make it to the top. Jean Hagen plays the character for Lina Lamont, a woman that has the most annoying voice in Hollywood but has the stage presence that everyone loves. Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden, a soft spoken lovable woman that has an amazing voice and personality. Donald O'Connor plays Don's sidekick Cosmo Brown.Throughout the movie there is a lot of different types of singing and dancing. It was greatly choreographed with incorporating so many different dance styles.The camera use in this movie was fabulous. The camera angle and height was used all different ways to draw your attention further into the movie. They used the Aerial view in a lot of shots to capture the entire picture within the frame to give us an overall view of the shot.The storyline of thinking fake love was real love, pretending to love to keep fame, finding real love, and recognizing real talent was all put together in a manner that keep my interest and made the movie, funny and intriguing while enjoyable to listen to.",8,0,1,30 October 2014
