Sucker Punch," Dumb
","That's about all I can say. It's possibly the WORST movie I've ever seen,and I only caught a few minutes.What's with the blonde idiot pretending that she can 'fight', when it's painfully obvious that she has NO idea of what she is doing. She certainly can't act!Thank Heavens I was only passing thru the room where it was playing on Netflix.Do Not waste your money on this trash.Trust me on this, it is not worth it. Use your money more wisely, and hope that this drivel will go into the trash can (which is where it belongs!), or show up at a dollar store, only.",1,2,6,1 October 2011
Lifeboat," Addendum
","To the Hitchcock fan, it's always fun to play 'spot Hitchcock' in the movie. Look closely at the newspaper William Bendix is reading!",Null,0,0,31 December 2018
Lifeboat," Great movie!
","I'd not seen this, but have heard a lot about it over the years. Finally got a chance to watch it today, and it was very gripping. I hadn't known that the book was written by Steinbeck, and it's very well done. I had a friend of mine whose mother was a shirttail relation to Slezak, and the face was similar.",Null,0,0,30 December 2018
Gettysburg," VERY well done
","As a major Civil War buff (sometimes to the dismay of my wife - sorry honey!), I love this movie. We just a couple weeks ago got back from a trip to Gettysburg. The trip made the movie just that much more special and realistic for me.Jeff Daniels is excellent in his portrayal of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and he 'gets' the character exactly right. While we all know that Chamberlain was no soldier to begin with, he rises to the occasion and was instrumental in helping to secure Little Round Top, and subsequently the town of Gettysburg. By managing to repel the Confederate forces, Chamberlain and the men he commanded should be praised for what they did.Go to Gettysburg. Take the guided tour bus, and when they stop at Little Round Top, get off, get your pictures, and reflect on exactly what happened here. You'll be glad that you did.A huge thank you to Ronald Maxwell for this excellent movie!",10,1,2,1 October 2011
Dunkirk," Very good!
","I'm glad that Charles Lightoller, 2nd mate of the Titanic, was portrayed as Mr. Dawson. Lightoller did indeed carry 127 British servicemen to safety at Dunkirk, with his son and a local Sea Scout. I found this a very fine movie.",9,0,2,12 August 2018
