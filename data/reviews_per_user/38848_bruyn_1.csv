The Blair Witch Project," Darkness, Car sickness, Parkinsons? Superhype
","Well, having someone who seems to suffer severely from advanced Parkinson shoot a grainy movie in near total darkness made people experience antiperistalsis: the carsickness kind though. Of course I went for the superhype, which worked, and a lot of credit to the inventors of it.  It's an end of the century WWW-hype succesfully marketed and exploited, no problem with that. But... cinematography?  horror? scary? I don't think so. Please generation nixers, do not compare this movie to Tex 1, that movie was innovation (capital i), George Romero was innovation.  I do agree with a lot of horrorfans that when mainstream Hollywood discovered that horror=$$, it lost most of its underground, non-PC avant la lettre, character.  But, supposedly going back to the roots with this 8mm handycam simply will not do for me (nor any of my friends, for that matter).",Null,1,1,2 November 1999
