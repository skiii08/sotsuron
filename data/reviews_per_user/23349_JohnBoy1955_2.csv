The Monuments Men," Monumental Stack of Shite!
","Only got 30 or 40 minutes in to this film and I was really looking forward to it - so many stars and such a bad, bad movie. The whole thing was just a disjointed series of scenes that did not hang together in any way, shape or form. 'Based on a true story' it said at the beginning - if it was it was a very poor attempt at relating it - such a waste of money and talented actors.If you want to watch something war based that at least has some form of plot, character development, humour and a few twists watch Kelly's Heros again, or even The Great Escape.Just bloody awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2,3,16 July 2014
Hereditary," Acting was good, effects not bad - plot, storyline and direction - BULL- poop!
",Save yourself the time this is definitely not worth it. The actors do the best they can with the rubbish provided but it does not work on either a horror or a drama level. I expected some unexpected finale - it just ain't there people.,2,1,4,19 September 2018
