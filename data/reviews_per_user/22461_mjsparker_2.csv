First Man," I remember the moon landing and it was exciting.
","I'm aware that this movie is about the titular first man, Neil Armstrong and yet this seemingly interminable film sucks all the excitement and awe out of one of mankind's greatest achievements. It's sad that the Armstrong's lost a daughter to cancer and that it seems one of their sons was on the Autism spectrum. Stylistically the use of hand held camera added nothing to the narrative as also the too many close ups. The musical choices seemed odd and out of place from the banal to the bombastic final piece. Overall it was like watching a documentary about the making of the film about the moon landing with this particular film unit tasked with following the Armstrong's.",1,169,296,16 October 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Mixed bag
",Kong feels like 3 or 4 movies stitched together badly. Actors seem to be photo shopped into a b grade 50s potboiler. Whilst the skull crawlers are terrific there is clunky humour set against very gruesome splat. The inhabitants of the island need more development and the film concludes in a rush.,2,6,13,28 March 2017
