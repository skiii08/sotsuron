The Devil's Advocate," If I seen it once, I've seen it enough...
","To my knowledge, this film was so frightening. I couldn't even believe Al Pacino has played an evil spirit who offers Keanu Reeves his sinful deals. I like Al Pacino though, he is like a masterpiece. This film was also another of his masterpiece. I have never seen Pacino offer any ladies to anyone else before, it was a miracle when I saw it. He laughed a lot in this film (because I have never seen him laugh a lot in any other of his movies). I also liked Charlize Theron, but only with that one hairstyle when she had dark brown hair and it was combed straight. Plus she has bright eyes. That's what I like about ladies. So I would say that this film was all right. I have meant to see Al Pacino only.",Null,0,1,8 May 2000
Scarface," Tony, Tony, Tony, the masterpiece!
","Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is one mad gangster of all times. He is even powerful than any others. This movie is compared to 'The Godfather' according to his other masterpiece films. When I first time watched this film, I felt so down, then later on, my feelings began to arise by it. How amazing! Al Pacino is like my living hero of all times.",Null,0,0,11 November 1999
Training Day," Good, but different on the other hand...
","I couldn't believe that this film was really from the director of 'The Replacement Killers (1998).' Because I saw T.R.K. as Fuqua's first work, and that had more intense action than this one, like pervasive gunfights. 'Training Day' is pretty good and somewhat realistic, too; but it could have been more better and intense as a decent Los Angeles setting. Other than that, Denzel Washington plays an impressive character whenever he partners with other people. I too, give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,11,23 November 2002
As Good as It Gets," Just as good as it gets!
","Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) looked like a true blue friend in this movie as he helps Greg Kinnear, but then suddenly falls for Helen Hunt.
Though, I didn't like the beating scene; I mostly liked the scenes when Jack, Helen, and Greg go on a brief vacation to a nice place. But then Greg, too, falls for Helen, less than Jack does. Plus I didn't believe that Cuba Gooding Jr. starred in this movie, too. He should of appeared in more scenes, though. Anyway, what I can say is that this movie is like a brilliant lifestyle, a lifestyle which can be as good as it gets.",Null,0,0,18 November 1999
L.A. Confidential," I only liked the fight scenes...
","The fight scenes were very amusing to me as I watched this film-noir movie. I liked that one fight scene especially when Kevin Spacey comes in to this young guy's office, he attacks him so bad like he's very upset. Secondly, I liked the part when one detective gets mad and breaks the chair and attacks a suspect in custody. So I would say that this movie is kind of good, with the gangsters though. This is one history of Los Angeles crimes in the 1950's. What a philosophy!",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
Face_Off," Travolta and Cage, both faced off.
","How could a person live one another's life by taking his own face off and using another person's face? For some people (while watching this film), how would you know 'who is who?' I assume that in real life, there is no such thing as face-changing. This film blew me away so hard as it was making me a huge fan of it. Most of all, I prefer watching extreme fights, strong combat, and BIG KICKS! John Woo is the man! I salute that director! Face/Off is one of the best and great action movies of 1997. I would recommend this film, too.",Null,1,2,7 July 2000
Jerry Maguire," What a Memorable Movie this is!!!!!
","This movie reminded me of when we went to Florida the first time in December 1996, because this movie was released at that time. I felt so happily depressed by watching this movie. Jerry Maguire is a very very handsome, popular motion picture of all. I feel like seeing this movie again soon. I like the front cover of this movie, Tom Cruise looks very handsome in it; he looked so shy and happy. I liked it a lot! And still do.",Null,7,16,6 June 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A 'MUST SEE' action film. John Woo RULES!!!
","I would recommend this second Mission: Impossible movie, rather than the first one. John Woo did a great job. A great great job. He gives out the toughest action films. I cannot say how much I have experienced by watching this. Secondly, I have never seen Tom Cruise fight very much. But this one, made me so amazed.",Null,0,0,2 July 2000
Pretty Woman," Pretty Woman, walking down the street; Pretty Woman, the kind I like to meet....
","Whenever I listen to the song 'Pretty Woman' by Roy Orbison, it always reminds me of Richard Gere, mostly when he is dealing with pretty young women regardless of what film he is in. It looked like Julia Roberts wanted to admire Gere once and for all. This movie was so fresh and clear. I liked the sharp appearances of these two lovers. Richard Gere is like the best man for all of these pretty women.Suppose Richard Gere has a son in real life (which I think he does not), and when the time comes for his son to get married, Richard Gere would really admire his pretty young daughter-in-law. Or, if Richard Gere was my father (which he really is not, but I am just reasoning, no disrespect), he would be super happy if I got a sharp young girlfriend and/or wife and if I still become active to my studies. I would appreciate his quote and support and he would make me feel very special. He would let me deal with as many young ladies as I want to. He would really enjoy watching me as I am being surrounded by them. You know what I mean? Because probably in real life, Richard Gere likes women a lot, and because Richard Gere is one of the ladies men. He still looks so young and pleasing.",Null,0,0,5 February 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," 'Good for you, Andy.'
","Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are in a dynamic role in this film. I could not imagine a lot of innocent people inside a gigantic prison of history. When I saw Clancy Brown first time, looked so tough, he's big too. I also like Clancy's role, too. He should be a great fighter. What is good for Andy Dufrense (Robbins) is that he makes an unbelievable escape route to run away from prison, finally.",Null,0,0,18 December 1999
