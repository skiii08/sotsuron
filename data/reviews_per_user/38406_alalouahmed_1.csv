Vertigo," Masterpiece
","Watching this movie is like taking a ride to the most beautiful beach in the world through the most beautiful forest in the world.
You love the destination and want to get there, but you still love the road and wish it stretched out forever.
You'll be so anxious and curious to know what happened, but you'll also love every scene and not want to skip a second.Brilliant from the master of mystery and genre defining movies, Mr. Alfred Hitchcock",10,0,1,21 November 2019
