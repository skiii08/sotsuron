Ford v Ferrari," Bale is a caricature
","I kind of, sort of, walked out of this movie. Not because it was terrible or anything but I just didn't care about the characters. The movie also wasn't very 'cinematic' although I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that. Now, I am not interested in racing but if you compare this movie to Rush, a movie I waited to see because I wasn't interested in the subject matter, it's night and day. I really enjoyed Rush. It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.The thing that bothered me most was Bale's performance and it might be the worst I've ever seen him do, although that's a pretty high bar. He plays a caricature of someone, not an actual character. And he ruins it for me because the whole family dynamic is awkward. There's 0 chemistry and it doesn't seem real in the least. I couldn't take him or the movie seriously. The scene when his wife is swerving all over the road and yelling at him was weird and out of nowhere. The son barely says a word.The movie is way too long. Every scene seemed to be the same after two hours. Let's have more shots of Matt Damon's character standing in front of the sun. Let's start every scene out with some classic guitar playing for nostalgia's sake to get you excited. The only good scene was when Bale's character talks about the perfect lap, that's it.",3,7,20,4 December 2019
The Sound of Music," Wonderful
","How is this not higher than an 8? That's ridiculous. Think about movies that come out today that are above an 8, would they be anywhere close to this this? Absolutely not. And it's a musical which is tough to do. Technically it's gorgeous as well. This movie is timeless and apparently underrated.",10,1,1,16 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JJ Abrams knows how to make a movie
","It's entertaining and I didn't leave pissed off, even for a life long Star Wars fan. It somehow worked. JJ got me with his nostalgia and lens flares. And Babu. The scenes are insane, all over the place and not long enough to explain anything. The ending is a bit bizarre but maybe because my expectations were so low, I was ok with everything. I was dreading to go see it and waited to see it but I liked it. I mean it's still not Star Wars though.I should probably even give it a 7 but they still hit on Jedi lore and, let's just say, things change in this movie which tells you they had no idea what they were doing in the first place. It's pretty much empty fun. There was a little charm to it. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega have very good chemistry together. Daisy Ridley just had shot after shot of her looking surprised/upset. It got tiresome after awhile. Adam, ya know, even if his character is poorly written he still brings some gravitas to his roles. So if you're on the fence about it, go give it a watch.",6,1,3,5 January 2020
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A gorgeous modern western
",I love this movie. It's top 5 all time for me and criminally underrated (although I think more people know about it now). I remember watching it with a group of people with the lights on in some random hostel in Croatia but after the first 10 minutes I had to walk away. I couldn't watch it in that setting. I needed to experience the movie fully after seeing how good the start was so I watched it later. I was not disappointed. The cast is unbelievable and had many actors earlier in their careers. It has scenes I still will watch to this day and a soundtrack I'll still listen to as well. It is long and maybe even boring for some but totally worth it. There's no reason it shouldn't have been nominated for best picture and original score but I'm glad it got multiple Oscar nominations.Years later I ended up reading the book which was also great. I don't know if there's a better adaptation out there from book to movie. So many lines were straight from it and I would almost argue that you should watch the movie before you read the book(naturally so you can say the lines like the characters in the movie while reading it).,10,2,3,24 November 2019
The King," A work of fiction
","I kind of loved this movie. Very well produced. The musical score throughout was great. From the first panning shot on the battlefield with the setting sun I was hooked. And I don't understand all the complaining about historical inaccuracies. Isn't one of the characters completely based on a character from Shakespeare?
It is over dramatic at times. The one instance that stands out is when Chalamet is arguing with an advisor and there's all this hair in Chalamets face for dramatic affect. Ohhhk get over yourself. There are other instances as well. Also, Chalamet is a good actor but doesn't ever quite pull off being a king.
I thought the script was almost perfect but too modern at times which made no sense. Dropping the f word and some other phrases that were just out of place. Robert Pattinson was a great surprise. Pretty hilarious with his French accent but it worked.
I did not like the script writers character, Falstaff. He was trying too hard. It was like he was trying to be Russell Crowe from gladiator, dropping his voice as low as possible.
But I swear I really did enjoy this movie. The production value is fantastic. I just wish I could see a movie like this in a theater!",9,2,2,4 January 2020
Marriage Story," One of the best in a down year for movies
","A very easy movie to watch even with its heavy subject matter. It will get an Oscar nomination for the script and probably best picture. Anyone complaining about the script needs to get off their high horse. It's certainly better than just about anything out these days. The characters are well established, even the minor ones.
From the first moment and throughout you're reminded of Annie Hall, with the immediate voice over, the way it's shot and all the NYC v LA jokes. Also, Kramer v Kramer does come to mind due to the plot itself. It's not as good as either of those movies. It was funnier at times than I expected so Its not all sad and heartbreaking.
It did get so heavy handed though every time they showed Adam and Scarlett being separated by a fence or pulling their child from both sides. I mean, we get it. They're separating. But overall a very good movie.",8,5,6,4 January 2020
