Deepwater Horizon," Worthwhile -- Better than expected
","I wanted to encourage anyone who thinks something like, 'another beat-up' or 'Hollywood goes disaster' (again...) -- In other words hollow film skimming on what is a Major World Wide event -- Wrong.To my surprise I found the film gripping. It wasn't as engaging as the producers may have indented. It definitely (still) pulled me in. What would make it 'engaging' as well? That's up to you; for me I thought that while the jigsaw parts to engage me were present, the treatment was very superficial (even dismissive).Another point for me is technology -- An oil rig like that is MORE complex and sophisticated than any Nuclear Reactor. Perhaps you can't cover it in a film; you must however explain the critical elements central to the story itself. Things were going well until the absent concrete test report issue was miraculously supplanted by a 'Negative Pressure' test. WHAT?! WHY? Motivation? Engineering? Science? Who explained how the release valve mattered more (or was a management fop?) Gaps in story telling. As I said I still found it grabbed me; may be I just need to read the court transcripts, etc. I definitely recommend watching 'Deepwater Horizon' more than once.",7,0,1,30 June 2017
Pirate Radio," wikipedia entry ...
","Great ol' good clean fun! I got interested enough to see what the real-world inspiration might be. Funny how familiar the wikipedia photo looks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_CarolineI was quite surprised to see that the first pirate station was like 1928. That's pretty cool. It would also be good to find out about some of the characters the DJ-s were modelled on.I have to recommend the 'Deleted Scenes' on the DVD. There's probably a whole 2nd movie there. One of the clips shows how the station managed to stay 'afloat' when the boys get out and about on the town. Won't spoil it, just watch the out-takes!There is also an explanation for why Dave did the dirty on young Carl. He's a bastard!",7,3,4,15 June 2012
Spotlight," compelling
","I had heard about the Globe story -- I had no idea about the grind and drama that went into working these horrific actions. Anyway I hired the movie on a recommendation, if this was a book, I'd be writing 'page turner' -- I have children and my hat is off to the cast, the writers and the actual reporters who have shown us some of the true horror in this world.I don't know how factual the information was in the movie. We've been hearing news reports here about child abuse in all kinds of institutions, women and men, all social areas, etc. I just dread that the '6%' number used in the film, might just be 6% of everyone. That's more than 1 in 20 if 'people are people'.",10,0,0,19 October 2016
The Flowers of War," Great story -- Dreadful, Terrible, Don't turn away -- Experience this Story!
","History or inspired by events can be more than imagination or art. This is one such story, in the telling; ask ..'Why War?!' Ever! Never! The English word for this film is two-edged: Tragedy / Redemption / Pathos ... and * brilliance * Are they three(?), of course -- Because it is just ONE thing. They 'label' you apply, is such and such of your own experience.A friend of mine, discovered around the time she was the same age as these school girls in this film, that her mother needed to escape China; and had been Forced to leave two half-sisters that my friend never, ever knew.I believe my friend learned this from an aunt or cousin but never found the right time to broach the subject with her mother (now passed-on).No one says things -- BUT -- This experience is Too Common by far(!); I've heard tell from Polish, Norweigens, and even Germans & Italians (yes! Even!), Chinese, Korean, Malays, Philipines ... A HUMAN Story.Today we have Daesh!'When will we ever learn' ~ Peter, Paul and Mary",10,1,2,19 September 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not impressed
","For me, it was like 'Sylvania Waters', plus-nothing. A bit like chewing tea. No substance, and not much kick. I'm sure the actors enjoyed themselves. It you want my assessment, is is LAZY and LAX acting, LAZY and LAX direction and just a bit TOO much 'we know something, we won't tell...' HUH!!?Could be the script, the book or just a 'get a movie' published mentality ... summing-up: vacuous.To make a comparison, 'American Psycho' (imho) was a good book and a poor movie. 'Wolf of Wall Street' felt to me like a remake of 'Bonfire of the Vanities' lacking the charm(?) of Bruce Willis... I expected a movie -- Did you like it babie?",1,1,3,4 July 2014
