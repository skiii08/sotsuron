Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effects shame about the script.
","Why oh why won't Hollywood producers spend some money on decent scripts as well as special effects?  Do they really think we are so stupid that we will just be dazzled by computer generated worlds and characters?  Surely George Lucas is rich enough to care about not just getting people into the cinemas but also ensuring them a quality experience when they get there?  This film seems to me to be a tremendous wasted opportunity to create a great drama around magnificent state of the art special effects and visual wonder.Where were the characters?  Neeson and McGregor, both excellent actors, were given nothing to do but wander about fighting droid warriors and some guy in Prodigy make-up who had no personality at all.  Even the Queen spoke like a robot.  The only decent character was the young boy.  Where was the fun, humour and humanity of the earlier films which were character driven not effects driven?  Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia , even Luke had real personalities, and the droids R2D2 and C3P0 were hilarious.  And the films said something about inner truth and trusting ourselves.  This film said nothing at all.Please Mr Lucas feed our intelligence and not just your pocket.",6,1,2,6 July 1999
In Bruges," Quite simply, the best film of the year (so far)!
","The wittiest script since 'All About Eve', combined with deep insights, magnificent performances, brilliant scenery, fine cinematography, excellent music - it's hard to fault this great film. At its core is the superb performance by Colin Farrell, proving yet again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation (check him out in Woody Allen's 'Cassandra's Dream' as well and you'll see what I mean). A perfect blend of comic timing, rough charm and vulnerability - it's a knockout performance. And that's not to diminish the work of Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes or any of the other cast members - even the bit part players are terrific. Best not to say too much about the plot, as it's better to see it with fresh eyes - but Martin McDonagh deserves to be showered with awards for his work as both writer and director (and it's his first feature!). And it's not a bad tourist ad for Bruges either! I hope this film comes up at Oscar time - it truly deserves to.",10,4,8,15 July 2008
Pearl Harbor," Someone get me a pair of scissors!
","What a great film this could have been!  The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from 'Saving Private Ryan' and the sinking of the 'Titanic' as one of the most harrowing 'disaster' sequences filmed in recent years.  But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.Okay - I could almost accept the hokey old love triangle romantic plot - certainly the stars are great to look at - but the dialogue really sucked: 'I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you'. Please!  And all those hero shots from the ground, and the slow motion love bits, and the soppy music, and the eternal sunsets...But what this film really needed was an editor!  The climax of the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor - an American defeat.  But it seems the film-makers decided that the American audience wouldn't be satisfied with this - and so the movie grinds on and on for another hour or so dramatising a revenge attack on Japan.  And we're supposed to believe that this attack was fought by the very same guys who were on the ground in Hawaii.  I mean we all know that America won the war in the end, so did we really need this long epilogue?Personally I'd cut out all the Roosevelt and the Japanese high command scenes and concentrate on the experiences of the people on the ground at Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese stuff was all completely unbelievable anyway. The sad loss would be the superb performance of Jon Voight as Roosevelt - but maybe they could make another film about him.  I'd also end the film after the attack at Pearl Harbor, as the survivors pick up the pieces.  So why not have a shorter Director's Cut - a novel concept - that makes this film the great film it could have been.  If you like I'll lend the scissors!",3,366,634,10 July 2001
La Grande Illusion," I don't get it!
","Why has this film been so praised, so admired, so loved?  It's not a bad little yarn about World War 1 POW's - but its incredible and deep significance escapes me.  In fact I found it a bit of a chore to sit through.The first part of the film is something like 'Hogan's Heroes', with the French POW's having a high old time eating like kings and putting on impossibly elaborate stage shows in drag.  And of course there's the ubiquitous escape tunnel!  Then it becomes a lot of silly ramblings as a French and a German aristocrat mourn the loss of their class - the other major characters are a French workman and a French Jew.  All very deep.  And then it all descends into 'The Great Escape'.Yes, it's all about the stupidity of war - but it makes its point quickly and then rambles on for another hour and a half.  I've always been immune to the charms of over-weight, middle-age French actors like Jean Gabin (and today Mr Depardieu), who we are supposed to find sexy - but Von Stroheim is splendid as the German officer.  He carries a tragic weight, as opposed to a cholesterol-induced one, that is very powerful.Surprisingly ordinary.",7,10,33,17 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," And Tom never even got laid!
","Minor ending to a great career - how sad to end it on what is really just an elaborate 'will I or won't I cheat on my spouse' movie.  Surely there are more important things to worry us at the turn of the century than a bit of hanky panky on the side.Maybe I've lived a very 'full' life but the goings-on witnessed by Tom are all pretty trivial - all he does is visit a prostitute and witness a bunch of wealthy New Yorkers having a masked orgy.  I find it hard to believe that a couple of thirty something rich gorgeous people like Tom and Nicole, living in New York, wouldn't have seen it all before.But anyway good acting, great steadicam work - but Kubrick made better and more profound films than this ('Paths of Glory', 'Dr Strangelove' and '2001' especially).  And when will Hollywood get over the silliness that male genitalia is somehow naughtier than female and never to be show?  And why was Nicole shown nude constantly and Tom never?  Very sexist double standards!  I liked Alan Cumming's cameo though, even if it was stereotyped.",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
Enemy at the Gates," The futility of war, and what causes it.
","I really loved this film.  It is one of the best movies about war - what it is like, and what causes it.  I know some people find the love story hard to take, but it is there to illustrate how jealousy and envy can lead to irrational acts, hate, and even war.At a time when the world is racing toward armed conflict yet again, this film is a timely reminder of the ultimate futility of war.  The opening sequence is one of the most horrific I have ever seen - comparable to that incredible opening scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  But unlike 'Ryan', this film does not become a flag-waving one-sided analysis of war.  Instead we get an in depth, and very moving, look at the reality of being human in a war situation - whether male or female, German or Russian.  And Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris all give superb performances.  I was a bit hard-pressed, though, to believe Bob Hoskins as Krushchev.Jean-Jacques Annaud is a remarkable director, with a strong visual style, and deserves to be recognised as one of the contemporary masters of cinema. Ten out of Ten.",10,62,109,24 November 2001
