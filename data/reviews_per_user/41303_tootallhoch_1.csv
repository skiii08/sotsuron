The Ring," 60 Seconds of Awesomeness
","This movie was about 90 minutes of wasted time leading up to 60 seconds of awesomeness.  If you've seen it, you'll know the 60 seconds I'm referring to.  It's the only truly scary (and satisfying) part of the movie.  I would recommend renting it and not wasting the money for theater tickets on it. There's a good possibility that the sequel to this movie could be better than the original.",Null,1,2,11 November 2002
