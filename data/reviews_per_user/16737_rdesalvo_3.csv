Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good sci-fi movie; so-so Star Wars movie
","I waited 17 years for this movie.  Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in a theater (I was seven).  Needless to say, I was expecting a lot from the newest entry in the Star Wars saga and I must admit I was slightly disappointed in what I feel is the weakest of all the films.Lucas spared no expense on special effects, but the eye-popping CGI effects in this movie are so perfect that they are almost TOO perfect.  In many ways, the original Star Wars films -- with their models of space ships and on-location sets -- look more realistic than entire landscapes and battle scenes done on computers, IMHO.This is a movie for kids of today, not kids like me who grew up with Star Wars and are now twentysomethings.  There is no other explanation for the annoying presence of the computer-animated character Jar Jar Binks, who seems to serve no other purpose than to interrupt otherwise serious dialogue with barely decipherable, inane banter (he sounds like a Jamaican on crack). Sure, the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi were annoying and almost sank that epic, but at least they didn't speak English.  Jeez.  I anticipate a slew of 'I hate Jar Jar' pages after this movie is released to the general public.Episode I is filled with non-stop action and I enjoyed seeing familiar characters like Yoda, Tuskan Raiders, Jawas, Jabba the Hutt and especially C3PO and R2-D2, because we get to see how they met for the first time. Natalie Portman is lovely as the queen and her costumes are exquisite. Liam Neeson could have benefitted from some caffeine for this role -- he looked bored as hell.  Ditto for Ewan McGregor.  In fact, many of the characters droned on and on in monotone voices -- there were no colorful personalities like Leia or Han Solo, which really hurt this film.  Even Darth Maul, the bad-ass Sith who looks so cool and has a great musical theme when he is on-screen, doesn't have enough screen time.  Actually, NO ONE is given enough screen time for us to develop any real attachment to except Jar Jar Binks, who is deposited in almost every scene for what Lucas must have felt was necessary 'comic relief.'  At least the light-saber battle with Maul, Neeson and McGregor was killer (a-hem!).I know I'm dwelling on the disappointing aspects of Episode I but don't get me wrong -- this is a compelling science-fiction film, competently made and certainly no embarrassment.  But 'Star Wars' is so much more than that, and this one is lacking some of the magic.",6,2,3,11 May 1999
Brokeback Mountain," 12 Things I Learned from Brokeback Mountain
","Although I was strangely unmoved by director Ang Lee's noble attempt to make the masses forget The Hulk ever happened, it doesn't mean I walked away from Brokeback Mountain completely empty-handed. Here are a few valuable things I learned from America's favorite gay cowboy opus.1. Copious amounts of beans and whiskey will make you gay. Like, barebacking gay.2. Dishes, dishes, dishes. There is an inordinate amount of dishes to be cleaned in the '60s and '70s, but, thankfully, Michelle Williams really knows her way around a kitchen sink -- as does this director.3. Anne Hathaway really knows her way around a wig.4. It is very difficult to express all the important, heartfelt things you have to say to your new gay cowboy lover with a bunch of marbles and peanut butter in your mouth, but you'll still get nominated for an Oscar.5. Every guy in Texas is a closeted gay EXCEPT the rodeo clown.6. People didn't age in the '70s...they just grew sideburns.7. Any time you have sex with a woman instead of your gay cowboy lover, she'll have a baby--in the next scene.8. Children do nothing but scream, cry and break things in stores. (And prompt you to go fishing with your gay cowboy lover).9. There are no gay hustlers in Texas, but they are all over the place in Mexico.10. It is a way better idea to wait out the sexual revolution and risk a painful death at the hands of homophobic hicks in Wyoming or Texas instead of moving with your gay cowboy lover to -- gee, I dunno -- San Francisco or Fire Island.11. If a movie is over 130 minutes, it means that it is really, really important. Like, Oscar important.12. Gay sex is excruciatingly boring -- even with Donnie Darko. Who knew?",4,19,71,17 January 2006
Pitch Black," Dark, tense sci-fi stunner in the tradition of Alien
","Some critics will say this movie is derivative of Alien, but it sure was a fun ride.  I have two words for you: Vin Diesel.  Watch him -- he makes this movie more than just another stalk-and-slash exercise.  Some people are calling this 'Scream in Space,' which I think is unfair.  I loved Scream, but I didn't find this movie to be jokey or littered with pop-culture references.  It is just a tight, well-executed, tense and clever spin on the 'we crash landed on an alien world and now creatures are trying to eat us' tale.",9,0,0,12 October 1999
