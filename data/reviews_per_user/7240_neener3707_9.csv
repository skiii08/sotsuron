Hereditary," Hellish, Terrifying, Perfect
","I don't even know where to begin with this one. When I heard that it was being made by some of the same people who worked on The Witch (which some people didn't like, but I liked it), I had high hope for this film, and boy was I not disappointed. Such a breath of fresh air for the genre in a time where Hollywood has prostituted it and released nothing but garbage. Not only was the film scary as hell, but it also had a lot to say about grief and trauma. The way the film is put together is its strongest part. The pacing, the editing, the cinematography, and the sound design all worked together to create a truly unique and hellish vision of horror. I'm a horror veteran, and rarely actually jump or feel tense, but this film made me feel like a horror virgin again, actually frightening me like no other Hollywood film can.The acting was also superb all around and only adds to the horror being presented on screen. Each character was unique and added their own style to this modern horror masterpiece. I saw many people in the theater jumping and looking away, some being grown men. A couple people even left, and I can't imagine its because they felt it was a bad film, because it was not. I am seriously considering going and seeing it again which hasn't happened since the Evil Dead remake and The Raid. I would say this film is a must see for any horror fan or for anyone wanting to be scared out of their minds.",10,356,685,8 June 2018
Akira," An Anime So Good, Even Anime Haters Will Love It
","I recently saw Akira for the first time, and I'm not a big fan of anime, but I must say this film blew me away. Set in Neo-Tokyo, a city built on an artificial island after a devastating nuclear war destroys not only Tokyo, but the rest of the world. A member of a motorcycle gang named Tetsuo has a chance encounter with a strange boy which unlocks secret telekinetic abilities within him. Tetsuo cannot control these abilities as they take him over in a ferocious rampage to find this enigmatic character known as Akria. Now, his friends, a group of psychics, and the Neo-Tokyo military attempt to stop him before its too late.Akira's art style is unlike anything of the genre, its colors and design is something you would see in a fever dream. The direction is excellent and the world is perfectly created to make a unique and amazing universe that quite obviously inspired many future films. The story is very complicated, the beginning goes by very fast, but it doesn't take away from the film, in fact, it demands a second viewing from you the moment ends. US companies spent over 1 million dollars to restore the visuals as well as adding an entire new soundtrack/sound FX, which was definitely worth every penny, as the film is spectacular to the senses.Over all, its a superb film that requires multiple viewings. Highly recommended.",9,3,6,16 January 2018
Us," SO MUCH POTENTIAL - UGH!
","Such a great idea for a film, such great actors (except one, I'll talk of that later), such great visuals! But holy dang was that an incredibly amateur attempt at a horror movie. I live in Santa Cruz so I was very excited to watch it. But.... sigh.... it just wasn't very scary. Not to mention how ridiculously long certain scenes dragged on. Not sure if it was attempt at a slow-burn style film, but the slow burn was more boring that tense. We get barely any family dialog, so we dont know or care about the dynamic, which makes certain scenes totally un-effective.As I mentioned I didn't like one actor, but rather one character. One of the 'Us' speaks while the rest don't. I understand there is a reason for this (twist ending) but it just really takes you out of it. It would have been much more effective to have them all silent and grunting. They wanted her to talk so she could explain whats going on, when we don't need context. First of all you don't need an explanation to understand the story, so it made me roll my eyes and think 'MOVE ON'. Many masterpieces of cinema don't explain anything (just look at Kubrick) because a sense of confusion adds to the mystery of the film.Earthshatteringly disappointing.",4,2,5,23 March 2019
Deadpool 2," The Second Coming
","When the first Deadpool came out, I, like many people, was enamored with it and it was the first MCU film that I liked in at least 5 years. It was just such a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre, it was fun, silly, violent, and didn't take itself seriously like heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America. This sequel was more of the same but just a little more action, jokes, and hilarity. You've seen the trailer so you know what its about, and the story was just secondary, I came for the violence and jokes, and it darn well delivered. Its like the started where they left on the first one, the tone is exactly the same, this childish hilarity that we all loved so much. The action was cinematic just like the first one, and the up the violence a little so that was nice. This film, like the first, was a unique film in a sea of the same old trash.",9,3,6,18 May 2018
Ready Player One," An Adventure With A Lot To Say
","Yes it wasn't 100% faithful to the book, but boy it was quite an adventure that had much to say about our current times. You should know the plot by now, if you don't, watch the trailer. I went into it thinking it was going to be another questionable book movie, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much it had to say bout our society and humanity. Other than the obvious one of our interest in video games because of our disappointing lives. But more than that it discusses things like the use of micro-transactions that ruin peoples financial situations, why we cherish friends or significant others even though we only know them on the internet and have never met them, and many other things. So this is classic sci-fi in the sense that it has something to say about our current society and culture.And about the inaccuracies to the book, there weren't to many, and I won't elaborate so I wont spoil anything, but honestly the inaccuracies didn't really take away from the film like many other times in book adaptations or remakes. The special effects were obviously beautiful and I was visually dazzled the entire time. The problem with most CGI orgies like Marvel movies and many others, is they lack the story to make it great, and thankfully this film did not fall into this category. It retains spectacular visuals while still maintaining a good story to keep you at least mildly engaged. I came for the visual effects, and left with a surprising feeling that it was much more than that. Some of the humor in it was hit and miss, some I laughed at, and some I rolled my eyes and felt it was lame, but again it doesn't take away from the experience.Would definitely recommend it, even to purists who read the book.",8,3,9,30 March 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," MUCH Better Than The Usually Average MCU Schlock
","I was afraid at first, the MCU movies are often not as great as they were in past times, but boy was I satisfied. I found little of the things I dislike in super hero movies, instead I found (finally) interesting dialog and action sequences more unique than others. This was not your typical boring 'city destroyed by someone', it was more unique and differently choreographed and I definitely enjoy the action sequences. Don't get me wrong, I personally disliked some things, but over all I was pleasantly surprised by a fun movie going experience instead of another predictable super hero movies. I am normally disappointing by super hero movies, but this one held me more than most, and its definitely well above average as far as MCU is concerned. The humor was also really ood and not corny like previous MCU movies, but I'll explain why later.So I said what I liked and I will say more, but lets talk about what I didn't like. First of all, I wasn't a fan of Captain America's beard, especially since he's my favorite, but thats my personal opinion. Without giving to much away, I didn't like the alterations to Spiderman's suit. Also I didn't like how they re-wrote The Hulk's condition. In canon, it happens when he gets angry, but now suddenly The Hulk side decides whether or not he shows up, as if choosing what type of angry will trigger him. I LOVED the additions of the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers movies, the truly brought their specific type of humor to the film and I thoroughly enjoyed it, they fit in so perfectly and added a new style to the series. All in all it was much better than the average MCU film, and I would recommend it to people who now dislike super hero movies.",5,1,5,27 April 2018
A Quiet Place," An Eternally Tense Thriller
","I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer, I felt like it showed the whole movie, assuming that the birth scene would be the finale of the film, but it happens less than half way through the film and the film had so much more to offer. It was eternally intense thriller that kept me and everyone else in the theater on the edge of their seats. I was also worried that the film wouldn't effectively portray the silence and intensity, boy was I wrong, the films quietness and also the way it was filmed gave a true sense of uncertainty and fear. I'll be honest not all the scares got me, but several of them did, and did very effectively, especially considered I am a horror veteran. I found the pacing and intensity to be very effect and kept me on the edge of my seat. And reacting to the audience reactions, everyone else was more scared than I am.Not only the horror aspect was good, but the dynamic between the family is also very well done. You truly feel like this was a family that love each other and John Krazinski and Emily Blunt do a wonderful job portraying not only the love between mother and father as well as the true love between parents and their children. The bad and good dynamic of children on their parents is on full display as well as the constant fear of protecting our children. The cinematography was great, it only added to the tense feeling in scenes, I found many of the shots to be unique and well shot. The monsters were bad ass as hell and are definitely scary, not only what they do but what they look like.I highly recommend it.",9,183,365,6 April 2018
Black Panther," Another Piece Of Marvel Trash
","Th critics are either liars our were paid to say this was the best Marvel Movie, tis film comes NOWHERE CLOSE to films like the original Iron Man, Deadpool, or Logan. This was definitely an attempt the fashionable diversity quotas in Hollywood nowadays. Other than the ooh aah special effects, this film offered little substance than what was already on the surface. I get it, powerful African Americans and females are popular right now but this film just shoves it in your face, I was really turned off by it. I considered leaving the film about halfway through but figured I payed for it, might as well finish it.As I said the spectacles were are as to be expected with the wild high budgets of Marvel films. With that it had some unique special effects and wild rides that I suppose are worth the price of admission. But th story is just atrocious, poorly written and really did not suck me in. During scenes of dialogue I rolled my eyes and just waited for the next sequence of special effects. And again, I've got no problem with films about minority culture, I find them very interesting, but this was just in your face propaganda, it was just so terrible, I was truly turned off this film.I would say skip this trash.",3,52,120,16 February 2018
Annihilation," A Very Unique Film - Enjoyed It Thoroughly
","Though many will see the beginning as slow, but boys is continuing watching worth, I found this to be a very unique and refreshing film in the wake of super hero trash and remakes/sequels. You know the story already, if you don't watch the trailer, and even the trailer doesn't even scratch the surface of the mind being descent into the unknown. I found the pacing and structures of the film to be well made, as well as the direction, the soundtrack only enhanced the unique visuals ans scenes of intensity. While the story seems vague and predictable, but the film takes a hard right turn, blowing your mind. I can't tell you how much I wanted to clap at the final twist.I have a feeling many people won't fully understand, as the film is highly sophisticated when it comes to scientific explanations about whats supposedly going on. You will have so many question while you watch the film. Te only real things a disliked was the opening and some of the sub-plots. I found the opening an odd choice by the director and expended different, and there were several sub-plots I found to be unnecessary. But these were just minor inconveniences and didn't really take me out of the film experience.I would highly recommend this.",9,178,377,23 February 2018
