Walk the Line," What a great movie!
","What can I say? I went to the cinema today with my 15 yr old daughter. Even as we were queueing for the tickets I wondered if we were doing the right thing. I don't like Jonny Cash and I hate country and western music.... but the reviews were so good we thought we'd give it a try. And were we glad we did! It's a terrific movie - good storyline, brilliant acting and even the songs are terrific. My feet were tapping and some scenes moved me to tears. Reese Witherspoon is so versatile - she slips into this role effortlessly. Joaquim Phoenix is made for the part. He plays a charismatic flawed individual that your heart just goes out to. If you're looking to be entertained, and want a movie that's intelligent - and not full of f-words (unfortunately so many US movies are blighted by F*** all the way through)give it a try.. you won't be disappointed.10/10",10,0,0,4 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Awesome performance by Russell Crowe
",Beautifully filmed movie.  The sensitive subject of schizophrenia is treated very sympathetically.  I now appreciate the enormous suffering and torment people with this illness endure.  An uplifting and moving portrayal of a mathematical genius.  A movie not to be missed.,10,0,1,10 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Awesomely beautiful
","This is movie making at its superlative best .... imaginative, innovative, sensitive and visually superb.  Tolkien said that LOTR was not based on anything, and was not allegorical.  That may be true but you can't help but think that his time in the trenches in WW1 had an enormous impact on him which he exorcised in the writing of the LOTR trilogy. 
The brutality of hand to hand combat, the desecration of the land and the power of an evil mastermind ultimately leading to death on a scale never seen before.  I doubt that anyone could have made a better movie version of the trilogy than Peter Jackson.  What can we look forward to next from this creative genius?",10,1,2,1 January 2004
