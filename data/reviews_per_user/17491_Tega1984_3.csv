Alien 3," Finchers worst.
","OK. If this movie was directed by some 'bad' director, I would not be so disappointed. But this is fincher. Guy who had directed a true masterpiece. I hope you all understand what movie I'm talking about-Fight club. But this one..... is way too bad.. for fincher of course.It's very moody and gloomy and depressive... of course fincher has tendency to direct such type of movies... I mean fight club and seven are quite depressive and moody too... but we are talking about alien right? this must be an action movie.. sci-fi action, it must not be a movie you should think about. it must be like two previous movies. just entertaining. but this one is not. The only excuse for fincher is that this is his first movie and I'm glad that he compensated this failure by such masterpieces as seven and fight club.",5,17,28,25 June 2007
Alien vs. Predator," It's a sin.
","I'm talking serious.IT'S A SIN to spoil such good movie.....two good movies!! predator and alien.The first is one of my favourites and the other is just classic. I mean paul anderson.....was good when he directed mortal combat, it was great! But with this movie...he turned both predator and alien fans into his enemies. predator 3 would be a great sequel, but now everything is ruined!. after this disaster predator 3 even if it will be directed won't be good. this movie is a total shame.Where did anderson get such poor actors? what was he thinking of when he was directing this crap? I mean..... I'm sure he wanted to direct some hit... but what did he hope for whith such bad actors and bad screenplay? The only good actor in the movie is lance henriksen but in this movie he is bad too!I'm sure this is his worst movie.When I saw alien 3(fincher) I thought nothing could be worse, but I was wrong! Compared to THIS alien 3 is a masterpiece. OK. I'm done. I'll try to forget this NIGHTMARE as soon as possible.",1,0,2,25 June 2007
300," Not What I Expected.
","At first I saw the trailer of this movie and I was amazed. Then I asked 2 of my relatives who had watched this movie whether they liked it or not and they said that the movie was great and advice me to watch it too. Tehy said that the movie was just fantastic and I would be amazed too. Well.... I watched this movie few hours ago and was totally disappointed. I expected much more from 300.Having watched the trailer I expected the action scenes to be much longer.There are quote a lot of clichÃ©s in the movie and the acting is far from best.To sum up the movie doesn't have any meaning and doesn't make any sense. This movie is obviously made for entertainment,it's not one of those movies which leaves something to think about to you.The problem is that 300 isn't that good for entertainment too, it's not one of those movies which you can watch over and over just for fun.I mean there are lot of movies witch make no sense but are quite good entertaining movies you can watch lot of times.Personally I don't have any wish to watch this movie again,it was pure disappointment for me.",5,1,1,27 June 2007
