Ali," well made
","this movie is a very good adaptation of the life of the most talented controversial and important sporting hero of modern times.a lot of people probably didn't like the movie because they we're expecting to see non stop action,but the movie deals with the most important parts in the life of this legendary boxer.when the fight scenes do come though they are awesome,particuarly the first fight against sonny liston.will smith plays ali better than anyone else probably could.although a bit long and drawn out at times this movie is still enjoyable if only to serve as a reminder of how important and iconic a sportsman ali was,quite simply the greatest boxer that has ever lived and probably the greatest their ever will be.",Null,0,0,12 August 2002
United 93," Wow
","I have been going to the cinema for over 30 years now and i have never ever watched a movie as powerful,moving and intense as this.this was so well made it was almost as if you were on that plane with those passengers.like someone else on here quite rightly said the last fifteen minutes of this movie were awesome and it will have anyone who watches is it totally engrossed by the events unfolding before them.It's not just the drama on the plane that this movie should be commended for either,the scenes shot in the control room showing events unfolding on that fateful day were equally as dramatic and the footage of them watching those two planes crash into the world trade centres borough back all those memories of just how astounded people were when this happened.I know you have probably heard this before but for once heed this advice,if you are easily upset or a bit squeamish then choose to watch another movie showing at the cinema because this is about as powerful as it gets and had me actually feeling drained when i came out of the cinema.someone else has said it's required viewing for all Americans,maybe that should be changed to required viewing for all Westerners.Brilliant.",10,4,8,20 July 2006
The Village," oh dear
","All you poor little people that went to the cinema expecting to be scared witless and come away feeling disappointed.M Night Shymalan once again shows his unique talent for storytelling,a gift that served him well in his debut film the sixth sense and although not as good,in both unbreakable and signs.Here we have a movie set in a small village concerning a group of people who fear the legend of the creatures in the wood.What develops over the next 2 hours is not a tale of things that go bump in the night or bad things lurking in the dark,but a tale of human sacrifice and love,although it did have his usual jumpy parts and the scene set in the woods toward the end involving the young blind girl was as genuinely scary as any I've seen.I enjoyed this film immensely and the acting especially from brody was as good as you'll see this year.The message this film does send out is of fear but not the kind I think many people we're expecting,but a kind far worse and more real to all of us in everyday life,hence the decision to isolate themselves in this place.I'll continue to watch Shymalans movies and enjoy them,in todays world of expensive hollywood blockbusters and cheesy franchises,M Night Shymalan make a refreshing alternative to those intelligent enough to appreciate his film making.",Null,0,0,31 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," breathtaking
","just been to see this movie for the second time this week and like the first one last year it is going to get better each time i watch it.The first hour of the fellowship is spent getting to know each one of the main characters and the movie takes some time before the real action begins,not so with the two towers from practically the first sequence the pace is set and doesn't let up until the finale.It's got everything great acting, beautiful landscapes,amazing battle scenes jaw dropping special affects gollum is fantastic and so realistic it's hard to believe it's a computer generated image and not a real life creature.The best three hours i have ever spent in a cinema and the third installment is supposed to be better,wow I can hardly wait,if you do anything over the festive holiday period then go and see this movie  promise you wont be disappointed.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
Saw," oh dear
","Being a fan of this genre I did have high hopes for this movie,looked quite good on the trailers and one or two decent things we're written about it so off I went to the movie cinema anticipating a decent psychological thriller along the lines of seven.To begin with the story was quite good and I remember thinking this is going to be quite a decent movie then it just got sillier and sillier and collapsed into what became little short of a comedy towards the end when the acting became nothing short of embarrassing and the plot unfolded into a bad mixture of seven,the bone collector and silence of the lambs,nobody minds a writer borrowing a little from other movies,but when the whole thing is pinched so deliberately from stuff you've seen before it then gives what you are watching no credibility and turns into nothing short of a farce.Go see this if you want to be entertained,i gaurantee you'll have a good laugh,but if you are a fan of thrillers like myself stay well away,you'll be disappointed.",Null,0,0,14 October 2004
