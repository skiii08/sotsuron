The Equalizer," More equal than other action movies
","Bobby, a widower lives alone. He has a simple life working for a Home Improvement Store. He does not sleep so well and frequently visits a local diner at night to read books and drink tea. During this visits he befriends a young Russian prostitute Alina. After some time and an involuntary hospital visit of Alina caused by her employer, Bobby decides to intervene and pay this man a visit.Watching the Equalizer is like a 90 minute déjà vu (no pun intended). There is not much originality in the story or execution of it. This does not mean that it is not entertaining though. Denzel Washington is capable and charismatic enough to capture and hold the attention for the most part of the movie. The action sequences are well choreographed and executed. But as I said, these roads have been traveled before and The Equalizer does not bring anything new to equation.",7,1,5,16 December 2014
John Wick," Superior action flick
","A hit man comes out of retirement to go after the man that invaded his home, stole his car and killed his dog. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, a one man army on a mission to get his revenge, and he will not be denied.The plot is thin. Strengths lie in the tempo, the action sequences and the cinematography. The overall cast is amazing with (too) small roles for Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick. The fighting choreography is fresh and inventive. A nice find is the depiction of secret 'gun for hire order' with its own code of conduct, form of payment and neutral meeting place in the local Continental Hotel.This is one of the better action flicks I have seen lately. Strap in and enjoy the ride!",7,1,7,21 January 2015
Fury," Raw and gritty
","Sergeant Don Collier aka Wardaddy is the commander of a Sherman tank named Fury and its diverse crew. Situated in the last days of the second world war the allied forces are confronted with the last fanatical resistance of the German forces. Allied troops are facing low morale confronted with the absurdities and pointlessness of war.After the Fury turns back as the sole remainder of a mission, a green soldier has been assigned to join the crew to replace a fallen comrade. Soon the crew is on the road again and after some skirmishes send to protect a crossroads from an overwhelming enemy force, to prevent a slaughter of nearby unarmed allied army personnel.This war drama is gritty and raw without much humor. It made me feel uncomfortable at times, but not in a good way. Particularly the rookie initiation and dinner at the Germans scenes felt wrong and awkward. To sum it all up: Fury is a solid war movie with a nice cast and too few actual tank battle sequences.",7,7,14,13 January 2015
The Maze Runner," Not much actual maze and running
","Every month a cargo lift arrives at a circular glade surrounded by walls. The lift contains provisions , animals and every month a boy with no memory of his past. Every day the walls open up to a maze, at dusk the maze is closed off. At night the maze is inhabited by unfriendly spider-like creatures called grievers.The film opens up following a new member of the all-male/boy community in the lift up to the glade. This turns out to be our protagonist Thomas. Thomas is initiated in the community by Alby, most senior and the first one to arrive at the glade. Thomas is soon drawn to the maze, but as it turn out only runners are allowed to enter and explore it. The coming of Thomas and the events he sets in motion are likely to divide the glade community in those who want to stay in the relative safety of the glade and the ones that want answers and unrestricted freedom.The movie is entertaining in its way but lacks depth and subtlety. Maybe that was not a necessity for the target audience, but it would have made a much better movie. The ending also could only have been less elegant by a cut to black and a full screen 'to be continued' message.",6,1,3,7 December 2014

Gone Girl," Stylish and entertaining
","On the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy vanishes from her home. When her husband Nick returns home, their front door is open. There are signs of struggle in the house. After a first visit of the police, a more thorough crime scene investigation follows. Amy has a special way to celebrate anniversaries for the last years by organizing treasure hunts for Nick. During the investigation clue one is found in the kitchen. When Nick and a pair of detectives follow up on the first clue in Nick's office, things take a turn when the clue hints to Nick having an affair.This is another stylish thriller by David Fincher based on the bestseller by Gillian Flynn, who was also responsible for the screenplay. Fincher cleverly makes use of non chronological storytelling by way of flashbacks for a better understanding of the relationship between Nick and Amy through time. The Ross/Reznor score is subtle but effectively creates an unique and fitting sound scape.Personally, I am a bit ambivalent about the ending. The final resolution is thought provoking, but certain decisions made by the main characters feel a bit 'off'.",8,0,5,16 December 2014
3 Idiots," Entertaining but overrated
","3 Idiots tells the story of three college friends; Rancho, Raju and Farhan. Rancho disappears after his graduation. When after years of absence a trail to his whereabouts emerges, the two friends set out to find him. During this road trip, the origin and history of their special friendship is told.3 idiots is a typical Bollywood production with some songs and dance choreography's. The shots are wonderful and the movie breathes an atmosphere of 'joi de vivre' and playfulness. The casting of the main characters is on point and they seem to be enjoying themselves. The central morale/message that is conveyed in the flick is universally recognizable but put on way too heavy to my taste.I must admit that I am not a frequent viewer of the Bollywoord genre, I came across the title reviewing the IMDb top 250 and became curious because of the high rating. Although the movie certainly is worth your while, I personally feel the rating is a bit inflated",7,0,3,14 December 2015
Sicario," War on drugs you do not control
","Kate is part of an FBI abduction task-force, dealing mostly with drug-related crime. She is invited to a joint operation to neutralize a major Mexican drug-lord, whose handiwork she has often seen in her career. During the operation her personal boundaries and beliefs are greatly challenged.The cast is good, especially Del Toro and Brolin are outstanding. Main character Kate, portrayed by Emily Blunt is a bit bland to my liking and gets overshadowed by her male counterparts. She also seems just a little bit too pretty for the part. The cinematography, editing and score are on par.Overall Sicario is a well constructed movie. The ambiguous US drug -and foreign affair policy and the tension between the various law enforcement parties makes this movie a fascinating view.",7,1,3,21 December 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Homage to the pioneers of gangsta rap
","This is not an Oscar winning feature. It is definitely well made and brings back fond memories to the day and age when rap-music took a rebellious turn, But in the end it is just another biopic.I was impressed though by the acting of O'Shea Jackson Junior playing his Ice Cube, the eerie likeliness to his father in posture and demeanor gives the movie a deeper sense of realism. Also worth mentioning is a fantastic Giamatti as agent Jerry Heller. I think he will get a leading male Oscar within the next three years if he keeps his game up so to speak.I do believe Dre and Cube were the heart and soul of NWA and are musical en lyrical masters of their trade, in this movie however they are portrayed as saints. I enjoyed reliving past memories and a bit more insight in the story of NWA, Cube and Dre, the score is dope. I Say two and a half hours well-spent. Word...",7,18,56,9 January 2016
Sully," Another solid movie from Eastwood
","Most people in the western world saw or heard about the miracle of the Hudson, where captain Sullenberger managed to land his severely damaged airplane on the Hudson river without any casualties. The film centers on Sullenberger and the crash investigation that questioned his choice to land on the river instead of returning to nearby airports.With a relatively short run-time of 96 minutes it surprised me how rich a story Eastwood managed to make. With clever non-linear storytelling and repeating events from multiple perspectives he puts out a strong and compelling story.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the captain Sullenberger, Aaron Eckhart who plays the part of co-pilot, does not get the chance to shine unfortunately.",7,0,1,26 September 2016
