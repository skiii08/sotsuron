Requiem for a Dream," Most incredible movie ever
","When i rented this movie, i didn't know how f*cking intense and good it was. I don't want to talk to much about this film because you must see for yourself.When the movie was done I was just shocked and for about 4 hours the only thing on my mind was the true pity i felt for the people in this movie.This movie is brilliant, i can watch it over and over again. It still takes my breath away.A must see !!!",10,0,0,24 April 2003
