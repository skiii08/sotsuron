Resident Evil: Afterlife," Paul Anderson shows again he can turn Pure Gold into Feces!
","The so called Resident Evil movies are mislabeled, they're not Resident Evil, they're just generic zombie movies with Resident Evil slapped across the title, I still don't understand how Capcom allowed the movies to carry the popular Resident Evil name, they never stick to the story, it has an amazing number of errors which include 98% of the movie being not true to the actual story found in the games.In a Nutshell, disappointing. The movie was made into a damn action film all over, there's no suspense just incredibly cheesy action scenes and weak tension, this is where I say Paul Anderson is an absolute idiot.The people who like the movie series have obviously never played the game or they have played the game but never got around knowing the story well, if you did you wouldn't be asking yourself throughout the movie 'what the hell am I watching?!' I give it a 1/10 mainly because it doesn't stick to the real story AT ALL, there's ZERO suspense, too many cheesy action and effects **I can't emphasize more how cheesy this movie is** and last but not least it's not a survival horror movie, it's just a stupid action movie with zombies in it... quite frankly Night of the Living Dead deserves more to be called Resident Evil.",1,16,31,19 September 2010
