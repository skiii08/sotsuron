","This movie is soooo funny. I couldn't stop laughing. My favorite part is '10 second Tom.' 'Hi i'm Tom,' he'd say every 10 seconds, of course. hehe! This movie I will def go out and buy. The movie is truly a romantic comedy classic, better than Pretty Woman and Pretty in Pink. For anyone who wants to laugh and fall in love at the same time, go to your local movie store and rent Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in 50 First Dates. Oh and don't forget Rob Schneider he was funny too. Seriously when he plays Ulla it's just to die, but not as funny as 10 Second Tom. So stop reading my comment and get over to a Best Buy or Target or Wal Mart or Circuit City or whatever and get 50 First Dates for your collection now. ...............'Hi I'm Tom'",9,0,1,31 January 2007
