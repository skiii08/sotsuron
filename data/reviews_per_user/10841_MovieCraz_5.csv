Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode 1: The Boring Politics
","Over the span of a few weeks I just finished watching all of the Star Wars franchise over again, and this movie is not bad at all. It is watchable and somewhat enjoyable, but it's not as good as the original series. Kids will love it without a doubt, but for adults, it can get a little boring after a while.I watched this movie in 1 1/2 hour increments (two days), because the movies are so long. I remember loving it without a doubt as a kid, but I began to notice how much this movie is lacking. But before I blast it, I want to tell what I liked about the movie.I loved the cast (SO many great actors!), Naboo was very pretty, the races on Tatooine were cool, and there were plenty of aliens! What I didn't like. 1: The boring politic dribble. Okay, I know politics play a key role in the republic, but come on. An entire half of the movie was political rambling that I didn't even understand. I honestly felt like fast- forwarding through all of it, but to write this review, I watched every frame. *sigh* If you're going to make a movie with a bunch of politics, please make it coherent, interesting, and understandable. 2: Midi-Chlorians and Anakins' birth. WHAT THE CRAP. Are you trying to tell me the force is comprised of all-knowing all-powerful cell particles and that Anakin was born from nothing!? How? What? WHY!? That is pretty sick and twisted. The cell particles lumped together inside Smi to create Anakin, which means he's a flipping Huge-Chlorian. *facepalm*3: Jar Jar Binks. Good gosh. Lock him in a closet and throw away the key! This guy is the most irritating, nonsensical idiot I've ever seen. In my mind I pictured a thousand deaths worthy of this boob. And yet he appears in ALL THREE MOVIES.4: Why do you create two cool characters (Qui-gon Jinn and the Phantom Menace) only to kill them in the same movie. AND it was a really quick battle that could have been epic if they had cut out a half hour of the politics and sprinkled some force juice and more Jedi in.5: The script was dry.6: Another celebration ending.It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. It's worth watching at least once. But now you've been properly briefed.",6,0,3,15 December 2016
Star Trek," Funny, Engaging, and Totally Worth Seeing!
","I've always liked Star Trek. I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie, but I would say that I have enjoyed watching the Star Trek universe thoroughly. I've seen almost every single movie and TV series in the franchise. Some were great, some OK, and some were just a very, very bad failure. It's been quite a roller coaster ride for Star Trek, but I think we are finally on the right Trek.First let me just say: I LOVE THE CAST. Chris Pine (James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (Leonard McCoy) and the rest of the wonderful cast made the movie. And to bring back Leonard Nimoy was a stroke of genius. The script was great, the jokes hilarious, the acting was phenomenal and we finally have a Star Trek movie with fantastic graphics!!!! (Although I think they went a little overboard on the haze lights.) The person who decided to put Spock and Uhura together is a genius. Their relationship just works. I don't know why it wasn't thought of before. I just hope this relationship lasts and we end up seeing Spock and Uhura tying the knot in the fourth installment. (something Star Trek has almost never done.) Please please please keep them together!Now onto what I do think needs a bit of work:1: I do think the Romulans needed to look more like aliens and less like bald tattoo'd humans. I was never really scared of them either. They kind of just looked like a biker gang in space with a cool ship.2:I'd like to have seen more aliens than humans, but, it didn't feel any less Star Trek without them. 3:They portrayed Kirk as a wimpy, selfish, womanizing jerk throughout. It got better as the film went on but he really only improved by the end of the next film Star Trek: Into Darkness. 4:Kirk progressed way too fast to captain and everything seems to step aside every time he loses the chair to let him regain it. (Both in this film and Star Trek: Into Darkness.)5:The bar scene exchange between Kirk and Uhura was WAAAYYY too much. I cringe every time I see that scene. I would actually like it if they cut out that whole thing. The exchange isn't even necessary if only to show Kirk as a womanizing sleazebag. (It happens about ten minutes in and lasts about eight minutes.)Well, that's my review. I hope this helps and that if you do watch the movie that you love it as much as I did. If you have never seen a Star Trek film before this film does not require you to have any previous Star Trek knowledge. And if you have seen them I hope you will enjoy! Once you have seen this movie go see Star Trek: Into Darkness where I am going to be posting a review on soon. I have yet to see Star Trek: Beyond but once I do I will surely post a review!Have a marvelous day!",9,1,3,13 August 2016
The Hunger Games," The Weakest of the Hunger Games Franchise.
","I know everyone says this but I have to say I am one of the Hunger Games' biggest fans. I've read the books and seen the movies. I know what I am speaking (or writing) about. I was excited to see the first movie when it came out in 2012. At this time I had not read the books yet, but I did know a bit about it. Because I hadn't read the books my first reaction was that I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it. I went away and read the books right before Catching Fire was released in theaters. And this is what I found when comparing the two.The movie wasn't completely off from the first HG book, but it deviated tremendously in some areas. Now I know what you are thinking. 'Oh no, let's get out of here now before this book fanatic blasts the movie just because it wasn't like the book.' That's not what I am doing at all. I'm going to compare the book and the movie and then highlight the good and the bad from the movie. So sit tight and stay with me.The movie disregarded semi-important characters from the book that didn't add to the movie (in their opinion). It also changed much of the scenes and dialog except for important key lines such as 'Happy Hunger games and may the odds be Ever in your favor.' and 'Ladies First'. The three most notable things though have to be the way Katniss got the Mockingjay pin, the werewolves, and Prim's cat: Buttercup. Now onto what I liked about the movie.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen was the most impeccable choice. She does the part so well that I can't ever see anyone other than her playing Katniss. I also thought Liam Hemsworth (Gale Hawthorne), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) and Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) were great casting choices. Donald Sutherland as President Snow was also an excellent choice, giving me the creeps every time I saw him. He just looked EVIL. The capitol was just as I had envisioned, the scenery was great, and the lines were good. The action was good (because it followed the book). All in all was a very good, captivating, and gripping movie.Things I think needed work:1: How Katniss got the Mockingjay pin. I won't go into how she got it in the books (which was perfection) but I do want to point out that in the movie it was a very nonchalant, boring way of introducing the pin that symbolized the start of a rebellion. If you had to deviated from the book you should have given it a better entrance into the movie? Maybe Katniss' mother gave it to her for strength? I don't know because it would never be as good as what Collins wrote.2: Casting choice for Peeta Mellark. I know all of you fan girls are ready to throw me into the next Hunger games for saying such a thing but it's true! Josh Hutcherson is a good actor, don't get me wrong! He just didn't feel like Peeta to me. Him and Jennifer Lawrence didn't have much chemistry on screen in my opinion. He wasn't the strong, caring, protective Peeta that I knew from the books. They made Peeta seem a bit weak and a sort of damsel in distress in my view. If you don't agree with me that's fine. I just wanted to point out that he seems wimpy and small.3: The werewolves. Oh my. Here I go. WHY!!!!!!!! Why would you change Suzanne Collin's werewolves. They were half werewolf, half dead tributes, that ran on their hind legs and had huge claws, teeth and big scary eyes. Here in the movie they looked like overfed pit bulls. Even their barking wasn't scary. This scene was supposed to send foreboding shivers down my spine. Instead I sat there in numb boredom, waiting for the games' 'big finish' to end so I could go onto the next movie. What a lame climax. That's all I have to say on that matter.Anyways those are the three biggest things I thought needed immense work. I hope you like this movie! If you are not sure about how you feel after watching this PLEASE watch Catching Fire. I promise it's a much better movie and you will like it. Also, PLEASE GO READ THE BOOKS! Have a nice rest of your day, AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR.",7,0,2,16 August 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Brilliant movie that was rushed at the end.
","First of all if you haven't seen Star Trek (2009) then stop now and go watch that movie before this one. (And read my review) Already seen it? Good. Let's continue.Just like the first film, this one was great. Was it as good as the first? Almost. If you have read my Star Trek (2009) review you will know that I love the cast. They all have great chemistry, deliver their lines brilliantly, and totally fit each and every one of their parts. Bringing in Benedict Cumberbatch to play Kahn was absolutely the right casting choice. He does an amazing job as Kahn in every way.This movie reflects the other very much. Great script, funny jokes, and great acting. But here are the things I think should have been worked on a bit more:1: The ending was rushed. By the time you realize Kahn in a villain (that is if you have never seen Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn) the movie seems to speed at a hundred miles an hour to finish.2: Spock and Uhurah's pushed aside romance. I loved their relationship in the last movie. They made and completed the movie in my opinion. In this one however their romance seemed to be pushed in the background, as if they were trying to find a way to end it quietly. (which thankfully doesn't happen here.) Spock and Uhura have so much chemistry it's crazy. As I have said in my last review, I hope we end up seeing them tying the knot in the fourth installment. I want to see a Star Trek movie with a legit married couple and not the 'dating everyone on the ship without making any commitments' thing I see in almost every Star Trek film. Please give us more Spock and Uhura!3: What's the point of space ships if you can use a portable teleporter to beam half way across the galaxy?4:As much as I love Chris Pine as Kirk, he should have stayed dead. For once I felt sad knowing a main character died in an act of selflessness. It made me emotional and made me realize 'Hey. If they'll kill off Kirk who else is going to die!?' I love it when I don't know what's going to happen next. The suspense that something might happen to a beloved character just draws you in. But once again, as in many movies, he didn't really die. If you're going to kill them off, do it.Anyway that's my review! I hope you guys enjoy the film!",8,2,4,14 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Good movie, reused plot, lame villain.
","To really understand this film and my review I would encourage everyone to watch the other Star Wars movies. If you already have or you're just a rebel, keep reading. This was not a bad movie in the least, but I was gracious with the rating I gave it. Why? Let me first tell you what I like about it. The graphics and CGI were great. The return of the original cast was very much appreciated and widely received. The script was decent and the main actress Daisy Ridley (Rey) was an unknown but turned out to be a fairly good actress. Here are some of the things that needed to be worked on:1. The villain. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) was a lame villain. In the beginning he was somewhat mysterious and scary but about a quarter way in he removed his helmet. And for what reason!? To intimidate the audience? Hate to break it to you but IT DIDN'T WORK. As soon as that helmet came off I was like 'How did that small helmet fit on his huge head?' and 'Was there a different, more talented actor under the helmet?' Then came the temper tantrums. OH MY GOSH. How old is this guy? And why is he destroying his space ship with his light saber??? Is he like 5? Then, trying to sell that he was afraid of being weaker than Darth Vader was just ludicrous. I actually laughed when he beat his side at the end of the movie. Is that supposed to HELP??? This is the weakest Star Wars villain I have ever seen. The old villains were scary. This guy is a five year old with daddy issues and a light saber.2. Was smeagol the Supreme Leader Snoke?3. Rey. OK, so I do like her to an extent. As I mentioned above she is pretty good actress. However, I do NOT like her relationship with Finn (John Boyega). They had no chemistry and no interest it seemed with one another. It was pretty ridiculous to put them together in my opinion.I wish that relationship would end. Quickly. Also, at the end of the movie she had more force that Luke Skywalker ever did in the old movies. This was quite irritating. You can't tell me that without any training she is that powerful. Implying that she is part of the family is a LAME excuse to do this. All in all, Rey should have been given a little more thought.4. Everything about Finn.5. Talking the whole time about finding Luke Skywalker and then only seeing him turn around and pause for an eternity.6. The reused plot. It's basically a bigger death star. No originality. There are other things, but these are the main things that stuck out to me. I hope you enjoy this movie if you see it.",6,10,16,15 August 2016
