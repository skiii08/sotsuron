United 93," Powerful / chilling from start to finish
",This film was respectfully done. Very non Hollywood. No sappy music or heroic speeches. Just very raw and very real. I'm not one to be moved by a film but watching the first half the viewer is tempted to want to jump on the screen and warn the characters of their fate. It's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit as it deserves a place in motion picture history. The only complaint I had is that the lady from the TV show Wings was playing one of the passengers which was a distraction and break in the reality of the moment. This film was not gory as I expected it to be. The blood was kept to a minimum but used enough to exhibit the horror of what happened.,9,1,3,28 June 2006
