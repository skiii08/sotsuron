The New World," This movie is a boring love story!
",This movie is a movie of an extremely boring sort which is why I have written this review. To explain this movie you could say that it is kinda like watching a documentary on Pocahontas except there is a bit of drama in it. So really this movie is somewhere in between a documentary and a movie because it is very informative and with a bit of drama. As I have said this movie is a documentary but when you rent or buy this movie your probably not thinking about watching a documentary and this is a 2 hour documentary that never seems to gets to the point so to speak because this movie has such a simple plot two people falling in love. This goes on the entire movie and in the end the girl falls in love with another guy and the first guy isn't even jealous which doesn't make sense. So basically this movie is the same thing for two *****ing hours. I'd please beg of anyone not to watch this movie. DON'T WATCH IT!!,1,11,19,20 May 2006
