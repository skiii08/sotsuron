Mission: Impossible III," Derivative. Soulless. Yawn.....
","SO glad I only borrowed the disc from my roommate, who had rented it. It's a shame because I really enjoyed MI2. Cruise is wooden and has that nutty glint in his eye most of the time. The premise, even as predictable as it was, would have been enjoyable had they taken the time to at least try and get the audience even a tiny bit invested in the characters. I love action movies, but this one is all fluff (explosions, fast driving etc.) and no heart. The movie moves SO quickly that you don't get a feel for the characters. I can suspend my disbelief in the silly things they expect a viewer to believe with regard to technology, but if I don't give a hoot about the characters and the story has been told a thousand times before (and better) why should I care about FX?",2,0,0,18 November 2006
