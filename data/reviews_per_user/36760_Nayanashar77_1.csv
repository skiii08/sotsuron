The Avengers," The Avengers:::::9/10
","finally,the avengers assemble..it was quite a wait for the fans and trust me,every waited minute was worth it...GOOD::Starting with cast and acting,every character has been evenly and uniformly crafted.Acting by whole cast is above par.But eventually IRON MAN and HULK(surprise element) are the main highlights.Directing was top notch.Its a difficult task to direct such a huge project with such huge stars but Joss pulled it off with flying colours.Special effects are of A++ grade and the humour element is just AWESOME.In 3d or 2d?? well watch it in both cause this movie will never get old.BAD::The villain could have been more larger than life, considering so many superheroes against.But this does not spoil the movie at all.",9,1,5,23 May 2012
