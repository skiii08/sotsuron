Conquest 1453," Great Disappointment
","Being a non-Muslim, I can't really be moved by anything heroic or romantic depicted in this film. I wonder whether this film can be loved by anyone who is neither Muslim nor Turkish.I am not a historian so I don't know for sure how historically accurate it is. But it looks like propaganda. Especially the ending scene seems so fake. Mehmet is depicted as a savior/saint instead of someone who simply wants more power or glory.The film is also very predictable. The duel between the two men who loved the same woman, the changing of banner on the high tower. The only thought when I watched these parts was 'Come on. Be serious!'",3,38,71,7 December 2012
Oldboy," Mixed
","The story is quite original. A guy wants to find out the reason why he has been imprisoned for 15 years. Yet in the end it turns out that he has asked the wrong question. Instead of 'why 15 years imprisoned', he should have asked 'why is he let free now'. The choice of music in violence scenes is also quite interesting.I find however rather difficult to empathize with those people. Both the ultimate motive and the ultimate punishment are about incest. Obviously in the Korean culture incest is taken really seriously and you are supposed to really suffer psychologically when you learn that you have had it unknowingly. Rationally I can understand it. Yet emotionally I can't feel it. My natural reaction would be 'okay. I have slept with my daughter/father. So what?'",7,3,7,13 December 2012
Alien," Rather childish film for someone used to modern films
","The film does not make sense.The science-fiction part is outdated and even amusing: space suits emitting CO2, funny computer monitors and keyboards, etc.Since the film was made in 1979, these technical details are forgivable.The idea of having a crew mainly made of humans is absurd, given that they obviously are capable of making really advanced robots.Not for a second I was surprised by the plot of the film.I can understand why this film was a top film in 1979. But I can't see why it should deserve any score above 6 in the 21st century.",3,6,26,12 May 2012
Fargo," Overrated
","It is an okay film. On the plus side, the music is quite nice.I can't however really understand why it has such a high score. The story of a kidnapping gone awry is quite simple. What is quite special is how unintelligently the people in this film talk and act. Unlike most films, this one does not have really smart or powerful characters. Much of the conversations, just as in real life, is basically nonsense. So in this sense the film is realistic.The problem with this realism is however that the film can get quite boring. Time is spent on events that have nothing to do with the main story. For example, the policewoman met one of her schoolmates who turned out to have some serious psychological issues. But that guy or their meeting has nothing to do with anyone else in the film. So why that scene instead of let's say, a rabbit is sleeping very tight in his burrow?This film reminds me of No Country for Old Men. If you like that genre, you'll probably enjoy this film.",5,0,4,14 December 2012
Life," Boring and Stupid
","The very first minute does not bode well. The director would have got the Doppler's effect quite right, if there were actually a medium for sound waves to propagate in space.The 'scientists' and 'astronauts' in the film behave more like emotional children rather than rational adults. When I saw the first guy die, I could not help feeling a deep joy. 'Great! He deserved it for his stupidity!'",3,0,3,12 June 2017
