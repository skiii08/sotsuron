Scarface," My Favorite Movie!
","This is one of the most amazing updated versions of a film I've ever seen. I love the way they added in the Cuba ordeal to create the story line. I recommend this to anyone who loves mafia movies, anyone who loves a true, in depth story of someone trying to come up in the world (even though it was illegally). Then, letting it get to him, breaking his own rules, which in turn ended up in the demise of himself, as well as the people he cared most about. He doesn't listen to the people in his life, such as his sister, or the woman he loves. He had so much potential, even in an illegal, drug world. He threw it all away because he didn't do the one thing he held highest in esteem about himself, keep his word.",10,0,2,24 December 2013
Sucker Punch," Shows True Bravery and Selflessness
","I hate this phrase, but this movie truly shows 'girl power'. It's extremely sad, but it shows what a person can rise above and how if someone really wants something, to rise above, they can. Like a quote from the movie, 'You have all the weapons, now fight!'. It also proves that there are people who will sacrifice themselves for someone they care about or a cause that they care about. I love how they showed the 'theater' when Baby Doll first gets there, and then she ends up acting out scenarios in her head that describe how she's feeling, how it feels to fight for something. The best part I think, is the fact that they say, everyone has a guardian angel, they come in different forms, an old man one day and a young girl the next. Most of all, that they aren't here to fight your battles, you're here to fight your battles, they are just here to show you the way and to keep you going. Overall, I think this is a must-see!",10,5,11,5 May 2014
