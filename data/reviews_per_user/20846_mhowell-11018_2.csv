Hereditary," Nothing Scary About This movie... boring
","This was one of the most boring and senseless movies I have ever seen. There is nothing about this movie that would classify it as horror. It's basically a sad drama that is slow and mostly uninspiring. Has to force myself to stay awake... and in the end, I would have been better off just getting some sleep.",1,2,7,9 October 2018
Us," Like a Bad 80's Twilight Zone
","This movie had the potential to be good, but it was all over the place. Plot holes, confusing story line, and some corny characters made this movie mediocre at best. It was intended to be scary, but there were several people (including me) laughing at the 'scary' scenes.",2,32,51,3 April 2019
