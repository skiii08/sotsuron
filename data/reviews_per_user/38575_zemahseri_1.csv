Conquest 1453," One of the best historical action movie in the world
","Fetih 1453 is the story of conquest of Istanbul (Constantinople) in 1453 which is a milestone in world history. Fetih may not be qualified as one of the best production made ever, in my opinion this movie exceedingly deserves to be in the top 250 movie list in IMDb and in the top 30 in my list.There are very few productions in the world that can be considered better than Fetih 1453 like gladiator, kingdom of heaven, brave heart, troy etc. in that particular genre.Also some may criticize or even may not like some of the action scenes or average acting of secondary characters, generally movie catches the highest standards in the world in all aspects.If you like action, historical epic movies and war scenes with a good and qualified scenario and watch movies for fun this movie is a must for you to watch.",9,19,55,23 February 2012
