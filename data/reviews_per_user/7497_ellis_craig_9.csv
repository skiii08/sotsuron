Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Waste of Time
","Just like part 1, this film is awful. This story must have been written by a child, example being The exploding heart kung fu technique and escaping from a coffin 6 foot under! What a waste of the audiences time and I have to feel sorry for the cast members during the world film premiers watching this film over and over again. Also the characters waffled on and on about nothing much making the story very boring. Improvements that were missing from Kill Bill 2 are: 1. More action 2. Less talk/waffle 3. Realism and not fictitious nonsense. Don't waste your time watching this film.",2,5,12,20 June 2004
Underworld," Great horror action film.
",Refreshing gothic effects and dark colourless images. Nice to see filmed in Europe. Slightly unsure about the werewolves immune to bullets!? Overall an excellent film.,8,0,0,28 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Doesn't fit in with the earlier films
","Just watched this week and i'm not impressed with the film story direction. The series started out great as an all family can watch films but now this has been dropped for a miserable, depressing, drab direction which doesn't fit in at all with the other earlier films. I don't know what JKR is thinking when writing but maybe she was in a dark mood herself and took it out on Harry Potter? This needed the old spark of Harry Potter film magic but its too late now! How anyone would want to watch this film again is a mystery. JKR will hopefully take a break from writing and think about letting other authors write Harry Potter stories about Harry's earlier times at magic school which would be good to see?",6,1,1,30 December 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I'll be back...for more!
","I went to the UK preview viewing. Thought the T3 action scenes were very good. Good story line too. The ending asks the question will there be a T4? I think so. Only problem was that I wanted the old cast of T2 to be in this film.Regards, CE.",6,0,0,1 August 2003
Resident Evil," Interesting zombie pic.
","Excellent story line and good casting. Watched the DVD version, thought that perhaps not that much gore but it didn't spoil the film. I liked the ending and i guess the film 28 days later can continue the story (maybe?). Resident Evil 2 hopefully should be good.",7,0,0,10 October 2003
Driven," Driven round the bend
","Watched the UK DVD release. Acting a little on the slow side, so was the car racing. Needs more in car action shots and less of the romantic angle. Sly saves the day and the film.",Null,0,1,20 April 2002
National Treasure," Enjoyable, action adventure, Indiana Jones style film
","An enjoyable action packed film. Never a dull moment. Nicholas Cage, and Sean Benn star,in an all star cast. The Gates family are a family of treasure seekers who believe they can find the national treasure. A treasure unlike no other. Ben (Nicholas Cage)believes he can triumph where his father, grandfather failed. Despite being ridiculed by every organisation. They set out to find the treasure, by uncovering clues. You are kept guessing until the very end as to whether there is a treasure and if they will find it before Simon (Sean Benn). An enjoyable funny action packed adventure, well worth a visit to the cinema.",8,0,0,30 December 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Very entertaining and worth going to the cinema to see
",I've not read the book and tried to keep away from the film reviews and newspaper headlines to not spoil me enjoying the film. I enjoyed getting to learn about the characters and trying to work out what was going on and why at the start *spoiler* a man was shot dead. The plot had a few twists and it held my attention trying to work out and guess myself the answer to the clues given. I wasn't that concerned about the film having a religious angle as this film is only fiction and I found learning about religious history fascinating. A well put together film which is very enjoyable *spoiler* leading at the end to the Holy Grail itself.,7,2,4,25 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Lost the plot slightly
","I feel that this film isn't a patch on the 1st matrix film, as too much chatter and the love interest angle spoils the story.. Also too much kung fu, goes on and on making the fight scenes dull, should of had short action fight scenes instead. I liked the freeway action sequence, plenty to keep the audience happy. Overall a disappointing film, should of looked closely at the original and kept with the same style which made it the success and quality the audience appreciate.",7,0,0,14 November 2003
