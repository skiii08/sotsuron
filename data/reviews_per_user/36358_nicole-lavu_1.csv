The Avengers," Absolutely A Must See!
","Now, I'm no expert on criticizing the film industry but if I do say so myself, The Avengers was an excellent movie. I have not been one known to read comic books, so I have no experience to judge whether the film stays true to the graphic novels. There are many factors that I consider when reviewing a movie. I look at the acting quality, how it compares to similar movies in the same genre, the plot line, and also the special effects quality. In my opinion, the acting quality was superb. Each character had their own unique qualities about them and I believe that the actors portrayed those characteristics to the best of their abilities. Robert Downy Jr. played Tony Stark/Iron Man and his character was very intelligent, but also very conceited and egotistical. Robert Downy Jr. gave his character a sense of humor which kept our hearts at ease at the most dramatic moments. I believe Mr. Stark was the comic relief in this movie and kept the movie alive with comedy. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers/Captain America, who is a man from a different era. His confusion but loyalty to America reminds us of the patriotism we should feel as Americans. Although his confusion is a fault for himself, it always is another comic relief for the audience. Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner/the Hulk. His ability to stay calm and relaxed is inspiring to the viewers but when he loses the ability, it creates an intense moment that keeps the audience members on the edge of their seats. There are many other characters in the movie but that was just to name a few. Next, I would like to take a look at how this film compares to the other films in this genre. In comparison to the other Marvel movies I do believe this was the best. Not only was it jam-packed with action and thrills, but it also included many other the other Marvel characters. I like how this movie intertwined the characters from the different movies and formed them into one. The way the director, Joss Whedon, explained how important teamwork is and how it's valued is inspiring to people of all ages. Also, in comparison to other movies outside of the Marvel Company, Star Trek might have some competition when it comes to The Avengers. Although, the two films have similar qualities I feel that The Avengers takes the cake on this one. In favor of Star Trek, the film had a romance aspect that is more appealing to the female population and The Avenger did not entirely portray a love plot line in the film. I was very impressed with the special effects quality of The Avengers. The way they presented the superpowers of each hero was unbelievable. Also, the fight scene towards the end of the movie and how the aliens were entering the portal through the sky was astonishing. The special effects in this film looked and felt so real to the audience, which makes this film more enjoyable because it showed something that we could imagine being real. All in all, this film had excellent qualities that defined is as a must see! I am anxiously and impatiently waiting for the sequel!",9,0,3,18 November 2012
