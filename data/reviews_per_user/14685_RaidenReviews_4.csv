Captain Phillips," A U.S cargo ship is hijacked by ruthless Somali pirates, taking the captain hostage
","Tom Hanks embarks on a tense hostage-captor battle with Somali pirates. Enough said. That sentence summarizes the epic proportions this 'based off a true story' movie has. However, due to the intricate substance of this movie, it requires some more elaboration. Tom Hanks stars in his most thrilling role yet as Captain Richard Phillips. He is a captain for the cargo ship the Maersk Alabama heading to Mombasa. The film's realism is what really captures the essence of this amazing true story. The ship used in the film is identical to the real Maersk Alabama, which gives it an authentic and genuine feel.To top that off, this film was actually shot on the open water, no studio set was used. You can't get more authentic then that. Bravo to director Paul Greengrass and the cast for taking on such an arduous task. This film relies on several close up shots of the actors, which intensifies key moments in the plot that again contribute to the realism of the film. Hank's accent in the film wavers a little bit, which is usually common for actors. The Somali pirates pulled off a wicked performance as merciless pirates who stop at nothing to get what they want. The Somali pirate captain, who was played by Barkhad Abdi,gave an 'edge of your seat' performance. He gave a lot of depth to his character. It is a 100% guarantee your heart will be racing during this film. Fast paced, high intensity and overall insanely epic.The bonus features on the DVD version of this film offers you an inside-look into the story of Captain Phillips by none other than the real Captain Richard Phillips! If you are a fan of dramatic true stories and love Tom Hanks, this is definitely a film for you!",8,0,0,1 February 2014
Shutter Island," A U.S Marshall investigates a mysterious island for an escaped prisoner only to find out darker secrets lie within.
","Right off the bat this film is perhaps one of the most intricate I have seen. All viewers are in for major plot twists and a spiralling journey down the world of the criminally insane. DiCaprio unites again with legendary director Martin Scorsese to deliver an excellent performance as a U.S Marshall haunted by a mysterious tragedy. Mark Ruffalo joins DiCaprio as a new Marshall from Seattle, aiding him in the search to locate a missing patient from Ashcliffe Sanitarium located on the eerie Shutter Island. The weather in this film is essential in giving it a dreading, uneasy and very haunting appearance. The use of rain and dark imagery really emphasize the morbid presence the film bears. Although this film is a staple in any psychological thriller collection, it has it's flaws. Many of the shots that include driving look very unrealistic and DiCaprio loses his Boston accent multiple times throughout the film. Other than those minor details the film remains a mind-blowing adventure. This is one of those films that switches plots after the initial plot is solved. After the 'missing patient' is discovered back in her cell, unscathed by the treacherous island, the Marshalls begin to suspect there are other things going on at Ashcliffe. After beginning to suspect the sanitarium is part of a government mind-control conspiracy, the Marshalls begin to realize they were meant to come here as victims of government experiments. This is where the movie's web weaves itself more and more as the true darkness of the island is slowly unveiled. DiCaprio's character begins to realize similarities between some of the patients at the island to his own life and he is also plagued by flashbacks of his deceased wife. The climax of the film that really explodes is when DiCaprio goes to rescue his partner from 'the lighthouse' where the mind experiments supposedly occur. The doctor and his partner are waiting for him in the lighthouse and explain that everything that has happened was set up and staged to help DiCaprio release himself from his past trauma. This is the point where everything you have seen crumbles down and unveils an explanation for everything that has occurred. This is where I just sat back and said 'Whoa'. The huge plot twist at the end really en-ravels the viewer into the story and leaves you immersed in the uncertainty of the situation. The movie's ending has epic proportion, where DiCaprio's character chooses to die as a good man, rather than his former self which really shows the moral fibre of his heroic character and how his understanding and acceptance of reality has finally allowed him to achieve peace.",9,0,2,25 January 2014
The Village," A colonial village surrounded by a forest inhabited by mysterious creatures is put in danger.
","This is a very intriguing film that really gets your mind working. Any film that gets your mind working is a good film, hands down. If you are a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work then you will greatly appreciate this film. The cinematography is really well thought out and it gives the film the daunting aura it portrays. The film sets around a colonial village surrounded by a massive forest. This forest is supposedly inhabited by creatures who have a truce with the villagers not to interfere with the borders that separate them. When a fearless villager named Lucius decides to cross the boundaries in search of 'other towns', the village's safety is put at stake. The most gripping part of this film is the haunting, secretive, mysterious allure that surrounds it. The film's eerie cinematography and a chilling score pieced together by James Newton Howard ( Nominated for an Academy Award) is the core of the movie. The acting in this film considering the brilliant cast of Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt was not the best. So in terms of acting performances, this is not one of the film's strong points. The film's foggy storyline which gets darker and darker as the movie progresses is the key factor of the film to follow.",8,2,4,13 February 2014
RED," A group of retired agents team up to save their lives from the government.
","An all-star cast, brilliant writing and top-notch special effects, what else can you want from an action film? Red is the perfect action film that strays between the lines of dark comedy and action thriller. Big names such as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren headline this epic action comedy, all taking on distinctive character roles and creating memorable performances. Bruce Willis takes on the role of Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who is now being hunted by the government because he is 'R.E.D', Retired and Extremely Dangerous. He meets up with his witty pension agent and reunites with his old band of ex-agents to counter-attack the plot against them. John Malkovich does a fantastic job as an LSD ridden ex-agent who's eccentric ways and mannerisms provide the majority of the film's comic relief. Helen Mirren plays a savvy sniper, who is classy but dangerous when it comes to her missions. Morgan Freeman makes an appearance as an ex-agent that still packs a punch. The film is based off a comic series of the same name and has elements of it in the film. The fighting sequences are intricate and fast paced. If you love guns, big guns and really big guns, this is the movie for you. Extensive gunfights and car chases leave the viewer riveted to their seat. The non-stop action and perfect one-liners make R.E.D an instant action classic and an epic adventure.",8,1,1,25 January 2014
