The Mask," Brilliant
","This was the perfect casting of Jim Carrey ever, and the best comic-book based film ever made. Hands down.And although Carrey has made other interesting and funny films, none have utilized his abilities as this practically made-for-Carrey film has.The Mask as a character itself is based on all of those cartoons with the redhaired dancer and the wolf, many were made during the WW-II years. One of them even had Red Riding Hood being eaten by the wolf at the end, or at least sitting in his pot.This was as clever casting as Robin Williams in 'Aladdin' or 'Mrs Doubtfire', something which we'd never see again. I believe there was even a sequel that is so im-memorable, that it's not even linked to this film in an IMDb search.That's where this film has a commonality with the Disney Aladdin films, you cannot do a sequel if you cannot reproduce a once in a lifetime performance.It's that personalities like Carrey and Williams are so dynamic that you can't just replace their characters with new actors.There were a lot of great character actors in this as well, including Carrey's landlady.This film could have had a good sequel, should have had one. I had never heard of this director, but he did a great job especially with the primitive CGI, very similar to Burton's work.It wasn't just Carrey, this was very well directed. And Cameron Diaz did not hurt, either.",10,4,4,26 July 2018
The Avengers," Nuff Said!
","As I missed this in the Theatre, I waited a long time for the Blu-Ray to come out. I knew back in 2008 when Iron Man came out, that The Avengers were Assembling.I did not understand why Marvel made a second 'Hulk' film after Ang lee's marvel-ous work, but that Hulk was a stand-alone story, and not worked into the fabric of the Marvel Multiverse.Each solo Avengers film introduced characters which were to be in this film, Iron Man was the most developed of them all, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor each developed those characters for this film.There was one more Avenger that should have been included, Wolverine, but at the time Marvel did not have the rights. Even so, Wolverine was not part of that first Avengers comic so long ago where they Battle Loki, and that is what this film was about.Joss Whedon was the prefect director to tackle this: His work on his Television shows and the Movie 'Serenity' prepared him for it. I was glad that an Underdog was given the Helm, and he succeeded brilliantly.After being Bombarded by the first Three X-Men films and the Sam Raimi Spidey Trilogy, it was just time to make this film. The Avengers are that one Marvel Property that has threads into all of Marvel's Super Heroes.The pivotal piece was Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury - I grew up when Nick Fury was a white guy and he was a much different character. Sometime in the late 90's and early 2000's Marvel recreated all of their Heroes and gave some of them a complete Makeover: But Jackson plays Fury much the same way David Hasselhoff did in the TV Movie. It does not matter what colour he is, white or black, he's the same guy.It is this one man who spearheads 'The Avengers Initiative' - Even though his board of supervisors have put the program 'on ice' Fury finds a way to make it happen, he puts together a 'response team' to deal with the threat of Loki.We met Loki in 'Thor' - Originally he was Thor's 'Brother' and best friend. In 'Thor' Loki learns he is actually a Frost Giant (Which is actually part of the Norse Legend) and something snaps in him. The Loki in The Avengers is not the subdued, Quiet Loki we meet in the first few scenes of Thor, he has completely lost it.This Mirrors the way he was written for the Comic Books, the way I see it, Loki does not really know what he wants, so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up. In the case of this film, he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo Aliens (We learn exactly who these guys are, at the very end of the film, after the title credits), as 'The Other' is talking to his boss, who turns in Profile and he is a SKRULL).The Tesseract, the 'Cosmic Cube' which has been a huge part of Marvel stories, was seen in Captain America, Red Skull was abusing it, it fell into the arctic ice and Howard Stark grabbed it. After the events of the Movie Thor, Fury assigns Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) to figure out what the futz this thing actually is.And they find out, as 'Hawkeye' (Jeremy Renner) states at the beginning of the film, The Cube is a doorway, and it is being opened from the other side.In steps Loki and he has gone even more insane, comparing the Human Race to bugs to be squashed via a Boot. Loki manages to turn Hawkeye and Selvig (This is another thing about Loki which came from the Comics), and the entire complex where The Cube was being tested caves in, huge Radar antenna and all.From this point on, it's Non Stop. We get to see SO much stuff from the Comics, the SHIELD HeliCarrier, the Avengers Mansion (Which was Stark Tower). But the best thing was the interaction of these guys, they don't get along in the Comics, and they don't get along very well at first here. What surprised me was how well Mark Ruffalo made The Hulk come to life, even though I liked Ang Lee's Hulk better: But Rufallo actually 'Acted' The Hulk, which was something not done in the two Hulk Movies.From this point on, Avengers sets a Bar for Marvel Movies that will be difficult to reach again, let alone surpass.This film easily surpasses the quality of the first two X-Men films, without burying them.",10,8,16,24 August 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Did they even see Blade Runner when it came out?
","I always wonder why people who hated something RUSH to post an iMDB review about it. It's just a waste of time. I think it is because Franklin Graham told his congregation to log in here and write 10 1-stars per recent film. This might explain the large amount of identical 1-star reviews that can be seen, repeating themselves throughout the reviews section although apparently written by 'different people'. Different people from the same IP address, or Anonymiser. I come in here to read the diversity of reactions to film, and when I do not see diversity, but 1-stars written according to a formula (You'll notice these people always list the same 4 points for every movie playing in the theater that they attack), then I know that I am not seeing diversity, not true diversity. Real diversity is not a rubber stamp replica of 10 other reviews.Reviewer 'Horrorgasm' has it spot on: I'm tired of people panning this film based on opinions of the original, which they never saw when it came out. I however, did see the original when it came out, and I saw this today. I was in shock and awe when I saw Roy Baty decide to love life at the end of Blade Runner, even Rick Deckard's life, and I was in shock when I watched 'K' (Ryan Gosling) start piecing together the story of Rick and Rachel out of nothing but bones in a Box.The original Blade Runner got panned more for the differences to the Phillip K Dick novel than the Narration that was added without Ridley Scott's permission. And of course, adding the narration like that sucked. But I preferred the narration because it made the original flow like a 40's Noir film, and Ridley Scott got the look and feel of 40's Noir. When it comes to film, we always prefer what we had originally seen. There have been a few extended versions of films which I liked more. Normally, director's cuts are alternate edits, like Ridley's version of Alien, which has a few different scenes in it, but is not really an 'extended' cut. But extended versions always have the original scenes, but with more added.But here, the same 10 'people' are complaining about 'Sequels'. They can relax, this is not a sequel. It's a seamless continuation. Denis Villeneuve had great respect in reconstructing the world of Bladerunner. Sets, Costumes, MUSIC. The moment this film starts, we know we are in the Replicant Universe, and we stay in that universe for about 2 and a half hours. My only real gripe is that Gaff, when we meet him in this film, is no longer talking in his colourful Street Speech, but it could also be that sometimes, when we get older, we drop things that were affectations.It is 30 years later, and Replicants are up to Nexus 8. There was some incident that EMP'd all of the electronics. No trees left on the planet. hard to tell which animals are real or if there are any left that are not cloned. and 'Skin Jobs' are now allowed on Earth, but they have all the crappy jobs, the ones we hired slaves and immigrants to do in the past.This film continues the statement made in Blade Runner that 'disposable people' have always been used to make civilizations. In Old Testament times, in Babylonian times, in Roman Times. Slaves built and died building the monuments. Slaves picked the cotton that made the south rich. And today, immigrants do all of those jobs for low pay, no benefits, and they even have taxes taken out for benefits they will never get, while the ICE waits to split up their families and deport them after 30 years of paying taxes.In this film, and the original, there are references to slaves and immigrants, in the representation of the Replicants. Their lives just do not matter. But there are a few, like 'Luv' (Sylvia Hoeks) who works for 'Mr Wallace' who somehow think they are equal and superior, while their owners (Jared Leto) continuously display contempt for her kind right in front of her, over and over again.There is a MacGuffin which has come to the attention of 'K', his boss Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), Luv, and Mr Wallace, but it is 'K's' efforts which show us his discoveries. In Fact, our attention is directed to the wrong person the whole time. A Memory points 'K' to a certain course of action. But...Who has the best memories?",10,0,3,24 January 2018
First Man," Turtles all the way Down vs Green Cheese
","This film.It's not about planting a flag waving in phony 'wind' on the moon. It's about the man who left that first footprint up there. And about what he personally lost to make it up there and back. And what he personally left up there. Which from that point of view, is much more important to Neil than planting a flag and then spouting Jingoisms. This focuses on just one of the men that made this happen, and he actually contributed to the program, he was one of the men who figured out how to do it.And although there are other astronauts in this film, It's his story, and how he fit into the program that put him up there. And it's personal.This is not 'The Right Stuff', and it's not 'Apollo 13' even, although there are depictions of a few tragedies in this, but it's about how they related to Neil, and how he dealt with them.There were also a few near tragedies shown that I never knew about, I had not realized how treacherous the Gemini program was. And although I made models of Gemini capsules when I was a child, I never realized how small they actually were.One thing that angers me are people who actually believe we faked this whole thing, usually those people also believe the earth is flat, or it's 'turtles all the way down'.Or the complaints about this movie that it doesn't show the flag non-sequitur. Really, who cares? We know it was done, this movie was so far from being about that than is utterly possible.I found this film far from slow or boring, it's intimate. And it shows Neil coming full circle to the person he was at the point where this movie begins. And that explained a lot to me.",10,1,3,17 December 2018
Vertigo," Magical journey into Fear
","This is maybe the one time Hitch mixed almost-Fantasy elements with one of the most intense primal fears of mankind: The fear of falling, and built a highly suspenseful mystery around it.Along with the classic camera moves which depict James Stewart's 'vertigo' (Ie, the elongation of one long shot, a camera move which is copied and used and ab-used by director after director: Example, in 'Lord of The Rings: Return Of The King' Frodo looks into Shelob's Lair: The closer elements in the shot stay stationary, but the farther elements seem to move away from the camera. This is straight from Vertigo).This camera trick was possibly originated by Hitch and was used in Vertigo each time James Stewart looks into a Void area: Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of this is the best pictorial representation of fear of heights, mixed with fear of vast open spaces (However this phobia is classified)- This is hard to describe unless the experience is common, Hitchcock must have had the same fear, because his depiction of it matches my experience with it- And so, as Stewart looks down, from the top of the apartment building, and later in the film when he looks straight down the Bell Tower, that visual effect where the far away parts of the image stretch away from the camera view, this gives people who do not have acrophobia and the other related fears a visual representation of what a person with those fears goes through.And James Stewart's reactions to heights during the film are not too fantastic, especially the standing on the top step of a step-stool, it is not too ridiculous that he had a vertigo attack at that point. It is important for the viewer to understand how debilitating Vertigo and Acrophobia are when mixed together, and Hitch gives us a visual taste of these fears within minutes of the opening shots of the film when Stewart looks down and the world stretches.Hitch adds to the mix, a story which is almost time-travel or psychic... Kim Novak's character pulls the wool over not only Stewart's eyes, but ours as well. She is at her most convincing when she is looking at the tree rings and saying 'I was born around here, and I died here...' We do not know anything but Stewart's fear of heights and his apparent guilt feelings at not being able to prevent an apparent tragedy from occurring... Just in case we do not really understand this Hitch added one of the most fantastic 'Dream Sequences' of all his movies, which is rife with clues of all sorts as to what is really going on.And this dream sequence causes Vertigo to be visually stunning. Although Hitch uses all kinds of tricks during the film to add an unreality and eeriness to the story, Stewart's Dream centers his, and our, fears into the story, and also elements are added that hint to Stewart, and to us, that there is more going on here.When Stewart finds Judy Barton, as he becomes more and more obsessed with dressing her up as Madeline, the film becomes more and more removed from 'reality' - especially when Stewart has an Epiphany, nothing in the shot has any substance but Madeline/Judy- The background becomes washed out, it is as if the only things that exist in our universe are James and Madeline/Judy.And as the film reaches denouement, this quality reverses until everything looks quite normal.There are too many aspects of this picture to evaluate: The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his best and one of the most spiritual in any Hitchcock film.Also the best use of a city as location, San Francisco in the late 50's, and some of the landmarks shown are still there. A lot of the scenery included many places that I remember that endeared San Francisco to me.",10,6,7,5 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Stranger Tides: Back to being about Pirates
","This film is as good as the Original 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' - I never liked the story arc that followed Curse of the Black Pearl, it was about everything but Pirates. Sea Goddesses, Flying Dutchman (With the wrong Captain, Davey Jones was not captain of the Flying Dutchman, Vandervecken was), the three original Pirates films were the story of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann- Curse of the Black Pearl was complete in itself, I always thought by adding all these sequels, they were stretching for a story. It was all too much, too fantastic, and not wholly as enjoyable as the first adventure.Not so here: This 4th installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, brings the focus back to a Pure Pirate Adventure, and with the departure of Swann and Turner 'At Worlds End', Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio were free to tell further stories about Captain Jack Sparrow, with the help of novelist Tim Powers, Disney actually purchased the rights to his book and worked with him, as opposed to James Cameron's outright theft of Poul Anderson's 1957 Hugo award winning short story 'Call Me Joe' (Which became Avatar). This merger of a 20-year old novel and new characters from the franchise, and the acknowledgment thereof, makes me hope for Hollywood Writer/Directors who would borrow plots and characters from well known books and try to get away with it 'scott free'.The threads from the Novel meld into the already laid out story of Jack Sparrow, which we have been hearing since the first film in the franchise- Kevin R McNally, as 'Gibbs' has been Keeper of Jack Sparrow's Continuity since the first film.This film injects a new villain into the Pirates Universe: Blackbeard, as played by the great character actor Ian McShane. McShane epitomizes all of the portrayals of Blackbeard and other evil pirates in pirate movies back to Basil Rathbone in 'Captain Blood'.Geoffrey Rush once again plays Barbossa, who is 'Not a Pirate', well, at first, in this story. Along with McShane as Blackbeard, Penelope Cruz is 'Angelica' - Apparently 'Blackbeard's Daughter'. Or is she? The characters of Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, Angelica are all wonderfully duplicitous, not being 'evil' or 'good' characters, they are more like real people, who have both bad and good aspects. And so, the relationships between Jack and Barbossa, and Jack and Angelica leave you asking 'Who is fooling who here'? And in reality, we are the ones being fooled, by the convoluted plot which Elliott & Rossio have woven into the fabric of the original Powers' novel.With the absence of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, This film focuses more on Jack's actual romance with Angelica, and there is also a side-romance which develops between the characters of Man of Faith 'Philip' (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named 'Syrena' (Spanish Actress Astrid Berges-Frisbey) - The resolution of which is difficult to understand, unless you pay attention to the sailors small-talk and speculations regarding the nature of Mermaids in this story.Look for Cameos from Dame Judy Dench, Richard Griffiths and another appearance of 'Captain Teague' (Kieth Richards). Stephen Graham (Band of Brothers, Snatch, Gangs of New York) is the Mandolin-playing Scrumm, another duplicitous character. The 'First Mermaid' is played by Gemma Ward, the Mermaids are all Fashion Models - From the waist up.Barbossa has developed a 'hobby' of collecting Poison Frogs - There is a reason for every apparently idle scene in this film.This film is back to the basics of what made 'Curse of the Black Pearl' so good - It is a fresh story, less dependent on special effects and more on character interaction. The introduction of new Director to the Franchise, Rob Marshall, did not significantly alter the way the story was told- This is a story about Jack Sparrow, and all of the things that endeared that character to us from the first three films, are all here in 'quadruplicate'. Marshall's direction was less over-the-top than Verbinski's. But the best quality of this film is the usage of Hans Zimmerman's Score, including the 'Pirate Theme' - Which was first used in the movie 'Gladiator', all of the musical queues from the first three films are here, plus new cues with Spanish flavour which add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. This is a film of extremely high quality, as is the case with anything Jerry Bruckheimer produces.",Null,1,3,19 August 2011
Men in Black 3," Best of the III
","This film is a major increase in quality over the first two, not that I did not think those were also great. There is a continuity to them all, that is capped off here.A Kinky Woman (Nicole Scherzinger) visits a guy named 'Boris the Animal' ('Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement), using the typical 'file-in-the- cake' routine, which unfortunately works and he gets loose, blowing a hole in the ceiling of the joint, revealing the Prison as being on the Moon.This guy is just a Menace, and he's got a little animal living in his hand that can shoot out high-velocity darts. He is actually an advanced guard for a race called 'The Boglodites' who have to go from Solar System to Solar system, eating them on the way. Next target: EARTH.But Kay (Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin) had arrested this Creepoid back in 1969, and set up a defense grid called 'The Arc-Net.'Boris gets down to Earth, and immediately resumes his 1969 Killing Spree.At MIB Headquarters, which looks almost exactly the same as it has in the first 2 films, Agent Zed (Rip Torn) has died, even though Rip Torn himself plays a different alien guy at 'Zed's' funeral. The Image of 'Zed' is Kirk Larsen, not Rip Torn. And there is a new 'Head' Agent, Agent 'O' played by Emma Thompson/Alice Eve.J wants to help out K as usual, but K just does not want J involved... And while waiting in his apartment, K vanishes, and his apartment changes... And J suddenly has a headache and wants Chocolate Milk. This is because Boris has found Jeffery Price, and jumped back in time to 1969, killing K.The Next Day, J gets to work, and nobody else remembers K. He has a 'new' partner, Agent 'AA' (Will Arnet, who I just can't seem to place).In fact, K's dead, killed by Boris in 1969... And the ArcNet was never deployed. And so the Boglodyte's invade, and J has to find the son of Obadiah Price, the only guy who had ever made Time Travel work, before MIB made it illegal: Jeffery Price (Michael Chernus). And so, to make a Time 'Jump,' J has to literally fall from a great height. So he goes back to the day before Boris had gone back.This is where all the fun begins, and Josh Brolin plays the young K as well as Tommy Lee Jones plays the 'Old, Busted Hotness.'There is just so much great stuff in this, with Andy Warhol, who is 'Agent W' (Bill Hader) and a crazy guy named 'Griffin' (Michael Stuhlbarg)-Who has the gift of the ArcNet Shield for K, he is from a race of guys who can see all kinds of ways Time will unfold. Ironically, some of the action in this film, happens at the same Park where the final scenes of the first MIB film happened.What is great about this film, is that it is a full circle of Time's Arrow, that refers all the way back to things that happen in the first MIB film.The only bad thing I can think of, is that we had to wait ten years for this film to come out, after the previous MIB film. But even with so much time passing, director Barry Sonnenfeld was able to re-produce the production design of the first two. And although Frank the Pug is not here, J has some paintings of Frank in his apartment. And no 'Jeebs' either (Tony Shalhoub).So Now the MIB story has played out its full cycle, they really did a good job with this one.",10,2,5,6 September 2012
Alien 3," Director's Cut vs Theatrical Release
","This is my favourite Alien film - The acting is superb with Charles S. Dutton (Aka 'Roc') and Charles Danse - Plus a motley crew of British Actors including Danny Webb as Morse, Paul McGann as 'Golic', Brian Glover as 'Andrews', Ralph Brown as '85' and of course a younger Pete Postlethwaite as 'David' - These guys make up the first British Max Prison in Space. David Fincher made us believe that this was a huge supermax prison on some backwater planet. And then we have the return of Bishop, we get to meet the original Bishop the way he was left from Aliens.The Sulaco of course on the outside was the same Sulaco, inside, it was different, but convincing as a ship interior. The 'Model 337 EEV' looked like a piece from a car engine, but as they also made a life-sized version of it, I eventually allowed myself to be convinced that the metal sliver that fell off of the Sulaco was an evacuation unit.My complaint with the Theatrical Release was that it was too short, but there were some great things - The 'Dog Alien' for instance... The directors cut is satisfactory in length, but the Dog-Alien angle is omitted, instead we have a Cow-Alien. Doesn't work. Also, the DC includes some digital Alien footage that should have stayed on the cutting floor, although some of it was made by some of the digital pioneers from Lord of the Rings, some of the digital shots are not very convincing. This is minimal in the Theatrical cut, in the DC, these shots should have been fixed up, they have the tech today to fix some of the digital shots and make it more photorealistic.Theatrical or Director's Cut - Fincher did a very good job at combining Practical Footage, Digital shots, Puppeteering and Mechanical/Animatronic Effects to give us one of the best Alien stories.Now although I have inserted a few spoilers here, my only complaint with the film was the Theatrical Length, and of course, After all the stuff these survivors went through to have two of them killed right away at the very beginning, kind of ruined the ending of 'Aliens'.An original Alien 3 Script I had read Online had Newt and Hicks surviving and were a huge part of the story. I had heard that a Fox exec forced Fincher to do the story the way it is in his film. But other than the disappointing deaths of Newt and Hicks, this alien-chase through a lead foundry was amazing. As someone said, it takes a while for the action to start, but by no means are there non-interesting events being played out on screen.For those of you who enjoyed some of the Music of Alien 3, some of this music re-appears in The Matrix- Watch both together, and you will see.",10,8,10,13 April 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Jared Harris: 'I'mThe Bishop!'
","Guy Ritchies direction of this film, and its close relationship to a Chess game, brings to mind Jared Harris' last words as the character 'David Robert Jones' in the Season 4 Finale of Fringe: And that too refers to a Chess game, where to lose a valuable player is a trade-off to a winning game. In that episode bad Guy Leonard Nimoy as 'William Bell' sacrifices Harris' Character for an upper hand advantage over his opponent, Walter 'Bishop.'And just as Harris plays evil genius 'Jones' in Fringe, he takes on the role of Moriarty without bringing any leftovers to this movie from that TV role. Even so, the two disparate characters do have many striking similarities. Both evil geniuses, both extremely polite and almost likable in a way, and both doomed.The Beginning of this film has Rachel McAdams once again playing Irene Adler for the last time. Robert Downey Jr/Holmes is a mess as usual, his housekeeper Geraldine James refers to his diet of tobacco and coffee with a side of Cacao Leaves and shots of Formaldehyde. Once again, things that are shown in a passing way in the opening scenes become major plot elements: Holme's 'Urban Camouflage' and his new Adrenaline injections.Stephen Frye emerges as 'Mycroft Holmes'-'Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother.' Holmes, Watson (Jude Law) and Mycroft indulge in a night of debauchery intended as a 'Bachelor Party' for Watson (Which Holmes as usual seems to have forgotten about, but not really), who is still going to marry, Mary. But Holmes uses the club as an opportunity to meet Noomie Rapace as 'Madam Simza Heron' who has something to do with a letter he intercepted from Adler before McAdams stopped being Adler. Madam Simza is looking for her long lost brother Rene, but a Cossack is in the ceiling, waiting for an opportunity to assassinate her. He is foiled by Holmes in the 'Acrobatic' part of this film.In the first film, we were introduced to 'HolmesAVision' and that is put into play here, with the added change of showing how Holmes does not always guess correctly what is going to happen next.Watson does indeed get married to his 'Mary' (Kelly Reilly) before the end of the first act, but their nice honeymoon trip to Brighton is interrupted by Moriarty's Assassins. From there, we go to Paris, and discover an assassination disguised as a bombing, and from Paris to Switzerland and Reichenbach Falls- And we all know if we have read the books what happened there.This film is very loosely based on 'The Final Problem' which was to be the very last Holmes story ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, fortunately for us it was not and Holmes was brought back for 'The Hound of The Baskervilles' and other stories.A method for Holmes to survive the 'falls' had to be concocted, and it was tossed in to the story as an apparent non essential early in the film. The fact that I did not guess this gadget is a compliment to Guy Ritchie's ingenious way of hiding things in plain sight.As an avid fan of the Basil Rathbone Holmes films of the 30's and 40's, and intrigued by some of the treatments of Holmes from the 70's and 80's, I was pleased with this take on the character. I liked both films made by this company so far, and if there is a third one, I am hoping the franchise stays with Guy Ritchies very capable hands.Kieran Mulroney and wife Michelle were a great writing team, captured the flavor of the first Ritchie film. Kieran had the distinction of playing 'Benzan,' An Alien 'Prince' in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' in a second season episode of that show.",10,0,0,28 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I: The Star Wars that should never have been. And Now in ThreeD!
","To quote William Hurt from David Cronenburg's 'A History of Violence' - 'How do you F# that Up?' Well, George Lucas? HOW DO YOU F# THAT UP? I just watched Harry Plinkett's step by step comprehensive video reviews of Eps 1-III. I've always known everything that Mr. Plinkett says, but there was never anyone who figured it out like he had.When it comes down to it, they were MAKING SETS even before George Lucas had any story at all. It is like Lucas wanted to AD LIB these films. I realise that he wanted to tell the tale of how Ralph Nadir Skywalker became Darth Vader, but in doing so, he did EVERYTHING the movie companies wanted to do to him when he made Star Wars. Everything Wrong that is.So, where Episode IV or, as I call it, 'Star Wars' was a stroke of genius directing, writing, storytelling - Art that came from ADVERSITY... Episode I was the movie that Star Wars would have been had the studios gotten their way in 1977.Now, unless you are less than 3 years old, this movie is NOT for you. If you like lots and lots of space ships, explosions, robots, gadgets, aliens, all saying nothing and doing nothing, then go for it.If you watch the original - UN-SPECIAL-EDITIONED Star Wars, there are NO scenes where people are sitting on couches talking about their problems, being filmed from only 2 cameras.Literally, these films go from BORING to TOO BUSY within seconds.I admit, I needed help from Harry Plinkett to understand what a travesty these moovies are: If you don't believe me, go to RedLetterMedia and check it out!As much as I rate 'Star Wars Epidose I' a 1, I rate Mr. Plinkett's Review a 10. It took lot of guts to put Lucas on the Chopping Block.Lucas needs to get back, somehow to his roots. He EATS too much. That's his problem, let him trade places with me, for a year: And then I'll guarantee you he can make a movie of quality.Like he used to be able to do: American Graffitti and even his student film, THX-1138. They are not super high quality social statements like Cronenburg's A History of Violence, but they are good, pleasing, interesting moovies. But then Lucas made Star Wars on almost NO money.If Episode I had been limited to a budget of say, 25 Milion bucks. The QUALITY may have been as good as his first SW moovie.But instead, instead of solving problems caused by too much Hi Tech CGI crap, he kept shoving more and more munny into making scene after scene of nonsensical, non-interesting Kack.Well... Lucas made Three Original SW Moovies that I loved. hey that's good for a lifetime of work, he don't need to DO any more.George Luke-A$$: Please STOP Making Moovies!",1,5,11,26 February 2012
Source Code," Freaky, Creepy, and Fantastic film from David Bowie's Offspring
","At night when I sleep, I usually load up a long playlist of movies I have just downloaded into my VLC Media Player.This film came up in the playlist at 4:00am - And I had woken up within the first 5 minutes of the film, so I stayed awake and watched this, truly disturbing film.Jake Gyllenhaal, a few years older (And taller) than he was in 'The Day After Tomorrow', is Helicopter Pilot 'Captain Colter Stephens'. We don't know this at first, he's on a train and he does not know how he got there. Then the train explodes! Jake/Coulter has then to discover he is not where he left himself, which was in Afghanistan flying a Mission - In fact he does not know where he is at all, and the only voice that speaks to him (Vera Farmiga as 'Goodwin') will not tell him! 'That's Classified' is her answer to his direct question as to his physical location. He is split between two bleak existences: He is in a doomed Train heading for Destiny in Chicago: in which the same events play themselves out over and over again, and alternately he is in a small cold box with a tiny TV Monitor from which speaks Goodwin and sometimes a 'Dr. Rutledge' (Jeffery Wright). The only thing Rutledge will tell him, is that he must play out the last eight minutes of the Tran's existence over and over again.To top it off, while Colter is on the Train, he is not Colter, but 'Sean Fentress' - Whose body he inhabits each time he visits the train. It is during these 8-Minutes on the Train, Colter meets and comes to know Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), who sees Colter as Fentress! Confused yet? As with Inception, I had to watch this a second time, and still have not gotten all that is happening, in this very creative tale written by Fledgling screenwriter Ben Ripley and directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of Alt/Glam-Rocker David Bowie.This story holds together quite well, despite some continuity problems due to the non-linear nature of the storyline. Some have equated this film to Terry Gilliam's '12 Monkeys' - But as Terry Gilliam's films are always very dark and hopeless, this film has very bright spots in it, and the ending is a hopeful ending, despite the curious nature of Colter's state of being.Colter, told by Rutledge he is living in a Simulation, finds that he can affect outcome in the 'real world' (He tells Rutledge he will buy him a Pizza) - If Colter's experiences on The Train are simply a 'replay' of the last 8 minutes of the Train, as Rutledge insists, and exist only as Source Code in a Computer, then Colter would not be able to change the events which happen on the train, which ultimately effect changes in Rutledge's and Goodwin's reality - And of course 'This is not supposed to happen'. Rutledge dismisses Colter's claims out of hand, but Goodwin, who is also a soldier, starts responding to direct questions by Colter as to his state and location, and ultimately she believes that he can effect the changes he claims he can accomplish, this belief leads to her giving Colter his last opportunity.There are a couple of things that bother me about this, they never explain how Sean Fentress's body is able to be inhabited. Rutledge explains it away as Fentress and Colter have similar body and mind characteristics, now this is fine when it comes to explaining Colter, but Fentress... His actual Brain would have to be within proximity of Colter. This is simply, mentioned once, and never explained or mentioned ever again in the film. - How is it that Colter 'becomes' Fentress? Perhaps there were 25 minutes of film left on the editing room floor that could explain this, and if that is the case, we'll eventually have to see a version of this film that has the footage restored- The people who edit films never realise, that if you make something believable, people WILL sit in a Theatre for two and a half hours. I think it is the policy of the movie companies, to release as SHORT a Theatrical Release as possible, with the sheer volume of 'Directors' or 'Alternate Cuts' of just about every film available recently, you can be sure this is the general policy! More showings per day, more buttocks in Seats!",Null,1,2,26 August 2011
Iron Man 3," Hands of The Mandarin In Extremis
","After watching Joss Whedon's new 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' Pilot, I stuck this in my VLC Playlist and let it roll again. I had seen it a few months back so it was a fresh Experience.Jon Favreau remained as 'Happy Hogan' but he gave the directorial reigns to another actor-turned director, Shane Black (Who was 'Hawkins' in 'Predator'). This was not a mistake, as this film uses everything from the first two and builds on them, so there is no real flavor of change.Robert Downey Jr is the same Tony Stark left from Iron Man Two and Avengers, and his dialog with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and 'War Machine/The Iron Patriot' (Don Cheadle) is the same argumentative banter as before.I was expecting the look of Stark's Malibu Residence to change, but no- It's exactly the same, including Stark's robot 'DUM-E' (Which sports a Dunce Cap in the beginning of this).This Story is a marriage of two classic Iron Man themes: 'Hands of the Mandarin' and 'In Extremis'. The Mandarin and The Ten Rings were some of Iron Man's first enemies. But the character of Tony Stark is much the same as it was 'In Extremis' - In Iron Man 2, we saw him gulping down 'Green Machine' drinks, here, he is having full blown panic attacks, which are impairing his functionality. Last time we also got to see the 'Suit in a Briefcase' and these all came from 'In Extremis'.But here, all the stops have been pulled out, nothing is held back. I have to admire the sheer difficulty of producing this, it is very hard to pick out CGI, and that's the way it should be.The greatest thing in here is Pepper, she is less than the Normal Frail 'Damsel in Distress', she has already taken over running Stark Industries, she was ready to be more than merely Stark's Secretary or Girlfriend.We have two unrelated crooks: The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the head of the AIM think-tank, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce). Needless to say, they look great. But one of them is misdirection and cover for the other. Which one? And the fact is, we aren't even guessing this duplicity until it's in our face.Shaun Toub once again shows up as Ho Yinsen, but it's in a scene of 1999 where Happy has long hair. Remember Yinsen told Stark that he had met him after giving a speech while being drunk: This is that event. Rebecca Hall is Maya Hansen, reminding me of Shelley Duvall. She is another variable in this equation.The Mandarin is taking credit for a number of bombings around the country, no evidence of Bombs can be found at each of the sites. 'When is a Bomb not a Bomb?' - That's what Stark is in the middle of figuring out, but he gets interrupted and sidetracked to Rose Hill, Tennessee.Where he meets a Kid, Harley Keener who helps him with a 'Bully' (James Badge Dale - 'Savin'). He also gets to meet a Flame, Stephanie Szostak (Brandt) who has 'the hots' for him, but he lets her cool off on a telephone wire.There are more convolutions in this film there there are in a Brain, well placed and true surprises. It's a rare thing to have that happen in film these days.More is going on with the character of Stark than the usual explosions, Repulsor blasts, and arguments with Pepper and Happy. His previous behavior had created Demons that he has to contend with here. He has to be Iron Man without the benefit of his Armor. But that's how he became Iron Man in the first place. So he's back to digging himself out of a hole with his mind rather than gadgets, although he has to visit a hardware store and make a few gadgets.The merging of the two story lines has created an alternate reality from the Comics, where Mandarin was a different character than this. But the use of The Mandarin here, shows influence all the way back to the first Iron Man movie so there is internal consistency in the three efforts.The trick with these Marvel Movies is creating action shots where iconic imagery from the comics can be used. In all four Spider Man films, these are the poses of Spidey as we web-slings across New York's Skyline. With Thor, it is the Image of him holding out his Hammer in Mid-Flight. Here, it is the image of Iron Man's Crumpled Headpiece on the ground in the middle of a flame, as well as his default pose with fist striking the ground. This movie gives us plenty of those images.Rebecca Mader excels as another Bad Girl, look for other cameos.I enjoyed all three movies in this franchise, so far this has been my favorite. Now all we need is a 4th movie where he has to fight Ultimo.",10,14,22,28 September 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln's Forty Whacks
","Benjamin Walker is Abe Lincoln in this, what should be rather silly Movie. The title and concept was so outrageous I had to see it. I was surprised to see how well they merged the 'vampire' story in with what we know about the historical man.As a boy Abe sees 'Jack Barts' (Marton Czokas) beating on his colored friend Will Johnson. He attacks, causing Barts to take revenge on his mother. This begins a mission of vengeance that has to be put on hold due to a promise to his father (Joseph Mawle) - After whose death he is freed of the obligation to not do anything crazy, he immediately finds his fortification of liquid courage and goes after Barts - and therefore finds himself in a World of Hurt. Rescued by 'Henry Sturges' (Dominic Cooper), he is trained how to use his weapon of choice, a silver-plated Axe, to do away with Vampires.So Sturges sends him packing to Illinois, with a list of names to deal with. But Barts has not forgotten that Lincoln had shot out his eye. And is stalking him as he courts Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), leading to a final battle between Barts and Lincoln: Who reveals an unpleasant truth to Abe before Abe removes an unsightly head - Sturges is a vampire as well!The way this is played out, is not verbal, but visual. Sturges tells his story to Abe in a vignette showing how 'Adam' - That father of all vampires - Had converted him using his own wife's (Teri Wyble) blood. And a new twist is added to the ages old mythology of vampires - They cannot harm each other. Ergo, Sturges through the years has been training Slayers to kill those who did this to him, and Lincoln is just the latest one.Lincoln marries Mary Todd and tells Sturges he is unconcerned, Adam of course does not know who he is. But unfortunately Barts had Lincoln's pocket watch in his gripping hand as he was killed, and Adam finds the watch in Bart's Coffin. And so Adam invites Abe to a 'ball' using his childhood friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) as 'bait.' Lincoln then tells his employer Joshua 'Speed' (Jimmi Simpson) the whole sordid story and brings him in to help. So Abe confronts Adam (Rufus Sewell) - Who has him at a disadvantage, trapping him. Adam tells Abe his long history using some interesting animation, and gives Abe a choice: Kill Sturges, or be made into a vampire using Will's blood. But Joshua has a 'calvary to the rescue' moment and rides his stagecoach into Adam's house... And as they escape, they meet another historical figure: Harriet Tubman of the 'Underground Railroad' - This is the first time 'Lincoln's Train' is brought up.It is after these events, Lincoln puts away his Axe and is more or less his historical self. He is seen arguing with Stephen A. Douglas (a cameo by Alan Tudyk) at the beginning of his political career. As Sturges had put it: 'Always have a contingency plan' and we see this referred to several times in this film. In this case, Abe had developed a career in Politics, and for a time sets down the Axe.But the heat rises when he becomes President: The institution of Slavery had been used to feed a growing population of Vampires in the South, with their needs being sated that way, they stayed put. But now, Slavery is Abolished, and the vampires take an active role in the Civil War on the side of The South: And there are a few scenes of Civil War reenactments that are wonderfully done, especially one classic scene where a particular Northern Captain is the only one left standing after the Vampire Southern Soldiers sweep away all of his men.The vampires take personal revenge on Abe Lincoln, and Mary Todd is on the verge of being driven mad. But with the loss of his son, Lincoln is shown the solution: With one and only one chance of beating them. So he loads a train full of this 'solution' - Only to be betrayed by Joshua Speed.But Honest Abe has some tricks of his own, and he finally pulls the old Axe out of mothballs, not as limber as he was when he was younger, but he soon finds his moves. So it becomes a race to Gettysberg - Can Abe get there first, or will his train get derailed?But Abraham Lincoln has more than one Train...",10,4,8,17 October 2012
Training Day," A Good Deed goes Unpunished
","In this Modern Film Noir classic, Denzel Washington is Detective Alonzo Harris, who runs an elite narcotics task force. Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly 'recruited' to it and even eager to join.Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of 'detecting' - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called 'The Jungles' where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter 'The Jungles' by himself. Harris appears to be the 'benevolent protector' of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our 'First Impressions' and how they are wrong.We get to meet many of Harris' 'friends' and acquaintances, who are either 'retired' drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as 'Roger') or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is 'Why'?Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.This film puts a new slant on the words 'Patsy' and 'Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross'.Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the 'Innocent Look' that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called 'The Jungles' were used as well.Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music.",10,2,3,25 May 2014
Star Trek," I was against this movie from the start!
","I even missed it in the Theatre. But thought about it, my mistake! Why deprive myself of something I grew up on, Something I have loved? To tell the truth I was curious, I wanted to see how JJ Abrams treated this 'Sacred Cow'. I had seen Fan reaction, Trek GEEKS stating that they WOULD NOT see this film. Well, I am a Trekker, but not a GEEK and I usually accept change, so, I bought this as soon as I had 25 bucks in my pocket.TREK had Devolved especially in the last 15 years of the syndicated shows like Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. I had thought Enterprise was just going backward, why tell THAT story? WHY make another FEATURE Film telling the Kirk/Spock story AGAIN? But anyone thinking that immediately loses the point: That in fact, this is NOT that same TREK Universe - It is irrevocably CHANGED.I was a huge fan if The Next Generation and the four films based in That Universe. I extremely enjoyed Star Trek: Nemesis: It was good writing, good acting, great story, and written by John Logan and directed by Stuart Baird. But as much as I liked that film, nobody else liked it. So, when I heard about this project - I thought, these guys have run out of road? No more new story to write, so they go backward? Feh! Until I saw the first scene of this film - Everything happens... Bad Guys come, Huge Space battle... And Kirk gets BORN- Effectively changing TREK History.Now, we have had Trek episodes (City on the Edge of Forever from TOS and Time's Arrow from The Next Generation) where the past gets changed And guys from the future have to go back and change it back.But the focus of THIS trek is NOT 'The Guys in the Future who haplessly have to go into the past and change it back' - Those guys do not exist yet! We don't ever see those guys... Those guys no longer exist! And all of Trek History from TOS... NEVER HAPPENED.And THAT fact gives this film great promise - As a NEW Beginning.We have one, and only one Link with that TOS/NEXT GEN/DS9/VOYAGER universe with it's Cardassian War and Dominion War and BORG: That is Leonard Nimoy as Spock PRIME. But Spock is also played by Zachary Quinto who could be Leonard Nimoy's TWIN, Or Son. Or Clone! This film is an abundance of riches as far as talent: Bruce Greenwood is Captain Chris Pike. Eric Bana as 'The Bad Guy' Captain Nero. I do not know Chris Pine who plays Kirk, but I DO Know Simon Pegg/Shaun of the Dead- Who Flawlessly plays Scotty (w/little alien pet).Winona Ryder as Amanda Grayson/Spock's Mom - I did not know it was she! And if you look carefully at the Vulcan council Members: You see Writer Akiva Goldsman. A stand-out is when Spock is standing before the Vulcan Science Council, who is the minister but the great character actor W. Morgan Sheppard? He goes uncredited in the film.My favourite piece of casting is Karl Urban as 'Bones' - A LONG way from Rohan in Lord of the Rings. His Dr. McCoy is flawless - Including facial expressions and sardonic/sarcastic remarks 'Are you out of your Vulcan Mind!' Clifton Collin's Jr (Traffic) as Bad Guy #2 - Rounds out a class cast. One other little Abramism of note: IN a scene where 'Simon Pegg/Scotty' uses the Transporter Trick to retrieve Kirk, Pike and Spock from two different locations onto the same Transporter pad - Standing right next to Simon Pegg is none other than Chris Doohan - James Doohan's son: An Homage to Departed Members of the TOS Enterprise Crew.Although 'this is not your daddy's Trek' - There are HOMAGES to Trek and earlier episodes and the ten earlier films. Check Kirk eating an apple while he takes a certain 'test' - Spock Prime saying 'I have been and shall always be your friend' to a Kirk that had never gone back to Genesis to pick him up.Now it is interesting to note, that NOT ONE member of Rick Berman's TREK Production crew are present. Not one script supervisor, not one AD, not one writer. This film is ALL JJ Abrams. Despite that apparent handicap, he SEAMLESSLY references that original Trek 'Verse.There are NO slow spots in this film. There is one 'Luke Skywalker on Tattoine' moment where Kirk is looking at the Unfinished Enterprise in Iowa. We can surmise that Because of Eric Bana's visit from the future, changing Kirk's Birth and everything else... The USS Enterprise is different.With that as the premise... Then TREK gets a complete reboot with this film, and if Paramount wanted to, they could go BACK, and re-tell ALL of that story of Kirk/Spock... Which would mean, all of The Next Generation could be retold? All of Deep Space Nine? As much as I was against telling 'Yet Another Kirk/Spock Story' - I cannot refute the LOGIC of this new 'Parallel Trek Verse' - And in fact, THIS Trek is an unrelenting, fast moving Epic... It never lets up, not for a second. It is Trek handed to Abrams with Paramounts Blessing and Abrams doing AMAZING things.I have to admit... As much as I hated this film when it came out... I LOVE this film, especially NOW, that I have it on DVD and I can watch scenes and scrutinize it frame by frame. I hated this film violently - And I LOVE this film just as violently! Everything about this Trek is a NEW Trek. A Fresh Trek... And I hope that Abrams gets to do it again! And NEXT time. I'll see it in the Theatre!",10,8,16,21 November 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Horrid, Horrifying... And Frightening!
","I watched this with the best open mind I could conjure up, and it was still not enough. According to several film historians, this type of racial attitude was actually common back when this was made... And it has been said DW Griffith was actually surprised when rebuffed for making this film. But the worst thing about this film is that, for a time, we had forgotten that it was ever made.Many students of film praise this work, on a purely technical aspect. In good conscience, I cannot praise this work at all for any reason. Certainly there were directorial facets that can be referred to as 'good' but, to be frank, if you use a toilet, and then not flush, then close the lid and clean the outside of the toilet shiny bright, it does nothing except hide the fact that there is still human waste products, unflushed, in the receptacle. On that analogy, a person would probably smell the stench and see the flies from afar before they even got close to the direct source of the stench of racism. And so I can NOT give this film even the slightest iota of praise: If a thing is rotten at the core, it is rotten through and through.This is exactly the case we have with this film. Of all the disgusting crap we have been sold over the years to us through the mis-use of the medium of film, This pack of lies did the most damage. This film is represented as if it were history and I am very glad it never happened, except for the unfortunate creation of a secret society that I hate with all my might. This Secret Society NEVER rose to the heights shown in the film, because I think that we as human beings actually knew better even back then to support this type of hate on the scale that was shown in this 'Epic.' The film was presented in much the same way as war films of 1941 to 1944 were presented: As if this 'Society' were saviours of the Continental US and that 'We all should rise up and keep the repression going and then everybody live happy evah afteh.' If any good can be said about this, it would be that we can see what we do NOT want our nation to become. Unfortunately, this film being made when it was made, and Film being such a new powerful medium, that damage this film wrought lasted for decades, even longer.This film is a monument to all the very worst of Hollywood: It is a monument to a way of thinking, that certain races of people ought to be 'Good lil boys and girls' and be seen, not heard, not vote, intermarry, or have any political power whatsoever. This bad way of thinking is not limited to the race in the film, it also spreads to other races from other cultures that have migrated to the US, and even cultures that existed here before this continent was colonised by people from Northern Europe. Even in 1915... This country was not a country with only one race of people living in it, it was a melting pot. But this film represents what we were allowed to see of our nation, and it was the wrong image.I am frankly astonished that the actors and actresses agreed to be part of such a thing, that they actually cooperated in this. I am thankful that we can look back on this film, as a lesson on all the wrong ways to make a film, or how to treat our neighbors and friends for that matter. I myself apologise, I apologise for this movie.I also apologise for things like actors in Black Face. You know? Al Jolson, Mickey Rooney, Fred Astaire... in a comedic sense, maybe there is some kind of humour in black face. For me? But what about a person of the race that is being 'parodied?' - How to they feel about it? The actual origin of the Black Face is a discussion for another time and place. As far as character acting: In modern film, it is possible to change an actors race for a dramatic part, if the actor is good enough: Walter Slezak to Chinese, Jean Simmons to Indian (Not 'American') in Black Narcissus. But from White to Black, is this proper? I do not know if I can ever view films from the 30's that have follies in them, and enjoy them as I used to. Has any actor put on White face and played a white person? This is a type of hidden boundary that was crossed in Vaudeville and on film, and it is pretty tasteless even to do it in a comedic way: In Birth of a Nation, White actors in Black face was NOT being done in a comedic sense: And to see the film, it is obvious who is in black face and who is a real coloured person. This ought never have been done! Griffith overstepped the boundaries of human decency several times even by thinking of making this film, but the use of white actors in black face was the largest misuse of his authority, and his gifts, if any, of a directorial sense.As far as I am concerned, this film shows the highest level of disrespect from one race to another ever captured on film. And I am sorry, I am so sorry that this was ever done. So, NO, may it not ever happen again, and may films like this be forever forgotten. May it never happen ever again!",1,5,12,10 May 2006
Iron Man 2," Upped to the 10th Power
","A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort. One thing we do know is that Iron Man WILL be a major part of The Avengers - And I ain't talking about Emma Peel!",10,5,8,26 September 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Standing Ovation from a room full of Trek Fans.
","I have had it up to my Vulcan Ears with the targeted attacks on this new Trek. When negative reviews seem to pile up and all repeat themselves verbatim, they were not written by several different people but in fact ONE person. Targeted Attacks to try to bring down the Rating of a film. As you can see, the overall Rating does not agree with the pompous spouting of a few loud individuals. Most of the people who have seen this film have enjoyed it as much as I did - Even giving it a standing ovation at the end credits -The WHOLE room, all standing up and cheering at the end. This tells a different story than the story told by the 1-star commenter who uses several identities to say the same thing over and over.Stardate -308983.9I walked into the theater never having seen a film made for I-Max, *in* I-Max - This is the best 3D I have never seen.From the start, we see Kirk doing what Kirk is best at doing: Completely Disregarding the Prime Directive and the Chain of Command. This Enterprise as we see it at the beginning of this latest Voyage, is a ship of Squabbling Crewmembers. Kirk is Squabbling with Spock who is Squabbling with Uhura who is squabbling with Sulu and Scotty is absolutely refusing to Obey Kirks Orders.Bookends. The first thing we see is the Enterprise rising from the Ocean on a Planet of Jungle People who would have all died. SPOCK Would have died. If not for Kirk's Disobedience. For all of Kirk's Insubordination, he is rewarded with a big fat kick in the buttocks by Starfleet Command. Reduced in Rank, The Enterprise Given back to it's Former Commander, it appears for a bit that we are back to the way things were before Kirk joined Starfleet: If not for one Christopher Pike.Meanwhile a Starfleet Officer with a dying daughter is seen being confronted by a strange, eerie man. KHAN. Who heals the Officer's ailing daughter - For A High Price. But it was all a ruse, every event that occurs which brings Kirk back into Command of his ship has been designed by this one man. This new KHAN who has been given depth and dimension never afforded the same character we met in 'Space Seed'. In fact, some of the things which occurred in the Prime Universe appear to never have happened at all in this Alternate Universe. This does not need to be explained, this needs to be enjoyed. And we, as a theater, as a whole, enjoyed it.So the Enterprise goes to Qo'nos, armed with some 'new torpedoes'- To Qo'nos, because Khan has used Scotty's Transwarp Transporter to escape there. So for the first time in this Universe, we get to see Klingons and their ships.But we have been tricked, as Kirk has been tricked. We've been looking at the wrong Bad Guy. But have we? It requires a Phone Call to Spock Prime on New Vulcan to get some needed facts about this Khan.The squabbling at the beginning of the film between the primary characters is due to the fact that Spock indeed has emotions, just as he always has had emotions, he is just being Logical in not wanting them to govern his actions. But even this is tested down to the bone in this characterization of Spock.This is an Enterprise Crew which is handed events that would have ripped the Original Series Crew into thousands of bits. It just seems that in these new stories, there is NO TIME- Because something else is always happening or being set up to happen.So we in the theater embraced this rapid-fire Trek which shot off several episodes worth of raw story in Phaser-Rifle succession. I've seen one particular type of complaint saying 'This is a remake of The Wrath of Khan' or 'Canon was ruined and ignored' - And this one person who is posting these complaints as many other people is missing the point that this is not the Original Universe, and is not giving his or herself permission to just ENJOY the premise that this *is* an alternate Reality.This is just to say, there is a TIME to keep things the same and a time to move on to new things. For the new Production Team, the same Team that bought us Fringe - To take on this new endeavor is difficult, because it would be easy to get stuck in the same rut that caused Enterprise to close it's ShuttleBay Doors prematurely.And because of that, Gene Roddenberry's hand-picked successor was given the boot by Paramount and the four or five huge storehouses of Trek Props which had been saved since The Original Series were sold to the highest bidders.So A Worthy Successor had to be chosen, and I believe the right guy was given the Job. To me, this is the same as the Klingon Right of Succession for the leader of the High Council.So it is not that Trek references were crammed into a 2-hour film, it was the proper use of them. Spock contacts Spock Prime, and Spock Prime is STILL Spock from The Original Series. This is ESTABLISHED.If you think that Trek has been ruined - Then stick your DVD of 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' into your DVD player and you can watch that repeatedly for the rest of your life - While the rest of us move on and explore the galaxy with this new Crew. Because Bajor is out there, Cardassia is out there, The Founders are still out there (And Odo). The Prophets are still there, now we can meet them all again in a whole new way - And I can't wait for the next installment of this great franchise.",10,6,18,27 May 2013
Elizabeth," Fantastic, Moving Historical Drama - Very Captivating
","Who can forget Bette Davis as the 'King in Petticoats' Queen Elizabeth the First- Until one sees how Cate Blanchette tackles the same difficult subject.I had never heard of Cate Blanchette until she was perfectly cast as Galadriel in Lord of The Rings, but after that I cannot get enough of her, she always raises the quality level of any film she is in.As a character actress she rivals the greats like Paul Muni - A chameleon, you never know as what next she will appear.I had wanted to see this film from the time that 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' was released, I did not want to see that film until I had seen this one.This film has great performances by Joseph Fiennes, Edward Hardwicke -Son of Sir Cedric Hardwicke and looks just like him, Geoffrey Rush, and the most striking woman, Amanda Ryan ans the fictional Lettice Howard as the lover of The Earl of Norfolk. Other standouts are Fanny Ardant as Mary of Guise. Finally, Richard Attenborogh as Sir Cecil. and that rounded out a great cast.Visually this film uses very little CGI except in establishing shots, and it is done well. The choice of locations give the proper impression of antiquity.Although this film takes some liberties with the history of Queen Elizabeth I, it shows us how it may have been for this remarkable woman: Imprisoned Princess to Queen to Virgin Queen.",10,1,3,20 August 2009
Black Book," One of Verhoven's best
","One of the first 'Foreign' films I ever saw was Verhoven's 'Spetters' - And he is back now to his roots. With this movie it was as if 15 to 20 years of Verhoven's Big Hollywood movies never happened. Although in fact they did happen, giving Verhoven the experience to make this film great, done on a 'shoestring' budget of only 16 million Euros, this film has the quality of a 150-Million dollar Hollywood movie.I recognise most of these actors from films like 2004's 'Downfall' and two versions of 'Operation Valkyrie' that were done in the 2000's - The German actors are well cast as Nazis especially Christian Berkel as 'General K√§utner' and Sebastian Koch as 'M√ºntze'.This film utilises the capacity of Europeans to speak several languages fluently, and there are English, Dutch, Hebrew, and German lines tossed out without any difficulty by the actors chosen. 3/4 of the dialogue is in Dutch, as this is a Dutch film revolving around events in that country toward the last days of WW-II in Europe.Carice van Houten portrays a Jewish woman surviving in The Hague in Holland during WW-II. I don't know if van Houten is ethnically Hebrew, or not, but she sells her heritage well in this film, except where she is hiding that heritage.The thing I kept forgetting with the amount of Nudity and Frank Sexuality in this film, was that this was not filmed in Hollywood, where the Ratings are hung up on such things. In that way, the storytellers were not repressed like they were when involved in US productions.The story itself, which is shown in flashback after 'Ronnie' (Halina Reijn) meets 'Ellis' (van Houten) at the Kibbutz in Israel, begins with elements of any standard WW-II story. But from almost the beginning of the flashback, we see that things as shown in this film, are definitely not 'standard' in any form. Who are bad guys are, is shrouded in a fog - We know there is a traitor, but our attention is constantly being shifted. The events in this film happen over a very short period of time and mostly over a three day period in The Hague. Random unfortunate events combine with deliberate sabotage and deception to cause some bad things to happen to a group of the Dutch Resistance. Which events were just bad luck, and which ones from diabolical trickery? The way this film plays out, is that we do not know until the very end of the film.This makes Verhoven one of my favourite directors, I am very glad he made this film, it was very well cast, of comfortable length, paced well, and one of the best things about it was Van Houten's singing in three languages throughout the film. I say this to anyone: If you have not seen this, go out and get it right away if you can find it- It took me about three months to find a decent copy of it.",Null,0,1,23 September 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Best of the X
","'I'm the best at what I do and what I do ain't pretty' This film surprisingly stays fairly true to what we know about Wolverine and the 'Weapon X' program through the comic books. The film is largely based in Barry Windsor-Smythe's 'weAponX' which was run as a serial in the 'Marvel Comics Presents' comic book line and later released in Trade Paperback form.There is a lot here for fans of Wolverine, certain aspects of this story were taken right from the Wolverine series of 1988 - Wolverine's relationship with 'Silver Fox' uses a lot of elements straight from the books and that 'chapter' of the wolverine story is actually fairly close to the source material. The only dramatic license I did not like was that Sabretooth and Wolverine are shown as brothers.Since the weAponX story by BWS was drawn in a cinematic style, a lot of the imagery from that book survives translation to Film format just as well as any Frank Miller book.While a lot of creative license was taken with some characters and some of the events that occur, much of the dialogue is taken straight from the books and the overall concept is maintained.Regarding the look of the film, I can use one example, when 'Gambit' reveals his powers, the image we are given matches the iconic profile of Gambit- From the comic books and the 1992-96 Cartoon.Since 'Victor Creed/Sabretooth' was a major part of this film, I was semi-disappointed that they did not get Tyler Mane to reprise his earlier 2000 role (Or, pre-prise, whatever the word would be) - The original X-Men film had perfectly cast Sabretooth. I wish they had cast Liev Schreiber for that original film, as he gives more to the character than occasional grunts and snarls that Tyler Mane used for language. Schreiber actually gives the character valid depth and darkness and is less of a cardboard cutout. My only real gripe about using a new actor for this role is that they did not try to match the image from the books, as the 2000 film did perfectly. And so the popular image of Wolverine engaged in mortal combat with Sabretooth- As painted by former Wolverine artist Mark Texiera and reproduced as a huge poster - That image was damaged and I do not know if other Wolverine fans are a forgiving as I am.Regardless of if the reason 'James Logan' becomes part of the Weapon X program is the same reason as the comic books (In The comic books Logan is abducted) - The Process of Wolverine accepting the 'Adamantium' metal to his bones is the centerpiece of this film, it is the most important part of the film, and as far as I am concerned you can toss the whole film and leave the process.The filmmaker needed to take the threads that had been woven in the first 3 X-Men films and give us a start point... Where did the Adamantium metal come from, what Stryker wanted to do with it, and why, all of these questions are explored in this film and as a fan of the comic book series, and also a fan of films in general, I accept the questions, answers and the way it was filmed unequivocally.I know I enjoyed this film highly, and so did the large amount of people I saw this with, this film got a lot of crown response.And so, I say the critics and paid shills that are panning this film can go to blazes and I hope that someone does to them what Wolverine does to 'Deadpool/Wade Wilson' at the end of the film - And you'll have to go see it to find out what he does. Oh, look the shills popped up and marked my post as 'not helpful' - Which means nothing except that someone is using a bunch of fake IDs",10,39,73,4 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Sam Worthington makes a whole new kind of Terminator
","Despite the Franchise changing John Connors as often as a T-1000 can change identity, The Terminator Story is now moved up into the time frame when Connor is in the resistance. These 'Alternate Timeline' stories are as popular now as when the first Outer Limits was on Television with stories like these, during the Golden Age of Science Fiction when Harlan Ellison was writing 'Demon with a Glass Hand' (On which the original Terminator movie was based). And so the Familiar elements of the Timeline... John Connor, Kyle Reese, Kate Brewster, and even the T-800/850/101, intermingle with the topnotch storytelling of X-Files Bard John Brancato, who also wrote T3.Christian Bale plays John Connor who is taking charge of the future he was groomed to live in - He is gathering his 'Tech-Comm' unit and although in this film, he is not yet Leader of the Resistance, Bale portrays him as a No-Nonsense leader... Gone is the Kid of T2: Judgment Day played by Edward Furlong, and no more of the wandering, hiding John Connor of T3 played by Nick Stahl, although Stahl had taken the role and made it his own, the change to Christian Bale was not a mistake.The Kate Brewster mantle was dropped onto Ron Howard offspring Bryce Howard, whose blind girl in M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' put her on the very visible map, and she no slouch in the Brewster role either, other portrayals include Anton Yelchin as a teenage Kyle Reese, Yelchin had captured all of the mannerisms of the character made by Michael Biehn.And so we come to the new, Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Replacing central character, Marcus Wright - played by new Action star Sam Worthington, who I have said is the Orlando Bloom of the 2010's.The Hapless Marcus Wright, eagerly awaiting execution sells his Body to the dying Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter)- Only to wake up in the middle of a small Nuclear Explosion. We see Wright for a second, in the underground Skynet facility Connor breaks into, and discovers that the T-800 Program is underway much earlier than expected.This can probably be attributed to Wright's appearance in the Timeline, Technologies that Skynet did not originally have, were on hand due to Dr. Kogan's experiments.The way Brancato melds it all into the original Terminator story, we know that the things seen in this treatment of the storyline will come to pass, just not in the way expected. The Wright character shines a whole new light on these events, and so, most of Terminator Salvation is seen through the jaded eyes of Marcus Wright.After Wright connects with Reese and the mute Star (JadaGrace Berry), his adventures begin, and Wright cannot guess where: Losing Reese and Star, Wright connects with love interest A-10 Pilot 'Williams' who has to eject on top of Wright's head. Moon Bloodgood plays Blair Williams, and immediately pursues Wright. What else is there to do in an apocalyptic future but repopulate? She becomes unrequited in that pursuit. Blair brings him straight to Connor and a startling revelation that he is not what he thinks he is... And that is all the spoiler I can put in here; this is basically the story of Wright, and his interactions with the characters we met in the 1st 3 films and in this one.There are MANY homage's to the earlier films; just about every scene in this film has a reference to an earlier Terminator. For instance, when the MotoTerminator jumps over the truck (Like Arnold/T800 did in T2) during a chase scene, Wright knocks out the broken glass in the window of the truck he is driving, just like T-1000 in T2. We can hear all of the 'I'll Be Backs' and other famous Terminator Phrases cleverly added to the dialogue. I like that they did these homage's, some of them are subtle, others blatant.The Kicker of this film, of course, is the Guest-Appearance of Arnold's face on the very first T-800 ever made - Which was photorealistic to the point where it did not look exactly like Arnold looked, it was meaner. This first T800 is several notches more powerful than Arnold's original T800 - He is MUCH harder to kill.... RPG's which would have turned the first T800 into scrap only succeeds in destroying the T800's Flesh. The combat chassis underneath the Arnold Visage is not the same Silver Titanium Hyperalloy Combat Chassis (Microprocessor Controlled) - This metal is More Durable.I honestly admit when I watched this, I didn't like a couple of things, but as you get into the 3rd, 5th, and 10th viewing of this film it grows on you, the Marcus character grows on you, and Worthington played this part VERY well. So far I've liked all three major films Worthington has been in. He makes this film for me, although the other actors in this ensemble cast are also good. Michael Ironside makes his usual small role appearance.As Stan Winston's final foray into the Terminator Universe, this film was done well, the effects well placed and not overbearing, the characters multilayered and fresh, the story a good overall Terminator Action/SciFi story, McG did much better on this than I expected he would. after Charlie's Angels.As this film was supposed to be the first of a 'New Trilogy' and reboot of the Terminator Franchise, I can only hope, that the ownership issues are leveled out, and that a new Terminator film can be made that follows the future as laid out here... Because the Wright character can return, we see how easily he was rebuilt as Skynet... And we know he can re-appear, even though his heart now beats in John Connor's Chest.This film, in my opinion put the same new life that Marcus Wright gave John Connor, to the Terminator Multiverse.",10,3,6,13 June 2011
Aquaman," Ronon Dex harpoons Aquaman
","I've been a fan of Aquaman since the 60's, so I'll take my own counsel about this film over anyone who was not even born at the time I was originally reading Aquaman comics. If you never read these comics as a child? If you never collected them, if you never watched the Superman-Aquaman 'Hour of Adventure' cartoon show from the late 60's every Saturday morning with your brother, then you ain't qualified to review it, really. If you have, if you have taken the time do you find reprints and trade paperbacks of the old stories, well then that's good. A person should try to be at least a little bit familiar with the character before watching this. And if you don't have the money to buy a bunch of used comic books, then there is Wikipedia and other online sources that are pretty good that can fill you in with the uniqueness of this character, because once you understand the character, you will see why I highly appreciate this film.Even though I stopped actively collecting in the 70's, I still kept up with the history of the character. Aquaman was originally a Blonde haired Blue eyed Seawater Breathing, Seahorse Riding gent who could talk to fish and swim around in the deep but not much else. He was the King of Atlantis, and so his comic books always dealt with his administration of the underwater Kingdom while his adventures with the Justice League of America sometimes took him to other planets. He's saved Superman more than once, and at one time, he grew his hair out long and lost one of his hands, replacing it with a Hook. He became a much darker, more unkempt and disheveled figure, much like Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight' version of Batman, which in my opinion Ben Affleck was the greatest depiction of.Aquaman, this Aquaman, is the undersea, super powered version of The Dark Knight. And Jason Momoa, who became famous playing Ronon Dex in Stargate Atlantis (another fable which included Atlantis), has been the first and best version of Aquaman. I don't think anyone can take it from here.I really don't know the state of the DC Cinematic Universe at this time, Zack Snyder started it with his Man of Steel, which lead up to the creation of The Justice League, and it is sad, very sad, that this story is not continuing. Or is it? I think I see plans for Aquaman II and Justice League II. But other New films are planned which are basically reboots of what Zack Snyder created. I don't want that, I want to see a second Justice League movie which includes the characters as they are now.Aquaman is one of the latest films to be told in the DCCU, and it caps off the tale with a threat that grows from the deep, Arthur Curry has a half-brother (Played by Patrick Wilson, Nite Owl from Watchmen, and I admit he is very handsome as an Atlantean) who wants to be crowned 'Ocean Master' which will empower him to make war upon the surface. Arthur has to prevent this somehow, and his adventures take him to Atlantis, The Sahara, my Homeland Sicily, and finally The Marianas Trench/Challenger Deep - To meet a unique creature that has killed everyone who has ever come face to 'face' with it. Can Arthur survive this?Now, the one thing about this film is that there appears to be a huge knock down drag out fight every 5 minutes. But, they are well choreographed. I thought The Atlanteans had too many Gizmos. Those are my only complaints.I thought it was cool that Nicole Kidman is his mom while Bobba Fett's Clone-Pop is his Dad. And his GF 'Mera' (Amber Heard, hm, she was married to Capn Jack Sparrow?), so it's an all in the family affair.Mainly I loved that a character that I loved as a child has finally been given their own film, and a guy I like played him. That's all anyone can ask.Notice - Since this review is pretty much the same as the other review that somehow got posted before this one, I'm removing 'spoilers', because I did not really put any spoilers in here. This was the update to that review and it just has a few new things in it.",10,2,5,5 July 2019
L.A. Confidential," A Buttkicking Confrontation between Crowe and Pierce
","This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the 50's and especially the Los Angeles of that era. The Power Gap created by a jailed Mob Boss 'Mickey Cohen' causes a series of murders of all of Cohen's Lieutenants, which we get to see as Danny DeVito aka 'Sid Hudgens' from 'Hush-Hush' magazine narrates the graphic violence.Russell Crowe is 'Bud' White, a two-fisted cop who can't stand seeing women abused, due to his witnessing his mother murdered by his father when he was a child. But Bud himself has a streak of Brutality. After dealing with an ex-con, soon to be con who was beating his wife on Christmas Eve, he and his partner Dick Stenzland make a liquor run for the 'office' booze party - White meets 'Veronica Lake/Lynn Bracken' with an immediate spark. Out in the parking lot, White sees another young woman with a broken nose in the back seat of a car containing millionaire Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathairn). In the middle of Whites' inquiries, out pops 'Buzz' Meeks (Darrell Sandeen) who White easily beats the crap out of. Stenzland tells White 'He used to be a Cop'This intro only seems like it bears little relation to the story as it develops, but in fact it is close to the heart of the story: And we see why as we watch it unfold.Ed Exley is the son of an honored LA Detective, who may have risen in the ranks using unethical means, who had been murdered by 'Rollo Tomasi' - 'The Guy who Gets Away with It.' Ed however, will not take the gratuity offered to him by 'Jack Vincennes' (Kevin Spacey), as he comes in with a wholly set-up marijuana bust (by Hudgens, for publicity) of two hapless kids. Vincennes is technical adviser to a 'Dragnet' style TV show 'badge of Honor' and he lives for doing it.What begins as a seemingly harmless New Year's Eve party ends up with cops beating the crap out of two Hispanic guys in Jail who had shot and killed one cop. They could not wait for the Press to leave the building and the whole thing is splashed all over the papers. Heads have to roll, and the only cops who come forward are Exley, who willingly plays Whistleblower, and Vincennes, who was coerced into testifying, or lose his job on the TV show. The 'rolled head' ends up being White's partner Dick Stenzland, 1 year from retirement, which infuriates the entire department against Exley. But Exley was promoted to 'Detected Lieutenant' - Because it was his idea on how to get Vincennes to testify.These two scenes are very important to the continuity of the film. As a chapter in James Ellroy's Quartet of novels about LA, many of the elements were in fact based on real people or events. The beating of the two Hispanic prisoners really happened, and according to a few Hollywood personalities from the past, there really was an agency similar to 'Fleur-De-Lis' that hired prostitutes that resembles famous Hollywood Starlets. And there actually was a power vacuum left by the imprisonment of real-life gangster Mickey Cohen.Curtis Hanson uses these real elements to tell James Ellroy's tale of corruption in the mid-50's. It is a tapestry of complex, interconnected events which will eventually bring three detectives: Ed Exley, Bud White, and Jack Vincennes to the inescapable conclusion of who really is Rollo Tomasi, and Rollo is closer to them than we could possibly imagine.There is one MacGuffin in this film: The Briefcase with Mickey Cohen's stolen Heroin. In some movies, the crime is solved by 'Following the Money' - In This case, the crime is solved by Following the Heroin.This film should have won an Oscar for the gritty realism portrayed, and it survives under the scrutiny of multiple viewings.",10,2,3,29 September 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," Much better the second time.
","When I first watched this film I thought it was way over the top and I really didn't like it too much. Primarily because there are a lot of really bad things that happen. But as I go back and I view each section of this film, this is a film that had to happen.First off we saw at the end of 'The Dark World' that Thor was speaking to Odin, and in the very final reveal it wasn't Odin at all, but Loki instead. Who apparently somehow faked his own death, and then took Odin's Place.So that little issue had to be dealt with. In a small side note, when Thor comes back home for a short time there is a play being held in honor of Loki, and the actor playing Odin is actually Sam Neill.Then, there was a question of what ever happened to Bruce Banner/The Hulk? And there is a surprising answer to this question, which Thor accidentally stumbles into.The part that really bothered me was suddenly, Thor has a sister named Hela who looks like a goth chick with a bad hair day, who happens to be more powerful than anybody that Thor has ever come up against. And this was Galadriel even (Cate Blanchette), Who I didn't even recognize at all until I saw the end credits. Like, WHAT?!? She's one of those actresses that apparently never ages. I don't know if she did any of her stunts in this, I don't think she did in the third hobbit film either, when she gets all dark world and stuff.A lot of time is spent on an apparent Trash-Planet, Saakar, run by Jeff Goldblum. And this is where he meets an unlikely ally, Tessa Thompson. The character actually doesn't really have a name, she is referred to as what she was: a Valkyrie. Possibly the very last one. And also a guy made out of rocks, 'Korg' played by the films very director, Taika Waititi, who is surprisingly very good and funny. He also played the bounty/nurse-bot in the Mandalorian.The final part of this film brings us back to Asgard that is not really in very good shape due to the ministrations of Hela. And then Clancy Brown is a huge monster and guess what happens? That's right, the Hulk tries to kill it.What I liked about this film is that it shows how the Hulk would have been after two whole years of being the hulk. He even developed a rudimentary language of sorts.There are simply way more good things in this film than bad. And it's also a necessary film for the storyline occurring in The MCU.Finally I liked the fact that Loki and Thor actually start respecting each other as brothers, despite whatever Loki had done he was still family to Thor, and to Odin.I just went through this edit and I see NO reason for it to be declined. I wanted to leave my original review down there for comparison sake. Thank you.===== previous review=====>>>But the reason I'm giving this a 9/10 is because, the parts that are good are very good. Actually, to blazes with the FakeAccounts downvoting me, I'm changing it to 10/10.This new director, Taika Waititi (from Flight of the Concords) maybe should not have done such a huge property, but he did well in most spots. Especially during Dr Strange's 'cameo'.What I did not like was a lot of familiar things were taken away in this installment, including some accouterments beloved by Thor fans. And some people from the first two films.What starts out as a mysterious hunt for Odin turns rapidly into something else. Then, suddenly, the story is split. A Good story has a good Beginning, Middle and End. This film has a good beginning, but replace 'Muddle' for middle here. Nevertheless, by the time the 3rd act rolls out, these distractions have been validated as necessary parts of the story.It is still entertaining and has a lot of imagery from the first Thor installment. Heimdall is back, and seeing everywhere, but for a while replaced by 'Skurge' (A Bald and Tattooed Karl Urban, using his native New Zealander Accent). And we knew that Loki had been pretending to be Odin, from The Dark World. Enter 'Hela', an unimaginable threat, played by an unrecognizable Cate Blanchette. And some new characters Played by Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson (who played across Anthony Hopkins in 'Westworld').Scenes showing Bifrost are perfectly matched with the first film, everything looks like it should, so most of my points are given for continuity. Even the 'Asgard' music from the first film is played. I was halfway expecting Guardians of the Galaxy to show up and save Thor, but alas, it wasn't them. And there was the usual amount of guest roles by other Marvel superheroes.Much better the second time",10,1,9,2 February 2018
The Terminator," From Near-B Movie to Franchise
","In 1984, when I was dragged to a theatre in San Fransisco by my thumbs to see this and was made to sit through two viewings by my friend, I noted two names: James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. I did not know that Cameron was one of veteran b-movie filmmaker Roger Corman's prodigies. At the time, I did not know much about Corman other than he had something to do with 'Battle Beyond the Stars' which I liked although I thought it was rather silly.Cameron learned all of his tricks from Corman... As this film shows. Basically, Terminator was a B-Movie made to look like an A-Movie. Using all Corman's budget saving tricks, Cameron produced a film that at least to a viewer's initial viewing, looks like it had a much higher budget than it actually did - Much like Corman's AIC films of the 60's.Now Terminator borrowed heavily from basic science fiction material, to the point where Harlan Ellison sued due to plot details similar to his short story 'Demon with a Glass Hand' which was made into an Outer Limits episode - One of the earliest Science Fiction things I had ever seen, I was maybe 4 years old when I saw Demon with a Glass Hand. I did notice the similarities, but basically I did not care. You can also see elements which may have been influenced by the short story 'All you Zombies' by the dean of science fiction, Robert Anson Heinlein. The Terminator then, borrowed from both of these sources. I was not surprised to learn later that Harlan Ellision sued to get story recognition put on the credits of the film, this was a very Ellision thing to do- Cameron should have done this in the first place though, you can't just borrow parts of plots from Hugo Award winning science fiction stories - And Cameron did it again in Avatar, borrowing the main plot elements of Poul Anderson's 'Call me Joe' (Guy in a wheelchair, spinal injury, moon of a superjovian planet, remote controlling a genetically created body on the surface of said moon and eventual transfer into that body), and since Poul Anderson passed in 2008, I'd say Cameron released Avatar just in time, eh? But he did not get away with it in 1984, as he was a fledgling director at the time. What Cameron did, was blend these borrowed items, and he created a new piece of work. Now, it never bothers me that film writers borrow from all over, in 1984 Cameron was made to put the acknowledgment into the film, and I am glad for that, because as I was sitting in the theatre, I was thinking, 'This guy reads a LOT of Science Fiction' - And as his taste was just like mine, I wholly enjoyed seeing the material used.Now what nobody really knew was how immensely popular this film would become, basically shadowing Arnold Schwarzenegger to this date with 'I'll be Back' and other quotes- Actually The Terminator is responsible for creating a whole subculture based on some of the phrases from the film. But what The Terminator really did was create a launching point for a Franchise.This film was a milestone for Special Effects Animatronix Wizard Stan Winston - Who created a whole working mechanical Arnold for a lot of the shots which reveal Terminator internal workings. When you view Terminator in 2011, these effects look rather primitive - What people have to realise that in 1984, nothing like that had ever been done before. This put both Cameron and Winston on the map from then on. Also we can thank Tom Woodruff, Jr, who has operated Winston (and other creatures) effects from the 80's through the 2010's.This film also made use of unknown actors, Michael Beihn, Linda Hamilton, the three punks Brad Reardon, Brian Thompshon (The Shape Changing Alien from X-Files) and of course the great Bill Paxton. And of course this was the breakthrough for Arnold even more than 'Conan the Barbarian'... More people identify Arnie as The Terminator rather than any role where he basically ran around in a loincloth.Now, I really don't care that Cameron basically borrowed material from several Hugo-Award Winning Science Fiction Authors, because nobody was USING that material, and any films made from material by those greats (A Boy and His Dog) were done poorly... Now here is a director not afraid to take this source material and make it LOOK the way it was written in these classic Sci-Fi stories, and so what we have here, is Part One of a now-Quadrilogy of great Sci Fi stories - This first installment set the basic foundation, and what has been done, is that Cameron is now responsible for creating a new kind of American Mythology based on these 'borrowed' concepts of Time Travel, Cyborg Soldier, Grandfather Paradox (Ie - Man goes back in time, becomes his own grandfather). Just as Lord of the Rings was created by JRR Tolkein to become a new kind of British Folklore, The Terminator has become part of An American Folklore. And 'in 100 years, who is going to care' that Cameron raided the refrigerators of Heinlien, Asimov, (Martin) Caiden* Ellison, and Anderson?*(aka, writer of Cyborg, originator of the phrase and creator of the 6 million dollar man)",Null,0,0,6 May 2011
Cloverfield," Scared the S___ out of me!
","The filmmakers effect of course is that as you watch the handy cam footage, you experience what the protagonists experience.The core of the story is the first bit of video with 'Rob' and 'Beth' - Two new, non-familiar non-Hollywood faces, faces you will meet at any party like the party 'Hud' was filming. Well, not like that particular party.But it takes an invasion by some unknown thing to tell the tale. It also takes the side-story about a Rave-Gone-Bad, which started to go bad the moment 'Hud' got the camera. Personally, I would have killed 'Hud' at the start of the film, but we needed Hud to lug the Camera around.This film uses the Hitchcock-ian method of filming with almost NO CUTS as in 'Rope' and 'Under Capricorn' - But with the added Handy-Cam kind of footage- This brings the film into an incredible level of first-person experience... Because WE become Hud as Hud films the events of the evening- So we see what Hud sees, and also what the camera sees.At first viewing, we have no initial idea what is happening, no warning, and we are not sure until we see a huge TAIL. And we have not a clue as to why the heads of Statues of Liberties are being flung as if they were crumpled aluminum foil projectiles, and we are teased like that all through the film, a lot of things we see are not really explained. Matt Reeves builds the picture, step by step, and to great effect.But what it comes down to... THIS is probably the GREATEST Monster Movie made in 25 years, not since the Original Alien- As Alien had the Chest Burster scene, this film has...Never mind what it has. I won't tell you, you have to SEE it- New York City has NEVER been Tokyo-Trashed like THIS... And while Tokyo has Godzilla, New York has Clover!",10,1,2,13 August 2008
Alien," Ridley Scott is the Perfect Director
","I have just watched the Directors Cut of this and enjoyed the commentary by Scott, Weaver, Skerrit, O'Bannon, Hurt, and others who were involved in the original production.I saw this in 1979. In 1979 there were two movies to see that had something to do with monsters emerging out of 'Eggs' - Prophecy and Alien. So, we had to pick, which monster movie to go see, and it was Alien, mostly on the basis of Rumour. We saw it twice in a row on consecutive nights. Needless to say, I took off my dinner jacket and watched the whole movie with one eye, so I could cover up my face. Now normally monster movies did not bother me that much except when I was very young.Now I have to reach back to give my impressions, and those impressions are larger when seen on a huge curved screen- I think they had some kind of four-channel sound in that theatre, it was the first film I saw that had noises coming from behind me. That might have been set up special for that theatre, I do not think that was so common back then.So, this film starts and there are these lines appearing on the screen, which resolve into the word Alien, while the credits roll underneath. Underneath this enigmatic hieroglyph, a very dark planet revolves, someplace we do NOT want to visit, an omen of bad things to come.Then we are shown a space ship, which in design is mainly four oil derricks: But to the eye appears to be a dark Gothic Cathedral.And the inside of the Nostromo is shown and we see all manner of corridor and dark rooms and machinery of all shapes and sizes. This is all the spoiler that you will get out of me.And so was set up the first Gothic Horror Movie set in Space. The first Successful one at least... There was The Green Slime before, sort of the same premise.This film perform all the basic Horror genre elements expected: The less you see, the more frightening it is. In Scott's case, it was not, how little or how much you see, but how fast that information can be flicked at you.HR Giger created the perfect monster: And my impression of it was that this thing was partially mechanical and also that it could hide itself in plain view. Another of my assumptions was that this creature would assimilate qualities of the organism chosen as host. I had a whole list of things this creature would do, or could do. This based on the very few appearances and activities of the thing we see in the film.When I drove home the first night I saw this in 1979, I was horrified but also fascinated with the qualities of the creature. I became obsessed with it, I drew it, what I could remember of it, in my notebooks, and when they came out with a toy figurine of the thing, I was first in line to buy it.This original Alien, designed by Giger but given life by Scott, is the best of all of the creatures of this type in the 5-film franchise. It is bar none the best monster ever made up by demented minds like mine.There is a serious, plodding pace set by Scott in this film. In modern horror films, the horror activity has a tendency to take place as quickly as possible: But in this one, we are set up from the first appearance of those Hieroglyphs at the beginning, to the point where we think we are safe (But we KNOW that something ominous will happen) and when it happens we are hit with a jackhammer: And I was not surprised to find out, when the famous scene was filmed, the cast themselves were reacting with real horror reactions.If Scott had not done it that way, this film never would have worked in that crucial spot. And because of that, there is really no place for sequels of this film to go: But thanks to James Cameron, there was a direction to go: And so the horror of the original film grew into a fascination with the creature. As was Frankenstein to early Horror films, Alien to Modern Horror films.I was pleased to hear Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott, when talking about this film, confirm all of my assumptions about this creature.And this is what makes Scott the perfect director, at least for the film Alien: because what was in his mind, he put across into OUR minds.And the most pleasing thing about that is he did it with mostly Practical Effects, simply executed, photographed and edited well.When I see the modern depictions of this horrifying creature, sometimes they use CGI representations of it which do not convince me, even though I did enjoy the STORY of Aliens vs Predator, the Alien is remarkably cheap looking (IN the CGI shots): But I can forgive that, because the director of AvP BROUGHT BACK the Shiny Dome Head that HR Giger had so carefully designed to scare the s___ out of us. So when I see disappointments in the CGI... Because I know that there is really no excuse today for a CGI effect to be bad...I know I can still flip the Directors Cut DVD into my player and catch that magic again.",10,1,3,30 September 2007
Black Mass," 'The Departed' in Real Life
","That was the first thing I thought when I started watching this very slow-burn take on the life and times of Whitey Bulger.I have read a few other reviews that seem to agree, this film starts of slow, and pretty much remains slow, but with each new development more corpses are buried under the pier, and you have to ask how can anyone remain clean? '1000 faces of delusion' maybe put it the best, 'It's not Goodfellas but in that lineage of unspoken titillation at what people get away with; it seems we'll always want to be flies-in-the-wall in the same room with horrible men'.And as much as I enjoyed Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Trilogy, and even The Departed, those were fantasy stories maybe slightly based on real life figures.But the image of Whitey Bulger is so unusual that this story is fascinating. And Bulger's own background - This film does not touch on his alleged involvement with the MK-ULTRA Program, but it shows this somewhat charismatic crook in a most realistic manner.Johnny Depp seems to have been born for this role, he even looks a lot like the man, makeup aside. And what starts out as an idealistic young FBI agent, Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, ends up deluding himself. It all sounded so good, when he met Bulger and proposed a way to take down a rival Mafia gang, but what started out as something 'for the good of all' (of course, except for the rival gang) ended up as an escalating pile of bodies and a geometrically increasing Body of Lies. In setting up an ambitious alliance with Bulger, Connolly forgot why he was doing it, and from then on was a total loss.It seems that anyone who became involved with Bulger's business became horribly dead as well. And Bulger did not stop with Business Associates, family and friends were not immune. But we still approach the character as a human being, his relations with his mother and 'little brother' Billy (Played well with a great accent by Benedict Cumberbatch) are all the same things we all have in common. And the fact that Billy Bulger was somewhat protected from the worse part pf Whitey's activities, seems like what our family members do for us.Regardless of this, there are no 'Happy Endings' here, and the bad guys don't get away with it. In the long run, everyone has to account for their actions. I would only hope real life is the same.",10,2,5,13 February 2016
Suicide Squad," Harley steals it, Smith nails it. Leto becomes the Joker.
","I stuck this flick up in my Plex Server and forgot about it. Then I watched it a few more times, and something happened. It grew on me.Most of the reviews I have read are over-analyzing this film. It is what it is. It's the BAD GUYS. It's The Joker. It's a comic book movie, for cryin out loud! Sorry, movies that 'suck' do not rake in a $745,600,054 Box Office. So, IMDb reviews say that this film sucks, and the Box Office (and other review sites) say that it doesn't. So ya just have to decide what you are gonna believe. If people kept going to the theatre to see it, and if they keep buying the Blu Ray or renting it, even to this day, then I'd say it less than sucks. Because it's just a fun movie.The More I watch this, the more I think Jared Leto is the best Joker I've ever seen. We have all this dark Magic cack going on in the background, the Sorceress is making an army out of charcoal people. But what's The Joker doing? He's gettin' 'His Puddin' back. All of the members of Suicide Squad have thing's they'd rather be doing, but The Joker? He just wants His Puddin'. He'll do anything for her.I love this film for the backstory of Harley Quinn and The Joker, it explains a lot about the character. My first introduction to Harley was in the animated Batman from the early 90's. Margot Robie gets it, she's that exact Harley, The strongest points are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith doing a great Deadshot. There are some truly great moments in this, but it takes a while to get to them.People have said that the Extended cut ruins the film. No, Nope. Especially the Harley/Motorcycle scene. I'm not really sure how the Theatrical version goes, I saw the extended version first. As I said, the first time I ever saw the Harley character was in the late 80's/Early 90's Batman cartoons. This character is pretty close to how that Harley was. That early Harley seemed to be a person who when trying to do the right thing, always gets quashed by prejudgments and circumstances and ends up back in Arkham. The relationship with The Joker has morphed into a full on love story, and it works here.Mostly, this film is a about the Harley/Joker (Jared Leto) connection, this Joker has moved away from the comical Cesar Romero version and the typical real-bad-guy as portrayed by Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger, to a more complicated personality: You never know what side of the law he'll assist. Most of his motivation is for Harley, so whatever is good for her, he does. Sometimes that happens to help out the good guys (whoever they are), sometimes not. That's the other issue: This film is all shades of Grey, the worst people are shown to have some measure of compassion, and the alleged 'good people' will break the law to keep secrets.By contrast, the Deadshot story is also a love story, his concern is for his daughter. Which is how government agent 'Amanda Waller' (Viola Davis) manipulates him - And she uses the same tactic on the rest of the Metahumans she's gathered up. But Amanda has bitten off a little too much with her incarceration of 'The Enchantress'/June Moone (Cara Delevingne) who gets away and starts a supernatural ruckus.So Waller sends out the rest of these (alleged) crazies under Colonel Rick Flag (and I am a huge fan of Joel Kinnaman) who is compromised by being in love with The Enchantress' Host June Moone- to hunt *down* The Enchantress. Seems a futile situation. One thing is clear, Waller is worse than the actual crooks in this sortie. Killer Kroc (And I had not recognised Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney- Almost didn't recognize him too), Slipknot, Diablo, and maybe a few others - It gets confusing as the film goes along, with all of these characters. But eventually it falls on 'Task Force X' aka Suicide Squad to take down Enchantress and each member has a role they play in this. Despite the story clutter, it's good to see these crooks all gathered up in one place. Director and Writer David Ayer tries hard to be Zack Snyder, maybe is able to emulate some of the imagery Snyder has created. Look for Clint Eastwood progeny Scott as a nasty Prison guard, and somewhere is voice and character actor Robin Atkin Downes ('Byron' from Babylon 5) as someone named 'Angelo'.The more I watch this, the more I find some great Classic Joker moments. Leto plays this as a cross between the Caesar Romero Joker, the Nicholson Joker, and the Heath Ledger Joker (who I liked the least). I think this Joker is the most like the Joker from the Comics. All I know is that, when Suicide Squad 2 comes out, I'll be in line. and so will a lot of other people.",10,3,6,11 December 2016
Interstellar," Huey, Dewey, and Louey's Rendezvous with A Space Oddysey
","I would not call this film a 'Remake' of '2001: A Space Oddysey' but there are several references to that film in this one. There are Monoliths (TARS, CASE and KIPP), a two-year trip to a Jovian Planet (Saturn in this case), Scientists in Frozen Sleep, a message of sorts, and the film even shows a kind of psychedelic trip through a spacial anomaly, ending in a scene with an old figure in a bed, Ellen Burstyn as 'Old Murphy'.As I read the IMDb Trivia I note that many of the scenes are shot using actual film and practical effects, a true rarity these days. Also that the 'Wormhole' look and feel was created using actual scientific data, rather than something just thought up in a CGI house. The Documentary Style of the Film is precisely the right amount, not too much 'shaky cam' - So it gives the feel of actually being there with the central figures.This film proposes some future calamity (unspecified) that leaves the Earth reverting to an atmosphere that would support ultimately only Anaerobic life forms, aka 'The Blight' which are choking out oxygen using Life Forms. The Midwest 'Dust Bowl' of the early 20th Century is referenced, and this film even uses interviews from a Documentary about it.But this film also proposes a world where the 1960-70's trips to the Moon are considered faked, propaganda to cause the Soviet Union to go Bankrupt. A world where Engineers are no longer useful, only farmers. Such a world makes me shudder. This Earth as shown here, does have Technology, even more advanced technology than we have today, but in a correct move, Nolan suppresses it's appearance and importance, at least while we are 'on Earth' with Coop, Murphy and Tom (older version played by Casey Affleck).A world where Nasa works in secret to perform a thankless, impossible task.This is the first film I have seen with Matthew McConaughey (As 'Cooper') that I really believed his character, one of the last Engineers and former NASA Astronaut who now uses his skill to fix farming machines. His 'Daughter' (Named 'Murphy's Law') is a little doll played by Mackenzie Foy (at 10 years old), Jessica Chastain as a young woman, and the aforementioned great Ellen Burstyn as an old woman. Murphy is a scientist at age 10, she understands the scientific process: Investigate, theorize, prove.But she has a 'Ghost' in her room that is toppling her books, and sending cryptic messages, In Morse Code and even in Binary in the dust left by an Open Window. Clues. Clues which lead Coop to his former Professor, 'Brand' (Michael Caine) and his daughter, also called 'Brand' (Anne Hathaway).I had to laugh at Coop's first meeting with TARS. I can't and won't say anything more.One of the main points of this film is time. Therefore, Hans Zimmer's score is based on 60bpm and variations, depending on how Time is moving on Earth vs for Coop and Brand.One final reference to '2001' is how a member of the expedition goes mad, in '2001' this was an artificial intelligence. Here, it happens to 'the best of us'. And just as Hal 9000 had created falsified Data, that happens in this story as well.The AI's 'TARS, CASE and KIPP' could be a reference to Huey, Dewey and Louey from 'Silent Running', but they are more than just walking, talking Monoliths. They are important characters, they are treated as people, we have to consider them people to believe this. People preprogrammed with the amount of honesty and humor they use.This film as with 'Predestination' explores the cyclic properties of time, we perceive time as ever flowing only forward. But is that the only way time can flow? Where 'Predestination' dealt with the 'Grandfather Paradox', this film deals with Relativity, and Gravity, using Robert A Heinlein's 'Tesseract' theory (From '-And he built a crooked house') to show how the past can be affected by the future. So, both films use elements from The Dean of Science Fiction.There are also things that bring to mind Arthur C Clark's 'Rendezvous with Rama'. It's really about Hope.I doubt if the troll who just handed me a down-vote even read this, or the other two trolls who piped in. I, and several others have been accused of being paid to write a good review, in reality the ones being paid are for the dupe negative reviews. And there are several verbatim dupe reviews in here.",10,2,8,26 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This film is proof
","Whenever multitudes of so-called critics and fans pan a film hard, that's when you go out and see it. The worse the complaints are, the better that film is when you finally go and see it.This movie is equivalent to six Star Wars movies rolled into one.That doesn't make it bad. And people complained about 'the last Jedi', which basically took place on a couple of ships and one gambling planet. So here's this film, and it's pretty much like a wild goose chase across the entire galaxy, and there was a reason why the character of Rey became a scavenger because that's what she is good at- and that is also a big clue to the events of this filmI had heard that this film, while tying a bow on several of the plot lines starting all the way back and episode I, also creates new, unanswered conundrums.Well? So what. Even though the main franchise is finally finished as of this film, that simply means the end of The three principal cast members.Who's left? Lando, Chewie, four droids. And several new characters that we have picked up starting in episode VII.So this film wasn't so much about ending the original story but also beginning a new story.So of course they are going to seed the ending of this story with new conundrums that will have to be answered eventually.There are also other shows in the franchise... Clone Wars, The Mandalorian, and there are probably also some books. So there is some semblance of a Canon for the ark ending here.And when you click through the reviews and comments that are allegedly generated by different individuals, we discover verbatim duplicates of the same bulleted list of complaints, why would one person who lives in England write the same exact review as somebody living in South Africa? That doesn't make sense, unless course neither of those people exist.So we mostly prefer her to make our own judgments. Of course the latest new thing that Trolls do is to assert that we received payment for out positive review. I WISH! That would be nice, but nobody gave me a dime. Think we should flip that question around and ask how many of these identical one star reviews that use the exact same arguments as 1000 others if they were paid to write THOSE reviews? Because generally, when people hate something, they don't jump up and immediately assemble elongated bulleted lists of complaints: they generally don't say anything about it. Unless they had some motivation, to not just post the bulleted list of complaints once, but hundreds of times. But most of the people I know and myself, whenever we don't like something very much we basically walk away from it and never mention it again. So why isn't that happening here?But this is only me, one person. And my experience with this movie completely disagrees with these thousands of one star reviews.Because I loved this, this was the perfect end for the franchise. Not only is it an exciting romp through the galaxy, there are also pauses where we get to say goodbye to our old friends. It is seeded with small mysteries that either get answered or leave us lingering hoping that they will be answered in some future entry for the franchise.Now if I were to say anything negative about this film at all it would be that they changed Chewie's make up. The last time the original actor played the part was in episode VII, and the new person has been doing it for at least two films, possibly three if you count Solo.And Chewie always looked pretty much the same, even with the change in actors, until this movie.So that's my one and only issue. If anybody really wants to know The ending of this film, the answer is always a lie in the very beginning of the film. And that is true with this film as well- upon watching this a second time I noticed several things that were referred to in the first scenes that were basically answered in the final scenes.Every film in this franchise had good and bad things. I don't think people realize exactly how big Star Wars was in 1977? When people go see a film more than once, that is unusual but we had people going back and seeing it 50, 100 times. Myself, I only went twice. And the ratings for this film from 1977 were a lot higher at that time than they actually are right now.Because this film it and all of the films in the franchise and all of the television shows and specials and one shots are all part of a new mythology.Star Wars is a franchise that has to live up to its name, which is basically perpetual conflict on a galactic scale. And how people cope with that how the normal people cope with that the things that they do and when they have had enough they will actually gather together.It's the perfect metaphor for our country during this time there never has been a greater unifying force then having a government that has set rule of law out of the nearest airlock. And that's basically what this film is about, it's about how a few people stand up to oppression, and then more people join them until we eventually have more people then whatever force or army is threatening to blow up our planets.Because that's one of the themes of this franchise, the proliferation of planet-destroying weapons. It is common to Star Wars, and it is common to our world as well.So the question comes down to this: what are we going to do? Are we going to not care and pretend that everything is normal, or are we going to do something about it?",10,9,25,16 March 2020
Pacific Rim," JaegerMeister
","I Love Guillermo Del Toro. the man has a twisted imagination, he makes some very incredibly scary Monsters. From Mimic to Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth, he's been scaring the Bejeezus out of us for over a decade. And we keep coming back for more.He even had a small hand in the creation of Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' - And in a way I am glad that Guillermo did not direct that, as he said that making Pan's Labyrinth almost killed him, I think The Hobbit would have been too much for him.But Pacific Rim was not - And he did it, Del Toro did a GOOD JOB on Pacific Rim.I think what people do not realize is how much of himself Guillermo Del Toro puts into his movies. A Lot of work, and a Lot of Love.So when I first heard of this movie a few years ago, I was not sure I understood what it was to be about - And I was correct, you cannot easily quantify what kind of Movie Pacific Rim is. Is it a Monster Movie? Yes. Is it a movie about Giant Monsters? Yes. Is it like Robot Jox? YES.So what we get is a cross between Robot Jox and Robotech - Men Piloting Huge Mechanical Robots, which are Man's Only Tools to fight an enemy which puts man on the scale of an Insect under these enemies' Boots- Er, Claws, Er, Appendages.And so we get to see the level of destruction from the first frame of this film, and not only the use of Huge Robots, but we are told about 'The Drift' - Two Minds merged together through the Machine, two men working as one, Is this a Love Story? In all ways, this is a Love story between Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) and Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). But it is also a love story between Raleigh and his late brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) - And also between Mako and her Surrogate Father Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And between the Father/Son Team of Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) - And finally even love between the oddest of odd couples ever: Doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and 'Gottleib' (Burn Gorman).Why? Because all of these people have shared 'The Drift' in some form or another.'The Drift' is not only a technical solution which allows two Pilots to Merge into basically a single Brain, Left and Right hemispheres, for Piloting a Jaeger - It's also a Gimmick created by Guillermo Del Toro to help us understand the relationships between these people.And this gimmick works better for that than strictly as a means for two Pilots to drive a Jaeger.Through this Gimmick, we understand Raleigh's loss of Yancy. We understand the antagonism of the two 'Scientists' Gottlieb and Geiszler, antagonism peppered with healthy respect. We understand Pentecost's protectiveness over Mako, as we see through her eyes how she perceived her Savior Pentecost when she sees him for the first time as a little girl holding one red shoe.It is Pentecost's Final Words to Mako which has a bittersweet ring to it: 'You can Always Find me, In the drift'.And when he says this, we KNOW, that he is not going to be dead, that he will always be there in Mako's Mind each time she relives that moment where she sees her Knight in Shining Armor arise from the Cockpit of a Jaeger.It is not just the digital imagery used to portray men fighting huge monsters, Digital Imagery which succeeds rather than fails on all kinds of levels - But it is the Imagery Guillermo has created- This WORLD he created and has given to us, to either live in, and enjoy with him, or to not bother- This fantastic Future Landscape which holds enough Future Shock to kill 1,000 Alvin Toffler's - THIS is what has been given to us with these images- And the way the Digital Images are blended with the practical Film effects, so we do not know where one ends and the other begins.In fact, one documentary I had read from, describes that the Kaijus were designed as if they were to be like the suits worn by Men in old Godzilla Movies- And in fact the way the Kaijus Move are very much like 'Men in Suits' - Only that I have heard Guillermo talking about creating large monsters in other films, particularly in Hellboy - that he animated the 'Sammael' daemons so that the movements were more like Animal Movements- He did MUCH the same here with the Kaiju Movements. But I am glad I bothered to watch this film - It has taken me a whole month to think about how I would write this review. It is because of the deep Humanity which this story shows us, love and respect, that I choose to respect it's director for.Because on top of all of these deep Human and Spiritual aspects of this story, Guillermo has given us a nonstop event filled with action, and when the Pilots get into their Jaegers, we get into the cockpit alongside them. And when Raleigh falls into the Rift with the carcass of the first Category-Five Kaiju, we fall down that rabbit hole with them, and when we see the Leader of the Invading Aliens, and the FEAR in his three or four Eyes, we can REALLY see that fear, and this makes that moment much more satisfying for us as viewers and participators in the story.Guillermo Del Toro is much different than other directors of today. Even here we can see his earlier efforts as influences - And one thing I know that Guillermo always carries around is his Notebook.Thank you Guillermo, and I'm still waiting for Hellboy Three!",10,2,3,31 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Send In the Clones, There ought to be clones
","And the De-Boned Hams. I'll just have to re-create it what I said before about this horrid moovie.I seem to be having difficulty in posting a review of THIS ONE FILM. All of my other very few negative reviews always got posted practically immediately. I don't see what I'm saying that could possibly be any worse than any other bad review of this film that I've seen on this site, so I'm EXPECTING this to go through. Not to mention I've ripped some other movies similar belly buttons and they got posted within half a day. So I'm directing this to whoever is deleting my reviews: if this fails to get posted, it must mean that Lucasfilm has some heavy duty influence over people speaking the truth over their films. This 2nd of the 'First Trilogy' which is actually the 2nd trilogy, or my uncle's sister's mom's cousin's prom dress on a pig, tried to mirror 'The Empire Strikes Back' And it FAILS on so many levels that I cannot count them. It's - Eh, Galactic in its failure.Let's look at it like this: This is about Anakin and Princess 'Amygdalin', right? Well - In Epidose I, Anakin was a whiny, bratty little punk (I think his very forgettable name was Jake Lloyd). He was more interested in 'Fast Cars' than Chicks. Princess, er, I mean QUEEN Armadillo (The Usually good actress Natalie Portman who was miscast and misdirected in these films), was a beautiful young woman (Disguised as a Scullery Maid) about 25 years old it looked.So - Just from the aspect of what we had seen before in Ep I the two were not even attracted to each other, she not to him and he certainly not to her! So - It's 15? Years later and Anakin (Now the 'grown' up and in this film, spiritless actor Hayden Christiensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) Suddenly 'run into her' - In the entire galaxy, they just happen to run in to each other. And some lame assassin hired by D'Jango Rhine-Fett (Jango Fett played by Australian? Actor Temuera Morrison) (Eh? Why didn't he do it himself?) fails to kill her, so they set these 18 year old, raging hormones, KID to Protect her.This is just the Beginning of the confusion, the plot holes, and the unnecessary CGI and Characters.Well, of COURSE he may be interested in her now, but I guarantee ya he wasn't thinking about it until he sees her. Lucas makes us try to suspend belief - and Fails. But that is the whole premise isn't it... They never show, Anakin as snotty 6 year old Kid, Pining away for Queen Armitage, did they? So we're s'posed to believe in this ‚Äì RUSHED romance, to say the least? Anakin says something to the effect that he had been thinking of her the whole time, for 15 or 16 years. The end of Epi- dose I never reflects this and the beginning of Epi-dose II certainly does not. Nothing in either of the movies shows that the two have any attraction for each other. Even in the original Star Wars, there was an immediate spark between Hans Solo and Princess Liea, in episodes I and II there is NOTHING. Just Sudden Teenage Hormones.That takes care of this, the 'main plot' - But Lucasses 'Multiplication Effect' is in full 'force' here. He's already WRECKED our previous concepts of The Force by lamely trying to Explain it in Epi-dose I. The Mitochondria, or whatever they were called, MitoClorians? Are lil microscopic sleeping tablets that Lucas put into the Plot, to make us sleep for 2 hours or so? Some things work better as a Mystery, explaining them away takes away their importance AND our interest in them.Obi-Wan needed to find a missing planet, so he meets up with some guy that looks like an Alien version of Norm from Cheers. Or, Morn from Deep Space 9, which was better in all ways than this tripe. He finds the planet of Big-Birds, and they have been making CLONES for some dead Jedi. Dracula (Christopher Lee) chops off Anakin's arm and runs off with the Death Star Plans. There are simply TOO MANY light sabers being wielded - in the original trilogy, their use was sparse, which made them Unique. There is NOTHING Unique about 50 Jedi dashing around with Light Sabers. Again - Lucas RUINS something cool he created in Star Wars.Sorry Lucas I to like it, but ya can't like Poo, even if it is served up on a silver platter with all the CGI in the universe! There is no style, no substance, NO FLAVOUR - nothing to get excited about.This film CERTAINLY does not mirror The Empire Strikes Back - Which was written by a HUGO-AWARD Winning Science Fiction Writer Leigh Brackett, and Directed by a professional Director.Lucas is not cut out for directing. He had some good ideas that in COLLABORATIVE Effort became GOOD moovies - Willow - Raiders of the Lost Ark. Collaborations. I want to end this by saying, I love moovies, for any Film Maker they get an easy '10' out of me: check my reviews, see for yourself. I am VERY forgiving and sometimes I'll go completely Against the grain to rate something high that was a dismal Box Office or Critical failure. If I enjoyed myself watching it, it's a 10. Avatar? 10, even though I thought Cameron stole the plot from a Hugo Award Winning Sci Fi story. Star Trek: Nemesis? '10' despite the old tired TNG crew. X-Men? 10. Star Wars- Episode IV? TEN. The Empire Strikes Back? Ten! Return of the Jedi? 10!This trilogy? Z E R O.I DID NOT enjoy one minute of this entire 2 and a half hour waste of my time.",1,2,6,28 February 2012
Ant-Man," 'It's Not a Keychain!'
","'Ant Man' has been one of my favorite Avengers, even in his other personae 'Giant Man', 'Wasp' and 'YellowJacket'. But this version of 'Ant-Man' is not the same Ant-Man from the comics I read. That version was Dr. Henry Pym, who with his wife Janet van Dyne aka 'Wasp' (Another version of Wasp), were part of the Avengers, maybe sometimes part of The Defenders, a short lived comic series that included members of The Avengers as well as Dr Strange. What is not told in any of The Avengers movies or even this movie, is that Hank Pym was the scientist who created Ultron- The films have Tony Stark doing it.This film is based on one of the side stories, where a burglar named Scott Lang steals Ant-Man's suit, but ends up using it to defeat a crook named Darren Cross. That's mainly the story told here. But Hank Pym is a large part of it, in this rendition his daughter 'Hope' (Evangeline Lilly) partially taking the place of the character of Janet van Dyne.This film focuses more on the Scott Lang story, an ex crook who works with a couple of burglars and a computer hacker. He can't even keep a job at Baskin-Robbins, because 'Baskin-Robbin's always finds out'.So he is forced to take a job with his burglar roommates. But it turns out to be a set-up, set up by Dr Pym himself. So, all Lang finds is a cool looking Motorcycle Riding outfit. Fun things happen when he puts it on.Meanwhile, Darren Cross, Dr Pym's ex-prot√©g√©, responsible for Pym's loss of his company, has been trying to figure out the 'Pym Particle' which is the basis of Ant-man's suit... Because he wants to sell it to some creepy looking guy. Pym knows that would be bad, so he wants to Sabotage that sale. But can he talk Lang into helping him, and will he be able to do it?One of the things from the comics that translated into the movie was Pym's Helmet, which he uses to talk to Ants and Bugs.Overall, I was pretty pleased with how this film came out- A lot of the things in it came straight from the comics, including the concept of what would happen if the suit-wearer went 'Subatomic'. But I mainly liked how this story takes the original Ant-Man and hands it off to the 'new guy' (And his Daughter, but that's for a sequel). And once again, an i-Phone is used in a major gag - Watch for it.",10,6,14,13 November 2015
Oblivion," There is More than One of Everything
","Tom Cruise just seems to be getting younger, as long as he does not grow a beard. Whether he is Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible or here as Tech Jack Harper, he never seems to age, and his energy is great. I don't care if he's tapping the energy of some Mothership, he's still OK by me.Speaking of Mothership, there is one in this film that is a real Mother, if we remove the word 'Ship' from the end and add in something more derogatory.As we get into this film, Jack recites a 'Revisionist Future History' of sorts. There had been an invasion. The moon has been blown to bits, and all the 'hoomans' moved away after the 'war' and are living on Saturn's moon Titan. There are huge water Sucking machines gobbling up all the earths oceans drop by precious drop, supposedly to send it all to Titan. And it's Jack's job as 'Tech' to keep these things running, along with a bunch of Robotic Drones that kill off apparent left-over 'invaders' that are still hanging around Earth for some unknowable reason.Jack's assigned wife is 'Victoria' (Andrea Riseborough) and she's his Comm officer. They report to 'Sally' (Melissa Leo) who is allegedly on Titan supervising them. It's a 'Mop Up Operation' as Jack puts it, they have two weeks to go, then they can all go home to 'Titan' and live happily ever after.But Jack keeps seeing the image of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and it bothers him. He doesn't even know who she is. But lately Jack has been picking up Books and other pieces of remaining culture and he hides them away at some house by a lake, which appears to be an oasis in a land basically barren. It's off the Grid, so Victoria has never seen it - Victoria stays high up in some Sky Nest monitoring the Comms while Jack roams the earth fixing broken Drones. He keeps asking Victoria if she won't go down to the surface with him, but she always refuses.The Robotic Drones are there to kill off the 'Invaders', Jack can't comprehend why they are still there and why they are so tenacious. There is nothing left, isn't there? We get flashes of their POV now and then along with images of what look like Scurrying Animals. When Jack falls into a pit which is the Public Library in NY City, they don't shoot him. Why?In fact there are two histories running at once, the revisionist history which we are led to believe, and what really happened, which comes to Jack in dreams and visions. Which one is real? And who is this Woman?But all things start getting answered, when an Orbiting Spaceship falls to the earth after 60 years, and who is in it but the Woman which Jack dreams about. As a matter of fact, Jack's world is twisted totally out of proportion from this moment on.What I love about this film is the imagery, it's a totally believable surrealistic landscape of a world devastated. Combinations of CGI and Practical Filming leave no indications where one ends and the other begins. What we have here is an antiseptic High-Tech World above the sky and the remnants of the devastation below. Of particular visual interest is an image of the very top of the Empire State Building sticking out of a sea of sand, for some reason, a signal is sent from this ruin to some place in the sky.But 'Nothing is as it Seems' and 'There Is More than One of Everything'. These two Axioms form the basis of what is a wholly unpredictable and enjoyable movie. Keep your eyes peeled for Morgan Freeman and the Stuntwoman-Goddess Zoe Bell, because 'Humans show up when they are least expected'.Directed by Newcomer Joseph Kosinski who wrote the original Graphic Novel this was based on, we can be safely assured there are no 'Temporal Causality Loops' or other gimmicks used by filmmakers. This is wholly original ground, even though it is basically Tom Cruise running around with a Gun- but I have always enjoyed Tom Cruise running around with a gun.The Film's Score co-written by Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese (The Bourne Legacy) is Bookended with a wonderful song performed by M. 8. 3. - So it's new faces all around.",10,5,9,4 August 2013
Watchmen," An Amazing Experience
","Normally I go to a film expecting to find good things in it- The last film I went to the Theatre to see, last year's remake of 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' - was a disappointment: But my disappointment in that film was mired in my love for Robert Wise' original film from the 50s.This film had no such barriers for me, it was a fresh story, a new look, and quite a different experience than what I was expecting, compared to the last 9 years of Superhero moovies: X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Iron Man, Punisher, Spawn, Daredevil, now I love these stories, but you can take all of those I mentioned (And more) and put them to one side, and WATCHMEN stands alone in stark reality, on the other side far removed from those basic superhero stories.I have copies of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and 300 and as I enjoyed those films, these are not great films: but WATCHMEN is great like Lord of The Rings is great: Great in Scope, Great in Effort of film-making and storytelling, and Great in Cinematography.And Great in Story: We are told this story through the eyes of Rorschact: We are given a romp through alternate history and we get to see The Kennedy Assassination footage revisualised, the Kent State Massacre atrocity, and the history of the 'Minutemen' super hero group and the murders of former members- And how fits with what we remember of our own sad history of the last 100 years: WWII, The Cold War, The Vietnam War: The 40's - The 50's - The 60's 70's and this story is told up to 1985 and as a historical representation, this story is accurately told in Music and Images.And so this is the result of The WATCHMEN Graphic Novel as told by Alan Moore, creator of Marvel's 'Xcalibur' and 'Captain Britain' and the author of the 'Inferno' crossover storyline from Marvel Comics back in the late 80's - Early 90s. Moore despises film versions of his work and his aversion to this almost caused this film to not be made. I've seen other films based on his work: Constantine, V for Vendetta, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This was the best use of his work but of course he sued to try to stop it being made: This makes my respect level of him go to zero. But that does not stop a well told story from being well told, even if told by a guy acting like a jackass instead of working with the creative teams of these films: League could have been Extraordinarily better if he had been involved, V for Vendetta was fantastic, but he sued to have his name taken off the credits.This is not a story for comic books to be sold to kids at the newsstand, this is an adult story like Marvels 'Marvels' and DC's 'Kingdom Come' both painted by Alex Ross - As a matter of fact, and at this time I do not know who painted the WATCHMEN Graphic Novel, but this film looks like an Alex Ross painted graphic novel so I would not be surprised to find if Ross did the art.The choice of actors to play Watchmen and also represent figures from our history was well done, Frank Novak makes us believe he is Henry Kissinger and Robert Wisden makes a Nixon rivaling Frost/Nixon's Frank Lanegella.But the centerpiece is Jack Earle Haley (Sugarboy from 'All the Kings Men') - As he narrates this story and compared to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine - I hate to admit that Haley's Rorschact is a better Wolverine than Jackman! (He is even short, compared to Jackman's immense height).There are a few that stand out, a breakaway performance by Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II - And I was in the theatre for the few scenes with Appollonia Vanova as Silhouette: And her appearance caused quite a few wolf-whistles and guffaws, even as a lesbian super heroine.The use of Non-Familiars as the principles... The murky graphic-novel colouring of the film using dark pastels... Made this film visually the best film I have absolutely ever seen.This film is a Film Noire Mystery at it's heart... A Whodunit, with the most complex and convoluted plot I have ever had the pleasure of trying to figure out - There is a lot of misdirection here, and I was surprised to be surprised.I have not enjoyed a film as much since I saw The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy- This story if complete, I hope they do no sequels, I just do not know what direction they could take, Alan Moore outdid himself with this, and I hope he appreciates his own work.San Diego 3/17/2009Addendum 4/3/2009After reading the Watchmen graphic novel and the warner brothers 'motion comic' - I can say that Zak Snyder paid meticulous attention to detail and every panel from the comic is represented.I now see what was changed, and in the long run, the story survives, and is basically the same story. The part that is missing is the part related to the mini-comic 'Tales of the Black Frieghter' which ties in to the part that was changed.I stand by my review... And after reading the comic, it was like revisiting the film, every shot is from the book, every look, every costume, every vomit-strewn alley is perfected in this Vision.Much Kudos to Zak Snyder for this immense effort.",10,10,19,17 March 2009
Justice League," Giving 10/10 for the 'Ultimate Cut' Fanedit
","I would give the theatrical more like 8/10, maybe even 7/10, because I did like some of the things in it.Whedon tries to turn this into a MCU film, which he is good at. But the story that Snyder developed was something a lot different than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Death of Superman is the quintessential DC Storyline. It's the darkest thing they've ever done. Whedon tries to lighten it up too much, but the scenes which Snyder had shot conflict with that. There certainly is a big difference between Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. This was a story that deserved to be told by the original director, just for continuity's sake. But the theatrical version fails to tell the continuation of the same story from BvS. The Ultimate Cut Fanedit, however, does.The only issue with the Fanedit is of course, the fact that it's a fanedit, and you have to go out and look for it, it's not hard to find, but it is difficult to get. And the guy who edited it, messed up the continuity in a few spots. But it does give us a good idea of what would have happened had Snyder been able to finish the work he had started 7 years earlier. It would have finished his Man of Steel trilogy. I'm hoping at some point, Snyder will be able to make his cut of this film, we had to wait almost 25 years for Richard Donner to do his original vision for Superman II. And that was worth it. On that day when Zack Snyder is able to make his version of this, that will also be a great day. I hold out a great hope for this.An official Snyder Ultimate cut would explain why dreams are not really dreams and why The Flash has to say 'Is it too soon?'. Is The Flash mucking with Time in BvS? I did not really like Batman v Superman, until I saw the Ultimate Cut. I did not really like Justice League, until I saw all of the missing scenes that explain what's happening. Snyder's concept for Steppenwolf, shown in the BvS ultimate cut, is a lot more menacing. I've seen some Snyder previz footage that has a very frightening image of Steppenwolf. But the Steppenwolf in the film, I don't know who is responsible for it, some have told me this was Snyder's imagery. But it does not fit, so I have always thought it was Whedon's work. The 'Ultimate Cut' has a continuation of this 'Dream', but as if from Cyborg's POV. Something even worse, somebody even worse than Steppenwolf is coming. I hope that when that story is told, it is told as well as Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.I understand the immense disappointment with this film, it mirrors my sadness that the Filmmaker who created this vision was not able to complete it.I encourage anyone who wants to see how this film could have gone to search out the Fanedit. It's worth it.It occurs to me, if Whedon had treated this film more like his 'Serenity', it might have worked better.",10,1,5,5 May 2018
Man of Steel," Superman is no longer a Comic Book Character.
","Not after being Treated by Zack Snyder. So where Watchmen gave us a fairly true frame by frame representation of that graphic novel, this film takes 'Superman' Canon and gives it some nice new flesh- In more ways than one.Russell Crowe's 'Jor-El' was basically the same man we met in the Comic Books from the 60's, and his agenda is much the same as that Jor-El: He knew Krypton was going to be blown into chunks and he wanted to save something of his culture. Basically, in the 60's this culture was in the form of his son, 'Kal-El' aka 'Clark Kent' aka 'Superman'.But over the years in the comics and other movies, the idea that Jor-El may have put some kind of documentation about the planet Krypton in Kal's spacecraft has crept up into the Canon. In the original 1979 film and the later 'Superman Returns' sequel, this was in the form of a crystal memory. In this film, it takes yet another form.What we have in this film is not a chronological re-telling of the Superman Origin story- What we get instead is a representation of who Kal-El really is, and how he got that way. Not merely his Super-Powers, but his reasons for using or not using them.So we don't see any of the iconic imagery of Clark Kent using a Phone Booth to change into his Blue Suit. Instead we delve into the real character of Superman and what makes him different from this General Zod guy.We've seen Superman treated as the comic book character he is through the old Serials and the George Reeves TV show, and in 1979 we believed he could fly due to Christopher Reeve's portrayal, but in those days Lex Luthor was a cardboard cutout of a crook and thorn in Supie's side. So over the years we have seen the maturation of the franchise. There are also decades of story that have elapsed since the original comics came out. So, how are we going to handle it this time? By making the characters much more believably human. Even in 'Superman Returns' there was a trickle of more mature story mixed in with the basic Lex Luther comedy, but here the old Comic Book aspects have been spirited away. Does this mean that there is a darker story happening? Maybe. But if there is a more realistic story happening on a human level, that is what sets this film aside as a different approach.And this is seen in the short vignettes between Jonathan Kent and Clark, in the short pontifications of Jonathan (Played by Kevin Costner). Diane Lane becomes Martha Kent and is also part of Clark's conscience and consciousness. And where Lois Lane was simply a female in years past, she is now a trusted confidant played by Amy Adams, willing to keep Clark's secret.Other regular 'Superman 'Verse' characters are shown, Pete Ross and Perry White and others, and their spirit if not their original appearances have been kept.It's just the idea of seeing 'Clark' backing down from an aggressor who he could knock over with his Pinky - In other films, they actually had Superman beating up bullies. But here, the concept of the real damage that could be wreaked by a blow from Kal-El's fist is respected, and his Restraint becomes more pronounced.This film is almost wrecked by the resurrection of the 'Zod' character who first appeared in the 80's Superman movies, but they gave him more dimensions and that made it less of the Monologuing bad guy and more of a nemesis, and the threat to the planet was just a wee bit more sinister than 'Superman II' where these cronies simply wanted to take over the planet. Oh, they still want to take over the planet, but it's not the same thing as was proposed in 'Superman II.'It's not that I didn't love the Superman TV show when I was a kid, or the cartoons, or hundreds and hundreds of comic books, and the several movies of the 80's plus the 'Donner Cut' of Superman II, which was partially used in Superman Returns, and I like this one as well...But NOBODY has ever made a Superman Movie where they showed Jor-el, Lara, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Lois Lane and Lana Lang. Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, The Bottle City of Kandor, The Fortress of Solitude with the huge golden key Supie would heft to open it, Bizarro World, Professor Potter, or even my favorite Supie Crooks The Parasite and The Composite Superman - Nobody has ever made a movie showing these people and things exactly how they looked in the comics, they always seem to re- image it all, which is sad, because in all four Spider-Man Moovies, they have kept the strict imagery of the Comics. And that has been the Only Franchise which kept to the original designs. Why can't they do it with Superman?Of course, Zod becomes something more in the 2nd entry into this universe, 'Batman v Superman'- but Superman's Doomsday was the result of clever manipulation of several arcs from the 90s-2000's comics. However, they kept the continuity from this film.Unfortunately, Zack Snyder was prevented from finishing this trilogy, and it was wrecked by Joss Whedon, who rediculous-ized the darker aspects of Zacks story.",10,2,6,4 August 2013
The Village," Lots of great things here
","This is not just some film about some kind of Amish colony, or any group of religious society shut-outs. If there is any religion proffered by this 'Village', it is not mentioned. It is not important.It's also not any kind of 'Horror' film, which is what it was promoted as. Although it has it's suspenseful moments. These people are basically normal, except for a few things: They will not ever return to 'The Towns' which is what they call the outside world, and they won't wear Red, or go into 'The Woods'.Or else, 'Those we must not speak of' will come. Whoever or whatever they are, becomes something we in fact focus on, but in true M Night fashion, this is not what the film is about.What we have is a basically idyllic home for a group of people. The Elders have their secrets, and the young people are being given a set of 'Traditions'. But one kid, Noah (Adrien Brody) is a little different. He is referred to as 'An Innocent' but it is clear even before we start seeing what is happening, he is not an innocent. He rocks back and forth in his chair as if Autistic, but he has speech. So, this character may have his own world in his mind which he lives in. We don't know much about that at first, but it is clear that Noah is a more complex individual than he lets on, and he is more intelligent than he is given credit for.The bright light in this film is mainly Bryce Dallas Howard, this was the first time I saw her in a film. She pulls off the Blind girl fairly believably, except her eye movement don't track a blind person's. A Blind person would not focus on anything- But that is a hard thing to duplicate if in fact you can see. Actually, Lili Taylor does a believable Blind girl in the 5th Season X-Files episode 'Minds Eye', the closest portrayal I have ever seen - Her eyes wander off camera, never looking directly at who she is speaking to.The elder characters talk about people in their lives who had suffered violence, people who had been killed in various violent ways. There is more to this talk than just remembrance, it is an important point.In their artificial idyllic village, these people live as if in the 1800s, sans any modern medical technology. This is a point brought up a couple of times, by the character played by Joaquin Phoenix 'Lucius' (Which may or may not be a reference to the film Gladiator where he had a nephew by that name) - He wants to go to 'The Towns' to get Medicines. But the Elders give him all kinds of reasons why he can't do it.So we think this film is about these kids being raised to not depend on modern gadgetry and to avoid offending those that can't be spoken of, who live in the woods, so that is another taboo place. The entire younger generation of the village has been raised to believe in a set of Absolutes, you can't wear Red, you can't speak of the things that will come, and you can't go into the Woods. And, things happen that appear to validate these restrictions. So this false facade is upheld by a thin veneer of what Elder Walker (William Hurt) calls 'A farce'.A farce that if the kids knew about, it would destroy whatever sociological experiment is being conducted in The Village.And we think this film is about Lucius, who wants to marry Howard's character 'Ivy'- Until M Night's famous 'Reversal' happens.It's at that point, Night slides in the reasons why the village exists, who the elders really are, and who the unspeakable creatures really are. But mainly, it's how a young blind girl can save the life of the one she loves, without the elders breaking any previous oaths they had taken. It's 'Yellow Riding Hood vs the Big Bad Wolf' all over again, and 'Nothing is as it Seems' as usual in Night's films.There are things Night likes to do as a Director, characters being shown in reflections in an object, which he does at the beginning of 'Unbreakable', many other little trademarks, they are all here. Mainly there is wonderful imagery and rich character development, but the Village itself and the lifestyle of the people therein is the focal point of the film, it paid off that the whole cast was actually trained how to live in such an environment. You believe that they made all of their own clothes, they husband their own animals, they grew all of their vegetables, they made their own homes. If you can believe that, then the rest of the film falls into place.",10,1,2,13 April 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Most Mature of the Harry Potter films
","Harry Potter has Grown up. Along with Hermione Granger and and Ronald Weasly, the three friends began this adventure at Hogwarts, and what started out as a silly romp through magical inanity has turned in to something very dark. Although Hogwarts is not where this story takes place, it is still part of the ongoing story. As with Lord of the Rings, the story has taken on proportions that Author J.K. Rowling probably had no control over - This story is telling itself and under the superb direction of David Yates, who has been at the helm for the last few Potter films, has been brought to vivid life. Magic and Technology clash in the middle of London in the sight of all of the unsuspecting Muggles.Each Potter film has been subsequently better then the previous films, and this film hits the peak... all stops are pulled out, nothing is held back... And so this part of the story which began with Goblet of Fire and the reawakening of 'You-Know-Who' is a lot like the final parts of Lord of the Rings. Catastrophe has been reached, we await the EuCatastrophe.We know that Potter has been accumulating useful magical objects during his education at Hogwarts, and in this film he uses most of them. Also, look for the very first Magic-Gadget used by Dumbledore in the first Potter movie. Now we are in a race to find the objects that make up the Deathly Hallows - We know who has one of these objects, it has been used in previous Potter films. It is not used in this one. And now we know 'You-Know-Who' is searching for these same objects. Who will get them first? Many questions which have been unanswered through the entire series are now being revealed, some questions we did not know were being asked. The doorway that Serious Black fell through as he died, what was that, where does it lead? These loose ends are just beginning to be tied up and I look very forward to the final installment of the Potter series - Will these things be explained, or will Harry have to explore more and more nightmarish scenarios? Although Deathly Hallows is part 1 of a two part story, this film stands by itself and some of the questions are already being answered.",10,1,4,14 April 2011
Knowing," Randomness vs Determinism
","This my favourite film of 2009 (Along with Watchmen), Alex Proyas has us chasing a huge Maguffin- one that Hitchcock would have been pleased with. By the time we are committed to Nic Cage's wild goose chase, a whole new scenario presents itself. Great writing, great directing, and Proyas uses the Digital Medium to full advantage.Music by Marco Beltrami, who is the new Ennio Morricone, which has strands reminiscent of I, Robot, not just of I, Robot but that 'This is a Proyas film with Music by Beltrami'The basis of this film is the aged argument of Randomness vs Determinism, and Nic Cage's character gives us the best definition of Determinism that I've ever heard, one that agrees with my belief system. Actually, it is not 'Randomness versus Determinism' - It is more like, Randomness AND Determinism, because the story here melds the two together. Things have to be Random, but the collection of random events builds a Determined Universe.A very spiritual film, and also references the current events of this year, which must have been difficult as the film was made last year, before most of the issues we got facing us this summer had materialised, so it is a good piece of speculative fiction as well as the interesting story it tells.10 out of 10 as far as I am concerned, worth watching twice in a row, and I'm going on a 3rd viewing now.",10,2,7,6 August 2009
"I, Robot"," True to Asimov's Vision
","I have to re-create this review because some brown-nose ran to daddy about one of my other reviews, and this one disappeared in the debacle.I have been reading Science Fiction and Asimov in particular since the 60's - And so I was excited that they were finally making Asimov's anthology 'I, Robot' into film.But when I saw the first previews I thought they were just Hollywood-ising the book. I was against the idea of this Movie when I saw those reviews. I did not want to see it, because I thought, they were 'ruining the story.' But when it comes down to it, the stories in book form of 'I, Robot' are simply not the best Robot stories Asimov wrote. Before he passed away, he introduced the idea of the Robot 'Sonny' in one of his last Susan Calvin stories. The Robot was not named 'Sonny' but it had Aspects that Sonny will show in this film.But most of the other aspects of this film, are in other Robot stories and books. There is a vast underground menagerie, which is shown in a small part in the film ‚Äî not in detail. This film references 'The Caves of Steel' - The vast underground Robot factory (Although, I think the Caves of Steel may have been on Venus, I'll have to re-read that book).Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a cop, who is as biased against Robots as an Archie-Bunker type may have been biased against colour in the 50's and 60's. But Robots are safe, aren't they? At least U.S. Robotics says so, with Asimov's 'Three Laws of Robotics':1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.But Spooner just does not trust Robots. Does not 'Like their Kind.' But he has a secret, he does not like talking about: Why does Spooner never use is left arm? There is a reason for this, which is revealed in the story. Actually as the film progresses, we see him starting to use it, until we see what is actually going on.Susan Calvin is a 'Robot Psychologist' - Or is she the Dumbest 'Smart Person' Spooner has ever met? In this film she is depicted by Bridget Moynahan, at first as a professional 'iceberg' - Or, as a 'Human Robot' - She has very robotic qualities. Calvin works with Robots, Likes them, was raised by a Robot 'Lenny' (LNE) in the book-So for her, they are safe.But one of the creators of U.S. Robotics, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who knew Spooner, apparently kills himself by jumping from a high room in the U.S. Robotics building - Or Did he? We can't dismiss The Robot, 'Sonny'-being in the room at the time. Why does this Robot read 'Hansel and Gretel?'In a scene taken from an Illustration straight from Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, we see Sonny jump from the same window Lanning 'fell' from - The imagery is exactly like a panel drawing from a story in that magazine.There are curt nods like this, to all of Asimov's Robot works all through this film.And so at first I was not pleased that this film did not exactly follow the stories in the Anthology 'I, Robot' - But as I kept watching it, I started realsing, whoever wrote this screenplay filled it with little things from the line of Robot novels and stories-The 'Robot Riots' ‚Äî those are there, in the film but not the same way as the book.I highly praise Alex Proyas for giving us this peek into the whole Mind of Asimov - And a true fan of his works will see the things I see. I am as purist as the next guy, but I have read harlan Ellison's 1990's screenplay for his vision of 'I, Robot' - And he attempted to bridge all of the stories in the book with a framing story that tried to connect them all - It did not work very well, as much as I like the attempt.And at the end of Asimov's career as a writer, he was introducing ideas, like 'Do Robots Dream' - There is a section of the movie where they have Lanning's voice from a recorded lecture, talking about things Robots will do, that defy any explanation other than that they are a new form of life. And also the idea that a the Robot Brain of Chicago - 'V.I.K.I' - Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence' ‚Äî may pervert the Three Laws, making it necessary to create the 4th, or Zeroth Law of Robotics:0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.This is all in the film if you look. And most important, the Robot 'Sonny' played well by Alan Tudyk of Firefly and Dollhouse, the robot who was made for a special purpose by Lanning himself - It never occurred to me that this could be the origins of 'R. Daneel Olivaw' which is the Robot Detective in 'The Naked Sun' and 'The Caves of Steel.'And so I have tried to talk about this film without giving away the whole story - If I have inadvertently done this, I will gladly mark 'Spoilers'-The only spoiler I can really add, is that at the end of the film where Sonny is standing above the rest of the gathered Robots on the remains of Lake Michigan - This is another image straight from the annals of Asimov's writings. And as such, very powerful.",10,2,5,25 April 2012
Van Helsing," Deserves better than it got! Great, Funny Sommer's Universal Monster Moovie!
","I loathed and despised this film when it came out, but I still bought a copy of the DVD. Before I sold over a hundred DVDs to a pawn shop, I copied this one, cos I wanted to watch it one more time.And now I am sorry I sold my copy! This is no serious horror movie... This is pure FUN! Universal must have decided to give Sommers the green light to handle ALL of the Universal monsters, and rather than doing it in several films, he wraps them all up in one great, complete package.Sure these Universal stories could have been made each into singular films of their own, but only Sommers could have brought Van Helsing face to face with The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, and even Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde.People expecting something else, totally forgot who directed this piece: Stephen Sommers, whose earlier treatment of The Mummy blew our minds- WHAT did they expect? Of course Sommers had to reach for the sky. It is not this film that was done badly, it was the public reaction to it, and if you reach back, Bush had just won a second term, so the public was in no good mood- Whereas the first Mummy was released during the height of an economy boom, and the second, just before housing balloon popped, in 2004, it was simply not the right time to release a film as light as this.This film is not just over the top, it is WAY over the top... And because of that it is rather funny, perhaps there was too much humour in the film, The Mummies had several serious moments, this had few. I believe that because this film was dine as a period piece, people expected Sommers to stay within the realm of the technologies we knew existed in those times... But Sommers instead, transposed several modern ideas into the story, and uses them... Maybe people thought this was too unbelievable... But I think Sommer's idea was, since this was a secret society of evil vanquishers sponsored by the highly secretive Vatican, Van Helsing had access to things like Rapid Fire Arrows and the little 'Volcano in a Bottle' gag. Since the Vatican are huge secret-hoarders, it is not too much of a limb to make yourself believe that Van Jackman had access to these things.Jackman is what makes the film so enjoyable, Between Jackman and David Wenham, they had me in stitches for most of the film. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely beautiful, I have not seen her in any films for some time, but she is absolutely fabulous in this. And of course we have 'Benny' from The Mummy, Kevin O'Conner, as Igor, and a great face, Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster.The first time I saw this was mid 2005, now six years later, I can laugh at it, and enjoy it like Sommers wanted us all to do in the first place. Since this film, Sommers has produced a 3rd Mummy film, directed by Rob Cohen, but even with a different director, that film is flush with Sommer style gags.If anything, this film was too ambitious, but even so, I hated it, but now I like it a lot.",10,2,5,25 April 2011
Ender's Game," Formics have No Mouths but still must Scream
","Basically, you can't make some of these books into Movies. Lord of the Rings? At roughly 12 and a half hours running time for all three extended versions, there is STILL so much left out. And so much changed, but despite that so much of it is exactly as I imagined it when I first read it. Lord of the Rings, that is, I have never read 'Ender's Game' and I'm glad I never have.The same goes for Ender's Game. We know we are getting a simplified story, so I choose just to accept it as it is. Even Orson Scott Card says they stuck to the basic book - So if the Author thinks that, then I can deal with it as well.So - Asa Butterfield, aka 'Hugo' is in another film with his Hugo Co- Star Gandhi, aka Ben Kingsley. And Harry Ford is looking OK just shy of what, 70? And ready for another Star Wars adventure, I think.What I liked about this film was the mixing of Child Actors and the older actors, who we've seen over and over, so there is a lot to anchor on here- We see these kids, in 'Battle School' and we see their Teacher Colonel Graff, so I can handle the Unknown Kids factor much better.Most astonishing is the appearance of Abigail Breslin as 'Valentine' being the exact same little girl she was in 'Signs' - She becomes the way the 'Buggers'/'Formics' can get into Ender's Mind.The other total standout here is Hailee Steinfeld, who I thought was a better Mattie Ross for True Grit than the original actress in the John Wayne version. Her Petra is perfect for this film, I don't think anyone else could have done it as well.And this is the big MacGuffin of the film and of the book - Ender thinks he has stumbled into a Game loaded into his school 'iPad' - But his 'Game' is more related to what is really happening in his universe than what Graff and later 'Mazer Rackham' (Kingsley) are telling him.And he has to figure this out, but he is being tricked, as we are being tricked by the clever underlying story of the book.In fact, during the first battle with the Formics, Mazer had learned something important, something which Ender is learning through his Game. In fact, Mazer is tricking Ender into playing His game, while Ender is being shown the Real Game in his device.When it comes down to it, we can either blow up our enemies into molecule sized chunks and obliterate them forever, or we can find a way to talk to them, even if they do not have Mouths and cannot Scream.",10,1,2,11 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Disavowed
","What surprises me is that every couple of years a new MI comes out, and the well-weathered Tom Cruise never seems to change. But here he is again, and doing his own stunts it would seem.The Odor of the IMF was not quite pleasant even after Ghost Protocol. We mainly have the same team from that film with a few slight changes. That is, if the IMF will even exist at the end of this tale. It seems that Hunt's team pulls off their latest mission by luck alone. And then Hunt is tricked and trapped by a weak-chinned terrorist (Sean Harris as 'Solomon Lane') and tortured and then helped by a shadowy woman ('Ilsa Faust' Rebecca Fergusen).Meanwhile, the IMF has been disbanded while Brant (Jeremy Renner) and Dunn (Simon Pegg) have been swallowed by the CIA, who are interested in Hunt's movements for the last 6 months. Because dozens of Agents from 'friendly' agencies around the world are turning up dead or vanished. We don't really know if Brandt and Dunn are covering for Hunt - Until Dunn appears to have won Opera Tickets for a Viennese Opera.That's how this all starts, in the Opera House. Hunt is there looking for Mr. Weak Chin, but the Chancellor of Austria shows up unexpectedly. And a lot of bad things start to happen.Actually, Hunt had been following a trail of bad things happening all around the world, and there are always two things in proximity of these events, the Shadow Woman played by Ms Fergusen and Mr Weak-Chin. Who are these people, what do they want, and why is the woman helping Hunt sometimes? This is classic Cold War spy stuff, without the damned Cold War to interfere with what is a well constructed story, well acted by the whole cast. Instead of 'Russia' we have what is called a 'Rogue Nation', which makes it a lot more interesting, because you can't place it on a map. And of course, there are all of the little plot twists and reversals like in the other MI films. Except here, it's more like a long episode of the original TV series. With a lot of action, but compared to the first 4 MI offerings not too over the top.",10,2,6,12 November 2015
Spider-Man," With Great Power comes Great Responsibility
","By default, Comic Books are the perfect Pre-Viz for movies made based on them. And as a long-time Spidey fan, I was able to see the panels of this comic book come to striking life, sometimes reproduced with magnificent exactness in comparison to the way the books have been drawn and colored.As far as this initial offering goes, the choices of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe and James Franco allowed for an almost precise match to how the characters they each portray looked in the books. The casting of Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae, and J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jameson: But it was not just the casting of actors who very closely resemble the characters of the Spider-man Universe, it was clearly Sam Raimi's direction in concert with the script by David Koepp based very closely on Stan Lee's 'Spidey' Origin Story, which made these people come alive and pop out of the comic book frames, almost into real life.Compared to some of the other Marvel universe movies, this one was done with the most amount of care and respect for the series. Just to reproduce the postures of the flying web-slinger, using some of the most famous frames from the comics, was an astounding accomplishment.From his humble beginnings in 'Evil Dead' Sam Raimi has been a clever filmmaker, especially in his ability to make splendid visual effects. Combine that with a huge budget along with Visual Effects god John Dykstra, who designed effects for Star Trek: The Motion Pic and the original Star Wars, back when it was still called that. Connect the dots with a fantastic Production Designer and Costume Designer, and it all just worked.One of the tests of how well Digital Effects have been done are in the viewing of these films on lower-resolution mediums, like smart phone screens and Old Cathode-Ray Tube TV's. I've viewed this film in each of those, and when Spidey is crawling up a wall in an obvious CGI shot, it makes you wonder if it really was CGI: In films like Daredevil, it is easy to spot the transition frames; here, it is impossible to find it.Comparatively, the work on Captain America showing Steve Rogers as a skinny kid is very clever. Here, the same tech is used in a smaller degree to show Parker as a wimpy, skinny nerd. This is highly effective so that when Parker sees himself buffed out with his shirt off, you believe a change has occurred.Where this film excels is in the rapidity of which it gets into the Spider-Man story, which is within the first ten minutes. As much as I do like the new Marc Webb 'Amazing Spider Man' (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good.In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film.Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who 'names' Spider-man - Saying 'The Human Spider? That Sucks!'My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of 'The Competent Man' and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice: Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey.But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically.But the main message: 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility' - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film.",10,2,3,27 November 2012
The Machinist," This Wonderfully Kicks Arse!
","This movie is REALLY SHOCKING and UPSETTING!! So a Great many of you movie loving people will LOVE this- especially if you love Hitchcock.Take the most demented Hitchcock Plot and multiply the 'twistedness' by a factor of 100... This is IT.Look for more movies directed by Brad Anderson. Also, great jobs by Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and especially Aitana Sanchez-Dijon. Look for good parts from Michael Ironside as well. I believe the combination of Brad Anderson and the Spanish production company, gave this movie a VERY eerie quality that would be extremely difficult to reproduce.This has got to be the most refreshingly original film I have seen in a long time, and I am proud of myself cos I chose it on a whim, and I finally have to say, Christian Bale fans, will be ULTIMATELY shocked by his transformation in this... An actor that can do what he has done in this movie, deserves respect.",10,1,2,14 August 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Secret Origin of Gwen Stacy
","Sam Raimi's 2002-2007 Trilogy was fantastic - He totally captured the essence of Spider-Man. But Marvel Comics themselves constantly re-tell the stories, and sometimes re-invent their superheroes, so also do Filmmakers who are telling, and in this care, re-telling these stories.Sam Raimi was not called on to do the re-telling, this time it went to newbie Marc Webb. How did he do? Not as well as Raimi did with his first two installments. But swell enough, to keep us interested. Is this an unnecessary re-telling? That's a big 'Nope.'Andrew Garfield is the new Peter Parker. He is less of a wimp than Tobey Maguire's version: Less of a wimp. But more of a geek. He's better at science than Maguire was. He Skateboards. He even stands up to Flash Thompson, stupidly, but he shows a measure of bravery, which Tobey lacked. He is also taller than Tobey Maguire.This new kid has it built in. he is intelligent, Maguire not so much. He's sharp, Maguire often did not know what was transpiring under his steamy glasses. He is not shy like Maguire was, where Maguire stood with thumb up it, Andrew Garfield acts. This is not to say I am not endeared to Tobey Maguire's version. But this new kid has his own way of doing it.We also delve into a subject that was not looked into very much in the Spidey Comics I had read-What happened to Parker's Parents, who they were, what did they do, and how Parker ended up with Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae? Campbell Scott is Richard Parker, a scientist working for Oscorp, and Embeth Davidtz is Mary Parker, Peter's doting mom. As a kid, Peter Parker was played by Max Charles. Sally Field is Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben is Martin Sheen: THIS I liked very much.Richard and Mary Parker are frightened by something. Their house has been burglarized. Richard has some secret papers in a hidden drawer: Peter sees this, he remembers. He remembers his father's leather attach√©, and the papers inside. But the Parkers are frightened, They drop Peter off at Uncle Ben's and are never seen again.Next Scene, Peter Parker is in High School, photographer for the school paper, geek, but respected. Has the gall to call Flash Thompson by his real first name, which he is rewarded with by a butt kicking. Enter Gwen Stacy aka Emma Stone. Perfect. She knows how to deal with Flash.A leak in the basement draws Peter's attention to his dad's Attache Case. There is a photo of Richard Parker with 'some guy' (Rhys Ifans) - Uncle Ben tells Peter later that this is Dr. Curt Conners, who was a friend of the Parkers.These family ties are tightly woven threads of the story. Peter Parker is very much Richard Parker's son. But he does enjoy a close relationship with his Aunt and Uncle.Peter finds the compartment in the attach√© case that holds papers with the symbol '√∏√∏' and some scientific formula. Looking up Conners on the computer, he sees that an internship program has just started, so he goes to Oscorp and sneaks in. On an escalator, he sees a representation of the shadowy image of Norm Osborn.As it happens, Gwen Stacy is the head intern, but she lets Parker stay. He gets Conner's attention by knowing the answer to a question he asks the interns. But then he bumps in to a man named Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) and sees that '√∏√∏' symbol on a paper he drops. He follows Ratha and finds a room with the same symbols, spiders fall on him from a machine.Gwen Stacy finally kicks him out and this is when he is bitten.From this point in the film, it matches some of the events from Raimi's version - He plays around with his new abilities and in standing up to Flash Thompson, gets into trouble, causing Uncle Ben to be called to Mid-Town Science (The school where Parker went), and phase one of the Uncle Ben 'responsibility' lecture.After school he goes to see Dr Conners and tells Conners who he is, giving him the formula which he did not know that his father was keeping from Conners and the rest of Oscorp.Missing is the whole 'Wrestling Match for Money' angle but the story with Uncle Ben is pretty much the same, he is killed by a petty thug, causing Parker to go out vigilante-style. Unlike Maguire, he cannot shoot webs from his fingers, he uses webbing he gets from Oscorp to make the Web- Shooters. Eventually he makes the costume and then goes out hunting some more - THIS is where Andrew Garfield is very good as Spider-Man, he is VERY good with the Spidey-Cracks. 'Hey! I'm Swingin'' Here!'Denis Leary is Captain Stacy, Gwen's dad, who Parker has several confrontations with as both Parker and Spidey: This is an excellent character, especially when Parker starts showing interest in Gwen.Most of this film shows the results of Peter giving the formula to Conners, who uses it to mutate into 'The Lizard' and how parker as Spider-Man corrects that mistake with Gwen's help, and the ultimate cost. The problem with this film is mostly the Digital Lizard, which although done well, is just too difficult to believe. But Spidey's fights with the creature are a good blend of practical filming and CGI. The Raimi films have too much Digital Spider-Man, most of the Spidey in this one, are really Garfield or whoever is in the costume doing stunts.I liked this more than I expected to, and I was very pleased with the chemistry between 'Parker' and 'Gwen' and the way Parker/Spidey admits to Gwen that 'The Lizard' was his responsibility. The 'Power/Responsibility' connection was not preached out at us, is was worked into the story on a gut level.",10,9,18,27 November 2012
Aliens," The Alien Queen!
","Q: 'What's laying these eggs?'A: 'Something we haven't seen yet...'This is a question we did not have any time to ask during the first film, we were too busy having our brains eaten, having molecular acid pumped at us, being raped by an Aliens Tail, and having Geiger's Alien salivating all over our spaceship.In the theatrical version of Aliens, we are not even shown the Alien Ship - As we are in the extended cut. If we get to see the extended cut, we can see that the ship has further deteriorated at least on the outside, one of the huge U structures seems to have fallen down.And so this is the film which gave James Cameron his 'acid' test - And he had to re-visualise the universe that Ridley Scott created.But he did not totally revamp that future imperfect... He added to it. He shows us the 'Company' - The Weyland/Yutani company which went unnamed in the first film. He gives us a look into the Corporate which drives this future and their motivations.And according to Cameron, that future is just as bleak as our present, including corporate criminals as portrayed by Paul Reiser and Military Meatheads portrayed by William Hope, Bill Paxton, Jeanette Goldstein and Cameron's own imported Michael Biehn. Cameron gives us a look at various personality types and how they would act in the future... Which is to say that there is not that much difference.After viewing some of the Bonus features, and a very long documentary which was made alongside the original filming of this epic, it is amazing, how Cameron could do so much, and build a universe so big in the limited space he had to work with. Amazingly, the budget for this hyper epic was a mere 25 Million, which would barely pay for Pre-vis in any modern epic.The first time I saw the Theatrical 'Aliens' I was impressed by the hugeness of the production, the sets seemed titanic. This was just Cameron, who was very clever with the way he filmed scenes on the alien planet LV426. It is difficult to determine what set pieces are actually miniatures, and which are full sized. The Troop Transport was a beautiful redressing of an airplane tug.Regardless of style difference between Ridley Scott and Cameron, this film is a seamless continuation of the story of 'Leftenant Ripley'. Cameron uses all the resources at his command to tell this story, and his library of 'tricks' which he learned by working for veteran filmmaker Roger Corman: The amount of visual trickery done by Cameron which fakes us into believing that LV426 is a real planet is astounding.The Aliens which are shown in this film, are a slightly different colour that the Scott's Geiger-made Alien.. And they do not have the shiny domed heads, which gave the Alien it's frightening, metallic aspect. Instead, they had Bone ridges which were probably cheaper to make. The fact that there are only maybe 5 or 6 actual alien suits is clouded under the impression that there are hundreds of these beasts.There is nothing that needs to be added, or subtracted from this story, and the extended cut of the film is most satisfactory, bringing elements back in which ought not to have been cut, but probably were for time considerations: The initial scene where Newt's parents visit the Alien Shipwreck and get 'facehugged' - Which includes a short look at the life in the colony, the children, and even the Weyland-Yutani logo... Which gives us the name of the company for the first time, except that this was not shown until the early 90s when the laserdisk of the extended cut was released. This scene was a critical piece of exposition, however, even when cut, the story survives brilliantly.But in order to put this film on an equal bearing with the original Alien, Cameron showed us that which was laying the eggs: The Alien QUEEN. When I first saw it, I just assumed it was Geiger's work... But to my amazement, this creature was wholly designed by James Cameron- And he mimics Geiger's work so well, you just cannot tell.The idea of the Queen gives us the shock value which the original film had: And when we first see this thing, we are agape. When I view the DVD, I must and do, rewind the scene and watch it again and again- Because that first impression is fantastic.This film is one of the jewels of the 20th century, and when you consider that the Universe that was shown to us was wholly created by using practical effects, we wonder why this kind of film-making cannot be done anymore. We assume that this kind of practical film-making cannot be done due to cost, but that is not the case: This kind of film-making cannot be accomplished in these days because we lack one important thing: A Filmmaker of James Cameron's Caliber and ingenuity.",10,1,2,15 April 2009
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Bryan Singer's Crowning Achievement
","The first time this storyline from the comics was used, was in the great 1992 X-Men Cartoon. I suppose there were a couple other cartoon renditions of this as well, but those were not worth mentioning- The '92 Saban X-Men series did a fantastic job of rendering the Core X- Men and animating the tales which kept us saying 'Make Mine Marvel' and 'Nuff Said' all these years.Finally, at long last, we have this story told in Live Action. Well, Live Action and some masterfully done SFX.No one can doubt that Hugh Jackman has brought James 'Logan' Wolverine to more life than any other cartoon rendition of the character, and even in the Comics his antics are always what you are drawn to. He's the best as what he does, and what he does ain't pretty, as he always reminds us.The graphic image of Wolverine in Mid-Flight, Adamantium Claws Extended - The Iconic Image of Wolverine which is on one of the covers of the 1982 limited series, was shown in 'The Wolverine' (On top of the Bullet Train), and his 'fastball Special' was shown in The Danger Room scene in X-3, The Last Stand. So, what's left? Plenty: Just keep your eye on Bobby 'Iceman', in X-3 he Iced Up Solid, in this he is finally able to do the stuff he can from the books.One enigmatic figure from the comics had never made it into the films: 'Bishop' (Omar Sy) - Other characters from the 'X-Force' side-team are also here, Sunspot (Adan Canto), Warpath (Booboo Stewart), and Bishop's Sister 'Blink' (Bingbing Fan, in the comics she is actually deceased, and she appears as a Hologram from Bishop's Armband). So we have a nod to X-factor here are well.The Original story had Kitty Pryde (Ms Ellen Page) as the one who this story revolved around, and Wolverine was actually Killed by the Modern Sentinels. In retrospect that story would not have worked as well as this, because of Wolverine's Central importance to the storyline that had been told starting from the first X-Men film.Some of the other particulars have been changed as well, mostly to use concepts (And characters/actors) from X-Men: First Class - So mainly this was a unique opportunity to use two sets of actors for Magneto and Professor X. The only thing that is a problem, is that Patrick Stewart had appeared as a Walking Elder Professor X in 'X- Men Origins: Wolverine' - And Xavier had lost use of his legs at the end of 'First Class'. But if you watch this film. you will see why it is not a problem: This film deals once again with Alternate Histories and Universes. This seems to be a common concept used in many media lately, most notably in 'Fringe' which had 'Red and Blue Universes'. In a way, we have this happening in the X-Men Franchise, and if my guess is correct, the next X-Film will deal with the 'Age of Apocalypse' which is a total mind-bender: IN fact Marvel changed the name of all of their major comics for six months while that story played out.What is great to see always is another appearance/cameo by Mike Dopud, who was notable for playing at least 6 different guys in the Stargate Franchise. He has appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well as in X-2, hes just one of those faces that shows up in Hugh Jackman movies. Look for him here, in '1973'.This film has Wolverine living in a Split-Level Head: One head in the Present (2025 or so) and the other in 1973, so the action literally spans 50 years. Despite the changes to the story from the comics, this film connects all of the X-Men franchise films in a way I had not thought possible, and as much as I respect the work of the other directors, it took Bryan Singer to pull all the strings back together. IN my view, is was a huge mistake for him to go off- mission to make 'Superman Returns'- A movie that should have been made in 1980, which was actually made in 1978, but the scenes Marlon Brando had shot were simply not used in their proper context- Having Bryan direct that was not the best use of his talents, as X-3 suffered for it. Not that I did not enjoy X-3, Magneto picks up the San Francisco Bay Bridge and lays it across to Alcatraz... In this film, the younger Magneto does something almost as amazing. What was better, Magneto moving the Bay Bridge, or Superman moving a huge Kryptonite Continent? What we see here, makes those titanic events seem small in comparison.Between X-3 and this film, we were shown just how powerful Magneto is, and that Jean Grey was even more so.In this franchise, we've seen Magneto move bridges, Jean Grey Vaporize people, Logan regrow skin as fast as Jean could strip him of it, and Charles Xavier take habitation of his Brain Dead Half- Brother's Body. Prepare to see much, much more in this latest installment, and be prepared for the coming Apocalyptic Age, cos 'El Nabin Sur' is coming.",10,4,8,1 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Catholic Rabbits, Freight Cars, Soldiers?
","And, the Black Cat! Bucky Barnes 'The Winter Soldier' can't get a break. There seems to be a string of words that when spoken, makes him compelled to follow certain orders.But something happened in 1991 that one weak chinned individual really wants to find out. It's locked in Bucky's Brain. But there is one other person who would want to know this secret: Tony Stark. Except he doesn't even know this secret exists.This is the time of 'The Sekovia Accords', the Avengers can't do a simple job without bunches of people getting killed and mass destruction abounding. Not their fault, bad guys are all over the place. Hydra is still being Hailed, but we don't see too much of them lately. Getting tired of Hydra anyway. Now, the world as a whole wants to have 'oversight' over the Avengers. Tony Stark favors this, Cap America does not.It's as simple as that, but nothing is simple anymore. And now, The Scarlet Witch is having a moment because she could not prevent something bad from happening, and The Vision, is he simply babysitting her, or keeping her locked up at The Avengers Mansion? Because there is an even better floating prison for super hero types who have gone off grid.This disagreement between Stark and Cap causes an Avengers Rift and puts Cap on the other side of the law for once. All for Bucky's sake, wouldn't you do all you could for your best friend? But many people want to see Bucky dead. Others don't want him dead, just what he knows.The question is, why? There is only one person who knows that, and he's well prepared to rip the Avengers into tiny kibbles and bits to find out about something that happened. On December 16, 1991. Look for William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, a jerk, this guy could cause severe problems in future movies.Each one of these Marvel Movies outdo the previous ones, and I thought Deadpool was great, except for that CGI Colossus. So many Marvel Superheroes have been established, and now, more and more of them are appearing in every Marvel Entry. It's like they are writing Lord of the Rings as they go, and doing a fine job of it. This is like the Battle of Minas Tirith, and everybody shows up to play. Including Ant-Man, who shows us yet another Dimension, also true to the comics.I was halfway expecting Tony Stark to be killed off, but that didn't happen. It is part of Marvel Canon, he was killed off and then resurrected by bringing his younger self into the future, this was a story arc from the Mid 90's. Actually I was expecting X-Men Apocalypse to be the 'Age of Apocalypse' arc from around 1994, which lasted about 6 months, during which time the whole Marvel Universe had been turned inside out, Apocalypse controlled everything, Logan had his hand chopped off, and Magneto was the head of The X-Men. The 'M'Kraan Crystal' which held the fabric of reality in check, had been broken by 'Legion', who was Charles Xavier's son. But in these current films, we keep seeing these 'Infinity Stones' that can twist realities apart showing up. And one of then is in The Vision's head!I have seen plans for a 'Legion' film as well. There are already holes in the X-Universe due to 'Days of Future Past' which I thought was done well, and now with the handing off of the X-Men principle actors to their younger counterparts, how long before this happens with our Avengers? We're selfish, we want to see more and more with these same actors playing our beloved characters. It is too bad that it takes so long for these films to be made, I just hope that RD Jr keeps playing Iron Man, Cheadle keeps being War Machine, at least for a while, these actors are all in their prime and could probably finish the whole arc with no problem.This film gives us yet another rendition of Spider-Man, I really liked the Toby Maguire version, and I also liked the Garfield version too, he was good in that role. Should have used the same guy here, but I like this new Spidey. Odd to see Spidey as one of the Avengers, but that too, is Marvel Canon.",10,1,6,6 August 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Smart Hulk
","This film gives us something that the comics had but the films lacked: the 'Smart Hulk'.It's unfortunate that this new development with the character came about in the last film of the Avengers series, this is something that should've happened in one of the two hulk films. But I'm glad it finally happened here.In fact I'm very impressed with the way the CGI was done for the character here, he looks very real. They've improved motion capture to the point where the actor themselves can provide the model for the CGI's movements. This goes all the way back to Gollum from lord of the rings, Who was also played but Andy Serkis, who played Ulysses Klaue in this franchise.These avengers films have been basically about one catastrophe after another, in the first film New York City was trashed. In the second, some small city/state called Sokovia was utterly destroyed. In infinity war, the destruction is brought to Wakanda. And in this film, it's the avengers own base that is leveled.But the amazing thing is that this film ties together, I lost count how many films is there? Three Iron Man films, three previous avengers films, Black panther, three Thor films. That's 10 so far, and then 11 if you want to include the Incredible Hulk, which was slightly outside canon for this franchise. None of the X-Men films tied into this so those can't be counted. What am I missing? Oh, two Spiderman films so far bringing it up to 13. And then Captain Marvel, 14. I am sure I am forgetting something. And then appearances within Agents of SHIELD, by Sif, Fury, Hill. Oh yes, two Guardians of the Galaxies, 16.Nothing like this has ever been done and the amount of work that went into this elongated tale has been unprecedented.And there are even more films related to the stories coming out soon.What I love about these films is that they are exactly like the marvel crossovers that I have read, complex Iron Man, Avengers, they even had West Coast Avengers for a while, which became Force Works.There are so many great stories in marvel comics that can be mind for future films. But it's just that we've never had a cast like this, involving all of the marvel titles.I'm just very sad that they could not get the X-Men involved with this because I know they were part of the story too. But they did get Spiderman in there because the actor begged Sony to do it and they listened. Which was amazing.",10,1,6,27 February 2020
Independence Day," People forget how well this film was received originally
","And most people rating it today were maybe not even born when it came out. Different Generations see films differently. But I saw it weeks after it came out, and the Theatre was still filled to maximum on a weekday Matin√©e. I stayed in the Theatre and watched it a second time. I've watched this film many times since then and the magic is still there, especially in the extended cut. As with the new ID4 film, my favorite character was Dr Brackish Okun (Named after Special Effects man Jeffery Okun) played by Star Trek: Next Generation's Brent Spiner.Emmerich and Devlin should have used this film as a template when making their sequel, it seems they had forgotten how to tell this story. The fast pace, multiple character stories, and wry humor kept you glued to it. Randy Quaid's 'Russel Casse' basically stole the film just like Brent Spiner did with the second one. What works is the flawed characters, both of these people, Casse and Okun, have serious social character flaws but they both rise above their perceived Geekness to become heroes.But what made this film great was the way they Composited practical special effects with the primitive Apple CGI of the time. When they showed the Alien Mothership and the 13-mile wide invasion ships, they looked not only big, but real. The Pyrotechnics were all filmed with real models of the cities that were being destroyed, upside down, so the Alien Weapons aftermath do not follow the laws of physics.Another thing that was not done in the new version, but was exploited here, was the use of an Apple Laptop as mankind's best weapon against an alien invasion. In the new time-line generated by this story, we have to assume the Apple Cupertino plant was destroyed, and there never were any IMacs, IPhones, or even modern day tablets and smartphones. Instead, advances in computing and Aerodynamics were affected by the infusion of Alien Tech. So the world depicted in ID4: Insurgence was not the familiar landscape we see here, which was totally destroyed.That probably made it difficult to insert modern day products into that story, as none existed. The Only thing we see there, was QQ taking over global communications due to by the void of ATT being gone.Emmerich and Devlin created an invasion story of special magnificence, something so large we could not have imagined it until we saw it here. 1953's 'War of the Worlds' came close, but we never saw the level of destruction that is shown here as three major US cites are totally eradicated, blown to smithereens, vaporized, gutted and otherwise obliterated.It seems they tried to make the Alien Invasion force in 'Resurgence' even bigger than what we see here, and it does not work at all. But the nature of the invaders was explored more in the sequel. This installment gives us a first look.But mostly the interaction between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is clever, even the relationship between Goldblum and his 'father' Judd Hirsh (From 'Taxi') which is just like so many of us in our relationships with our fathers. Especially with Russel Casse and the love of his kids, despite his alcoholism. And President Whitmore and his daughter, Captain Steven Hiller and his Fianc√© Vivica A Fox and her son. So this film explores how family dynamics would be affected in such a scenario. That aspect is severely lacking in the new sequel.Mainly it's a story about heroism, not Jingoism. Nobody waves any one flag, it's the whole world united, Israel and Palestine working and fighting together for a common cause. Which is the world we all would like to see eventually. Here it takes an Alien Invasion to bring people together. Hopefully that won't be the case. Ironically, the world was closer to that goal when this film came out than it is today.",10,0,0,2 August 2016
District 9," A new Direction for Science Fiction: Reality and Beyond Reality
","In this new type of Science Fiction story, the universe is NOT a glossy, antiseptic, phony piece of set dressing. The bad guys are very similar to yourself, or to your neighbors - Or to your Employers! The age-old issue, of 'The ALIEN' - The 'Unwanted' group of people that move from one poverty stricken area to a new even more impoverished area - A people that were even invited to 'Live Among Us' by our leaders:'The New Colossus'Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles. From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.'Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries sheWith silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!' And so, taking us at OUR word, these masses of huddled Aliens have moved down and taken over whole areas of geography. But... This did NOT occur in the United States - THIS is a speculative fiction film that occurs in... South Africa!!! And the intruders are NOT OF THIS WORLD. These unwanted visitors are sorely UNWELCOME... This scenario is roughly - 'Take two completely different cultures and see just how much NON-Communication can occur - HOW much abuse they can take until they DO something about it.' Well, this film is about two remarkable people, one HUMAN, one ALIEN - Who find a Common Ground.We also have the situation where the lower classes in Johannesburg, who have been kicked out of many other communities - Because of Intolerance - They themselves have the same revulsion and Intolerance that was shown to *them* - So there is no help there, no 'Solidarity' between Humans that have been KICKED about and Poor Miserable Aliens.This film begins in DOCUMENTARY style - This film does not declare in every shot, 'See, this is a SPECIAL EFFECTS Shot!' - Even though it IS a digital effects shot.The blending of Digital and Real elements - The line is SO thin that it cannot be found in some cases - Even in Lord Of The Rings sometimes the boundary between a Digital shot and a Practical shot was very obvious - that is NOT SO in District 9.And so, Neill Blomkamp - With the help of Peter Jackson and some of his crew - was able to make this film - Which is basically, 'The Fantastic meets the Mundane'Our 'Hero' - Or in this case, ANTI-Hero 'Wikus' - Begins his role in this film as one of the Establishment. One of the guys who is DOING the Oppressing. Perfectly Portrayed by Sharlto Copley ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1663205/ ) - This miserable piece of Humanity - Who is just like anybody in the United States, England, France, Australia - Has just been 'Promoted' to oversee the eviction of 1.6 Million 'Prawns' - The Insectoid Aliens In Question - From a Slum/Ghetto situation to a... CONCENTRATION CAMP situation.And of course, there are a few of these 'Prawns' that really do not want to go to the new Concentration Camp- And it is Wikus, interacting with these few Prawns - That starts the Ruckus in this Film.Now - In direct relation to films like the original Star Wars Trilogy - The Second SW Trilogy - ALIEN - We have these observations:If you listen to the Director Commentary for District 9, he talks about how the Digital Effects were deliberately de-emphasised... For instance in the beginning of the film, the first time we see the gigantic space-ship, it is not like it was shown in Independence Day, 'V', or any other film where a huge mothership LOOMS over a city- The first view of the ship is in DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE, what looks like a hand held cam.Same thing with shots of the aliens, they are shown in groups of rioting people and in slums.However, in Avatar, it was almost like 'See how much money we paid for Digital Effects' - Every shot with digital characters is totally over-emphasized. But that is just Jim Cameron- Like in Titanic, he had to use that footage of the real titanic on the bottom of the ocean- Which is confirmed in 'Ghosts of the Titanic' when he went down there agin in 2001, right around the time of 9/11 - He went down to the Titanic again and you can see where he got most of the footage for Titanic...Avatar however, I give the guy respect for BLENDING the digital world and characters he created with the live action people and set pieces - He moved it a step beyond Lord of the Rings.But between Avatar and District 9 - Avatar is basically EYE candy, I like what it looks like, but District 9 is the most gritty, realistic film I have ever seen- and IF a spaceship went to South Africa, it would be treated similarly.The ironic thing is that while District 9 was filming, there was a real situation with Zimbabwe - riots and fighting.Also, the use of those troop transport trucks with the 'V' shape - I never knew that was an anti-mine design - and it is strictly used in South Africa by the paramilitary.",10,0,2,26 December 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Desolation Row
","After being carted away by 'The Eagles are Coming!', our troop is still playing Hide and Seek with Azog's Orc-Pack.But we have to have a Flashback First. Once again we see Peter Jackson walking around Bree with a Carrot in his mouth. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring' we met his daughter as one of the cute little Hobbit kids. This time, she is a 'Butterbur' (The Ostlers of 'The Prancing Pony'), carting tankards of Ale to Thorin and Gandalf, one year earlier. Just look for the girl that looks like Peter Jackson. Here is talked about Thrain's Disappearance, Thorin's father- Who wielded the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings. As Gandalf tells Thorin, they would need a Burglar...Fade to Bilbo spying on Azog's pack, and he sees a huge Bear. Gandalf tells him this Bear might be an Ally, he will either help them - Or kill them.So they take refuge in a House, Gandalf not telling them it's The Bear's house, until The Bear is chasing them into it. The Bear is 'Beorn' (Mikael Persbrandt), and it just so happens that he hates Orcs and Goblins more than Dwarfs - So they have a temporary Ally.This film had a lot of the things I was waiting to see, Mirkwood, The Spiders, and the Wood-Elves Kingdom. Lee Pace is Thranduil, Legolas' Father. It just makes Sense that Legolas is there, and if he were true to character, he would have helped the band of Dwarfs just like he helped Aragorn and Gimli. Peter Jackson creates a She-Elf out of thin- air, 'Tauriel' (Evangeline Lilly) who is very Elf. I don't have any trouble with this either, she neither adds nor takes away anything, and gives us something very pretty to look at. But she only has eyes for Fili, much to Legolas' Chagrin.Since The Hobbit was written as if Bilbo wrote it, these little facts and characters didn't need to be written in, so it's up to us to fill in the blanks, with Jackson's help. And Tauriel is very much an Elf, displaying many of the powers that Arwen had.While the Dwarfs plus Bilbo get 'wrapped up' in Mirkwood, Gandalf has to go to the High Fells of Rhudaur. This is part of the back-story of the Witch King of Angmar, the leader of the Ring-Wraiths.These two stories get told side-by-side for the rest of this film and beginning of the last, much the same way Lord of the Rings told up to five stories at once, we have the Orcs - Azog and Bolg, who is introduced here, summoning Azog to Dul Goldur. We have the Wood-Elves Kingdom, we have Laketown, and the bargeman Bard's (Luke Evans) relationship with the Master of Laketown, and his history, Evans also plays Bard's ancestor Girion, the archer who shot the Black Arrows at Smaug at Dale and missed, but in fact causing a chink in Smaug's armor, to be abused by Bard 60 years later. Laketown creates the opportunity for many characters and interactions to take shape.But mainly, the Dwarfs get to Erebor on Durin's Day, even though their party has been split up, Kili and some others left at Laketown, where Bolg attacks, giving Orlando Bloom the opportunity to be Action Hero again. It seems that Legolas has the Skill to kill Bolg (Lawrence Makaore, who was the Witch King in Return of the King), just not the luck to do it this time.We finally get to see the Whole Smaug this time, not just his nostril or eye. This is one of the best Dragons of Film, CGI or Not, almost as good as the Dragon from the early 80's film 'Dragonslayer'.Some of the interaction between Smaug and the Dwarfs is expanded a bit, but in the end, Smaug smells Laketown on Bilbo and flies off for retribution. But not before he gets to take a kind of Swim and gets a shiny new coat...If 'An Unexpected Journey' hinted at many of the things to come, 'Desolation of Smaug' gets into the details much more, further connecting this trilogy to the 'second' one. In a way, I wish this trilogy had been made first, or that less time had been between the two. That way the reaction to this one would have been less jaded.When it comes to film, what do people want? Three more Expendables films? More Schwarzenegger films? I think this era's moviegoers, well they may be fine - But it is all of these Internet Eberts who create 50 IMDb accounts, just to try to scrag the ratings of one film, that ruin the enjoyment of the people who went to see it. And if you check the join date of every bad review or 1-star rating, you'll see it was 'One Day Ago' - And I'll bet they pirated a copy of it just to watch it - If they watched it at all, which I doubt.",10,5,8,19 January 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," What if we Sit on them and Squash them into Jelly?
","That's what I would like to do to the Trolls who are attacking every positive review in here (probably using multiple IDs). We'd have quite a glob of squished IMDb trolls, maybe enough to satisfy even the Three Trolls of Trollshaw.Peter Jackson once again visits Hobbiton and takes us with him, this time for real, as they have left the Hobbiton set standing. In my mind only Jackson could have made this, just like only he, an unlikely Director, could have made the first (Or rather, Second) Trilogy. Is 'The Hobbit' a 200-page book? No, actually it is more like 986, at least in i-Books. Regardless of book length on paper or in Bytes, what is forgotten is that 'The Hobbit' is simply one very small part of a much larger story written by Tolkein which included 'The Hobbit', 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Silmarillon', and several collections of 'Lost Tales'. If you are not interested in the whole of Tolkein's Awesome Creation, then maybe these trilogies are not for you. As this story never really begins, and never really ends, I can live with these very short in perspective sorties into Middle Earth that these films afford us. Jackson has handed us a window into Middle Earth, a doorway in fact. We can either enter and enjoy it as it is, or spend our time using multiple IMDb accounts trying to drag this film and the others down. Me, I prefer to enjoy them, and write about why I enjoyed them.First off, I don't think Two Hours and Forty-Nine Minutes are enough. And in fact, the extended version is over three hours. And that is almost enough, at least for this first part.We are given an illustrated history of how the Dragon 'Smaug' (Benedict Cumberbatch/Khan) took down the town of Dale while getting at the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor for it's Gold, and the unhappy history of Thror, the King Under the Mountain, and his son Thrain, and grandson and subject of this film, Thorin Oakenshield, named for the Oaken Branch he used while fighting the Orc 'Azog the Defiler'. This all given to us by Ian Holm as 'Old Bilbo', in a note to Frodo (Elijah Wood, looking very much as he did almost 15 years ago).This gives us something to grab onto, since The Hobbit is the same story as Lord of The Rings. It gives us a continuity as Old Bilbo reminisces of a time 60 years past - At which point Bilbo meets Gandalf, who looks basically the same as he did in Lord of the Rings - When he was still Gandalf the Gray. Enter 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin, who 'Blunt the Knives and Bend the Forks' while eating all of Bilbo's food - Of which Bombur doesn't use a knife, eating blocks of Cheese whole.One thing these films have more of, and even more in the extended editions, are the delightful Songs of Middle Earth, mostly in the same form as they are in the books, even a few from Lord of the Rings that we missed in those films.As far as young Bilbo is concerned, Martin Freeman portrays a much different Bilbo at first, and as the films proceed the mannerisms start becoming more like Old Bilbo. I was expecting 13 Dwarfs much like Gimli, but we never saw any Young Dwarfs in Lord of the Rings. Apparently they look very Human until they start digging for Gold and their noses grow. These are all relatively Young Dwarfs save Balin, and they show his progression from being younger in Flashback.This was Middle Earth as it was before the end of The Third Age, there was more Magic, this was reflected in the look of Elves and of Rivendell, even of Orcs, Goblins, and Trolls, all riding Wargs. By the time of Frodo, much of this magic had been subdued.By my second viewing I was better able to see which effects and characters were practical and which CGI, there are a lot of practical shots and Miniatures. What we are offered here is a level far beyond Lord of the Rings, it works because that is how the story is.After the party gets abducted by the Trollshaw Trolls, the film veers away from the book somewhat, expanding the role of Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy). Or merely telling us more than is told in the book, not necessarily adding more than is in The Hobbit, merely foreshadowing things to come in Lord of the Rings- such as The Release of The Witch King of Angmar and the rest of 'The Nine', further trying the loose ends of Lord of the Rings.There is one little thing about Stone Giants, I thought this had been made up and added, in fact, Gandalf talks about it briefly in the book. Once we get into Goblin Town and Bilbo meets Gollum, it is the heart of the story, 'Riddles in the Dark'. Maybe Guillermo del Toro had something to do with the look of the Stone Giants, feels like his handiwork. To be Continued.",10,4,8,19 January 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Speaking of 'Ghost' - This is the real Spirit of Vengeance
","Brad Bird's Live Action Directorial Debut has made a Dent in my Reality.Surrounded by Exec Producer JJ Abrams team of crazy thinkers and doers, Brad has No trouble matching Directing Wits with JJ.And regardless of Tom Cruise' Idiosyncratic beliefs is Alien Motherships and Thetans and such, we can allow him his inanities - Because he is one hell of an Actor and one hell of a Producer. I laugh with everyone at his shocking statements to the press, maybe Cruise is simply trying to 'Shock or Schlock' us, maybe he likes that his insane statements generate News coverage - Hell, I don't care if he even believes in his own prattle. Regardless of that, people will Talk about Cruise after this film - Cos he's simply damn good, I've admired his acting all the way back to 'Legend' and here he is Ethan Hunt all the way. He does things here that he's never done before, and he does them well. So I give my High Respect to Cruise, good job, damn good job!This marks Cruise' Return to High Powered Action films. The Production team of Cruise/Abrams hands us one walloping good tale. Brad Bird's technocratic directing speeds us through Ethan Hunt's Disavowment and inevitable vindication in ways we've never seen before with production value unlike any of the previous MI Films.Each MI Film has made references to the ones made before. In this film we herald the return of Benji (Star Trek's 'Scotty-Simon Sean of the Dead Pegg) as a full Field Agent. Along with Agent Carter (Paula Patton who was great in 'D√©j√† vu') and 'Analyst Brandt' (Jeremy Renner), the disavowed team once again save the world as we know it while nobody is the wiser.There is a destruction of a Major Russian Building - So Believable, what parts were CGI and what parts were real practical Effects? I sense a Blending of the two. There is a 5 minute Chase scene through a Sand Storm - After watching the Featurette which shows how they filmed that section, it is amazing that most of the elements in the frame are real items. The scene is edited so well that we are totally fooled. That this whole thing happened in the middle of a desert during a sandstorm.Cruise must like Heights - Is that building in Dubai real, is was that CGI'd? The Building reads as Real - As do Cruise High-Altitude Stunts.Ethan Hunt is a combination of both 'The Competent Man' ‚Äî and Cary Grant's 'Mr. Lucky' - But through all of Hunt's competent Stature, we can see real fear in the character's eyes-Cruise makes us believe that the man, although subject to the same uncertainties as we all, just knows by default as well as IMF Training how to 'Make his Own Luck.'Because, in this film, it's not like James Bond, perfectly executing each gag with NO mistakes - Hunt makes Mistakes - His team makes mistakes, equipment does not work exactly as expected, and there are people who are just not what they seem - Hunt uses each turn of events, good or bad, ultimately for his benefit, he knows what to let go and what to pursue.Now... To address the use of these iPhones, WHERE do I get one of these, and are they A5's? They've got to be Jailbroken, or at least Altered in some way by IMF. What is of interest here, is that I can relate to the use of the iPhone in this film, as I use mine for just about everything - For shopping, for driving, for watching TV or Movies, it is a remote, it locates things for me, it tells me where I am. But these iPhones even tell you who is going to kill you - Provided you get the message in time! That is the only true spoiler I'll give you.One thing about these particular iPhones, some of them are slightly larger than mine. Mostly they look exactly like mine-so I love it ‚Äî iPhone - The Official Phone of the IMF!",10,1,3,5 April 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Centerpiece of Pete Jackson's LOTR Trilogy
","Someone said in another review: If you are not entertained by this movie then it is not possible for you to be entertained. A Vision appears in my mind of Russell Crowe shoving two huge swords into a guys gut and then lopping off his head while screaming 'ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?' As this film is the centerpiece of the most complex Trilogy ever made (even more so than 'Avatar' Which Weta also did the majority of Computer Graphics for)... Then the problem lies with the viewer, not with the Filmmakers.And for myself after watching this film a multitude of times in both Theatrical and Extended versions plus the hours of extra material, I feel that Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens, Fran Walsh, Barry Osbourne, Rick Porras, Howard Shore, Jamie Selkirk and all of the cast and crew of LOTR are all personal Friends of mine who have visited me in my living room whenever I've watched the extras. My favourite person is Gino Acevedo, the Prosthetic makeup artist who did Limbs and Gollum's digital 'makeup' - And he was one of the 'Pirates' in Return Of the King.. Don't know why, I like the way the guy describes his work, I can get along with someone like that. There was also a woman, she was only shown a few times but I was impressed, did all the motion capture for the digital hordes, Carrie Thiel: Also modeled all the moves for the Massive Agents, quite deft and professional, and she looked like she means business. Christian Rivers... The Miniatures Unit, they can come to a party at my house ANY day, I owe all of these people. Each person who worked on LOTR was a consummate Professional, chosen for specific jobs... Even Alan Lee, hired as conceptual artist along with John Howe stepped out of his slot to assist Dan Hennah with the set decoration, so these people did a lot of multi-departmental work. The atmosphere must have been something to see! Insane artists designing the Witch King's Spiky Helmet! These people made a permanent dent in me and I'll never forget them, I'll remember them forever.The most amazing sight is our first view of Edoras as Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas ride up... Which was a real place that existed for just Six Months, the most convincing set ever built for a movie. 'You'd find more cheer in a graveyard', Gimli grimly offers as they ride up... These films were made in the midst of a time of great upheaval and change, just as the characters face in the film: Pippin tells Meriadoc... 'Maybe we don't belong here, it's too big for us, besides, We still have the Shire' - Whereas Meriadoc rebukes him, telling him, 'The fires of Isengard will spread, The woods of Tuckbourough and Buckland will burn, and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone... There won't BE a Shire'. Our choice is to make our world good or bad: So I challenge anyone watching this film to let this be a cautionary tale - How would you like your world? And Ironically, Weta Digital also worked on another film which makes the same statement... 'Avatar'. Do we want to live in a world with NO Brazilian Rain Forests or African Jungles or Polar Ice Caps? We cannot live without these things, they are necessary for our survival and also the survival of our precious animals, our most valuable resource. And so we stand at a crossroads and we must go up the Morgul Vale to the Dead City and up the secret stair through Shelob's Lair and right into Mordor. And we can't stop there, then we have to wade through troops of Orcs and then up a volcano that keeps threatening to erupt! And then it DOES erupt, so then we get to surf on huge Rocks and then if we are lucky we can catch a ride on the next Eagle that flies by... Perhaps Lord of the Rings is a Prophetic Story, Prophetic and representational of us today, although Tolkien never wanted it that way.Considering this is a landmark film using brand new MoCap tech, the computer graphics meld into the practical and miniature sets perfectly. I KNOW there is no 'Warg Attack' in the book, and in the book we do not get a troop of ELVES showing up just in time to help defend Helm's Deep and Legolas never takes a Skateboard Run down the outer steps of the deeping wall, but Jackson made the best Lord of the Rings he was able to make and thank The Lord Bob Shaye shelled out the money to make this, and in Three films... And the story is basically intact, so please no complaining about no Gandalf fighting the Balrog Under the Mountain! Peter Jackson interpreted Lord of the Rings for us, and handed it to us on a platter. But if all you have seen is the Theatrical version of all of these movies, then I can say with authority, you really have not SEEN Jackson's Lord of the Rings - So go out and rent you that Extended Cut- Soon to be released in Blu-Ray HD!",10,0,2,12 January 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Absolute Madness
","I expected this newest entry into the Bourne story to be a total redundancy, instead I received a kick in the rear end, to my most happy surprise.As this runs concurrently with some of the events in Bourne Ultimatum which in turn ran concurrently with certain events in Supremacy, we have an overlapping story. I credit Tony Gilroy with keeping a level of continuity, despite several years of Technical progress. The time frame is kept by not showing currently used Smart Phones and Computers, so if this film is in the same time frame as Supremacy and Ultimatum, we can believe it.Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing is not as cute as a button as she was in 'The Mummy,' she is a mature woman now, but still very acceptable, In fact I did not immediately recognize her. She's just a geneticist, working in a lab at work she likes to do. She does not know the extent of the work. When she gets into the story with 'Aaron' she is confused, and does not understand the stakes. Not at all like Franka Potente, who was living on the edge before meeting Jason Bourne, Marta is just a scientist, but leave it to Renner to give her a crash course in evading bullets, on the fly WHILE evading bullets.Jeremy Renner comes in to this film as a mountain man, a veritable 'Liver Eatin' Johnson,' and we see right away he has extraordinary ability. The first shot of the film mirrors the last shot of Jason Bourne getting away in Ultimatum. In fact, the theme of Water that is all through these films is clearly kept.This is a new world of secrecy, where people can be made a target just by speaking one word or having knowledge of a particular sort. This is a world where even the agents involved do not speak to each other, are not supposed to know each other, and Jeremy's character is simply identified as 'Number 5.'At a glance, Mr. Renner does not look like the kind of gentleman who is in the secret agent business, he appears to be more interested in eating Livers from 'Crow Injuns' (Apologies for using the word) like Robert Redford in 'Jeremiah Johnson.' But after a failed attempt at blowing him up using smart drones, he makes an immediate appearance change as he steals a random airplane and flies away.In the meantime, Rachel Weisz is almost killed by the great character actor Zeljko Ivanek ('In Bruges' and two 'X-Files' among other appearances) when he goes mad by touching some blue muck in test tubes before offing himself. Rachel goes home and is apparently interviewed by FBI agents who are not what they appear to be - They are there to shut her up.We don't have to know how Jeremy/Aaron Cross finds her, but he gets there just in time to prevent her assassination by these ghouls, after he offs them, he burns her house to the ground and they run away. Tony Gilroy depends on our knowledge of the previous films so that we don't really have to see how he tracks Rachel down, we know he can do it, and he does it.As it turns out, Treadstone and Black-Briar were just small tips of the iceberg as far as CIA Black Ops are concerned, and Edward Norton as retired USAF Col Byer is shutting the USAF's agency down, which is called 'Outcome' (I thought it was 'Alt-Com') with Donna Murphy (Spider-man 3) in tow.This movie is a feast of great character actors, but what makes this film stand out are some chase scenes that are so over the top of the previous Bourne films that those cannot even compare.The complaint of this film is that the story seems to not make sense, but as I see it, it is not a finished story; I believe Tony Gilroy is expecting to make more of these, which he should, as we can see now that the story can be continued even without Matt Damon. So there is not really any resolution of the story. Basically it is 'The Birth of a Super Soldier' - a New guy with even more ability than Jason Bourne, and a nemesis (Louis Ozawa Changchien as 'LARX #3') who can just get up after being shot. Also, I read that this film depended on some 'drug addiction' idea, but in fact it was not really drugs at all. but some complicated sounding genetics and virology, explained by Weisz. It sounded technical enough to be viable, and just enough of an issue to move the story along. The only suffrage is the 'run-out-of-time' ending.This film is way over the top. But Tony Gilroy actually did a great job Directing and Writing this chapter, and the cinematography is very good. If there is a sequel to this, I would be happy to see it.",10,6,10,10 December 2012
Unknown," Neeson comes In From The Cold
","Neeson works well in these European Thrillers, it is hard to categorise these films, they are part mystery, part action, part car chases. And that's what makes these European films work, like 2008's 'Taken'. The Berlin backdrop along with veteran actors like Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz work with the mystery and action elements to give a fairly good romp through Germany. January Jones and Aiden Quinn, as well as Diane Kruger also do some good character work in this.I'll have to admit, I was not really expecting the turns this story took, and that is what makes a good film for me, if I can't predict it, it keeps my interest. Plenty to keep my interest in this, Actually the entire plot of this film from the beginning to almost the end is nothing but a huge 'Hitchcock-MacGuffin', the reveal of which is pretty drastic.Car Chases have interesting twists, and the choice of locations make this a great looking film.Like 'Taken', this film incorporates veteran American actors in a European Setting, along with veteran German actors, Bruno Ganz is always great to watch, and several newer faces, among them Diane Kruger who has already proved her worth in 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'National Treasure' as well as a memorable cameo in one episode of Fringe, she earns her place in this film, she did her role well - Not being the Hapless, Helpless Female, her character takes the initiative, because she takes the initiative.There is nothing else really special about this film, it is a good film, written and directed well, and I will be watching out for Jaume Collet-Serra in the near future. Sometimes a film does not have to be spectacular to be great, but this film does have some great things to see in it, and I'm glad I watched it.",10,1,5,17 June 2011
Million Dollar Baby," I had an epiphany about this movie today
","And its Tea-Party roots.Basically, this movie was a tool used to inject poison. I'll get to that in a bit.This film was released at virtually the Nadir of some of the worst years, not of just my life, but of this nation.If we look at the events surrounding the year of it's release: US is embroiled in basically a war which our then-president caused over OIL. The Housing bubble had burst, and one year later, Bush's first attempts to privatize our social security system was put into effect, namely 'Medicare Part D' which privatized a function of Social Security, took it AWAY from the State, and handed it directly to private entrepreneurs and Insurance Sharks. Many of our elderly went without medication for up to three years. If Part D were put on the table today exactly as it was in 2004, it would be rejected, because it is supposed to be 'Federal'. The reason why this I bring this up is because it was an issue during the time this movie was being made, it's director and writer believes in it, and mainly this movie attacks the idea of Social Security.So I watch this movie, and it actually did have some good things in it, ergo my 5 rating. For the first half at least, some of it was very good, because Chair-Talking' Clint actually is a talented director. But I thought I was watching a movie about a girl who liked Boxing and became a woman boxer. And it was interesting as that movie... Until Clint decides to speak to that empty chair for the first time.Suddenly, the film is no longer about a budding girl boxer, suddenly she is disabled, and her 'evil' mother is fighting with Clint over her money (The mother who just so happens to be worried about losing her Social Security benefits because she is given a HOUSE).If a Disabled person, meaning a person dependent on Social Security to do things like get Medical Care, EAT, find transportation, etc (In other words, those things that people who are not disabled take for granted) - If suddenly were given a HOUSE like that, well for a fact there would be serious and instant consequences- They COULD lose their Social Security. Now, the mother is no angel, and has problems: But to be worried about losing Social Security is a dread fear for all people who get it. However, the woman did receive and act on bad advice from other family members. But Clint uses this one dysfunctional family to make all of Social Security look bad, attacking the recipients of it, in order to state his political views on not liking the system. Well, to hell with you, Clint! Basically, this film is a war about a girl's inheritance money - Should it be given to her Family, who does not seem to give a rip about the girl, or should her 'beloved' trainer get it? The Problem is, regardless of how bad the mother appears, she was justified in being worried over losing her benefits. Simply put, Clint is not a valid person or director to put these elements into a movie, he's never had to LIVE on Social Security. Maybe at times he's had to get California Disability, but that's not the same thing- a person who is on Social Security can own a house, but to just be GIVEN a house is a serious problem.Perhaps if Clint had not made such a big deal in the movie about the mother's fear of Losing Benefits, but it just seemed to me, he went out of his way to make it into some kind of 'statement'. I mean, if the mother is a B****, then just have her be a B****. The whole thing about fear of losing Benefits had no place in this film.Now regarding the relationship Clint has with his Boxer played by Hilary Swank, I could believe that a bit. But that was at the very end of the movie, where his true feelings came out (He tells her what the Irish Slogan he had sewn on her robe meant). It would have been a better ending for a better movie had not Clint used the Anti-Medicare Detour to get there. Now, I've never read the stories that this is based upon, I don't know if the reactionary ideas were in the stories, or if Clint simply put them in. All I know is that this film uses those unfortunate events to make a system we depend on look bad.But this is just Par for Eastwood Movies these days, he is no longer interested in making any good Drama, he actually used to make films that supported the underdog, lately he makes films to support radical right wing reactionary ideas. But mostly he creates these huge canvases where he basically justifies telling a lie as the truth, like his latest sniper movie which gives his stamp of approval to the War in Iraq. I'd rather see him stick to Fiction.",5,3,5,29 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," I'm Distracting you, ya big TurdBlossom!
","This was simply fun, no other way to describe it. This is a Comic Book movie the way they should all be made. It's the 'Star Wars: A Hew Hope' type of thing.Most moviegoers today did not see the original 'Star Wars' as it was called in 1977, and moreover they did not see it up to 20 times in the theater like just about everyone did back then. In fact, there were no multiplex theater complexes, movie-going was much more of an event.By today's standards, it's impossible to create a movie that will have the same impact. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ran for most of a year when it came out. But Star Wars? The Original Star Wars ran for almost 2 years straight, the line to get in was constantly over 100 people long.So when I say, this movie gets that feeling back, it does - Maybe not the same reaction. It is very rare that a movie runs for a year these days, so if a movie runs 4 to 5 months, it is considered excellent.But I started hearing very good things about this for months until I was able to see it. It looks good, the music brings back memories, and at the most important spot in the movie, they play 'The Runaways' version of 'Cherry Bomb'.Vinny Diesel really does not need to say much beyond 'I am Groot', after a while, you know what he means. But the guy who stands out here is of course Dave Bautista, who was also in 'Riddick' as what Riddick calls 'A Big Jamoke'. Here, he's the the big Jamoke who takes everything literally. His performance is one of the best things here.Each of the main characters has that one quirk that makes them interesting, or, irritating.I can see tendrils of story leading into The Avengers and the first Captain America installment, look for The Cosmic Cube. There are several great character actors- 'The Collector' (Benicio Del Toro), Michael Rooker (Yondu), Djimon Hounsou as Korath, John C Reilly as a Nova Cop, even Glenn Close as Nova Prime. Christopher Fairbank, 'The Broker'.Lee Pace (Thranduil from The Hobbit series) is a great Ronan. and we finally get to see that 'Skrull' who was shown briefly at the end of 'The Avengers' - It was 'Thanos', voiced at least by Josh Brolin.I have the first edition of this comic in my comic bin, sadly I have never read it. Of course this is rife with CGI, but it's a comic book movie, and CGI is, or could be used as comic art of sorts. I wonder how much this story follows anything from that one comic? The cinematography is very much like recreated comic book frames.It's not just about CGI, it is using it cleverly, which this does. This film could not have been made without it.Zoe Saldana is great in green, but the big mystery of the day is 'who is Starlord's dad'? According to Yondu, 'The Guy was a Jerk'.Hopefully we'll find out, in a sequel that's as cool as this one. And remember, Nebula (Karen Gillan) is still floating around somewhere sans hand, did she go back to her daddy?The bad reviews and votes: I found several verbatim 1 stars in here, repeated over and over as I went through the pages chronologically. Seriously, post it ONE time. Ya don't get 100 votes while we only get one!",10,5,9,26 January 2015
Clash of the Titans," Clash of the CGI Effects Houses
","I was expecting this to be horrible after reading the flogging this film got in the reviews, actually it was done very well. Director Louis Leterrier did as well as he could for 2008's The Incredible Hulk and of course the original Transporter film, I do not know if this film puts him in the same league as Peter Jackson and James Cameron. He did however do a good job.The whole look of this film is very good - The landscapes are believable and the characters are as good as any of the gods from the Xena/Hercules franchise (Which I loved, by the way, especially Ares). The CGI blends in with the practical elements very well, and I think my favourite image is the Djinn and his little blue flame. Leterrier clearly steals some of Guillermo del Toro's disturbing imagery with his Stygian Witches - And a few other Del Toro-isms appear, placed in perfect places.Of course I watched this due to Sam Worthington, who is the new Orlando Bloom of the 2010's - Just as Orlando Bloom was the action star of the 2000's. These guys give the film industry great new blood, I love these guys. Basically, James Cameron made this guy a superstar, but he is just a great stock actor- I love his little slips into Australian Accent now and then.This film is a feast of great actors, a lot of them just doing cameos - Mads Mikkelsen leads the support cast along with Pete Postelhwaite (Perseus' Fosterfather), Lliam Neeson (Zeus), and Ray Fiennes (Lord Voldemort of Harry Potter) as Hades and that a great casting job. In the background we see Danny Houston and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's Dr. Bashir, Siddig Al-Fadeel (as Alexander Siddig). Alexa Davalos is Andromeda and probably the most beautiful actress to date, Gemma Arterton as Io.This film is basically the story of Perseus lopping off the head of Medusa, a story that has been told and retold in books and films since forever, so that cannot be a spoiler as we all know the story - but unlike Harry Hamlin - Worthington shuns the help of Zeus at every turn.The Kraken in this film is probably my favourite creature of the film,not a but like the great Ray Harrihousen depicted it, and not like the beast from Pirates of the Caribbean, almost a cross between the two.I also like the Punk Rock look of Medusa, she can turn me into stone any day, I think the idea of making love to a woman with a snake-hairdo was probably sexy to the men who originally thought up the Medusa story, this treatment of Medusa is very sexy, the upper half at least. And casting Natalia Vodianova was a stroke, she was not monstrous unless she was looking at someone.The standout performance of this film of course is Jason Flemyng as Calibos, I did not recognise Flemyng at all underneath all that hair and stuff.I've watched this about seven times so far, and I've enjoyed it each time. It is done rather well, but probably not as a 3-D film, it was made and released very rapidly when Avatar was released, so it was not really filmed to be a 3-D film was Avatar was filmed specifically on 3-D cameras. It does well however on a regular flat screen, that's how it should have been released- It is probably more effective in 2-D anyway - But as I have never seen this in 3D, I don't know.I always like to enjoy movies for what they are, not for what the shameless publicity hype said they were.",10,7,12,5 May 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Very good film based on a Phillip K Dick work
","Not as close to the source material as was A Scanner Darkly, in this case the story we have here is loosely based on the short story 'The Adjustment Team' by Phillip K Dick. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt spearhead a great cast including John Slattery and Terence Stamp, at first you don't really know what is happening here, just a hard-luck story about a guy, loses an election due to bad luck and nosy Republican media, meets a girl on Election night, but although it would seem like this is what is happening, it is not.Instead, the very Fabric of Reality is ripped... Who are these guys with the Hats... Cousins of The Watchers in 'Fringe'? What is great about this film is the connectivity between a science fiction story and a religious story, except that this film is neither, although aspects of both are present.This film joins the ranks of other reality-questioning films like The Matrix, The 13th Floor, and Dark City - Except that this is not a world-construct, it's simply the world. And so concepts that might be more suited to a science fiction or religious film are brought into the grasp of people not familiar with either genre, it is simply a film about people, and these things that are going on are not supernatural or of alien design, it is more like, 'This is how the world is constructed'.Matt Damon goes up against the masters of time and space and beats them. So rather than say, 'Foreknowledge vs Predestination/Freewill vs Determinism' you can say 'Freewill AND Determinism' - As Damon shows when he asks, 'What about Free Will?'. Actually the entire premise of this film is that we do actually have Free Will and Choices... Regardless of any entity which may have knowledge of future events.This is a wholly NY Movie, filmed in NY, by people in NY and as such is in my list of top NY movies. It looks good, it is acted well, it is directed very well, and a lot of my favourite Character actors are here, including Anthony Ruivivar and John Slattery - Although this is more of a breakout film for Anthony Mackie, who does his job very well here... Starting out as a minor character, his importance is made evident later.",10,1,3,27 June 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Faster than a Catholic Rabbit
","That's how fast Ultron multiplies himself, according to one character.There is one thing to say about these Avengers and Avengers-Related films of late, they are stuffed full of 'Transformers Dark of the Moon' style creatures and robots attacking large populations. Ie: Huge CGI Sequences showing the utter destruction of various cities, as if Tokyo is everywhere and can be rebuilt quickly.But in this case, the story closely matches the Comic Books from whence it came. If you watch this without first watching the Iron Man films, the Thor Films, the Captain America films, and even Guardians of the Galaxy, you will be lost in a barren wasteland of references to something called 'The Infinity Stones'.It is the one thread that connects all of these films, it was introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger, and it showed up in some form in Thor and Thor: The Dark World.In fact, the one particular Infinity Stone gave Loki his power to brainwash Hawkeye and Dr Selvig. But we didn't know this in the first Avengers film.The nature of this particular stone is what ultimately causes the creation of one of my favorite Avengers: The Vision. The Vision! I don't know if The Vision's creation follows the way it was done in the books, I never read the Ultron storyline. I suppose they had to change some aspects of it, like they did with the Extremis storyline in Iron Man 3- But even that is related.I have never read any Marvel comic without having to buy several other titles just to follow a particular story, in was bankrupting me, I had to stop collecting. I'll have to find the Trade Paperback/Graphic Novel of this to compare the story elements.But I think my disappointment is that people forget that these movies are extensions of those original Comics. They are filmed that way, to look like a comic book, and there is no other way to tell the stories. Every Avengers story eventually includes a huge battle over a city, a planet, in space, etc- This film has several large battle sequences even before the final climactic fight. They get sequentially more complex until the final one, it's not just a fight, there is a city floating in the sky, there are hundreds of Ultron Droids, and there are too many bullets flying around for even Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays the exact same kind of guy in Days of Future Past) to avoid. I was totally shocked by Elizabeth Olson, who I did not like much in 'Godzilla', she totally got the Scarlet Witch, and she gave her to us. The way she is, what she can do, that's straight from the Comics. One worm can that was not toppled was that 'The Twins' are in fact Magneto's Kids. They don't mention much about the part of Wanda's power that is due to causing freak accidents to happen, she is an 'Improbability Engine' (It's on the back of one of my X-Men Trading Cards).One thing that was great was a party on the Avengers NYC Mansion, which we saw at the end of the first Avengers film. But it was crashed by Dr Daniel Jackson of Stargate, oops, by Ultron! I recognized James Spader's voice almost immediately, because it sounded very much like that character from the Stargate movie and the TV shows. Ironically, the actor in the TV versions uses the exact same voice. It was genius casting, gave Ultron a lot of Depth.What Else? Oh Yah, in the Comics, Hawkeye was married to another Avenger, I think who got killed off. That's one thing that's different with Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye.But as I watch these Avengers flicks and the other related Marvel Universe films, it appears that not only are The Avengers being Assembled, but the entire Marvel Multiverse! From X-Men to Avengers, from Thor to Iron Man, these franchises are making mine Marvel just like the comic books did when I was younger.Nuff Said? Nuff Said!",10,3,9,23 September 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Order of the Phoenix - Best Potter Yet!
","I saw the first Harry Potter film amidst a flurry of criticism that kids were being taught 'Witchcraft' through these stories. Highly Unlikely, and rubbish. I guess the purple Teletubby is also gay and evil, as is Barney the Dinosaur. J.K. Rowling has created something that most American moviegoers do not grasp very well- English Humour and Morals. These movies show that anything can be used for bad, or good, whether it is 'magic' or Technology- And are an encouragement for kids to always use any advantages they have to do the right thing. Therefore, the Jerry-Fallwellian idea that kids are badly influenced by the Potter series must be discarded.In the films, these stories are rapidly changing from Kiddie stories, to exquisite interesting young adult mysteries- And I like the way the kids are growing up. What I really enjoyed about this one, is the return of several of my favourite characters. Mad Eye Moody, Padfoot, Remus Lupin, Professor Trelawney, Hagrid, and even Lucius Malfoy and my favourite, Ralph Fiennes as 'He who must be not be named' - Everything about this film is done well, and as always I love the little vignettes at the beginning of each Potter movie, where there is always something that tries to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwart's. I especially liked this one... And the interaction between Potter and his cousin. Eventually Potter will have to have it out with The Dursleys, and this will be something that I will savor when it comes to pass.There are a couple of things that are not explained... That archway? What was that? I suppose there was a reason why there was an Archway in the center of the department of mysteries... And why there was a pointed lack of discussion about it, except for Hermione's passive comment about the voices she could net hear (But we know Harry could hear them).When I saw the first two Harry Potter films, I thought 'He who must not be named was to be the perennial antagonist, like Lex Luthor and Superman. But so far the progress of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's attempts to come back to the land of flesh have been from slightly irritating to very deadly. In this film the malevolence takes full adult form, and Potter deals with it in a mature way. And so it is not just about a silly little kid now... It is about a young man who has been confronted by darkness, who makes the best of the lot he has been given, embraces his friends, and asks all the questions about life any boy who is growing up would ask... And basically, that would be, in Potter's case, 'Am I Turning Bad?'And if this movie, and the books and films based on the books, are filled with bad things, then I suppose Harry Potter would not be asking Dumbledore... 'Am I turning bad?' - So instead of a manual for kids to learn magic spells, I rather see the Potter series as an entertaining way for kids to be influenced in a positive way. Who are the children that read and watch Harry Potter books going to imitate... Harry Potter, or Draco Malfoy?Beginning with Prisoner of Azkeban, the films took a more mature and malevolent turn. I'd say the 3rd movie was the turning, and the ending of Goblet of Fire movie was hideously, fantastically, dark, leading directly to Order of the Phoenix.And so all 4 of those stories set the tone for Order of the Phoenix, and the first half of the movie, I feel Potter's frustration, which is magnified by Professor/Undersecretary of Magic Umbrich. (I love cats, but any woman who has a collection of CAT-PLATES on her wall, er, has got Problems!)It took me about 3 years to realise that I Love these stories, and I almost do not want read the books, because I am used to the stories unfolding the way Chris Columbus told us the first 2... Alfonso Cuar√≥n gave the series a sharp NUDGE into the surreal with Prisoner of Azkeban, Followed by the slap in the face we get from Mike Newell in Goblet of Fire: David Yates had really no problem building on what had gone before, and he reminds us in most forceful way of the events following The Prisoner of Azkeban... So now a momentum has built up, and regardless of who directs the next film, all the pieces are now set in place.... (Except for the Womping Willow, where is the Womping Willow?)My One Complaint is that movies 4 and 5 are desperately Lacking in Quiddich...",10,0,3,13 January 2008
Elysium," 'The Sprawl'
","Neill Blomkamp shows us again his world of parallels, and uses a William Gibsonish approach this time.A small 'Ringworld'«Ç - 'Elysium' orbits the earth, where all of the richest people live in pleasure and luxury - And without ever getting sick.But on earth, it is a scene from 'Skinner's Room' (The short story by William Gibson about 'The Sprawl'), where civilization has no place to go but up and over itself. The World is policed by Robots, and this is the world 'Max' (Matt Damon) grew up in. All his life he has tried to save up enough money to buy a ticket to Elysium, but he himself has succumbed to the fact that this is basically impossible.But the company where Max works, who make the robots, is the same company that built Elysium. And things are not quite as pleasant as they seem up there, 'Delacourt' (Jodie Foster in a great character role) wants unparalleled Martial Powers as the head of Security for the whole habitat. And she sets her aims much higher than just enforcing the 'No People from Earth Allowed' policy.Helping her enforce this is Sharlto Copley as 'Kruger' looking particularly old, he is the one called on to perform any and all unscrupulous acts.Mainly the point of this film is that One Piece of Information can either make the world worse, or make it better for all citizens, not just Elysium. And this information falls to Max, it takes him a while to understand just what he needs to do with it- and as much as he wants to save his own life, he has had a responsibility thrust upon him that he alone becomes uniquely capable of making happen- With the help of a Hacker named Spider.This film shares the Bleak landscapes of District 9 and also Sharlto Copley who is as great a villain as he was a geek in D9, and the only real Threat to Max being able to do what he needs to do. His South Africa heritage comes out well here, along with his two sidekicks.The side-story here is between Max and 'Frey' (Alice Braga), as she gets caught up in the mess as well, but this is just more motivation for Max to do what he needs to do- So as Max had a fairly selfish motive at the beginning of the film (Survive) it becomes more than that.Niell is a great world maker, although I really would not want to live in his vision of the world which has Elysium floating over it.But overall there is the hope that we can prevent it from ever becoming that way.«Ç - 'Ringworld' is a series of books by Larry Niven about a huge habitat orbiting a star 200 light years from Earth, a habitat that is equivalent to the surface of 30 million Earth-Type Worlds, built by a race called Pak. Elysium is a mere fragment of that size, but it's internal surface is very reminiscent of Ringworld.",10,2,3,7 April 2014
Avatar," Call Me Joe
","I don't give a rip if people 'Find this helpful'Not that I didn't totally enjoy this movie, or Terminator before it, but James Cameron needs to do one little thing: Add a writing credit to this film that says 'Based Upon the short story 'Call me Joe' by Poul Anderson'. And maybe even a CO-AUTHOR credit - Because Cameron snagged LARGE amounts of plot - Maybe even some dialogue! How could Cameron do this and NOT know that science fiction readers would NOT recognise a World-Class, Hugo-Award winning story? Even the original 'Day the Earth Stood Still' gave credit to the Harry Bates story 'Farewell to the Master' and THAT was not even as highly recognised as 'Call Me Joe' is, 53 years after it was written.Avatar does not simply use little elements of that short story, ut blatantly uses major plot elements including the very end. These things were NOT created by James Cameron, they were created by a science fiction writer named POUL ANDERSON and these things were created not in 2009 but in 1957. If Cameron thinks that he can just DO this thing and people will not say anything about it, he's mistaken! I know he used it, many other people know it and Cameron himself knows it because practically everything that is in the short story has been either used outright, or referred to in the film.Anybody who has read the Anderson work and then seeing this film, can not afterward say that 'This is a Coincidence' or 'Cameron has just borrowed a few of the things from that story' - No, Nope. Let's list the basic things which are similar:1) A ruined person is given a job 'driving' another body.2) This body gives him full use of his legs - The 'Driver' is Exhilarated, enjoying his new body as MUCH as possible, even razzing his superiors. But the man, who in the story is named Ernest Anglsey, is chiefly most interested in one thing: Survival. This parallels the film in every way possible.3) The ruined person's actual body rapidly deteriorates while the 'avatar' or in the case of the story, 'PsuedoJovian' body gets stronger - This is a MAJOR Plot element used in the film!4) Eventually the ruined man's brain has been moved compleately INTO the PsuedoJovian body!5) In 'Call Me Joe' - this story takes place on a moon of Jupiter and on the Surface of Jupiter. In 'Avatar' - The planet 'Pandora' revolves around a SuperJovian'There had to be a PROCESS where this could happen, in 'Call Me Joe', the machine in which the ruined guy sits is getting feedback from the brain of the 'PsuedoJovian' and wrecking part of the machine, a 'K-Tube' - In this regard 'Avatar' is changed from 'Call Me Joe' - In which a Technician is sent to investigate why the K-Tubes are failing. This includes a two-year jaunt in 'Frozen Sleep' from Earth to Jupiter, just like how 'Avatar' begins, with Sully taking a 5-year trip in Frozen Sleep. Still not convinced? The Short story is told as a narrative by the technician, 'Avatar' is told in a narrative by Sully. The technician 'Cornelius' is baffled, but eventually discovers this: It turns out that Anglsey had been 'writing' himself into the empty Pseudo Jovian Brain the entire time, a brain that was made better than a human brain. So in the end of Call Me Joe, the man discards, happily, his old ruined body - The doctors said he went out with a smile on his face. And this is the EXACT Ending of 'Avatar' Cameron took this storyline, and created a Planet that could store a human mind, a planet where every living thing can biologically interface with every other living thing. Because the TREES are a hive mind of some sort? Not that I do not admit that I like the things Cameron did with this story, but he SHOULD have given Poul Anderson DIRECT credit for this, because as much as I wanted to believe that this was a total coincidence, I cannot believe it NOW after watching this film, Cameron had to have deliberately used it.Now regarding the FILM all I can say is WOW and I apologies for having to include that previous spoiler: it is a very good film, and I would have loved to seen it in 3-D. Seriously, the only thing that annoyed me was Cameron's use of the story without giving credit - The Imagery is Fantastic.It is hard to imagine a planet that lights up at night, it is hard to imagine Live Action blended with an eerie PIXAR style of animation. The earth-based things, people, ships, guns, all LOOK like they are from Earth, but the things that are from Pandora, look like they come from Pandora, especially when the two things are shown together. James Horner creates a great score using elements from Aliens, Titanic and Enemy at the Gates.My Favourite shot is when the Shuttle is first descending into the pit on Pandora, we do not understand the size of the pit until the next shot which reveals a MASSIVE machine digging up the ground.Cameron says a lot about ecology in this film, he shows us the conflict between 'corporate' and 'scientific' and the resulting atrocities that occur. This has even occurred in the US, in our treatment of our Indigenous Population. Most of the things we use for energy today, were life forms in the past - And this concept it explored in the Avatar material 'Unobtanium' - Named so because it probably cannot be obtained.Regardless of Cameron's use of a classic short story without crediting it, I highly enjoyed this. But if Cameron is thinking of any return trips to Pandora, he needs a return trip to the United States Copyright office.",10,2,5,10 May 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Holy ____
","This is a film basically based on two books: 'The Davinci Code' itself by Brown and 'Holy Blood|Holy Grail' by Lincoln/Leigh and Baigent (Teabing). I care not if this film and books are 'sacreligious' - I care not, if the film and books are based on actual history or any fiction or 'hoax'- And I refuse to discuss my personal Faith with anyone who is not willing to just accept a thing for what it is... Be it Fiction, or Non-Fiction Religious or Secular. All I can do, and all I wish to do, is give my personal 2 cents about what this film did for me.As of this time I have not read the book: Which is a plus for me for this film. I was only marginally aware of the concept of Holy Grail vs Holy Bloodline.This film introduces a guy named Dr. Robert Langdon. In Film-Land: We have never met him before, therefore, Akiva Goldsman has created an introduction to the character in the beginning of the film- this is accentuated by the cuts to a murder being committed at the same time.Little time is wasted getting us into the story, it begins the moment Langdon steps foot into the Louvre. Brown's book deals with a secret: In this film we are given the choice about that secret, maybe that same choice is given to us as readers of the book. If the 'Secret' of the film revealed to us is true (in terms of the film only), how are we going to react to it? This question is the basis of the conflict of the film. The activities of the characters in this film are all based on this. Some people are afraid and react in a certain way, others are not afraid but want to use this secret to destroy. Still others are actually curious, and therefore, try to use what little resources they have to attempt to find out what is really happening.These three motivations: Fear, Curiosity and the seeking of Power are intertwined throughout the film: And as each level of the plot is revealed, we are genuinely surprised at several different moments. There are a few places where we can successfully guess what is next, but by that time we are hit over the head with something else.This film is also an Odyssey: Beginning in France, then over to England and Scotland, we see some of the most magnificent locations ever shown in a dramatic film. The shots interior The Louvre are worth seeing, as are the exteriors Scotland.I have heard both Pro and con Tom Hanks as Langdon, and my personal opinion is that of the hair did not work, should have been left curly. I do not know if the Sophie Neveux in the film is acceptable as what she appears as, even after three or four viewings of this film. Sir Ian McKlellan is excellently cast as Baigent/Teabing- And Jean Reno is extremely excellently cast as Captain Bezu Fache. Impressive is Paul Bettany as Silas, and other characters played by Jurgen Prochnow, Alfred Molina are fairly believable- The supporting cast does exactly that... Supports.I could get on my own personal soapbox about the subject of the 'Secret' of this film. But regarding, at least, this rendition of the story, as Ron Howard presents it: We have the same choice as the characters in the film: Fear, Curiosity, or Search for Power. Since it is ridiculous for us as mere viewers of the film to even think about the last choice: We are therefore as viewers only given two choices: Fear or Curiosity.And historically, Fear is the reason for all of the worst acts of Human Beings toward other Human Beings that have ever been recorded, not recorded, or erased from history.Also historically is the fact that Human Curiosity has given the Human Race all of the technological and even spiritual advances we now in this day enjoy: One of those being freedom of religion, another being Film.So I personally accepted Curiosity as my motive for watching the film. In the film, Hanks poses a question: A person that may have the blood of Christ running in their veins... Would that person seek to increase faith on Earth or would they act to destroy it? This film and both of the books that it is based upon is just a Modern-Day Grail Romance, and should be treated as such.",10,1,2,1 February 2007
In Time," Bonnie and Clyde of Time
","Is this another of my Vanishing Reviews, Because I could have sworn I reviewed it right after I watched it.Andrew Niccole (Of Gattica) has written and directed another film in a similar Bleak Genetically-manipulated future: In Gattica, you could not advance in society unless you had been genetically made 'better' - But 'In Time' - Everyone is made perfect. Everybody ages normally, until they reach their peak at Age 25 (an age I guess where we all felt we were at our best) - And then their Clock starts.Everybody is given a year, gratis: But in this future, the only currency is TIME. The cost of a Bus Ride, is 2 hours - One more hour than Justin Timberlake's Mother (Olivia Wilde) has.Justin Timberlake works in a factory where they make devices that store TIME. They pay him in Time - But today, they shorted him, because they did not bother to tell him his quota had gone up. That is the problem with this future, nobody bothers to tell anyone else when things that matter like this suddenly change. So a person who depends on stability for day to day living gets put into a jam when suddenly, it costs more money to live than they have left on their 'clock.' But Timberlake, sees a Rich Man enter the Bar where he hangs out - The man is wasting money with no regard for 'Minutemen' - Crooks who will steal your time. Timberlake protects the hapless guy from Main minuteman Alex Pettyfer (I Am Number 4) and they hide in an abandoned Warehouse. But the man was Henry Hamilton, who was worth Hundreds of Thousands of Years - He only had a hundred years left on his Clock, and he gives it to Timberlake, with the Admonition 'Don't Waste My Time' - Because, people are implanted with a Clock that can either give or receive Time from any other Living person. If a person dies with time on their Clock, that time is gone forever. So Rich Guy Hamilton 'gives' Timberlake ALL of his time save for 5 minutes which he uses to Sit on a Bridge - Timberlake tries to save him, but all that does is put Timberlake's Face on a Camera at a Crime Scene.This starts Timberlake on a little romp where he has to evade not only The Minutemen, but Timekeepers. The first thing Timberlake does is give his best friend 10 years, but his friend drinks himself to death. He then tries to give some to his mother, but Mom could not get on the bus, as they had increased the fare by more than she had. She tries to run all the way, but misses Timberlake by mere seconds. With nobody left to keep him, Timberlake decides to see how the 1% lives - So he takes a cab ride 'uptown' - Where he meets rich man Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and milks him of several hundred grand worth of Time. This impresses daughter Sylvia, and Timberlake gets invited to Weis' little Party for the 1%.But the Timekeepers want to talk to Timberlake as to why he ended up with the last of Hamilton's time, and they crash Weis' party - And so Timberlake grabs a very Goth-Looking Silvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and its the best case of Stockholm Syndrome she ever had.Several Times, Seyfried and Timberlake are left with Mere Seconds to live, but using wits they keep afloat, and eventually beat the 1% and give the 99% some hope - By 'redistributing the wealth' a bit - Seyfried and Timberlake decide to create their own little Stimulus Package when they rob her pop out of the only existing Time-Storage Device that has 1 Million years on it.Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later) is the Time-Cop who is trying to catch Timberlake, Murphy plays the role like he always plays em, makes us believe it.This film is populated with every young actor in Hollywood - Remember, nobody ever ages past 25. So, some of these actors do a great job of making us believe that they are several decades older than they appear.",10,14,21,30 April 2012
Thor," A Good Feeling from Asgard to Midgard
","I never was that much of a Fan of Thor as a Marvel Comics character. I liked him much better in the book 'The Roaring Trumpet' by Fletcher Pratt and L Sprague de Camp, a short story which comprises the first part of 'The Compleat Enchanter' - A book written before World War II. In that treatment, Thor is a big bellowing guy, on the scale of a Bear more than a a European Adonis-Model-Type - who enjoys leaving the imprint of his huge Hammer (named Mjollnir) in the skulls of so many Frost Giants. Mjollnir is the only thing these two characters of Thor have in common: A Huge Hammer that gives Thor his Power.In this film the Hammer is an Asgardian Symbol of Honour, Responsibility, and Worthiness: And so it was given to this film's version of Thor, but he misused his Authority, and Odin took it away and banished him to Earth and also sent Mjollnir there, until such a time Thor proves worthy enough to once again wield it.That is the crux of the story as told in this Film. What we call 'Magic' - A More Advanced Culture would call Technology. And so this film expounds on that idea: Thor is a member of a highly advanced race of beings, called 'the √Üsir', who use the BiFrost 'Rainbow Bridge' to traverse the 'Nine Worlds': Asgard, Mannheim (Or, Midgard), Vanaheim (Where the Vanir live), Jotenheim, and a few other places. Mannheim is our Earth and Jotenheim is where the Frost Giants dwell, and this 'World' has a large bearing on this film. These world are part of Yggdrasil, the 'World Tree' and Bifrost is the bridge wherein the Aesir can traverse the worlds.From WikiPedia:The three worlds above the earth, in heaven:1. Vanaheimr (Vanaheim): Realm of the Vanir 2. √Ålfheimr (Alfheim): Realm of the light elves 3. √Åsgar√∞r (Asgard): Realm of the godsThe four worlds on earth:4. Ni√∞avellir (Nidavellir): Realm of the Dwarfs 5. Mi√∞gar√∞r (Midgard): Realm of man 6. J√∂tunheimr (Jotunheim): Realm of the giants 7. Svart√°lfaheimr (Svartalfheim): Realm of the Dark ElvesThe two worlds below the earth, in underworld:8. Niflhel (Hel): Realm of the dead 9. M√∫spellsheimr (Muspelheim or Muspell): Realm of fireIt should be noted that the Norse 'Hell' is a world of Cold compared to the Judeo-Xtian cosmological model.What I really liked about this film, is that Kenneth Brannagh brought all of this Mythos and laid it out straight at our feet.Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) is an Astrophysicist who discovers the use of Bifrost in our world, and that in our terminology, Bifrost is an 'Einstein-Rosen Bridge' - IE, a Wormhole. The Aesir can manipulate this and effect travel between the Nine Worlds.Chris Hemsworth is Thor, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and Tom Hiddleston is Loki - Thor and Loki are depicted as 'brothers' who grew up together, but Odin had kept a secret from Loki, which eventually became a source of friction. What is remarkable in this story, is the apparent true friendship between Thor and Loki, something which has never been explored in Book or Film regarding these 'gods'.There is a section at the beginning of the film showing the history of the Aesir battling the Frost Giants, and the 'childhood' of Thor and Loki and other aspects of life in Asgard. This portion of the film has excellent CGI, profound music written by Patrick Doyle (Who wrote the music and was also an Actor in Brannagh's 1989 'Henry V'), and gives an impression of great antiquity. The film's basic story is told in two realms: Asgard and Earth, so we have a split storyline.One unexpected face was Rene Russo as Frigga, Odin's wife. Idris Elba is Heimdall (Which is one of my favourite Norse gods) and the great Character Actor Colm Feore plays King Laufey of the Frost Giants.Stellan Skarsg√•rd plays a character named Erik Selvig, another Astrophysist and Mentor to Jane Foster, his character was created for this film and was not previously part of the Marvel Multiverse.As Norse Myth is one of my favourite subjects, I highly enjoyed seeing how Marvel and Brannagh treated the subject, and this film made a huge impression on me.",10,1,3,12 August 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Way Over the Top
","I was so excited to see this film come out, there were some VERY good things in it - We finally get to see Zion. But Zion was not how I envisioned it after Morpheus describes it in 'The Matrix' - We can see that even in the 'City of God' there are still Politics to deal with. Those Politics reveal meatheads that cannot see the facts in front of their faces, and so we have to have a film like this in which Neo has to deal with and mostly work around said Politics.Like The Matrix, most of that had to be said about the film, maybe was already said by the guy who said 'Matrix Reloaded Sucks' - But I don't agree, Matrix Reloaded is a very well made film... There were fights and car chases that we had never envisioned could happen. People standing on ceilings, CGI that seamlessly blended in with practical elements, and of course the Wachowski Brothers trademarked stop-and-rotate filming which I loved in The Matrix and I loved in Reloaded.But the thing that brought me into the film, that interested me, was the ability of Agent Smith to duplicate himself and even take over a Human. So we are set up for the final confrontation between Neo and Smith although it does not happen here. But my complaint with the whole series has to be stated here in this review. And that must include Spoilers, so I apologize in advance for that.At the end of this film, we have 'Three Captains - Three Destinies - Where some might see coincidence, I see Providence' as Morpheus states.And so the three-pronged attack on The Source begins, one crew is destroyed by sentinels in short order, causing Trinity to have to enter the Matrix to fulfill that crew's part of the attack - Meanwhile Neo, Morpheus and The Keymaker enter the Corrodor of Back Doors... With Smith guarding the door to The Source, which is actually the door to The Architect, who lays out the choices for Neo, who opts to save Trinity rather than do what the architect says he must do, as Neo is nothing but a piece of code leftover which must be reinserted back into The Source. This Mimimised Neo greatly in my eyes.So Neo saves Trinity, returns to the Nebuchadnezzar which is destroyed by sentinels.Neo holds up his hand and destroys the sentinels, then passes out. We do not know, at the time, somehow he had ended up in the Train-Man's little pocket universe simulation, we are not introduced to that character at this time. All we know, is that suddenly, Neo is showing he has actual control over the machines in the 'Real World'.This is where I was disappointed, Neo taking out the Sentinels, suggested to me, that the world OUTSIDE THE MATRIX was actually YET ANOTHER COMPUTER CONSTRUCT, IE, a world within a world- Similar to the plot device of The Thirteenth Floor.But this was not the case, and I thought Neo's sudden apparent control over Machines, inexplicable. I was HOPING this was to be shown in Matrix Revolutions, in my mind I thought - Matrix Revolutions is going to have to explain this, and there were SO many places the story could have gone after the end of Reloaded, Reloaded set up so many possibilities, but none of them were explored in the last film... It was just Too Hopeless, although there was some amazing CGI, the story, which up to that point had my interest completely, suddenly started to suffer.So, as good as this film was, it basically took apart everything that was said about Neo in the first film, took away the mystery of who he was, took away his Power, gave Smith TOO MUCH power. There had to have been a better way to tell this story, Wachowski's should have either quit after Matrix, or gone in the direction I was expecting... That the Matrix itself was the bottom of a series of levels of virtual realities, if that had been the story, the Wachowski's could have built something incredible out of that, but they didn't.",10,0,1,28 June 2011
Enemy at the Gates," Krushev with a British Accent
","This film reminds me of John Mackenzie's 'The Fourth Protocol' where we have good English actors who are portraying Russian people, speaking with a British accent (In scenes that are allegedly taking place in Russia).Not that it matters that much, especially in this film: But I do think that an actor like Bob Hoskins would have been able to pull off a Nikita Krushev, especially after all of the characters he has made us believe in the last 25 years.I have the same problems with Ed Harris, not that he was not the perfect actor to portray the German Sniper: He is just so... American.Nevertheless, if you ignore these little irritants, this is a great film, apparently a true story pulled out of a huge book about Russia in WW II: but expanded and dramatized.Jude Law looks as good as any other character part he has taken, whether it is Lemony Snicket, Sky Captain, Joe from AI, or, my favourite, Errol Flynn in The Aviator. This role just adds more to his already huge repertoire of characterizations.The cast of this film is just marvelous, a part for just about all of my favourite character actors. Add to that the set that was built for this little drama to be enacted out on.I like films where details are believable, aka, honest films. Well, the details that Jean-Jacques Annaud decided to show us are in fact the details that are important. It would just have been my personal taste to have the accents done according to country at least, but in retrospect, it did not take away from my enjoyment of the film.",10,3,4,30 September 2007
The Departed," The Best Fiction always has a bit of Real Life mixed in.
","This excellent Scorcese combination of 'Black Mass' and 'Infernal Affairs' combines the semi-true story of Gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, based partly on James 'Whitey' Bulger) and the story of two moles planted in the Boston Police Department, each looking for the other, and their identities hidden from each other until the very end of the story. The Context is basically recapped in the 2015 film 'Black Mass' with Johnny Depp', minus the elements from 'Infernal Affairs' but still retaining the idea of an FBI agent protecting his informant- In whatever underhanded ways he could.Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan seems to be the clean cut Boston Detective, and Leo DiCaprio as 'Billy' as an undercover cop who ironically becomes the most trusted member of Frank Costello's gang, and seems to be the worse off of the two. They both connect to a Police Psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga in a more sexy role than she had in the remake of Manchurian Candidate) who becomes a pivot piece for the plot.There is some great Age Regression for Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello, who takes Sullivan in as a young man and grooms him to become his mole. Meanwhile, 'Billy' as part of his cover is trained by spending time in the Hoosegow.It is known to Costello that there are police informants peppered through his organization, and most of the story is Costello trying to find out who these are, while Billy at the same time tries to protect who he is. Costello charges Sullivan to discover the informants, so basically the who things balance each other out. But the ways these two plot points interact, make this an interesting watch. And of course there are many examples of Scorsese humor dotted throughout in bright red grisliness- Some of these hold up to the burying alive of Billy Batts from Goodfellas.The question is, who's the rat? And who's the real rat? When is a rat not a rat? Sometimes a rat can be two different things.",10,1,2,13 February 2016
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Much better than I remember
","I was reluctant to watch this the first time because of the panning and beating this film got from the critics of the time. But after watching this again, I believe it was totally unwarranted.A lot of work went into this film including one explosion that took seven months to set up for one-shot.The relationship between Sam and Mikaela was made stronger especially on her side, which was my largest complaint about replacing Megan Fox in dark of the moon.I hadn't realized that Peter Cullen has always been the voice of Optimus prime, I had been assuming that they chose a different actor that was able to emulate that great voice. But this is actually Optimus prime.And the state of the art for this film supersedes the first transformers film by an exponential factor. They were able to do things here that made the CGI much more believable, also the use of practical effects in a lot of places makes it very difficult to see what is CGI and what is not. Sometimes when a transformer was in the scene, it would be a real prop as was the case with bumblebee. Also parts of Megatron.The story itself was based on certain aspects of the 1984 transformers movie.It is too bad that the public reacted so negatively to this, so much hard work went into it. And it brings in new auto bot characters, some of which continued through the franchise.",10,3,5,15 April 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," New Concept: Tom Cruise as the Anti-Hero
","In the first five minutes of this film, I had to be thinking, 'What a jerk!'. This is an alien concept for Cruise, who is always the 'Competent Man'.For the next couple of hours, we see a believable transformation of the jerk into a hero- And nobody will ever know it.Tom Cruise is 'Major Cage' - A Hypocrite, and a coward. Who is apparently getting his just deserts: arrested, demoted, and sent into the front line ranks of doomed soldiers using the very same equipment which he had told all of BBC was 'Winning the War', only he has never used it, does not even know how to turn off the 'Safety', and to top it off, it's not as much of a boon as he had insisted on British TV.More quietly, we see references to a 'Full Metal B____' aka Emily Blunt as 'Rita', who had single handedly won a previous major engagement with 'Minimal Training' plus a huge Sword.We really don't understand what is happening until Cruise and 'Company J' (Equipped with Drill Instructor Master Sergeant Farell played by Bill 'Game Over' Paxton) hit Normandy Beach- And then we get to see what these 'Mimics' really are.But that is not the real fun, as Cruise, who is now 'Private' Cage, takes out an unusual Mimic and himself in the process, only to wake up... On the previous day.There have been a lot of films dealing with aspects of Time lately: 'Predestination' of course, based on Robert A Heinlein's excellent short story 'All you Zombies' which deals with the famous 'Grandfather Paradox'- 'What if one were to go back in time and kill their own grandfather?'. Then, there is Relativistic Time-compression and expansion with 5th Dimensional cross time communication in Chris Nolan's 'Interstellar', which could be seen as a rehash of 'Contact' or an Homage to '2001: A Space Odyssey'.But this is a science fiction/War Movie version of 'Groundhog Day', Doug Liman creates a somewhat believable excuse as to why it is happening.With each iteration Cruise experiences, he changes from Arse to Hero- He has no choice really. If it had not have happened to him? He'd continue to be the jerk he was, most likely. But with each repetition that original jerky character falls by the wayside.In short order, Cage discovers that he has something in common with Ms Blunt's 'Rita', when she tells him something odd on the battlefield: 'Find me when you wake up'.What does she mean?",10,1,4,1 February 2015
American Gangster," A dance between two competent men
","Richie Roberts: a good cop, tries to do his job, gets punished for it.Frank Lucas: worked for and was beloved by Bumpy Johnson, takes Bumpy's place but forgets the standards that Bumpy taught him.This film is a true period piece of a time that I lived through and remember, I especially remember the wonderful soul music, culminating in 'Across 110th St.' which is played in the center of the film, as a reminder that this film is very similar to that earlier 70s Blaxploitation film.The costuming is perfect and period specific, the hair, The language.Both Richie and Frank are unaware of each other's existence until one fateful episode involving a chinchilla coat. From that moment on the two characters inevitably spiral into each other, indeed, there is no way to avoid the collision of these two forces of nature.Even as two members of exact opposite races, these men know and understand each other when they finally meet and collaborate.As far as some of the other dramatized events, we don't know the veracity of these incidents, I think the story was told as truthfully as could possibly be told. There is a lot of irony in this story, and Ridley Scott has a finely tuned idea of how to use this in filmmaking.I have seen video of the real Richie Roberts, and Russell Crowe does a great job with his looks and mannerisms, as does Denzel Washington with Frank Lucas.This film is peppered with great character actors who do their jobs wonderfully, especially the character actors of colour. Josh Brolin picks up the mantle of a true American scumbag, Bob Leuci, but the fictionalized portrayal renders a name change for the character, 'Detective Trupo', not quite 'Prince of the City'. Brolin's character becomes a thorn in the side of both Roberts and Lucas, who both provide sharp sticks up Trupo's fundament when he gets too nosy.This film portrays the biggest cop-bust of all time when 2/3 of the New York City drug enforcement department was sent to the hoosegow. This is of course history, so it's not really a spoiler. You just have to see how Ridley Scott provides this historical takedown: during the climax of the film it happens from every direction possible.A lot of research went into this film to make it look and sound exactly right. And the documentary style coupled with peppered flashbacks draws us into the story.There is an extended version that I have seen a few times that expands some of the more delicate or violent scenes, but the theatrical version provides just about the same amount of information.",10,0,0,29 June 2020
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Thorin becomes Smaug vs. Galadriel, the Action Hero
","This entry of the Jackson Tolkien Films is the most difficult to get a handle on. Mostly because the events depicted only filled a few chapters in 'The Hobbit'. But what most people forget, is that these events are meticulously revisited in the Appendices of 'Lord of the Rings' and there are more to these events than in JRR's first Middle Earth novel.For one thing, Gandalf joins a 'Council of White Wizards' mentioned in the last chapters of The Hobbit, which confronted 'The Necromancer' and drove him out of Dol Guldur. Saruman is not named as one of these, but those events are also in the Appendices of Lord of The Rings. Which is where it speaks of Saruman telling Gandalf the lie that The One Ring had rolled down the River Anduin into the Ocean, Saruman in fact had been looking for it for a while, but Bilbo's unexpected possession of it put a kink in his plans for it.This 'Council of White Wizards' is shown early on in the Film, and in this treatment, includes Gandalf, Radagast, Galadriel, Elron and Saruman- Who had all come to the aid of Gandalf. This is where Galadriel 'Adamanty' drives 'The Necromancer' from Mirkwood- At first I thought using only 'Nenya', the 'Ring of Adamant', but after repeated viewings, she is definitely also holding the Light of Earendil, which as you remember, she gave to Frodo in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Here, she is shown with all of the potential dark power needed to perform an ejection of Sauron, protected by that light just as Frodo and Sam were in Shelob's Lair. I wonder if Galadriel's Wrath can be viewed as the same as Burt Lancaster, armed with a Machine Gun, shooting down Japanese planes in 'From Here to Eterenity'? Both show each character digging into their inner selves, pulling out power from deep within. Whether this power comes from a Machine Gun or 'Nenya', one of the Three Elven Rings, is inconsequential. Both have the power, but it is the person who must choose to use these as weapons. Both scenes show each character differently than they normally are.In the extended version of 'Desolation of Smaug' it is shown that Gandalf has found Thorin's Father Thrain in Dol Guldur. This also is recollected in The Appendices, with the fact that he had the last Dwarf Ring.So the question is, how do you tell a good story out of the few remaining chapters of the book? You do it by mining all of the facts out of the Lord of the Rings Appendices that relate to this time and side-load them into your story. The actual 'Battle of the Five Armies' is not experienced from the reader's POV in The Hobbit, it is told after the fact. But here, all of the things that led up to it can be shown.The only real added thing was Jackson's Addition of the She-Elf 'Tauriel' (Evangeline Lilly), who I had already said was pleasant to look at, especially when she lights up like Arwen while healing Fili, the whole thing with the added character and a kind of romantic thing with Fili does not deter me from enjoying this one bit. We know that Legolas and Gimli found an unbreakable connexion, not just in the Lord of the Rings Films but in the books as well, in fact they take the very last Ship into the West. Would JRR Roll in his grave? Maybe, maybe not, if he understood how movies are made. I have to question, would a treatment of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, done page by page and scene by scene from the books, be any better? Consider that in Lord of The Rings, one story is told, then it backs up and tells another story that happened at the same time. In a book, that might make those events easier to follow, but in a film, to show them all happening at once is better.So Legolas and Tauriel take a side trip to Gundabag? Maybe the book does not have those characters doing that, but we do know that Gundabag and Angmar were part of this story and with Lord of the Rings years later.But the part of this film I love is the depiction of The Madness of Thorin, who, after Smaug is killed, takes on his personality, even repeating phrases Smaug used. What will it take to break through that madness? Thorin has to do it himself, but he has always had the Loyalty of the other 12 Dwarfs and Bilbo.The Highlight of course is Billy Connolly as Dain, asking very politely if a an army of Men and Elves would Sod Off, Before being attacked by Creatures that seemed to have come from 'Arrakis' in Frank Herbert's Universe.The Blending of CGI with Live Action and Miniatures is mind boggling. THIS is where Jackson Excels.If 'The Silmarillon' could be made into a film or set of films, would Jackson do it? Moreover should he do it? I think so, if only to create a continuity of look and feel of Middle earth. New Zealand really is Middle Earth on Earth. Of course, I may add more when the Extended cut comes out. This film was in fact much too short. Finally, I want to add a hearty middle earth 'finger' to all of the trolls who are downvoting every positive review.",10,8,17,24 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Death of Star Wars
","... Kind of like, 'The Heat Death of the Universe' - Meaning, it's Hopeless.I told George Lucas in my review of Epi-Dose II (dose of Sleeping tablets) that I was sorry, I do not like dishes of large steaming piles of Doo Doo, even when served on a silver platter of CGI.That goes double for this high-piled steaming hot platter of 'Dooku.' Except for this addendum: 'Most People Dig the Smell of Their Own' - This theory also applies to Artistic Endeavors - Most people like what they do, they even save the scribblings they did as a Child. I'll bet Lucas does. Or Did. That's why his original idea for Hans Solo was a big Frog Man. That's why, one of his friends got him to change it. And why that character Worked.Lucas had Nobody to challenge him when he made huge mistakes making these three so-called movies.That's why this is the worst of the lot. Because by this time Lucas has himself totally deluded that he's making a stylistic masterpiece. Well, I've got news for you, George: You need to start looking at your works more Objectively like an outside person would look at it, to see just what garbage you have created.Now, I can pick this film to pieces, but I would just be repeating RedLetterMedia's Harry Plinkett, who already did that-Step by Step and in great detail.So what I am leaving here, is my immense feelings of Sadness over the total and complete death of Star Wars. And this was the final movie that killed it.Even though Star Wars was resurrected in Legoland and on The Cartoon Channel, 'The Clone Wars' which is a stupid thing to make a cartoon story about, but hey it makes money right?Yah that's it - It Makes Money - It's a MONEY GENERATOR for Lucas. Pretty Soon, Lucas will be the corporate entities he hated when he was making the original Star Wars. He already is that actually.So what is going to happen, is that Lucas will leave behind a Corporation that will dictate to us that Star Wars I-III were GOOD Movies 'because they made money' - Which is only true because they held hostage the original Fans of Star Wars who MADE him that money in the first place.This Movie is the Final Insult to all true original fans of Star Wars - The guys, Like ME - Who stood in line for hours to see Star Wars in 1977. I saw it five times, how many times did you go to the theatre to see this? I'm asking you, the other 'new' fan of Star Wars who says that they LIKE this movie. Well, did you, WOULD YOU, stand in line, in the RAIN, for six hours just to get a seat in the worst part of the theatre at the MIDNIGHT show? Would you do that for Epi-dose III?I'm guessing, you would not do that, and that you never went back into the theatre for a second viewing. Or a Third, or Fourth, 5th 6th 7th 8th - Some people saw the Original Star Wars up to 50 to 60 times. Would you stand behind your assertion that this is a GOOD movie, by showing THAT MUCH dedication? Because it DID NOT HAPPEN. Not for Episode I, II or III.Because it happened in 1977 and then again in 1979, but it id NOT happen in 1997, 2002, or when THIS moovie came out. Did it?Because if people HAD liked this one as much, and if this movie WAS as good as the original 1977 Star Wars - Then there would be practically NO bad reviews in here at all. But this can be easily Proved by the Demographics on IMDb:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/ratingsWhich does not reflect the publics feelings about the original Movie in 1977 - At which time it would have gotten a MUCH higher rating than it is getting now, and as you can see, the SHARP incline of people who LIKE 'Episode IV' - Compared to Ep III, which is Heavily weighted by people, like me, who hated it.",1,1,2,28 February 2012
Shooter," 'The Gunny'
","What makes a good film is honesty. What makes honesty is reality... believability. This film is one of those in which you can say... 'That COULD happen.' It is an adventure flick so you have to stretch it, but it is there within grasp. According to the tech expert they hired for all things guns, a shot from about a mile is possible, but with results more severe than we see in this film: And that is all that can be said without making it a spoiler.An example of this kind of film is 'Seven Men from Now' by Budd Beotticher, we believe the Randolph Scott character: That he is lightning fast, although this is not shown, just the effect. In this picture, we believe in the Swagger character. How did they do that, endear him to the viewer? Well, with a simple thing called HOMAGE.For guys who like depictions of sergeants yelling loudly, what does the word GUNNY mean to us?It took me 2 viewings to obtain the significance of Mark Wahlberg's characters NAME: Bobby Lee Swagger. Not that Wahlberg yells loud at anyone in this film... It is what he represents. In the scene where Wahlberg and Pena meet the Levon Helm character, Helm calls Wahlberg 'Gunny.' Although The real Gunny's first name is Ronald, we got a guy that could BE a younger version of 'The Gunny' shooting his way through the flick. At what time did I start thinking about R Lee Ermy? I don't know, but it happened twice. So I figure that this was intentional Homage to The Gunny, who is great at shooting watermelons- So I had to believe that there was an intentional connection there.This man that Wahlberg is portraying does not look like R Lee Ermy, but he is 'The Gunny' and like his namesake, is a master of all guns and sniping scenarios and there is just enough tech in the film to allow us to believe what we see.What we have to believe is that Swagger is a sharp operator: Thinking several moves ahead, covering himself and dealing with it when fat Philly cops get the drop on him. The way this is filmed, what we see as viewers is what Bobby Lee sees. We see things that could be significant, we just don't know what the significance is. And where Fuqua kicks us soundly in the ass is that we see all the things that Wahlberg sees, but the card-house collapses so rapidly that all we can do is watch Wahlberg surviving and then later wreaking vengeance.I liked this almost as much as that remake of The Italian Job- Same kind of vengeance tale, except that I hated the bad guys in this flick much more than Edward Norton, who is hard pressed nowadays to play evil guys- He had better luck in The Score playing a heartless M-Fer. The guys in this film make Norton's crooks look like Weenie Roast MC's.. These are well you have to use the word that starts with F. These guys are just F_____D, not to cause anyone to be offended by the word, but just as definitive descriptions of these guys.what makes this film refreshing on top of the complete vileness of the crooks, is the level and amount of practical effects used. Not up to Tony Scott's level with exploding barges, Antoine Fuqua is on his way with this style of film-making. And this director leaves his stamp on us- Give him some scripts like the ones Scott has done well with and this guy could do a lot.The cast in this is pretty choice, especially Danny Glover and Ned Beatty... But the best shock is out of the blue, Elias Koteas, with a receding hairline... playing the crook of crooks, and we are satisfied when he is dealt with. actually, I was surprised to even see the guy... so far from the guy with the hockey stick in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or even the cripple from 'Almost an Angel'I always rate these things by how much my butt was kicked the first time I saw it... And although there are a few little things in the flick which bother me after the 4th viewing, overall, I was convinced, even the 3rd time I saw it. Lately, if a film stands up to at least three subsequent viewings, it is one that goes in the movie collection. That's is why I can recommend to anyone who likes explosions, this film is worth the investment of a couple of your hours. Especially for the last thing I have to say about it: Kate Mara. I don't know where she came from, but if I see her name on something else, I'll watch it for certain.",10,0,3,6 August 2007
Rango," This is the Proper Use of George Lucas' ILM
","As much as I loathed the Star Wars I-III Fiascos, because of overbloated CGI and No Substance, I LOVE this moovie for the same reason. Not because of 'No Substance' - There IS substance here. There is a Cleverly Written by John Logan story which was fleshed out by some very good Computer animators - Possibly the same ones that worked on SW: Episodes I-III except that their services were good and proper HERE. The characters were brought to life by incredible Voice Talents: Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty - Alfred Molina - and the great Bill Nighy - And many many more.This movie works like Warner Brothers cartoons from the 30's through the 60's worked. It works cos it is a nod to Directors like Chuck Jones and I Freleng. Early Hanna-Barbera (Not Later H-B). Walter Lantz. it is a nod to over 70 years of Cartoon Cleverness.THIS kind of movie is what the CGI is for-It's an artistic Medium. Meaning, Gore Verbinski used it as a Palette and Paint Brush.Because, it does not pander to little Kids. Movies (Star Wars I-III) that are designed to (Star Wars I-III) accommodate little kids (Star Wars I-III) always end up being insulting to the same kids (And to the adults who bring the kids). It's because all of the best cartoons were made to be funny for ADULTS. And that is what we have here, a cartoon made to amuse adults, made funny for adults, and enjoyable by adults. Except for one problem: It is not a cartoon.It is - I don't Know what it is! It's not a Movie is it? Except that it was put onto film and run in Theatres... But it was not MADE on any film medium. This was all done on the best computers using the cleverest programmers and most talented animators in their respective fields. But FILM it is Not - More like 'Computer Created Entertainment.'This CGI cartoon references other top hitters like Chinatown (water theft), and the appearance of CGI Clint Eastwood as the 'Spirit of the West' in a scene that mirrors a scene from Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End- This film - I don't know what else to call it because this is not really a film. It's all Digital, but it was shown in Movie Theatres. Well, this Huge Computer Environment-Based Entertainment which was SHOWN in Theatres, made fun out of all kinds of movies that were made on Film.And that is what makes it great. It's a new direction for animation. Because it's not impossible imagery blended in with real life action and actors... It is completely imaginary... Which makes it real in a sense.In a way, it is film, because some of the animations used Motion Capture techniques - Some direct motion capture, and other keyframe animations that were created alongside an actor's filmed movements. So, it was all character driven, Just like Gollum in Lord of the Rings - But now, instead of just one character being CGI, they all are. And believable too-Because of the shunning of Symmetry. Even Bug's Bunny's face as perfectly symmetrical in those old cartoons, but here, Rango's face is like Johnny Depp's face - A Human face, even though Rango is a Lizard, Non- Symmetrical. And also with the other Lizards, Mice, Field rats, Foxes, Turtles, and Clit Eastwoods that were in this... Film.I loved this from start to finish, and this is the direction I wanna see CGI going in.",10,4,6,28 February 2012
Prometheus," A Dash of DNA and Half a Brain
","What makes this movie great is the concept that even with technological advancement, people are inherently stupid - Ergo Logan Marshall-Green (Charlie Holloway's) remark about anyone with a dash of DNA and half a brain being able to create life.As with the first Alien film, where there was one and only one intelligent person (Ripley) on the crew who saw the danger of allowing an unknown alien life-form into the ship, the 17 Members of The Prometheus are mostly dumb even though they are Geologists and Biologists (Whose stupidity caused them to become the first victims of mutated earthworms).But some people are not stupid, and other people simply make the wrong choice. Even others who are not actually human are simply 'following orders' as with the case of David 8 (Michael Fassbinder, Magneto from X- Men first Class) - Who, as the indentured servant robot David would rather be T. E. Lawrence. But in fact he is bound to do everything Peter Weyland (Guy Pierce) commands him to do-Until in fact released from that contract by Weyland's death.Basically what we have here is a story of Men trying to be Gods on several different levels, or trying to steal fire from Olympus and having to pay the consequences. In the opening 'creation' scene I do not believe the 'Engineer' was left on Earth with the blessings of the crew of the flying saucer we see leaving the vicinity. But it is clear that these beings later interacted with people due to the 'chariots of the gods' evidence found by Dr. Shaw (Noomie Rapace), an alignment of planets oddly similar to the planetary system shown at the beginning of Alien, identified as LV-426 in Aliens. This moon is identified as LV-223.This story is magnificently filmed and directed, using a minimum of CGI, and Weta Digital at that - And so the landscape of LV-223 looks wholly real. The only thing that bothers me, is why did The Prometheus have such High-Tech computers and gear, but the Nostromo, a ship from a later time, have tape, paper-clips and chewing gum with Computers that look like IBM PC 8088's? Obviously in 1979 the computer tech shown was top of the line, but I just wish Filmmakers, when dealing with future stories, would use some imagination, so that High Tech PCs will not look like Anachronisms 32 years after the film is made.Other than that, story. We know that most or all of the crew of the ship must needs be killed in horrible ways during the course of the film. But to see such idiocy... We would think that Humans of the late 21st Century would develop a sense of caution especially in space. What occurs in this film is basically a bumbling, inept comedy of errors which results in ironic tragic deaths. The basic Tenet of 'Don't Touch anything that you do not understand' or 'Do NOT Open Doors' should be a given. In a potentially hostile environment, you simply don't run amok opening doors and Vases full of 'Make-Me-An-Alien' Juice. You DO NOT try to pet an Alien-ised Earthworm as if it is a pet CAT! And you really, really NEVER leave your group in an unknown place, unless you know exactly the way out. I accept this movie as a lesson that Stupidity has its own, permanent sentence: Death.Even the 'Engineers' - Maybe were trying to 'Clean Up' an Exxon Valdez oil spill of their own: But the contagion of Stupidity must have affected them as well.As a warning, this film is great: As a Prequel to Alien, it is wholly acceptable. The Music of Marc Streitenfeld is excellent, including the riffs from the original Alien. The little stylistic influences on the production design by H. R. Giger was a great 'Almost-Alien' - Or, because this was LV-223, perhaps things happened differently than they did on LV-426. Because we KNOW that the Xenomorph will take on characteristics of its host life-form: Human, Dog (Or Cow if you watch Alien 3 Directors Cut), Predator.Needless to say, this happened on a different corner of the Galaxy as did the events leading up to Alien. Now that know there are as many designs for creatures mutated from Host life-forms as there are stars in the sky, perhaps some of these can be exploited in Movies about them. As far as this film goes, it paves the way for that to happen. But I REALLY want to follow where Noomie and Fassbinder's head went, after leaving that place. It was excellent to see one of those ships in working condition. NOW WE KNOW, who was piloting the ship in Alien, was not as non-human as they originally appeared.The only other thing I do not like, is that this movie appears to be targeted, with hundreds of verbatim 1-star reviews: Obviously from the same person.",10,16,35,17 September 2012
Wonder Woman," Gal Godot tells us about that picture in 'Dawn of Justice'.
","I loved the first impression of Diana Prince from Dawn of Justice. She had the look and the attitude, stood up to Bruce Wayne, and had the general appearance of competency. I've seen this actress in other films and this is who she is.But in this film, we see there was a time this was not so, she was not even allowed to train with the rest of the Amazon Women. Even after she did become the best of the Amazons, she was still kind of goofy. I enjoyed that stark contrast from the woman in Dawn of Justice.Of course, it took Chris Pine, who was still channeling his own goofy version of Kirk, to help define the Princess of the Amazons.And their interaction was what got me interested in this story. Imagine a World War I Soldier stumbling into an invisible island, full of Gorgeous Women who kill off an entire Nazi regiment? They have no idea what the world is about, and they send their Princess, actually Diana is more than just a princess as we learn later- They send this Princess out into a world she knows nothing about, so there is a short time where we see Diana continuously breaking protocol for women allowed in the early 20th Century. It was an opportunity for various Faux Pas, and well played. Also, she redeems herself nicely.But she sets herself an agenda based on the wrong impression of who the Bad Guy actually is. She has determined, without knowledge, that it must be a German General. Because she has no concept of deceit or trickery, this original 'virgin' Wonder Woman has never been exposed to that, and it's a problem that Pine's character 'Steve Trevor' teaches her how to deal with.Lynda Carter's version of Wonder Woman was enjoyable in a campy sort of way, but that version of WW never dealt with an important facet of the character: Her Immortality. And, in the Justice League comic books, there are only two immortals that are constantly in the center of things: Superman and Wonder Woman. I refer everyone to the wonderful Alex Ross illustrated 'Kingdom Come', which better defines the relationship between Kal-El and Diana Prince.But this film is 'The Secret Origin of Wonder Woman', who she was, who she is, where she came from, and her first love affair, although never Requieted. And IMDb's spell checker needs to be fixed to allow the word 'Requieted'. Unrequieted. Requieted.This film is not as dark and ominous as Batman V Superman, maybe it should have been. This is the DC version of Hydra, the Germans have a secret factory that makes a gas that makes Mustard Gas look like Nitrous Oxide.But all of the wonderful character actors in this are cast well, especially Danny Houston. And I haven't seen Connie Nielsen since 'Gladiator', she's aged well and commands her role. Robin Wright is the Amazon who teaches Diana.These DCU movies have been panned hard, especially Dawn of Justice, and I've seen some very unfair #FakeReviews here, many of them verbatim duplicates of each other. It's doubtful that any of the people who made 1-star reviews have ever stepped foot in a theater. Still, last I looked, the rating for this film was standing up to the incredibly ridiculous bashing it has been taking from the #Fakes.So I say this, if you are a real person, a DC Comics fan, a woman, or just anyone who doesn't waste their life in Reddit r/TheDonald or 4chan/b, you'll like this, I've interviewed many people who watched this, and they unanimously liked it a lot. We can't let Bots and Trolls tell us anything about Hollywood, let them watch The Apprentice, it's the only thing their mentality can grasp. Even comic books are over their heads.",10,13,28,11 August 2017
The Wolverine," The 1982 Mini-Series finally on Film
","This film deserved much better than it got, I think this was one of the most true X-Men related films of them all. To the Boneheads who are spouting 'Who Wrote This?' - Well, blame Chris Claremont and Frank Miller.I've got a copy of that first Wolverine Mini-Series, original printing.If you take this story and strip out the Mechanized Silver Samurai and Viper alterations, it's that exact story. The main characters are all there: Yukio,Mariko, Viper, Shingen, The Silver Samurai, and The Black Hand (Later referred to as 'The Hand' in the books).There are also elements from early 90's Wolverine arcs, as Wolverine, when he had been stripped of Adamantium by Magneto in X-Men (Vol II) #25 and Wolverine #75, he wandered the world carrying the Sword of The Yashida Clan, which is shown in this film - A Sword made out of Metal from a Meteor, which Wolverine used to incapacitate the evil 'Bloodsport/Bloodscream' later on in the series and later entrusted back to the Human Silver Samurai.There is even a nod to 'Cyber' - An evil Mutant who was completely encased in Adamantium, who was the only enemy Wolverine really feared- Who was killed in Wolverine #100, his Adamantium leeched by Tyler Summers (Cyclop's Grandson from his son Cable) which he intended to put back into Logan but Logan refused to go through the bonding process and this reverted his genes and gave him an animal-like appearance.I don't remember the time-line much, it has after all been 30 years. Around that same time Professor X's son, Legion, went back in time to kill Magneto but kills Professor X instead, causing the 'M'kraan Crystal' of the Shi'ar to crack, bending reality, thus causing the 'Age of Apocalypse', an Alternate Timeline where it was all changed: And the Goal of that X-Men, led by Magneto, was to repair the M'kraan Crystal. This arc was done over 6 months worth of Alternate X-Men titles.Eventually all these arcs lead up to 'Days of Future Past': And indeed, there is a huge reference to this at the end of the film.If anyone had followed the 1988 (Volume II) Wolverine, set in 'Madripoor', they would remember two fellows, Roughhouse and Bloodsport who hounded Wolverine incognito as 'Master Patch' - And so I initially thought that this rendition of 'Viper' (Svetlana Khodchenkova) was a female version of Bloodsport, as Bloodsport was the only enemy that could suck out Wolverine's Healing factor. And, as Bloodsport/Scream's goal was to suck all of the life out of Logan, this is apt as the elder head of the Yashida Clan takes on this goal.But that was not the case, although Viper's Ability to weaken Logan's Mutant Healing factor was similar to Bloodsport/Scream, she was her own villain with her own agenda.As far as the film, this was the best X-Men related film since 2000, and as much as I liked 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' I like this one much more: Because none of the other films really got into who Logan really is, the fatalistic, tired of living Wolverine- Who although too tired to live, and not caring about much, because so much had been taken from him, he still fights as hard as he can.And THAT is why I loved the Comic Book Series, and why I like this installment of the films. Because, in their own way, Marvel is pulling all of the best story arcs and sticking them into these movies.And everything looks very good here, Hugh Jackman doesn't look much different than in the other films. This 'Weakened Wolverine' was an interesting twist, allowed us to get to the dark aspects of the character.",10,2,4,24 December 2013
Iron Man," Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man
","After a couple of almost-flops by Marvel Studios, I was worried that this film would not be as good as the X-Men Franchise or the Spider-Man Franchise. But that is all it was, worry. From the very first scene, I was convinced that Robert Downey JR was Tony Stark.This being set in a decade far from the Vietnam War years where Iron Man had his birth, they altered the origin story just enough to fit into the 2008 time-frame of this film. That, and the emergence of Computer Technology that he Original stories did not have access to. Other than those slight changes, this film chronicles the Origin of Iron Man in almost the same way the original comic book stories had been written.Rather than being captured by Vietnamese, Stark is caught by a group called 'The Ten Rings' - Which refers to Iron Man's ultimate nemesis, The Mandarin. And although he does not appear in this film, we do feel his presence hidden deep in the story.Faran Tahir (The Captain of 'The USS Kelvin' from 2009's 'Star Trek') is Raza, one of the Mandarin's Hands who has been collecting Stark's weapons in the Middle East. Shaun Taub is 'Yinsen'-A Kind man from the city of Gulmira, who has saved Stark from that piece of Shrapnel hanging poised to enter his heart.Just as in the Comic, Stark uses his own weapons to build the first Iron Man suit and he kicks his captor's arses, and the way this was filmed, was that the director Jon Favreau re-created some of the most notable frames and poses from that first Origin Story.What makes this film remarkable, is the perfect marriage of CGI and Practical effects. This was done so well, that it is impossible to tell where the elements actually switch.Even Stark's Malibu Home is a CGI creation, but as Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) looks out toward the ocean from Stark's home, the CGI aspects of the shot are totally invisible.Jeff Bridges is Jeremiah Stane, who has an agenda that we only learn about toward the end of the film. Terence Howard created 'Rhody' who would later become War Machine. This role was taken over by Don Cheadle in Iron Man II and he played it as Terence had laid down.Favreau had to put over 30 years of Iron Man into a two-hour movie, choosing just what to include must have been difficult. This film ends with an epic fight between Iron Man and WarMonger, something which happens much later in the comic book stories.Stark's Butler 'Jarvis' is actually an A.I. built into his home, this is another difference between the classic comics and this film.The main tension is between Stark and 'Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow). This is also the first appearance of 'Agent Coulson' (Clark Gregg), a SHIELD agent who appears in several more of these Movies. Favreau himself plays 'Happy Hogan,' Stark's Chauffeur.And all trough this film are little hints that The Avengers are going to Assemble, soon.",10,0,2,23 August 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Connecting 'Superman II' to Doomsday
","I've been gone for a while, and this was one of the first films I have seen for a few months. As always, I rate not by my faulty sense of how good or bad a film is, but by how much I enjoyed it. And, despite some huge problems, I really did enjoy this.As with Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen', we have a painted canvas that tells a story - Not as well as he told Watchmen, but as well as he could make it, with the mess he was handed.And by Mess I mean, why on earth was the 'General Zod' story line from Superman II resurrected for Man of Steel? I don't think the Zod story ever was told in Classic Superman comics, and it was not a good story especially since Richard Donner was removed as Director for it - Simply so that Menaham Golan would not have to pay Marlon Brando another 10 million dollars.But somehow Zod reappeared in Man of Steel. That was the worst part of that film as well.I have been a fan of Superman and a reader of comics since I was 5 years old, all through the 60's, and there were some great stories told back then. But one thing about the Batman of that era, he never used a gun, he never even touched them. So in the 80's when a Machine-Gun toting Batman appears (even though they were only in his Batmobile), I was shocked. The Batman from Chris Nolan's latest trilogy did not use them, at least not that much.But this Batman in Dawn of Justice, is an Angry Batman. And a Batman who will use guns, and even kill people with them.This film starts mainly with the battle of Zod and Kal-El seen from Bruce Wayne's perspective, which gives us an interesting view of what was happening underneath. Ben Affleck did a great job, an aging, angry Batman. being manipulated by Lex Luthor, but not knowing it yet.Many people have said this film lacked a narrative structure, and it is true. The story is told visually, much like Watchmen was, but lacking Watchmen's great Narration as heard from Rorshach and Dr Manhattan, two very different people telling the same story. In Dawn of Justice, it's much the same way: The story is shown from Clark's view as well as Bruce's and even Lois.I highly encourage anyone who has not seen this to skip any theatrical versions and go straight to the extended version, which explains much more about the underlying Metahuman stories.While Bruce is nodding off at one point, is he visited by a Metahuman? He sees a man, who says it is 'too soon'- But is it a dream? I am very curious about that, Zack Snyder is very good with little hints like this. I don't know what that meant, but I suppose in Justice League we will find out.But the breakout performance here is by Gal Godot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, and neither Batman nor Superman know who she's with. She was by far the best Wonder Woman of any Film or TV show, an actress that did not have to go far to really look and act the part. The one good thing Zack has done with this film is effortlessly merging one of the most popular Superman stories (The Doomsday saga) with the Zod story or Superman II. Zack always does well with films based on Graphic Novels or Comics, and this is no exception. And it stands up to multiple viewings.I know that they are doing Justice League now, and I'll be very curious to see that. This is one series of films that has to be finished and not left half-told. I just want to see exactly how Zack resolves the issues we are left with. Will he return to a more Comic-based script, or will some writer decide to mix it all up again?Nevertheless, I enjoyed this quite a bit regardless of the tarring it got from the less talented writers called 'critics'.",10,2,4,22 July 2016
Blade Runner," Tears in the Rain
","This movie is as dark and foreboding as Ridley's earlier 'Alien' - Naturally, because Syd Mead also did a lot of the production design. And he used everything he could get his hands on to build an eerie cityscape - Including, ironically, the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, which was star Harrison Ford's ride in the SW Original Trilogy.I've heard many Philip K Dick purists pound this film, because it changes some things from the Book 'Do Androids Dream of Dlectric Sheep' on which this film is based. - But what those people probably don't know, is that Philip K Dick himself approved of the film-Especially the dark look which he claimed was exactly what he was going for. Philip himself understood that written works rarely can be filmed as written, from Gone with the Wind to Lord of the Rings, filmmakers are constrained for time. To tell a 500 page book in 2 hours running time is difficult.So even as Ridley Scott changed some of the science and mechanics regarding 'replicants' and altered a bit of the character interaction, he did maintain the spirit of the novel - Which is, Do things we create, which appear Human, actually become valid living beings - Do they have souls, and more important, do they have a Spirit? This is explored in this film.'I Think, therefore I am.' Eventually, mankind will build a computer capable of passing the Turing Test, and when that happens, will we treat that invention as a slave? Do I treat my Home Computer as a kind of Slave? Actually they way I see it, my home computer always takes on characteristics of myself. So in a way, my home Desktop and my Laptops, are living breathing beings.I loved the Narrated version - Mostly cos thats the way I saw it originally, and the removal of the narration track, kind of ruins it for me, it's not the same without it.Maybe if I had seen it without the narration, but all my information about the movie and what is going on, is IN that deleted narrative.As much as I like the extended cuts and the 'Final Cut' - I feel sort of betrayed that there was no 'Final Cut' with the option to have the narration running if I wanted to.There are also several scenes that are different, in the US Theatrical version versus the International version. For instance, when Rutger Hauer kills his 'God' Dr Tyrell, in the version I originally saw, it's a more gruesome. Later, Hauer shoves a long nail through his hand, thats also missing in the extended/final cut.Other than that, the two versions are pretty close.And I do like both versions, or, all versions. I have seen about 6 different cuts of this, each with slight differences.Mainly, when I first saw this, it was with the Narration, which gives good exposition on what is happening. Without it, there are a number of things left unexplained. The Narration track explains pretty much what is going on, also the nature of Ford's character and the characters of Bryant and Gaff. Also some of the motivations of the Replicants.When Ford is hanging from the top of the Bradbury Building by two broken fingers, in the rain, I was sweating bullets. That scene has the same effect on me in all versions.I'm so glad I was able to find a version with the Narration, it had been 30 years since I had seen that version. It was refreshing.",10,2,5,1 March 2012
Signs," Science Fiction used to make a statement about Faith
","I saw this in the Theatre, so my first impressions were from that perspective. I always enjoy movies more when I see them big.I understand why people react to this film, but it's from misconception. Mainly, that this is a science fiction movie. It is, but it is not. I'll get to that in a bit, why the 'Science Fiction' aspects are plausible within that genre. The more I watched it the first time I understood that this was a story about a man, a Priest even, who after a lifetime of being a pillar of Faith for his small town- the one person who everyone depended on to bolster their own Faith, has lost his own Faith.This is a Man who hates his God, for the loss of his Wife, maybe other things. He has quit his position as Leader of his local Diocese, but even in that resigned position, his 'constituents' still look up to him. This is shown in one scene as he takes his family into town and is approached to give advice. He is still called 'Father', they still confess their sins to him.As a decent man he still gives 'fatherly' advice to whoever asks- It's as if they don't accept that he has quit his church and his God. And his Faith. But old 'habits' die hard, he still will not curse and he still acts as an impromptu confession booth. I must address the misconception that as a Catholic Priest, he 'would not be Married'. Whoever thinks that, is living in the 1950's, Catholic Priests have been getting Married as far back as the 60's and Rome even made changes in doctrine to allow it. So it was not unbelievable that this man would be a Married Priest with a family- Of course, it is not common, but it is within reality. Actually he could be an Episcopalian Priest, but whether Catholic or Episcopalian, it's believable either way.As far as the fabric of Alien Invasion which underlies this story about Loss of Faith, Crop Circles and Abductions are referred to. What is given are the basic beliefs by Ufologists about what Crop Circles might be, and the two theories about why an Extra Terrestrial would visit Earth: Observation or Hostility. The first half of this film dissects some of those theories, and even refers to the wearing of 'Tin Foil Hats', which I thought was a great jab at conspiracy theorists.But these Aliens are shown to have a weakness: Water. So, the question rises up as to why Aliens would invade a Water-based planet. Well, the answer is right in the movie; they are not invading but collecting.As far as the concept that this film is trying to 'preach' some kind of specific Christian message, I don't see that. Faith is the same, regardless of religion. I'm not talking about the Christian concept of 'Faith vs Works', that's a whole other issue. What is being reflected is basic Faith, all Faith is a working Faith, regardless of what it is applied to, even Science. Basically, you have Faith in a certain thing, and that Faith causes you to follow through in a certain way, because you have expectations based on that Faith.But what is Christian here, is the concept of 'Miracles' in the form of 'coincidences'. When added up, if they hadn't happened that way, then something worse would have been the result.This is something I understand, I think many people do. How many times, after a string of unfortunate events, has it turned out that in the long run, they proved beneficial? For instance, you get held up in Traffic or by any other delay, and something bad had occurred at your destination? Had you been on time, it would have happened to you. The film provides its own fictional examples of this phenomenon, but regardless of the fictional aspects, things like that do happen.I don't think many people initially gleaned this from the film at first viewing, focusing more on this 'Water' vulnerability, and of course, if these beings were intent on taking over Earth, it would have been a big mistake for them. But the fact that this is not what they were doing at all only becomes apparent if you watch the whole film through.And of course, this revelation occurs in the film as one of M Night Shyamalan's famous reversals, one that sets the whole Alien Invasion scenario as the thing of secondary importance, showing that the Reverend Graham Hess's return to Faith as the main point- An issue that had been affecting his family and interpersonal relationships. And in that light, my favorite part was when Hess confronts 'Ray Reddy' (played by Night himself) as the man who had accidentally killed his wife, it was one of Night's best Hitchcockian 'Cameos'.I just felt that this film had more positive things to say, it did not show mass destruction and vaporization, which are blatant in films like Independence Day or War of the Worlds (Both versions). But the whole 'Invasion' aspect was done as something Subtle, which I myself believe is how it would happen.My review has probably spoiled that for first time viewers, which is why I hope that it is read after viewing. Other than that, this film impacted me because it hits home several key aspects about Faith.It was as if the film were speaking right to me, not just me, but the people I was with, we all agreed on this. So I think anyone who has difficulty with this film may be having a Faith crisis the way Reverend Hess was at the start of the film- And generally, I've found that when we kick against an issue which is being brought up, we are having trouble with it.",10,1,7,13 April 2015
X2: X-Men United," So what if the characters were not exactly like the comics?
","This I think was my first 'Comment' - I opened it up to see if I could make a correction to a typo and now I am being told not that I have too few words of text. Pfaw! Oh Well. I was first in line to see this thing when it came out by where I live... I was disappointed that they did not offer free comic books like they did with the first X-Movie.This movie ripped! Great story, good continuity between the first movie and this one. Excellent depiction of characters. Worth the 3 year wait. And... They actually gave Halle Berry some speaking lines.I like how Famke Janssen looks here, better than the first movie (or the last, but the last there is a reason for how she looks). My favourite thing about this film was the way Nightcrawler was shown, and the way he was filmed teleporting was exactly how I imagined it when I used to read X-Calibur (The comic series where Nightcrawler spent most of his time).Although I saw this twice in the theatre, I did not really recognise the 'Pheonix Saga' until I saw X-3 and they brought out that part of the story.What this story deals with is mostly Wolverine's past. They changed the 'Lady DeathStrike' character just a bit, and I have to say I like the revision.I think this film was the director's masterpiece, not really having been impressed by Superman Returns, I feel he is a traitor to Marvel for leaving the franchise and going off to DC-land.Since the first X-Men movie came out, each subsequent Marvel movie has exceeded the quality of the previous one.Looking forward to The new Hulk... And too bad Eric Bana is no longer Banner!",10,0,0,10 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," First Star Wars since 1983 (Non-Special Edition) that didn't suck!
","'42' unhelpful votes, there is cheating going on here. Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with 'reboot or rehash' - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi'. We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place.This is not a universe that is 'in the same condition as it was in Eps IV, V, and VI' - As there is a new republic, there is also a new group of imperialists and fascists that want to tear it down. It's happening in the US this very day, so this is nothing new.I suspect these negative reviews are just the spewings and ramblings of anti-JJ Abrams shills, doing the same as they did for Star Treks I and II. Because there are NO kiddie elements in this new Star Wars, it is a story aimed at long term fans of the franchise and it hits with a bullseye. What surprises me, is ALL of the 1-star reviews say EXACTLY the same thing. Because they were not written by 100 guys, but by ONE guy AS '100' guys. The main thing here is 'Where is Luke Skywalker' - And both bad guys and good guys want to know the answer to this. So do We. These include some of the old regulars, plus a new bad guy who wears a Helmet that looks like the Ugly Narc-Alien from Episode IV, who narced on Hans Solo to Imperial Storm Troopers and particularly Jabba the Hut. In an early confrontation in this episode, this duck faced guy takes out Max Von Sydow who indicates this person came from the Good side of the Force.So to me it's just continuity, as there are Jedi who followed Luke and his mentor Obi-Wan, any new recruit that goes down the Dark Side ends up doing Darth Vaderish things, like killing Off a whole school of Jedi Kids.As in life with often repeated scenarios, that keep on repeating over and over, this is just the same in the Star Wars universe. I'm not worried about that, what's important here is 'Does this film play out like original Star Wars'? And yes, it does.And although this film includes people from Eps 4, 5, and 6, this is a new story, and so there are two new players, a girl, who is waiting on a crummy sand planet, and a storm trooper, who turns away from his programming because he wants something better. And there is something about this Kid, do we know *his* father?The imagery is pure original Star Wars. The gadgets, the Droids, the Crashed Imperial Destroyers. New and Old Aliens, in new and old Bars.I very much wanted to know who this girl was, and I very much wanted to know about this kid who walked away from being a storm trooper. In the Meantime, it was great to see Han, Chewie, and Leia, who have scars of age and experience. At one time, they were the young ones who had the responsibility laid on them, in this episode, it is the girl and the boy. Because in real life it is always the young choosing to do good, who have long term effects, who save Nations in some cases. It's generational, the old guard passes it on the the new guard. If you live in this world, you're feeling the change of the guard - As the old song says.That's what this episode is, although there is a major victory, it is at major cost. And although the old Empire had built two powerful Death Stars, those were nothing compared to a new threat. It's a death star on steroids. So some ask, why make new Death Stars? Why have one in this movie? Because, it's the limited thinking of The Imperialists and Fascists. Because they always go back to comfortable norms for weapons design- In their Supreme Leader's small thinking, another huge planet sized weapon with a huge GUN.I saw this in IMax, in 3D, and I was impressed with how each 3D gag was well thought out and well placed. My brother kept trying to reach out and touch the tip of the Imperial Destroyer. A film shot in 3D has to look good also in 2D, and this does, in the IMax theater I could occasionally pull off my glasses and see a 2D Scene, and the composition in 2D was just as good. I'm not really a fan of 3D films, you can't really call them films anymore, as they are made on all digital medium. But for this episode, it worked well.In Lucas's overblown Eps I II and III, the CGI was over the top and blatantly CGI. IN this film, the CGI blends with the practical elements so that you absolutely cannot tell which is which. And also in Eps I II and III we have a multitude of scenes which are boring discussions explaining the force, mainly people sitting on couches talking. That, to me is about exciting as eating a plate of Tripe! I guarantee you, you will NOT see any Jedi sitting on couches talking in this one. Or Senators, or Sith Lords. This film is action from start to finish- about 2 and a half hours worth.And after walking out after the last scene and the film credits, there is no way in hades or Tattoine, that this will not have sequels. And this episode deserves to have sequels. And I for one cannot wait for those to come out!",10,8,51,5 January 2016
The Matrix," Keanu Reeves falls through 'The Thirteenth Floor' of the 'Dark City'
","Of all of the Reality-Perception films of the 90's... Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor... This film made the loudest noise and propagated cell phone knockoffs, two sequels, and a very long-lived online Virtual Environment/Game. And of course, it put Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving on the map.I saw this film in Anaheim during it's first run, this film was released during the Dot-Com blitz and was an Anthem for Pirates and Hackers alike. Whole Usenet groups spring up overnight, and 'There Is No Spoon' was being painted in Subway Tunnels just like 'Frodo Lives' in the early 60's when Lord Of The Rings inspired cult-like activity.'What if I give you the Finger --- And you give me my phone call'This portrayal of open defiance against 'The System' and it's 'Agents' rallied people around the world to take up arms against corporate idiocy everywhere, I was very pleased to identify with it.'How can you talk when you have no mouth?' -The Corporate response to any attacks by 'Little People' is to basically cheat - In this film by literally removing Neo's Mouth.But Neo was the one who would be able to use the same Methods Matrix Agents used, to beat the main Agent 'Smith' who was a program that developed an Ironically Human Hatred of Humans.There is so much in there, a lot of religion and philosophy is explored in this short film. But so much has already been said about this film, being a landmark event, there is nothing really much to add to what has been said about it.But the idea that what we can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste might just be fabricated for us by 'God' or whatever, this was new to the year these films came out. Like The Thirteenth Floor which was released exactly one month after this was, this film presented the idea that we are not really here at all, we could be somewhere else altogether... And the idea of Virtual Reality is not really a concept of the 90's computer age, it was conceived in the book 'Simulacron 3' by Daniel F. Galouye... I am not sure when this was written, back when he thought it up, computers were comprised of huge vacuum tubes and were the size of buildings, but somehow, Galoye saw into the future and that a kind of Virtual Reality was possible using computers.Even today, as we are on the brink of having 3D HDTV's in our houses, the reality of The Matrrix is not far away - If we are not already caught in it, if we are not already living in a Matrix type environment.And that is the question, isn't it? Because, it is all in our minds anyway...'I know that this steak isn't real'But we can still eat it. So, even without spoons, I can still enjoy this film 12 years after it was made. But it should have ended with this one, there should never have been any sequels.",10,0,2,28 June 2011
Godzilla," A lot better than the more Neanderthal reviewer's have said
","It is not perfect, but what movie is? Even the Lord of the rings trilogy had a couple of spots that were kind of rough. Speaking of which, special-effects genius Jim Rygiel returns to give us his visual interpretation of Godzilla and Motu.I'll add this: I really liked in the 1998 version as well, because I believed it was New York City's turn to be smashed into tiny pieces of rubble.For too many years Tokyo has been the main recipient of Godzilla, Mothra, and all of the rest of the monsters attentions. It is time for new cities to be totally rubble-Ized, and in this film it is Janjira, Japan; Honolulu, Hawaii; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Canada, Er, I mean San Francisco. In this film once again Vancouver, British Columbia becomes the 'virtual' San Francisco.Therefore, because most of the action occurs in San Francisco, Er, I mean Canada, this television show, Er I mean movie appears to be a reunion of Stargate-Atlants-SGU-1 Guest actors and actresses including Jill Teed of Wormhole Xtreme. You will see the Russian 'General Chekov' speaking to Bryan Cranston at the beginning of this film, on the USS Saratoga you will see the girl who played the Comms officer in the Stargate SG-1 episode 'Prometheus', when they try to take the A-for-Atom-Bomb Train to San Francisco you will see one of the Goa'Uld system lords from Stargate SG-1, in Oakland you will see the actor who played a younger version of a General Hammond from the episode '1969', and there are a few more faces dropped in here and there for effect ending with Jill teed as Liz Olson's friend.That is mostly why I enjoyed this movie, even though it was good enough even without all of my favorite Canadian actors doing cameos.The imagery is realistic even though the plot line if any does seem to jump around a lot and these monsters, these huge monsters seem to easily get from Japan to California in 60 seconds flat, who cares about any of this? It is a form of nitpicking I do not participate in. I enjoyed it, it was a good movie. And the fact that more and more of these negative reviews are written by people who just happened to join IMDb to write only one review of one movie makes them not valid at all, I don't even read them.",10,2,6,23 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 10/10 for the Original Unaltered Version, 1/10 for the Ruined Version
","It's hard to rate this, cos I was in the theatre, on the first DAY that star wars was shown in San Diego. It had already gotten a kind of limited run, so there was a slight buzz about the film (And I mean Film, not Digital Medium).But still nobody in the SOLD OUT Theatre knew what was going to happen next. We see this little Space Ship flying by, Oh, look at that, it's being chased. Then we see what it is being chased BY, the Star Destroyer FILLED the screen.From that moment on, we are all in a kind of Fugue. We were caught up in the story being told, the characters interested us, even that original Bar scene that Lucas said he hated, it was fantastic, it was like nothing else ever imagined on screen. And finally, these Rebels, we don't understand what they are rebelling against, except that it is 'The Empire' and that it's BAD - And NOT Explained-These Rebels are being attacked by a huge World-Sized Space Station. It was something nobody had seen before, the dimensions were incalculable. And Oh yah - There was this thing that gave our hero, Luke Skywalker, a kind of Edge - The Force. We didn't know what it was, and it was not explained by the 'Old Man' of the movie Sir Alec Guinness: It was a MYSTERY.And so it all led up to 'The Trench Battle' - WHich was visually and creatively the most intense thing anyone could experience. By sitting in that Theatre, we all were WITH Luke in his X-Wing and what he saw, We saw.It was an incredible experience for me, one that impacted me. So, I had to see it again... And Again and Again and Again. Five Times I saw it, and my friends who I had gone with also came back, and brought new friends. If the IMDb Demographic had been done in 1977, it would have been, 90% to 95% 10/10.People forget this, and younger people, they just never knew it. This Movie affected the WORLD.And Star Wars, as it was called back then, stayed in the theatres to SOLD OUT SHOWS - Every show! For almost a YEAR.Trying to explain this to people who politely 'like' Episodes I through III - Well it is impossible, because they were never there. Had they BEEN there, they'd have to agree with me, because it is not me, it is History. Perhaps, there is some Data Bank in Hollywood that shows how LONG Star Wars ran and how many people went to see it during that time. I challenge any person who insists that Episodes I through III are 'good.'Because, we're not talking about something that was JUST 'good' - People did not discard their Tight Budgets of 1977 just to go see a Movie up to 60 times. I knew one person who saw it 100 times.And because it was expected to be a FLOP - There were no TOYS made in time for the showing of the movie. So, Kenner gave people 'vouchers' - Which they could redeem when they finally caught up with Production Demands of Hans Solo action figures. I have, a Luke Skywalker Action Figure of that time. It is not special, except that it is rare.George Lucas went with 'No Name' actors for the characters he had created. Except for one guy: Sir Alec Guiness. All of the acting was good, because the story was good. It was more the Gestalt of the whole-The young actors, the incredible visual effects which were used to propel the STORY forward ‚Äî the satisfying resolution... Oh the Explosion of the Death Star was satisfying in So many ways, and the 'Special Edition' ruins even that by adding the 'Praxis' explosion from Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country.The release of Star Wars even affected the look of Star Trek, when a Motion Picture related to THAT show was released in 1979... Gone were the streamlined look of all the ships from the TV Show, the Klingon Ships had visible windows, tanks, portholes, hatches... All due to the look of spaceships in Star Wars.You cannot compare episodes I-III to this, even if I am wrong and they are 'good' movies - Because Star Wars the Original was not just a 'good' movie, it was world class. It made statements for Conservatives, it made statements for Liberals. It made statements for Religious People, it made statements for Atheists. It made statements for people who read Science Fiction, and it made statements for people who read The Bible.So, I cannot accept that Episodes I through III are in any class related to this, the original and unbeatable story of Luke, Leia, Han and Obi-Wan.The Original Trilogy was American Mythos Created and Personified, the Second Trilogy was UnMitigated Garbage and Filth- And more importantly, an EXPLOITATION of the first trilogy - An exploitation designed for one purpose: To Generate MONEY. And that it did, much to my dismay. Because if you spend enough money, you can get people to believe ANYTHING. Just look at what happened in 2010 with the Mid Term Elections, all bought and paid for by Corporations. Which is exactly what happened to the Star Wars Franchise.",10,1,3,29 February 2012
Cloud Atlas," Truth is not Personal or Perceptual
","It has been a while for The Wachowskis, but this film marks their return to magnificence. But I have enjoyed all of their films, and this film brings us back to the level of incredibility which we first saw in The Matrix.I believe that everything is connected. In fact, the way I view the universe is the way it is shown here, my thoughts on Heaven, Hell, Afterlife, even Time all mirrored in this film based on a book which I must read.I believe that we as souls are put on this earth to learn, to evolve and to become enlightened, and if we keep getting it wrong, we keep getting put back.That is what this film seems to be saying: a soul, played in several various lifetimes by Tom Hanks, must learn how to change from a scoundrel into a hero. And because he is the narrator of the central story in this time spanning adventure, so must his character be the focus, even when his involvements in the other tales are peripheral.'There is a Natural Order to this world' - 'The Weak are Meat and the Strong must eat' - Even the phrase 'Soylent Green is People' - All become repeated phrases or ideas, in sometimes grisly and literal ways.What makes it difficult to review this movie is the complexity of it, and it was a wise choice not to follow the format of the book. Instead, the stories are told all at once - Because even through the veil of time, they are all happening at once. But I found it not difficult to follow the story as it played out. The first time I watched this I was in a dream-like state, it was as if the film were speaking to me personally. As if the film were telling MY beliefs, even though I was not really aware of it at the time.And while five of the tales are about 'Something Diresome is about to happen' I loved the tale of 'Cavendish' - With all of the Dark being played out, the Humour of that chapter was not wasted, and well placed in the film.Stories like this cannot be told in any format but the format presented here. For anyone who believes that Deja-Vu is a glimpse across time or even alternate universes, this film will be easy to follow. But for people who lack empathy, who either believe in nothing or their religions prevent them from accepting the 'true-true' or other ideas and religions, then the meaning of this film will fail to reach them.I would have been included in that latter group of people, even 20 years ago, but as we live, we learn and our world-view changes. This is how it is supposed to happen. If we live a long time and keep our one and only world view and it does not change, then our lives have failed and we must live it again until we DO understand.And the other main point of this film, is that Truth is not and never can be objective, we do not perceive the Truth, Truth is Truth whether we believe it or not, see it or not, or ever had it told to us or not. This is where we commonly fail as people, especially when our religions try to replace ideas that have solid evidence to support them, such as the Big Bang and Evolution. I have found that Faith does not require you to believe in Creation stories as Gospel Truth: Faith is also another thing that is not objective, Faith is Faith, you do not have Faith IN something, you simply have Faith- And Faith is not directed toward any person or God, and if connected to religion, the claim is that Faith is FROM God. So too is the True-True.This was why the Zachry character had trouble with the Meronym Character at first, until a real trust and Truth was established, when Meronym also trusted Zachry enough to tell him why she was there. This is where we always get tripped up, Truth, when we tell it, repels fear.The magnificence of this film is revealed in the way each actor plays different people through time, sometimes of different races, and sexes. Without the great ensemble of character actors, this film may have failed. It required Faith to have been a part of the making of this film, as each actor was charged with making we the viewers believe in each of the people they had been, are, and will be.There are so many dimensions to this film, 1000 words are not enough for me to convey how deeply it affected me. The Golden Age SciFi Writer Lester Del Rey (Del Rey Books) is brought to life in the character of Luisa Del Rey.",10,3,6,21 March 2013
Fantastic Four," ...So why does this moovie not enjoy the status of the X-Films?
","Year 2000: X-Men comes out, the first major Marvel moovie in a long time. BLAM, it's a hit, we have guys like Magneto and Professor X and Wolverine brought to life, people loved it, and Hugh Jackman's career gets a boost. 2002: X-2 comes out, same thing. In the meantime, we saw Spidey and The Hulk come to life, and we also saw The Punisher 'Punish' John Travolta. Heh. And people liked these films, and the parade of Marvel Heroes coming to life was extended to The Fantastic Four.So, what exactly went wrong here? To my eyes, nothing. The characters ARE The Thing, Mr Fantastic, Sue Storm, and The Human Torch. Dr Doom, when in fact he becomes Dr. Doom, IS Dr. Doom. Hey, I believed it. But a lot of people, say they did not. Why? Well, it may be a thing to do with the pacing of the film: To my first viewing, the beginning seemed rushed. They told that part of the story too fast. What the heck DID happen in space? I see that people would get confused if not already familiar with the story. Is that it? I heard that there was an indication that a better Sue Storm could have been cast. Well, either these people are blind, or Jessica Alba really IS invisible. I vote that they are blind. A lot of people did not think Dark Angel was invisible, I certainly did not. And I did not think that The Invisible 'Girl' would have been better cast. Not being a collector, but being a comic book fan and being familiar with the 4antastic 4, I believed it: I had no trouble assigning The Invisible 'Girl' to Jessica Alba. So, that will probably get a hostile response, but so what? She was great.And the same goes with the rest of the cast, down to Stan Lee doing HIS cameo. Chiklis, as far as I am concerned, will forever be The Thing. He's got the look, and he's got the Voice, and IT'S CLOBBERIN TIME. I believed that he stopped a truck, and I believed it was The Brooklyn Bridge, and I SAW Reed Richards stretch down and save a fireman. I SAW Sue Storm throw a shield around a fire, and I believed it, twice. (Thrice, cos I am watching it again as I type this).And when it came down for us to discover the characters, in this moovie form of the 4-4, I saw many years of Comic Book lore put right in front of my eyes. What was wrong with it? As far as I am concerned, nothing. But some Marvel Purists, will maybe agree with me that the beginning, the origin of the 4-4 was told too fast, and they may also find fault with the 'discovery' portion of the film which granted, takes a large amount of the film. But to true believers, this is what happened. As far as the story following the comic book, this was closer than The X-Men, it was closer than Spidey's tale told by Sam Raimi.So, is it the director's fault? Should they have given the task to a veteran? I don't think that was the problem either, on a personal level, I believed the characters, they acted the way I expected them to act. Reed is a geek. Grimm is from The Bronx. Johnny is reckless and insane, and does not do what he is told, and Sue is complicated, and Alba certainly has that down pat, she can't be read in the first half of the film.The problem, then, if a story suffers, then it suffers in the script, and we had a big Hole between Doom and the 4-4. The way this was told, Richards should have caught on immediately that not all was copacetic with Von Doom. In that regard, Richards was an idiot. But Richards is a dolt when it comes to women, not scientific observation, so he would not have missed what was going on with Von Doom. So: The middle of the story could have been told a bit better, and more developed. I mean, how much of a story do you have with people who have put themselves in confinement? Well, I hope that is not considered a spoiler.As far as spoiling this moovie for anyone who has not watched it: I will not say that the images in the moovie are well composed, the CGI is there, but not real obvious, and some things that you think are CGI are real and some things that you think are real, are CGI. I will not say to the comic book collector that loves images, that they will get their hearts desire with how this production LOOKS in comparison to what we saw when our first issue of 4-4 was bought in... 1960? Whenever the series came out. No, I will not say that. I will also not say, that maybe this story was told FAST, cos they wanted to get to the sequel FAST, to tell the story that the 4-4 are famous for. Know what I mean? Naw, I won't say that! I will say that I enjoyed this twice in a row (and I believe I already said that) and I think that the Fans, who just want to enjoy this as it is told, will enjoy it, given the chance.Nuff Sed!",10,0,1,15 December 2005
Spectre," How in 57 Blazes can this even remotely be compared to Rogue Nation?
","For one thing, Spectre has been part of the James Bond Universe since the time Ian Fleming was actually among the living. Spectre was part of every JB film until 'For Your Eyes Only' when that version of Blofeld was dumped unceremoniously down a factory chimney stack by Roger Moore's 007.Spectre supersedes Mission Impossible by decades, especially the Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt MI's. Not that I don't enjoy those, but Bond was here FIRST.As far as this installment of the Daniel Craig JB's, I was pretty disturbed that once again, Q stiffs 007 on Tech, only giving him one watch. And in Skyfall, it was one gun and one radio.Bond has always been eponymous with Q and Gadgets. I don't think he needs a lot of them, but at least a new car once in a while. And at least he got one, this time, even though it was meant for 009 instead.Bond is always in trouble with his superiors. In this latest, the whole 00 program is going to be mothballed. Bond has irked a new superior (Andrew Scott as 'C') and this is the guy who can crumble the whole thing. In fact, the old MI6 building is to be demolished, and a new gleaming tower in it's place. But who will really be in control of it? The 'C' or 'Control' reference refers slightly to 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' which was aptly remade recently with Gary Oldman. But as this film goes on, what's C really up to? At first he appears to be supportive of Bond, but in short order we see he is a hindrance. And he's nosy, so once again Bond can't even trust his co workers. Ray Fiennes however is a great 'M' and he fell into the role perfectly.This Bond episode is more about misuse of surveillance- Who has access to it, and who is using it? And how much of our daily lives are they seeing? Quite a lot if we are to believe this, a global consortium.This version of Spectre is not the silly version shown in the early Bond films, where they are swallowing space capsules or living in underwater habitats with guys with Metal in their Mouth. This is a most serious Spectre, and they have a most serious enforcer played by Dave Bautista, there is nothing even remotely comical about this new 'Jaws'.But it appears that Bond is quite over his head in these matters. And even when the dust settles, has Blofeld's Head really been cut off? Bond's former M gives him a ghostly assignment, and that's the last we see of her, but not of her Bulldog statue. Bond is the personification of it, he just won't quit.Of all of the Bonds over the years, Daniel Craig's is the one who is the luckiest it seems. But to me, Bond is not all fists, he also is supposed to have charm, and to have access to cool gadgets. At least a few of them, granted Pierce Brosnan depended on them too much.One thing I will say about the short lived Tim Dalton Bond, he was great with aerial scenes, I'd like to see some more of those. Bond ain't dead yet and Craig, not by a long-shot. I look for ward to at least one more Craig bond, I think this franchise gets rebooted all too often.",10,3,8,25 January 2016
Warcraft," I don't get it, I had heard nothing but good things about this.
","Back when this came out a lot of people spoke very positively about this. In fact when I first heard about it I was positive I wouldn't like it, I'm just not into movies based on video games.  But that very thing was what caused me to enjoy it so much, because I knew this was based on a video game, I could totally accept the characters and the visuals in this film, and they blended in with the live actors so well it was hard to tell how it was done  Very nice addition to Duncan Jones/Zowie Bowie's (I can't believe that this is the guy making these movies) repertoire, I remember when the kid was born. And now he's made a few really great movies, including source code.  I liked Paula Patton from ghost protocol, and I believe I saw her in mirrors as well. There were a few other names that I always like seeing, Ben Foster and Dominic Cooper, and Toby Kebbel and Clancy brown, not to mention Ruth Negga from agents of shield.  But the St. Louis film critics association should get stuffed, awarding this 'worst film of the year'. I award them 'worst film critics ever'. This is just amazing because the buzz about this film was highly positive at the time and by reading through this now, you think it was a total flop. But it actually wasn't. Everybody that I spoke to loved this film, all of my friends, and I heard that this was great from more sources than I had expected too: I was expecting people to say that they hated it. But in fact the only people who hated it where the St. Louis film critics Association. It was that positive buzz that made me interested in this in the first place, and here comes the SLFCA to quash that. Well the hell with them, I will have to remember that if they ever award any other films worst of the year, I will have to immediately go out and watch those films The thing that amazes me is that I normally don't go for this kind of thing but it was done so well. I had been wondering why there hasn't been talk about a sequel, because I thought this movie was going to be the first one in some kind of new Ur fantasy trilogy, but thanks to the SLFCA and other trolls, we don't get to see this story told any further. Thanks a lot.",10,1,2,8 June 2018
Contact," Science and Religion both use Faith
","Mostly out of respect for Carl Sagan I rate this 10 - It is in fact a diamond in the rough as others have said.As far as Production Value, the state of CGI Graphics when this film was made was poor - It could have been done better. That was the one thing that bothered me, some of the CGI was great, but at the time CGI was no good for planes, ships or a huge rotating Gyroscope. It was good however for storms and galaxies and planets.But despite this minor flaw, the sets were very well done, including Jody's 'spaceship' and the structures surrounding it. But what drives this film is not how it looks, there are strong and weak aspects to that. What really drives this story is Character, and the fact that we ourselves can relate to the dichotomies presented here.Basically all through this film, Dr. Arroway refuses to see the merits of Faith, she only relies on what can be proved with Facts in Hand. But Faith in God cannot be accessed that way.This rigid thinking initially allows her to make her big discovery, but when it comes to the row she created and taking part in her own discovery, it prevents her from being originally picked as the person to represent man as a whole. We have Nick Lowe on one side representing the Conservative POV, and Matthew McConaughey on the other, who should be representing the Conservative/Religious POV but in fact Ms. Foster's character cannot see that he is actually her most valuable ally.This is how both Science and Religion should tread, they are in fact not at odds with each other, they complement each other. I think this was Carl Sagan's final statement with this book and film. Both require Faith to make work and if allowed to, Science and Religion can be used together to answer questions that neither alone can answer.I personally believe that if a machine like the one in the film were built, we would experience it differently from Within and Without.James Woods as the NSA chief almost reprises his great role as 'Citizen Cohn' and Tom Skerritt reveals a Political Ass-Kisser and chump who is not above taking Arroway's discovery and using it for political gain, even while standing in her way earlier in the film. John Hurt in another chameleon role is SR Hadden, a mysterious recluse and main Arroway ally.And as much as Matt McConaughey bothers me, his character is pivotal to the film, as well as Gary Busey prodigy Jake as the psychotic religious fanatic which he so well represents. I believe all stereotypes are accounted for using appropriate actors.This film is worth sitting through, even though it moves slowly. Not many movies or TV shows lately have such a positive message to expound as this, but the source material and author says it all.",10,2,5,10 May 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Down in Flames'
","I'll say this about Michael Bay, he can handle Action and Suspense like no other director since Hitchcock. And Just like Hitchcock, he gets a little over-ambitious sometimes.In this very ambitious third installment of the Transformers Saga, Bay literally 'Reaches for the Moon' - Someone else commented that this film is riddled with clich√©s, but I say the clich√©s are turned on their ear. This film starts out with Documentary style filming, combining 'News Footage' scenes with 'Live-Action', first-person footage (If you can call the CGI here, which is very photorealistic, 'Live Action'). The inclusion of real-life footage of Kennedy mixed with a pretty convincing lookalike filmed in Black and White Video style *almost* had me believing that it was really Kennedy in all of the scenes- 'Almost' - Because the final cameo of 'Kennedy' has a different angle, and in colour, and at that point, the differences are apparent with the lookalike actor.Although the story told here does not quite match the story that has been told in the first two films, it is still a very good story: 'Down in Flames' - Bay cannot now back up and make any new Transformers films, he has destroyed his world, literally. And so I am expecting that, this film is the last film of the Franchise, if more Transformers films are made, some serious 'Rebooting' will have to be done.This film loses 'Mikaela Banes' (Megan Fox) and 'gains' 'Carly Spencer' (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) - Which from the start is a total loss, as the 'Mikeala' character had been developed from the beginning, this 'new chick' is dumped on us and we are supposed to believe that Whitwhickey has developed a relationship that rivals his earlier association with Ms Fox. No - It does not work, and Sam Whitwhickey's puerile salivatings and palpitations and teenage jealousy rages are just not believable, the character Carly is simply not believable, she's a card-bored cutout. As a real actress and woman and most importantly high-style Fashion Model, she works VERY well, I believe THAT. But in this film, I do not believe HER. Mikaela, on the other hand, was shown as a talented and gifted Mechanic- That I believed.So from the moment Spencer walks up the steps in first-time reveal, on tip-toe even, the average viewer might go 'Oh Come On' with in-credulousness... Incredibility? Disbelief maybe. Personally, I DO NOT believe that a chick like that would ever be interested in pimply-faced Shia Lebouf. But I can suspend that a bit cos of *my* ex gf'sSo with my only spoiler of this review over with, I can get into the way this film looks, mostly happening in 'Washington DC' and 'Chicago' -And on the Dark Side of the Moon, I believed THIS. The first time we see an Autobot, one of the little guys, I'm still not sure what they were called, and then later as we see the Autobots on various missions, the transformations are better, the overall look of the Autobots are better, the CGI is very very good... This is why I gave this film a '9' - It would have been a '10' if not for the female-lead change.Excellent performances here from John Turturro, Frances McDormand, 'General Glenn Morshower' (Who I think lately is always a character named Morshower in his latest films), Alan Tudyk, John Malkovich, and even Shia LaBeouf - Plus the return of Tyrese Gibson as 'Epps' which makes this his reunion with 'Lennox' (Josh Duhamel), makes this a great 'Mega-Ensemble' cast. And Leonard Nimoy who just had to be given lines referring to things Spock said in 'Star Treck' - That was another mistake, but mostly he plays his character well, as do all of the Autobots and Decepticons.This film is just too overwhelming. There is no relief, no space to relax, this film is a juggernaut- It plows over you. Some of the editing is confusing, mostly it adds to the very rapid pace of the film. (And I have said this before and will probably say it again}: Too Much 'Future Shock' - Enough to kill 1,000,000 Alvin Tofflers.But despite the changes in female lead and other small inconveniences, this film is a warp-15 thrill ride, I was wholly exhausted after watching it, especially the final ‚Öìrd of the film. For those who like massive mechanical destruction on a scale that makes Brobdingnagian look like Microscopic, insane stunts that no human could possibly perform (but they did), well then this is for you.It's just Mindless Entertainment, insanity on a galactic scale, and the warping of not only time and space, but of our minds as well. Michael Bay has come a very very long way, parsecs, light years, from 'Bad Boys'.",Null,2,6,29 September 2011
V for Vendetta," England Prevails!
","Alan Moore and David Lloyd wrote this as a graphic novel from 1982 to 1989. The decade of the 2000's was the decade were the Graphic Novel emerged onto the big screen with films like '300', 'Watchmen', and 'X-men III: The Last Stand' which was based on The Phoenix Saga graphic novel by Marvel. Of all the graphic novels made to film, 'V for Vendetta' flawlessly captures the cinematography created in the graphic novel art, even more so than 'Watchmen'. The Wachowski Brothers and director James McTeigue recreated the graphic novel as a film depicting a grim, bleak future where England has been manipulated into a reactionary government. The underlying message of course is 'Beware' - It could happen in the 'Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica' as the character in the film played by Roger Allam - 'Prothero', calls the USA ('Prothero' is probably a play on the name 'Prospero' - as this film has a lot of references to Shakespeare in it).Natalie Portman and veteran Hugo Weaving spearhead a great cast which includes John Hurt ('Sutter'), Stephen Rea ('Finch'), and Stephen Fry ('Dietrich' - Fry most recently plays Mycroft Holmes in the 2nd Robert Downey Jr. 'Sherlock Holmes' film and also the Cheshire cat voice in 'Alice in Wonderland')- The rest of the cast include Jeremy Iron Spouse Sin√©ad Cusack, Natasha Wightman, Rupert Graves, Tim Piggot-Smith.As we never see Weavings face in this entire film, we depend on his rich voice to develop the character of 'V'. Portman begins her 'Evey' (E-V) role as a cipher, but the character was given more substance and personality in this treatment- Alan Moore vied to have his name removed from this film, just like he did for Watchmen.There is one moment in the film where Rea has a revelation of connection, the filmmaker uses this as an opportunity to collect all the discordant plot elements and merges them all together for the viewer. This is probably the finest moment in the film, the music very powerful.'V''s Jukebox contains songs by Julie London, and Cat Power- Kind of an odd combination but it works in this film.",10,1,3,5 March 2011
