Ford v Ferrari," excellent
","Love and hate for this movie, and I understand. If you aren't into cars or racing then this isn't your thing to watch, simple as that. But for the muscle car lovers and espescially the Ford Mustang lover Shelby will ring a bell.Simply said, this is the story about Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. Their love for cars and starting a battle against Ferrari to build a faster car. And that's what it's all about. Cars, cars and cars and the friendship bewteen the two and their fight against Ford to get started building the GT40.Excellent performance from Bale and Damon as from the rest two which are perfectly chosen for their characters. And the British accent of Bale, so nice.Full of action and suspense and of course the death of Miles. A must see for all geeks for cars.

The Blair Witch Project," love or hate it, it started a new genre
","Love or hate it, it's the film that started a new era in the horror genre, the found footage. It's true, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) started it all but this flick came out in the beginning of the internet. The Web was something that everybody started to know and this flick was well promoted on that way. Not everybody was comfortable with the web and giving nothing away except the title did the thing. I was in the US when it was promoted and yes, you did believe what you saw.Cannibal Holocaust surely was a found footage but it was all about cannibalism. And it's there that Holocaust fitted in. The Blair Witch was controversial because love or hate, no in between was possible. Some were afraid seeing it others fell asleep. But it do has a few creep moments especially the night scenes.Is it all that great, that's the big issue because the only effects used are done with branches and stones. And that's just why it all looked real.The remake is now a few days before release so I will surely go watch it. Therefor I recommend to see the original one which also spawned a sequel that was terrible. But without the Blair we would never had the Paranormal Activity franchise and so many other found footage flicks.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7,1,2,19 September 2016
Insidious: Chapter 2," better than the original one
","To be honest, I didn't liked the first one and I only rated it a 5 out of ten. But this was shown as a preview at a horror Halloween night so I had to watch it but I must say that this flick was over just before you know it. Again directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (both of Saw fame) and produced by Oren Peli (of Paranormal Activity fame) they have learned from the first one and the critics about it.Before the opening credits you have in fact a prequel of the story of the original Insidious. If you haven't seen the original one don't worry because after the credits in a few minutes all is explained about the first flick, done that this ghost story delivers the creeps until the end. It's done by using almost no extra lighting and doing some shots in POV. It even had a eighties feeling by using a lot of wide angle shots. It's even explained who the ghost was in the first entry of this franchise. We do have ghosts again of course but this time they added a special effect to see the difference of the world of ghosts and the real world, smoke and echo warned you of the ghost world and it worked. Again, it never was scary but this time the ghosts were shown in another kind of movement and also they added some funny situations with the two investigators of the paranormal world. It's also a clear view that Oren Peli did had his influence on part of the directing. At times Insidious 2 did had an paranormal feeling. A funny scary horror that will have you watch the screen full of anger from the first minute until the end. And we all know by now that part 3 is on the way. Who is the girl in the wheelchair and was that a creature towards the end? Who can tell, yes, Wan and Whannell did it again, an ew franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",8,0,1,1 November 2013
Blade Runner 2049," top notch
","Okay, it took 2 years before I watched this flick. Reason was simple, I had to be in the mood to watch and and do have some time because almost clocking in way over 2 hours it's a hard one to watch because seen the original I did know that it was not going to be a simple one to view.I can be very simple about it, Denis Villeneuve directed it and have seen Arrival (2016) I knew that this was going to be good, was I wrong, it was utterly sublime. The way it was shot, the score used by French band M83, the editing, the acting, it was all well done. If you are into cinematography then it's a must see. Some did even stated it a masterpiece, maybe that's true, because it never bored me one second. Even as it is very slow and sometimes a bit hard to understand.Even Batista shows that he has acting skills, even Harrison Ford is top notch, not that I ever doubted that but to pick it all up after all those years.Again, it shows that Ryan Gosling is a hell of an actor, and that you don't have to go for blockbusters to see a great movie.

Men in Black 3," typical Men In Black with great CGI
","It took me some time to watch it because I had a lot of fun with the other 2 entries. But what a great flick this is. The acting is sublime and even as Tommy Lee Jones isn't all over this flick it's still a must see for the Men In Black fans.It starts already with some great effects and from the first minutes you know what you can expect. Hilarious situations and a great story. They had to move on after 10 years and indeed their instruments aren't the most important thing here. The neuralyzer isn't the thing here. This is more about time traveling. But just look how they did that. Some funny parts but have a look to the effects used, sublime. I was funny to see David Rasche (Sledgehammer anyone?) again and yes, Will Smith was performing excellent. Jemaine Clement (Boris) was enjoyable too. Fans from the first hour will surely love it. It staid close to the original. If you wan't to have fun than this is your flick.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 1,5/5",8,0,1,18 March 2013
Sucker Punch," Zack's most controversial feature
","I guess here in my country it was one of the most promoted flicks and the one no-one went to. Really, even at my work there were posters hanging in the men's toilets. And admit, most posters just shown the girls in sexy underwear or clothes. So indeed, I thought that this was one for the flesh flute players. But still, all the negativity surrounding this flick kept me attracted to it. How many times are flicks being hated by the press becoming cult classics. Now I don't think that it will be a classic, only time will tell. Al the 5 girls were almost unknown for me, okay, I knew Vanessa Hudgens from High School Shitcall and Jena Malone from The Ruins but that was all. Scott Glenn didn't need an introduction I guess. But back to the five, I was surprised that they did it all well. Naturally it's a Zack Ryder flick and you love him or hate him. He's really a CGI man. And it do shows but it's all done so beautiful that I never was annoyed by the CGI. And the score, what a great tracks and how it was edited into the flick. I have seen the extended cut which clocks in 17 minutes longer so it took me over 2 hours of my life and wasn't bored at all. The CGI did take the overhand at the dream (or should I say dance) sequences but there was actually a story involved. This may be Zack's most controversial feature so far but if you can dig futuristic flicks or fantasy than it's one to watch. It do contain dragons, zombies, robots and creatures to have a fight with. For me it was a nice surprise to have seen Sucker Punch, I liked it, strangely most of the viewers didn't.",7,1,2,26 September 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," still some boring parts but moves slowly to darker regions
","Twilight, you love it or you hate it and I'm one that hate it. But I must say that this time I enjoyed some parts. Still, it do has a few boring parts. I was happy that the glistening vampire was gone and that we really had a vampire this time to see. the part I enjoyed was when Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) had a dream of her wedding where they killed everybody. it looked so great and I was surprised by the amount of red stuff they used. On the other hand it's still clear to see that it is a flick for youngsters. the romantic scene in the water and after wards in bed were Bella is fully naked they really edited in that way that nothing was seen of her private parts and juggs. Kristen admitted that the shooting did had a few nudity shots but that the producers and director thought that it would be shocking and they wouldn't get their toddler rating. A bit the same what happened with Jennifer's Body (2009) where Megan Fox comes topless out of the water. But that's another story.Once Bella becomes pregnant the movie becomes a bit enjoyable to watch and the boring situations and blah blah between Bella and Edward are on a hold. Jacob Black also has an important role and leaves his shirt on this time. Maybe they all have learned there lessons due spoofs and reviewers laughing with Twilight.I do must give kudos to the special effects and in fact the part make-up where they transferred Bella into a sick and almost death person. She's skinny too (easy to spot in her bikini) which adds towards the looks of a sick person.Naturally, all is predictable (no pun intended) and no surprises are to expect from this part. The end shot of Bella was one you could see coming miles away but please do watch the end credits when suddenly the Volturis are back into the game. They are the best looking vampires in Twilight. again, easy to spot what they are going to say.Overall, it is still Twilight but like Harry Potter they are moving very slowly to darker regions.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",5,3,5,18 June 2012

","This was one I was looking forward to but what a disappointment it was. I mean, I don't have any troubles with the fact is this an abduction or is this the truth but when it takes until the last 15 minutes to reveal what is going on, no that's not my cup of tea.The effects at the end are okay and I kept watching it only for the fact to see what the real event is. But from the start until the end it's blah blah and nothing really going on. Suspense, for some it will be and they did it with misunderstandings between the three.Call it a horror, not for one minute.

The Longest Yard," i enjoyed it not for the comedy but for all the WWE superstars and Burt Reynolds
","I was told to see this one. A remake of the 1974 flick then with main lead Burt Reynolds, and to see again in this flick. I always love d his acting,I grew up with Deliverance and Smokey. Nevertheless, not a main lead here this was stated as a comedy.People knowing my reviews about comedies do know that most US comedies aren't my thing. To say the least, I never laughed for one second with Friends. So we have an uncredited Courteney Cox who starts off in this flick. It's starts okay and I did had a laugh here and there but once we are in prison I never laughed again. Must be me I guess but the humor wasn't there for me. Still, once I get beyond the point that I would not laugh I start to enjoy it in another way. I started to watch how all those WWE superstars were doing their performances. I guess they had a real good time with Paul Nash playing the gay person.So after all, once the game is on I was really into this flick. For me not a comedy at all, for many it is. I enjoyed it, never seen an Adam sandler flick before so he didn't annoyed me. One you could see with your friends to cheer with the game.

Resident Evil: Afterlife," story is weak but one of the better 3D flicks
","Clocking in at the success of 3D afterlife was shot in real 3D and it shows but it is also it's weakness.The story picks in exactly at the end of part 3 so for that reason no problem. But it takes us to Los Angeles , fully infected with the Undead. They do have new abilities but we do move a bit too far away from the original concept, Umbrella. It's only when they reach 'Arcadia' that Umbrella really comes in the story.The only way I can explain this flick is for the 3D reason. They do look stunning but are the main part why you would watch Afterlife. Not only that, they also use super slo-mo for fight scene's and bullet flying around. I watched it in full 3D and you are lost in the effects used and forget what's it all about. As i said earlier, some personages from earlier entries do return but it's the weakness of the story that made me think, seen it all before. Only the last 20 minutes once at the 'Arcadia' are worth watching and is really what Resident Evil is about, not about killing Undead in all possible ways. But if you want to see great 3D then this is your shot.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",6,1,3,6 December 2012
It," not scary, but still worth seeing
","And so IT went. After the disastrous summer with all failing flicks IT was going to be the next thing. IT would make up the summer and would become the blockbuster this year needed, so the campaign was up for IT. Everywhere you go you couldn't ignore IT. All jokes aside, I just seen the notorious flick.First of all, with Stranger Things being an instant Netflix hit concerning children as the main lead it was clear that flicks with kids do work. So a remake of 'IT' was in the make. By using children you could go two ways. They are the victims or they are the heroes and in IT, they are a bit victim but mostly hero. Is that a problem, not at all but that means that IT isn't going to be a flick for the hard core horror geeks. Secondly, made as a blockbuster and having kids in IT, you don't have to think twice, no use of red stuff or nudity at all. This means that what could have become a gory flick, because Pennywise is evil, doesn't happen at all, sure, he do bites but the gore is left out of IT. Watch the beginning when an arm is bitten off...and you will get IT what I do mean.Is it all that bad, no, because Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) really looks evil and scary at some moments and the effects used for Pennywise are above mediocre. To be honest, all effects are top notch. And the kids are believable too. But sadly IT isn't scary at all. What does work is Pennywise talking and looking but he doesn't offer jump moments or goosebumps. The creepiest part for me is the thing going on between Beverly March (Sophia Lillis) and her dad (Stephen Bogaert). That do offers awkward moments and you will get it what is going on between the two. The bathroom scene also with Beverly is creepy.Is IT the flick I was waiting for. I thought it was going to be creepier than what I saw, maybe a bit too long especially the end. Worth seeing but unforgettable, I don't think so.

Hereditary," nothing scary
","And so I fell into the trap laid by promotion about people running out of theaters and people vomiting. I mean, I have seen over thousands of horrors so this one better be good to give me the creeps. And even in my country it was stated as the flick were people were fainting and crew of theaters had to be aware and had to say to attend the people watching. Once the flick was over I had a ripped-off feeling. Nothing is scary by ways that you would vomit. There's no gore at all, okay, there's a severed head and decapitations and so on but overall on part of a bloody mess it never shows. It's a slow starter and it takes almost over an hour before the horror comes in. Being compared and stated as the new Exorcist I'll be fare, no Exorcist (1973) is more scary. On the other hand I found it better than the overhyped Insidious franchise. What the movie does by using industrial sounds as score is giving it a rare feeling, and on that part the movie works. Still, there were teens attending the movie and they did scream loud. well promoted, mediocre horror flick. And if you want to vomit and being iritated by a uncomfortable feeling go watch Irreversible (2002) were people really ran out due the 9 minute rape scene and the notorious head smashing or go one step further with A Serbian Film (2010).

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," typical Timur flick
","This flick will divide the viewers in two camps just like the story itself, how cool is that. By which I mean, it's not a straight horror story. It's never frightening and the story itself can't be taken serious and it's that fact that will turn away the lovers of horror.On the other hand it's easy to spot that it was directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Just watch the fight scene's how it all was filmed. Most done in slow motion and that's so typical for Timur. Remember Nightwatch (2004) and what followed. So for people who loves this kind of filming or do adored The Matrix (1999) its fight scene's then this surely will be your cup of tea.That it was shot in 3D gave it an extra but it does hide the weak script. Don't get me wrong, it never was boring but if you think about Lincoln really being a vampire killer and the battle at Gettysburg being done between vampires from the south and humans from the north then this in fact a rip-off of his own Nightwatch franchise. But I must say that the effects looked stunning and that the 3D really worked. Just watch the horse ride and towards the end the disaster with the train. It's all exaggerated but let that also be the autograph of Timur. The acting itself was believable except when getting older you could spot that the beards were as fake as it could be. Still i enjoyed it because I don't have any problem with Timur's films so far. But some are fed up with him giving always the same treat. At the end of the day it's just a twist on American history filled with extra effects.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,1,11 December 2013
John Wick," great action movie
","Great to see Keanu Reeves back, it must have been since The Matrix (1999) that I saw him in a flick. But I must say, even as this flick is available really cheap these days that I thought this must be bad, that I was wrong. This is a great movie and to be honest, I liked it very much.The story itself is rather simple, you know, wife died, getting out of business, receiving a dog, getting robbed and dog got killed, it's payback time, end of story. But from the beginning until the end I enjoyed it very much, the score, the fight scene's the shoot outs, the way it was shot and edited (the way they shown the translation of Polish) everything was great, and the acting of all the thespians was way over mediocre.It never really becomes brutal or you don't see a lot of bloodshed or even say nudity it somehow doesn't matter because the action is what it's all about. A surprise it was in fact, Reeves shows that he can still carry a movie and it was so great to see all those well known names from yesteryear and nowadays working together. And for the lovers of muscle cars, it do contains a lot, the mustang, chevelle, charger and challenger are all in. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",8,1,6,19 October 2015

And I must say that I really enjoyed this must see flick.Even as it clocks in at almost 2 hours it never had a boring moment. And it do has a few sentimental moments about losing the one you love. And even as the story isn't that strong it all works out fine. It's just a survival on the train that has some zombies running around.But what makes this flick watchable and above mediocre are the effects used. The zombies do react and move on a weird way, And in the beginning the deer standing up after being hit, wonderful. Also there's a lot of CGI used with collisions between trains but it all looks real. Even the horde smashing against each other it do works. For all zombie geeks a must see.

Underworld," take me to the underworld
","The Matrix (1999) spawned a new genre. A genre when action is taken place all is shown in slo-mo. Also when people are fighting or doing their things the Japanese wire-effect is used. The Matrix stood on his own but 2003 brought The Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded but also a lot of flicks based on those effects. Underworld followed the same tradition and brought something new to the horror genre. By doing that it had his pro's and contra's but I was taken by the throat.I had seen it in 2003 but nowadays with the Blu Ray relaeses I saw it again and reviewed it again. I loved it because I was hooked on the story and on the suspense build in Underworld. But also on the sublime acting of Victor (Bill Nighy) and Lucian (Michael Sheen). I really loved them and the way Lucian was played was really welldone. Michael moved further to the stupid and ridiculous teenage vampire saga , Twilight, but again I really loved his performance there as Aro.Selene (Kate Bekinsale) looked gorgeous and indeed reminded you the most towards Neo in The Matrix. She played well too but I wasn't really into her. She was a bit the underdog. Still, not that all into CGI I never had any problem with the lycans coming alive. Full CGI but still they add the real red stuff in it when they attack the vampires. The script itself is just as simple as it can get. Vampires are living among humans, some are Death Dealers like Selene. They only have one reason why they are Death Dealers, to destroy the lycans. It's going on for ages until Lucian has interest in a human. It's for Selena to search it out why and she come across a revelation of lies. Once that happens the movie really becomes enjoyable. Len Wiseman did an excellent job as director. He did Underworld Evoltion (2006) to move further to Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and the remake of Total Recall (2012).If you are into vampires and werewolves and can dig a twist to the world they are living in than pick this up, excellent.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",8,0,0,15 October 2008

Each time the cat appears I lost total control espsescially in the space ship, hilarious.Due clocking in under 2 hours, I said it before, is really okay to watch, Endgame clocked in over 3 hours, way too long. Of course it isn' all action and there's a drop just around an hour which is a bit of bla bla and that's what made me give it a 7 in stead of 8. Great to see Samuel back.

World War Z," not a horror at all
","So much negativity about World War Z that I was afraid almost to go watch it but I had to watch it because it's all about the hype of nowadays, Zombies. What I really can understand is the difficulty to categorize this flick. I just should file it under post apocalyptic, not a straight horror.To call it a horror it should be scary or for a zombie flick maybe even gory but none of that is here to find. We have seen it all before, flicks with major names trying to make a horror but failing in the fact that people who are used to see the big names dropping the flick because it's so-called horror. That's what happened here, Pitt buffs never went to watch it because the zombie theme and horror geeks are into The Walking Dead nowadays full of gore and here we don't have any (no gore and brutality off-camera) so they discard this flick too. Not that it was bad after all, but a lot of zombies are done CGI wise. The quickness of the zombies and the cleverness (climbing over a wall) do makes it a bit creepy but the scene's in dark alleys never makes it scary. Still, post apocalyptic lovers will adore this. It's a nice start for a zombie evening, to watch with the whole family before the children go to sleep and you are plugging in the real stuff.

Passengers," the romance is not the main theme luckily
","When my teen daughter asked me to go watch this flick i agreed on therms that it wasn't going to be a love story which is for me the kind of thing I don't want to see. Have seen the trailer it looked okay so I gave it a try.And in the beginning I did like it a lot, pure sci-fi which I thought was okay. But I was afraid once Jennifer Lawrence (Aurora) would come into this pure sci-fi it would quickly turn into a love story, which finally did. But did it bother me, not at all, because there were jokes mixed into the story which made me forget about the love between Aurora and Jim (Chris Pratt). And of course I did know that the bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) did have a naughty side. Luckily the love came on the second side because the space ship needed to be rescued. Naturally this kind of flicks don't have blood or real action going on but there are a few moments that makes you want to see what will happen. On part of the effects used they are really stunning. The gravitation being removed in the spaceship does things with aurora in a swimming pool and that is really a must see. So having extreme good effects, a bit of jokes here and there and a good story made it all watchable even for an old fart as me. I hated 'The 5th Wave (2016)' for so man reasons but Passengers, well, I did like it. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",7,1,2,7 January 2017
The Hunger Games," Battle Royale mixed with Twilight
","This must be one of the most hyped films over here in Europe this summer and naturally I took precautions to watch it due the fact that hyped flicks mostly fail for me. The Hunger Games are based on a book and here things already go wrong. It is loosely based on the book. I just will refer to the dogs at the end of this flick, here they are created by the masters of the game. In the book they are the dead that resurrect into dogs. A big difference and also one of the reasons that shows that it was made for the youngsters among us. While the books have a lot of blood and gore the flick doesn't show us anything of that. But is it all that bad, no, there are a few good actions taking place and it never bored me but it failed by choosing for a flick that fits for whole the family. By saying that it brings me back to another trilogy I doesn't like, Twilight. The way the lover birds are talking does take you back to Twilight. I was more into the brutal Immortals (2012) a flick that failed for others but worked out fine for me. If you like The hunger Games but would prefer it a bit rougher then I should recommend Battle Royale (2000) but let's wait for the remake of Battle Royale coming out in 2015 if it will be like the original one.Effects and acting was okay but it's a trilogy I wont follow any more.

I did have a few loud laughs. Just watch how they used Don't Stop Me Now from Queen when they are hitting a zombie. Or when they meet another bunch of people that have survived. Or when Shaun is walking towards a shop. It's also funny to see how Coldplay was involved in this project, back then in 2004 they weren't the mega seller they are nowadays. The effects on the other hand were excellent, just see how one zombie got a whole in her stomach. And not only the humor was okay but the gore staid intact too. There are a few better comedies out there but this one worked on all kind, script, make-up, effects and especially the editing.

But not only that, the second entry into the 3th generation franchise was another perfect example how it all should look, in other words, this is really a Star Trek flick.The characters were strong and the combination Spock and Kirk did work out fine. On part of the story, clocking in over 2 hours there's never any boring moment. And the effects are really over the top. Just see the collision of a space ship into San Fransisco. The fight scene for example is another feature worth seeing in San Fransisco. If you are in the possibility of seeing it in 3D be sure to do it.

Hostel," good storyline
","After Cabin Fever Roth became a so called member of the splatter pack. So it was time for him to make a splatter movie. He did it and is was called Hostel. The storyline is very simple, but what makes the movie is the torturing scene's. They are all done in a gory old fashion way and the blood flows frequently. Were SAW delivered a lot of torturing but in a bit of fantasy this story could happen. the only problem was that some people said that the gore was overdone here to but the SAW franchise down. But SAW had some good storyline that became a franchise. Again Roth made use of real babes and let them suffer in many ways. What we never thought was the fact that it had an open end. Hostel 2 came surprisingly quick after this one. Be sure to watch this first if you would like to catch up with part 2. Be aware of the 'burning eye' and the 'station scene'.",6,0,2,25 June 2009
Green Room," brutal and in your face effects
","Being at the wrong place at the wrong time that is in fact what this is all about. Would be a mediocre film wasn't it for the fact that this is brutal as hell and comes in your face sometimes. When a broken punk band is going to headline a gig at a skinhead location things go wrong when one member has to go back to the green room to pick up her cell phone. Entering the room he witnesses a murder. End of story for the punk band. From then on this rather alternative flick turns into a brutal flick. And I can say that it isn't for the easy offended. Even as it has a few names in it that make you think, he really for example Patrick Stewart playing the leader of the skinhead location. But there are more to see like Alia Shawkat and Iogen Poots but sadly also Anton Yelchin who died of blunt traumatic asphyxia aged 27.What does make this flick brutal is that there isn't any warning with the use of score that something will happen. And when things happen they are really well done. Be prepared for breaking an arm, cuttings, machete's, gun shots and I can go on. Most brutal for many is the dog walking around.Still, when the flick is over you are left with a bitter feeling like, what the hell I just saw. For me one of the better flicks from this year. No exaggerated effects but a simple story with real looking effects. And you are in the movie from the first minute until the end.

The Babadook," eerie atmosphere
","Not bad at all but let me say that not every horror buff will like this kind of horror. It do has it moments but it also is a slow builder. There's not that much of horror going on in fact but it's the way it is shot and the use of lighting that gives a special feeling and don't forget the performance of the two main leads.The story itself is rather simple. A mother and her annoying child are living together when the father has died by accident. But their child is a real pain in the *ss at home and at school, so the mother decide to read him a book, The Babadook. It's some kind of weird book and the child gets obsessed with it and start to see things but after a while the mother does too, the babadook is alive. It's once the book comes alive in their mind that some creepy shots and eerie atmospheres appear and that's what makes this flick great. Not only that, when the mother is watching TV you also see shots of other classics and the Black Sabbath's (1963) most scary moment is here also to watch.The Babadook is a flick that must have it from it's creepy moments and not for the gore (which isn't in it) like other horrors. As said earlier, not for everybody but once seen you will not forget it, or you will find it eerie or you will find it rather boring, the choice is yours.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,8,19,4 November 2014
Us," starts of topnotch but when the supernatural comes in I lost it
","Another hyped horror from 2019 and after seen it finally, let me say overhyped. Firts of all, the story is original but towards the end it get's a bit weird and unbelievable. The acting i could dig because all of them had to do a double role.But for the geeks out there. All killings are done off-camera which makes it naturally a downgrade for the fans of gore or red stuff. The flick itself starts very well and I was really sucked into the story but after a while when must I say the supernatural comes above it's when I lost my attention somehow.A big cheer on the other hand that all actors in main lead where black people. Finally Hollywood get's it after a few years of trouble about that fact So after all, well above mediocre but not the most scary one of the year.Gore 0/5

127 Hours," hail to James Franco and Danny Boyle
","I don't have to introduce Danny Boyle. His flicks always had some kind of twist, just look at Trainspotting or 28 Days Later. His new much acclaimed flick '127 hours' already did his work in the US. Today it was premiered over here and the newspapers and tabloids did their , free promo, home work. People getting sick by watching it or just leaving the theater because they can't take it anymore. That's okay but that kind of reactions made me became precautionary. Sometimes the reactions from the US are over the top...But I can admit, if you have a weak stomach then I understand that you could become sick. I won't go into any details but there is indeed a very gory part. If you are a horror buff than you will have no problem with it but for non-horror watchers it will be a hard pill to swallow. After 15 minutes into the film Aron Ralston (excellent played by James Franco) get's stuck in the canyon. From that point on it's just him you are watching. Flashbacks, hallucinations, it all passes by. But the editing and the choice of music did his work to, when 'A Lovely Day (Bill Withers)' starts it just gave another dimension to this number. And the use of Sigur Ros, which I normally doesn't like did his work too. A must see and surely an Oscar worthy. If you liked 'Into The Wild' then this is surely one for you.",8,0,3,17 February 2011
Blade," another comic relief
","It has taken me ten years to actually see this movie. Why? Because I have seen a lot of trailers and was still thinking, what is the fuzz about this one, is it action is it horror? Well, I can tell there is a lot of action in it, a lot of martial art but the horror is far away, even as it is a story about vampires. It all starts of very well with the scene in the discotheque but afterwards it becomes very clear that this is a comic remake. The story is very well but the effects makes it laughable. When the mastervampires have a ritual at the end, won't tell it all, they change into flying skeletons...looks stupid, looks like Disney is horror. The only effects that are nice are the bites and the ending of Udo Kier, that's really nicely done, sometimes the flying skeletons made me remember of the disappointment of Evil Dead 3. But then it was the eighties. Due the fact that there are sequels people must really liked this one, perhaps the second one is better, will see....",6,1,19,15 October 2008
Creed," excellent flick and top notch Stallone
","Growing up in the seventies and eighties, yes, you know that I have seen the classic Rocky (1976), the start of the career of Stallone. From there on the Rocky franchise was started but once we entered number 5 it was downhill with the franchise and also a bit of downhill with Stallone's career. But Stallone was friendly guy and everybody had big thumbs up for him.So it was time to bring him back as Rocky but being too old so the script was about the Creed, the boxer Rocky faced in part 1.What an excellent flick this is, this is in fact a bit of the same of Rocky but it all works out fine and Stallone gives the best and it shows. Clocking in over 90 minute it never bored me for one minute. Sadly Stallone missed the Oscar for his role, should have won it. A perfect entry in the Rocky franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5",8,0,2,20 March 2016

","The problem with all those superheroes flicks and their spin-offs is the fact that most flicks are way too long and do have a mediocre storyline. Did i like this one, sure.The story is great, the effects are stunning and even clocking in over 2 hours it's still full with action. One moment I thought, OMG, not that famous kiss and don't let it be a love story, luckily it isn't there's a bit of liove but destroyed with action.About the story itself I can't say a thing because it's easy to catch and I would spoil a lot. Great to see Amber Heard again. And a bit of a joke here and there.

Resident Evil: Extinction," better than part 2
","W hat a great opening this flick has, it takes you back to the ending of part 2 and the start of part 1. It picks up exactly when Alice (Milla Jovovich) breaks free of a new experiment being hold on her body but it also takes you back to the original Resident Evil when Alice wakes up in the shower. Finally the effects were much better than Resident Evil, here they went back to real effects and less CGI although CGI is still an important part in Extinction. Also this time things are seen on-screen instead of being done off-camera.I wont go into the story itself because Alice has new abilities and is confronted by...Alice. Further she a loner in a world gone by but when a weird dream happens she has to join another group. Together they're of to destroy the Umbrella company and of to Alaska, were there is no infection.I liked it because I just watched the previous parts otherwise you wont understand all what's going on. There's no explanation who and from where the group comes that Alice joins. A nice entry and for me better than part 2.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,0,6 December 2012

This one follows the research done and also shows how the cops back then didn't worked together maybe if they did the case would be solved. Still, we are following the cartoonist getting obsessed by the zodiac.One funny part is to see that a flick losely based on the Zodiac is shown here, Dirty Harry (1971).It's a long trip first part showing the killings then we move over to the research done by the cops and the newspapers to end with the adiction of the cartoonist. excellent performances, great flick.Gore 0/5

Cloverfield," Is this worth a hype?
","After seeing the trailer for this flick we thought it was worth waiting for. At last, available here in Belgium but what a disappointment it was. Knowing the director for the sublime 'Alias' this flick is just one to see and to forget. It starts out fine by getting to understand the individuals and suddenly hell breaks out. After the first attack of the monster a cellphone is ringing and suddenly it's all about romantic. It made me think of that other crap 'Godzilla the remake'. there is no gore let's even say any suspense in this flick. It's normal that this one will be compared with Blair Witch but BWP was at least creepy. I understand that in the US people were talking about the attack on NY remembering 9/11. I'm glad that I have seen the movie but will not buy it and will never have any moment of wanting to see it again. And knowing that they are talking about Cloverfield 2 only makes me shiver, no thanks",5,2,4,19 August 2008
Silent Hill," a strange experience for non gamers
","Silent Hill is based on a game and we all know that gamers love this flick because it stick close to the creatures in the game and the story. But for people not knowing the back ground of Silent Hill the game this could be a weird flick to watch. The story itself is rather simple but still then for non gamers it could be difficult to follow. Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) the daughter of Rosa (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) has a sleepwalking problem. Not only that, she always mention the name Silent Hill. Rosa is fed up with the problem because Sharon being adopted she wants to go back with Sharon to her birth place to find out what Silent Hill means. But the drive towards Silent Hill isn't without problems, being chased by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden)a police officer they both crashes down the road. After waking up they find themselves in a deserted place full of mist and falling ashes. Not only that, Sharon is gone. Clear to rescue her daughter together with Cybil they slowly get terrorized by the abandoned city and getting more and more entwined into the disturbing history of Silent Hill. Freaks and strange creatures do move around some done with CGI some in the flesh. Some parts are indeed a bit scary because they used the effects of shadow and light. But again, some of the creatures aren't explained (like the one with the pyramid head) and will be weird to watch with a surreal grandeur. For a game being transformed into a flick it is even sometimes rather gory. Even the score from the game is used now and then. The incoherent story can irritate some viewers. And that's the main problem with this flick. It's a beauty for the gamers but for the unknown it's a complex story even as it is simple as it can get. I had a feeling of a bad flick looking good. It's hard to explain and review. Still, horror buffs will love it because we do see bodies burn and being teared apart. And some creatures do have a Clive Barker overtone.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,1,1,16 April 2013

","Took me a while to see this one but my wife saw it on a plane and said it was okay. I waited so long because the further we go into Spielberg movies the less I do like them. They are more ane more into a Disney fairytale. But when my father-in-law presented this on 3D to watch I did give it a try.Starts off rather good with a lot of action going on, espescially the race with all those features that you will recognise when you are into gaming. But once that was over I didn't get a grip on this flick. It just didn't got my attention. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad but it isn't vintage Spielberg for me.But they also told me to watch in in 3D because it do adds and I agree. Due computer animation they were able to exaggerate the 3D effects. They were stunning. Especially when they are in the virtual world. But again, I will forget this movie rather quickly for a Spielberg flick.But teens will love this and gamers will love this, that I can assure you.Gore 0/5

","Have seen all of Tarantino flicks I only had one feeling. It's going from excellent to mediocre so far. No, Django Unchained (2012) wasn't my thing at all. Too long and too much blah blah going on.So I thought this was going to be a blah blah flick too but luckily it wasn't. Sure almost 3 hours long it do has it flows starting great without action just until they arrive at a stopping point. From there The Hateful Eight becomes for me another typical Tarantino flick with a lot of conversations going on but just when I thought that it would become boring the action comes in and the story do takes a turn into what happened before and the red stuff shows itself in full bloom. It's so nice to see that after the Django failure Tarantino is back with a good western. If you can take the nonsense in the middle then you are in for a nice threat towards the end.

The cars are still an important item but the effects used are becoming bigger and bigger. And the weirdness of it all is that it all works out fine even as you can spot the CGI clearly in some parts. Not only that, guns and fight scene's do enter the franchise too. The most over the top thing must be the scene with the airplane. If you just look at it then it must be a hell of a runway. They drive for minutes over the runway. And once the plane goes in the sky it just takes off again and again. And still you just don't care. It's in fact the acting and all the characters that makes this franchise work. It do has a few surprises and be sure to watch until the end because once the end credits are running you be in for a big thing.

","It doesn't happen that much that a sequel is better than the original movie. Director Norrington screwed it up in the first one by choosing CGI blood and stupid effects. For this one the director was Del Toro, well known for his movies. He also used CGI but in a better way. The story is better than the first one. Okay, you never see real people, it all happens in the underworld. Fighting scenes are better done qua fighting and bringing it in front of the camera. Make up is also much better. Some people hated this one again due the CGI Blade, well, these days it is used a lot, watch Hellboy or Spiderman. Of course there is an open ending so indeed there was a number 3 on the way.

Underworld Awakening," moves too far away from the other 3 entries in the franchise
","Things go wrong here in the Underworld franchise. Only Selene, and a small part for Michael, is to be seen from the original cast. It do involves vampires and lycans but i just couldn't care for Awakening. Selene here is more an superhero than a vampire. She can do things not normal for a vampire and not be seen in the previous entries. The story itself was a bit weak too, guess the producers just wanted to earn some easy money. Selene is involved with Michael in an explosion. She wakes up twelve year later in a world were mankind wants to annihilate vampires and lycans. Once awake she sees that she's in a laboratory. She soon discovers that she has a daughter, Eve. But the lab is in fact part of lycans who want to use Eve's body to find a cure against silver bullets. I can agree that the story had to involve but don't bringing any cast from the last 3 entries is a fault for me. Also the fact that one lycan was a big monster was a bit exaggerated. If you want to see stuff like that then move over to the Resident Evil franchise. The effects on the other hand were maybe the best so far. But we are also a few years further than Rise Of The Lycans. It is still watchable but it moved too far away from the other flicks of Underworld. It do has an open ending so within a few years part 5 will be available.

Suicide Squad," the story wasn't that strong and Harley's jokes weren't funny
","There you have it, over here another would be summer blockbuster like Independence Day but both flopped completely. It's strange because you can't deny the fact that flicks about superheroes are a big hit nowadays. But after the controversial Batman vs Superman (2016) I'm left again with a bitter feeling.I remember more then a year ago when rumours came that there was going to be a Suicide Squad flick. Soon pictures and trailers appeared and it looked all stunning. And the testoterone with so many teenagers was growing with the first view of Harley Quinn with her tiny short. But a short or sexy outfits doesn't make a movie. It's not all that bad but for me the jokes offered by Harley Quinn didn't work at all and when you got a problem with a main lead be sure that the flick fails. But it's not all her fault, it's the story itself that didn't got my by my throat. I have seen the Batman fighting Superlan twice and still it isn't my flick. Guess I have the same feeling with this one. In the beginning and at the end, Batman do appears (Ben Afflick) to make it all believable and Jared Leto is excellent as The Joker but we will never see a Joker like Heath Ledger again. Better then the stupid Independence Day, stronger story for sure but sadly after more then a year waiting Suicide Squad couldn't convince me.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,5,6 September 2016

My cu of tea so for me this flick really did work. Somehow it reminded me of Batman Begins (2005) were Batman is also trained up in the mountains. The story did work fine and the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch (as the doctor) was sublime. Naturally the bad guy Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton )did also elevate this to a higher region on acting.But i's also the effects used that were stunning on parts of the dimension.

","I never intended to pick this up because there are so many flicks out with robots and some do work but when monsters are involved it could become a camp flick. But when two major shops left our country the had to get rid of their stock so that was the moment to visit both, and I came across Pacific Rim 3D rather cheap. Now that I finally has seen it I'm happy I did. It's an excellent flick and even as it contains monsters and robots in the main lead it do has a real story to tell. When the flick started it immediately reminded me of course of Godzilla but also Cloverfield (2008) came to my mind. But it wasn't all about monsters here. There's a bit of a macho thing going on and a love story luckily that part you could see coming and is only a main issue the mast minute.

A rather big surprise that it was actually good after the failure of Battleship (2012) and Batlle Los Angeles (2011). And when it do becomes camp it's when Ron Perlman (Hannibal) comes in.

","It's been a while since I watched a flick about superhero's. The reason is simple, mostly those flicks clock in over 2 hours and do have a lot of boring moments. Didn't know what to expect from Ant-Man but I gave it a try due Michael Douglas being in it and Corey Stoll who I knew from the stunning series The Strain. But was I surprised when it was over, this was excellent.There wasn't any part that bored me and the story itself was rather good. Even when the ants came in I thought this is going to suck real hard well it was again excellent. Towards the end there's a fight between good and evil and even that looked great.

Predator," fox tricked the critics on part of the 3D
","I have seen Predator in so many ways, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray and now finally in 3D. The reviews were stunning about the 3D trailer that the critics saw and everyone who adored this flick hunted down the 3D predator. But was it all worth the wait was it what we expected from 3D. Being an old flick and never been shot in 3D a conversion was to be made. But Fox did it in a hurry and didn't work years on the 3D project like done with for example The Wizard Of Oz (1939). They used the Ultimate Hunter Release as base for the conversion. But UHR was already under fire by the critics due the bad Blu Ray conversion. So rumours started within the geeks about the 3D release. To the point, it does work in some ways and sometimes it indeed has a 3D look and sometimes it just didn't work at all. The opening sequence was the real thing with the alien arriving from space. The stars really gave depth into your 3D telee. And that's exactly were FOx went wrong. They worked with in-depth 3D in stead of 3D coming out your telee. Nevertheless, I must say that I enjoyed it because it's a hell of a movie. Some effects might see outdated but the suspense is there and the gore is still intact. I'm happy with my 3D Blu Ray but I can understand that the geeks thinking they would feel the predator are a bit disappointed.Just say that Fox went for the money and didn't spend time on the conversion, and just watch the 2D Blu Ray added within the box, it's just the old release with all the extra's but nothing knew to discover. So it's a fifty-fifty, if you like 3D just pick it up, there are uglier conversions to catch...but for the geeks of predator just leave it as it is. I gave it an eight just for the flick itself.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",8,1,2,6 January 2014

It's more about him then about Queen itself, which is normal, his life ended due AIDS.performances are top notch, everybody performing as Queen do look like them, even their way of moving or looking.

The movie stops with the death of Freddie. It's also not explained what happend with his solo album(s).The fun for me was that a comedian, Kenney Everett (also death die AIDS I think) I followed close back then is also in it and he was also so recognisable played by the actor.Clocking in way over 2 hours the flick is over before you knew it and it's the songs that are still standing that will take you by the throat. Excellent.

Baby Driver," one of the better flicks of 2017
","Promising trailer made me go watch Baby Driver. Also stated as the blockbuster of the summer of 2017. Once it hit the theaters over here it was soon gone and it never became what it was promised and did remind me of last years summer failure, also called the blockbuster, Suicide Squad (2016). I agree, Suicide Squad did fail as a flick but Baby Driver didn't for me.But I can understand all the writings about it because it isn't a 'normal' flick. It do has all elements of a suspenseful flick. But it's the excellent or even exquisite editing combined with the score that do annoy a lot of people but if you can dig that then you are into a really fine flick. The score used never bothered me, there are even a few surprises in it for me like The Damned (Neat Neat Neat). The shootings throughout the flick edited on the music made it for me a delight to see. Must have taken a lot of patience to do that. Nevertheless, the opening scene with the car chase is a must see and it one of the best seen in years. Another surprise are the brands of cars that they are using. There's something for everybody from German cars to old US cars to Japanese cars to even the newest muscle cars. I found it a stunning flick with superb cinematography and editing. Naturally the use of all those songs did remind me of Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) were the score was also a main thing. And for the older viewers, yes it's cassette galore, those good old Maxells from the eighties. One of the better flicks of 2017.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",9,2,8,18 September 2017

","I wanted to see this flick for two reasons, the excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio which finally delivered him his Oscar and the cinematography. But after seen it this is just a classic to become. Can I say a negative thing about this flick, no I can't. All those long shots used or the extreme close-ups it do works out fine. The effects used, the attack and the bear of course are really gory as hell and the bear thing do looks real. But the natives used are so believable due the fact that they speak their language and do say what's it's all bout, taking the land back.Not a minute too long and for cinema geeks this is a must see.Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",10,1,7,20 March 2016
Disturbia," Horror for a Saturday afternoon
","To be honest, I thought this one was offering more then just a romantic story between youth interfered with a serial killer. It all looks fine when the movie starts but when the house by the serial killer has been spied just when you think, here we go, it never delivers and it returns to what i call The Breakfast Club. It is only at the end of this movie that it all starts happening. Then suddenly the killer is there and we get a bit of suspense but you all can see it coming from miles away. the way he is going to react, who he will kill and by who he will be defeated. No gore or blood is shown, only a scar above the killer's eye that heals very quick, in the next shot it is gone. A shame, because the storyline could have gone miles further and less childish.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," don't take it seriously, seriously?
","I was waiting until this came out because I liked Red Riding Hood (2011) and Snow White and The Huntsman (2012). Both another take on the popular fairy tales. This story looked promising but for me it failed completely. The story was very simple although having some good effects it still wasn't my thing. And even as a horror buff there are some moments to cheer about like smashing heads and bodies being teared apart.It's clearly made for the adult due the sometimes gory shots but it also looked sometimes like a spoof. I didn't had any problems with the acting but it's just a simple story more about witch hunting, in fact, it's popular these days to take popular names and mix them in a horror story, take a look at Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (2012). It do has some funny moments and some things are so predictable that it more looked like a mish mash.Full of one-liners make sit an ideal flick to sit and enjoy with the family but it doesn't deliver toward people searching for something new.

The Machinist," excellent Bale
","Just before Christian Bale really became famous he was the leading role in this brilliant suspense flick. I wouldn't say that it is a horror but some do because the mind is playing tricks. Nothing supernatural but still spooky. The director Brad Anderson was already famous with Session 9. Here he shows that he can do it again. The acting of Christian is really excellent. For me the movie 'American psycho' was a big flop, sadly his name was attached to it. But here, you really can't believe what he did for this flick. See his body, no tricks, he was really skinny. The shots where the dreams are revealed shows Christian as how he looks in a normal life. You really could see that an Oscar is on his way...Which actor would dropped an amazing 63 pounds for his role? It's all about the insomniac Trevor Reznik and his hallucinations. The other actors are all believable. It isn't really bloody but the flick is over before you knew it. Michael Ironside has a small role in it, typical Michael. One to watch especially to see the body of Christian and no, I am not gay!",7,1,1,30 December 2010
The Fast and the Furious," made for the petrol head generation
","Now that part 6 is out there and still getting very positive reviews I found it time to pick up the series. I'm not normally into all that macho stuff but because it's involving cars I must had a closer look to the success of the series.Once over I thought to myself, why is this a hype. It surely isn't going to win any prices and Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto)isn't the kind of actor that gives great performances (well maybe in the Riddick franchise). But then again I was surprised to see some well known faces from the genre I like, horror sci-fi and exploitation, and see Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) was here doing what she does best, playing the hard girl. Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him. But that is only clear in part 2. To be honest, it's a no-brainer with some action here and there but also with to many clichÃ©s like the cop falling for the sister of the bad one, and having the Stockholm Syndrome towards the end. I didn't find it really going fast and to so furious, well I was.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",6,3,7,18 September 2013
Captain America: Civil War," excellent
","Not really into superhero flicks I still do watch them because everybody does and I want to talk about them. The X-men franchise can't satisfy me really and the Avengers franchise is better but do has it flows. But have seen the trailer of this one I thought I would give it a try.What a great flick this is, and by now I do know why the Avengers causes me problems. It's the annoying Iron Man. I mean, when he's Tony Stark he really annoys me with his way of talking but here he isn't the main subject. It's all about Captain America of course. Why I did like it is the fact that it's all about the action throughout this flick. Not that many talking, it's fighting and fighting and it's the Avengers against each other using their superpowers so on part of the effects it's ultra brilliant. I must warn that if you haven't seen another superhero flick that you can have a problem because there's Ant-man and Spiderman popping up, and we do see flashbacks from most of the other superhero flicks.The performances are all excellent, yes, after Deadpool (2016) and Ant-Man (2015) this is the next in a row I do like. Be sure to watch the end credits because the movie goes on, and also wait until the end credits are over, there's more to catch.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",8,1,5,20 May 2016
Saw III," low on gore but deeper into jigsaw's story
","Same director as part 2, same writers and same production team. What could they do to the franchise to keep you attracted? Bringing out different versions of the flick, so I just watched the 113 minutes version, more then IMDb stated (108 minutes). The story picks up exactly were part 2 ended but naturally they had to bring in back again the torture porn that was now on his heydays. But they moved a bit away from the genre by going in much deeper into the relation between Amanda and Jigsaw. And I must say that it worked out fine. They dared to put out some main actors from part 2 and brought in some new names. Dina Meyer had to leave as did Donnie Wahlberg. New names came in and the most important one to the franchise is Costas Mandylor, but here he is only 2 minutes in it. I was glad that they moved away from the story like in part 2 were we had a bunch of convicts being brought together. Here we do have some victims who are going to meet some Jigsaw devices and I must say that they were so far the gruesomest in the series. The one in the beginning were Troy (J.LaRose)is full of chains going trough his body is also one that nobody will forget. On the other hand the twisting of bone structure isn't for the faint hearted too. What they also brought in was full frontal nudity doing so with another device. It was something we hadn't seen so far in the series.The way it was filmed was the same as in the previous flicks. A lot of flashbacks and the use of fast moving images. The revealing at the end was again unpredictable. And now I must admit that I was glad that I am watching them in a row, because you pick up so much details. If you watched them one at a year as they came out, you have forgotten a lot. I liked this version more then Saw II even as it has less blood in it, but when it comes to the bloody parts it's more gory then part 2. In fact you could see that the editing and use of score was done by the same editor, Kevin Greutert. He also will be becoming more and more important in the franchise, after part 5 he will be the new director.Now that I picked up the Saw franchise and am beginning to like it more and more.

","Starting off with a compilation of what happened at the Amityville house it all looked fine. If you want to know what happened go watch the original one (1979). Once told we do move over to Enfiled Great Britain to see what is happening over there. Based on the real events late seventies at Enfield.And again i was tricked or possessed by the trailers shown were people are really scared and are screaming. Been in the genre almost 35 years I thought, could it be as scary as The Exorcist (1973). Sadly it wasn't.What it does is again having a lot of jump scene's and creepy voices but even as I did like part 1 this one couldn't satisfy my hunger.Some parts I did enjoy and of course children being possessed do offer something weird but it's so typical James Wan so you know what to expect and you do know what is going to happen like a ghost passes by in a slow and creepy way. For example the painting coming alive, mmm, didn't work for me. Or the crosses being turned upside down...What The Exorcist did I haven't seen yet.

Resident Evil," good back then but nowadays outdated CGI
","Based on a game Resident Evil was meant to be the next big thing. Seen it back in 2002 it was indeed something special but no out on Blu Ray I saw it again and it was a bit passé.Why, because the digital effects used are a bit out of time. It's strange to see it nowadays with the effects from back then, but wait, the faces doesn't always look believable when the dead are walking. But the dogs really looked stunning. The big monster on the other hand was clearly to see that it all was CGI. But not only that, even for a monster flick it is low on gore and even red stuff. Most of the slaughtering is done off-screen. But it is really the story that makes it watchable after all. A virus is let free in The Hive, an underground laboratory. The computer shut down all entrances to avoid infection. An elite military corpse has to investigate what went wrong and by entering The Hive they come across Alice (Milla Jovovich). She has amnesia and slowly her mind tells her what happened to her and what is happening inside The Hive.Being low on gore and red stuff Ithought it was meant to be PG-13 but knowing Milla we all know she isn't afraid to show her body and that's what she exactly does in Resident Evil. She even goes fully naked and shows it all if you watch closely. It was a nice entry in the genre with the walking dead and the monster but for me nowadays it doesn't really stand up towards the technology. That's weird because older flicks do stand their time. Still, worth watching.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,1,2,5 December 2012
Avengers: Endgame," way too long
","Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around.

There was already an alien inside the spaceship. So fans of the genre guessed that this would be the beginning of a franchise. And so it was.

","Okay, I admit, I followed the hype concerning this flick. And yes, it indeed delivered what the hype suggested. The main actor, Sharlto Copley, does deliver real good acting. And this is his second or third movie. Wow. As you see in my summary there is more than just the story itself, for me, maybe because it's played in South Africa, it's all about the apartheid. But the black people are now the aliens. Or am I wrong? Who knows, maybe I have seen to much. Anyhow, the movie delivers in all directions. It sure did on the storyline. No romantic stuff like in so many Hollywood productions, remember 2012. It's great to see the decaying of the main actor, no heroes around. Maybe the alien is. Watch it for yourself. The beginning is a bit like a documentary, then it all starts and CGI comes in. Never been a fan of CGI but here it's used in a perfect way. And the language used by the aliens. I recommend it to everybody, horror or SF freaks out there. It's original by all means. A big relief between those majors coming out these days.

","Is there another movie that has so much comments as this one, you have the hatred and the loved ones. Everybody told me to stay away from this movie but after 2 years I thought it was time to spend 2 hours of my life to watch this acclaimed flick. I just watched it so I could talk about it, my wife would like to see it so here we go. People who know me here in my native country or who know me via youtube or this site know that I am a horror geek. So there we have the first problem. All the sites concerning horror are tearing this one to bits. When the end credits were running on the flat screen my only opinion was, let's have a look at the lady. And even she wasn't so much amused with watching Twilight. Our opinion was, this is definitely NOT a horror flick, this is just a romantic movie just to be happening with vampires. I can understand that teenagers who are falling in love are really looking up to this flick. Remembering my youth there was Grease and other romantic movies. I wouldn't say that this is Grease of the 'OO because they don't sing but I can understand that there was a gap for the teenies after the ending of Harry Potter. But to say and understand that grown ups like this flick, that I can't just get it. There is really nothing going on. Just when you think, a-ha now the vampires will strike the movie cuts away to another scene. The only part were really something is going on is the part were a member of another clan is being killed. That part I enjoyed. The other 115 minutes are just talking and talking about why and when and how they should become a couple. The vampire going into the sun is another issue, diamonds look-a-like appearing on his skin, and the fast movements in the woods. No thanks, just give me the old vampires. But again, for me I just would give it a 2, due the reaction of my immortal one sitting here in the settee. But I must admit that I will watch the second part just to see it, no expectations at all...if you are a teenager under 16 you really will love it but if you are older...put a stake through it! It's strange that another teenage flick being released flopped, but there you also had the vampire story in it and there really something went on, I'm talking about Jennifer's Body.

Tucker and Dale vs Evil," dumb and dumber go fishing
","I admit, I was afraid to watch this horror/comedy. I'm a horror buff and I can dig comedy too but mostly the combination of both doesn't really work. I had some laughs with the Scary Movie franchise but others like Vampire Suck and Transylmania weren't that laughable. But they came out of the states and their humor isn't my thing. I dig more the British humor like Lesbian Vampire Killers. The director Eli Craig isn't really known for comedies and is more an actor than a director but even then as an actor he isn't really famous in the comedy genre. But what he did here is unbelievable. He even wrote this funny flick himself and directed it. As main leads we have Tyler Labine (Dale) and Alan Tudyk (Tucker) also not known to be funny but they surely know their stuff, Tyler moved on to The Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and Alan came from I Robot. And what an excellent job they both did here as two hillbillies running into trouble just for being hillbillies.I surely would recommend it to the horror fans even as it is a comedy. It do has some gory moments and a lot of red stuff but it's always funny to see how it happened or what is going on. And the jokes are excellent. It's not just funny faces or a fart here or there this is sublime writing and acting falling together. I laughed from almost the beginning until the end. Maybe the last 3 minutes are a bit predictable but what a good time I had watching it. I should even dare to say that maybe this was the funniest horror I have seen so far. If you want to have a good time with stupid situations, dull blonds, red stuff, gore, silly cops and all of those typical characters than sit back and enjoy.Gore 3/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Story 5/5 Effects 4/5 Comedy 5/5",8,4,4,28 October 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," excellent use of CGI and good storyline
","This is supposed to be a prequel to the much acclaimed Planet Of The Apes from 1968. But in that particular flick an astronaut crew crash lands on a planet in the distant future where intelligent talking apes are the dominant species, and humans are the oppressed and enslaved. In Rise we are on planet earth, to be precise in San Francisco. A laboratory is experimenting with a new medicine to cure Alzheimer but they need to experiment on chimpanzees. But one experiment goes to far and a genetically-enhanced chimp breaks free and leaves a baby chimp behind. The mother is killed and one of the doctors (James Franco) Will Rodman takes the baby home and it grows up in the family. But the baby chimp has some qualities inherited from his mother. Once the chimp (Ceasar) knows it and uses it intelligence. Due a simple incident between (John Lithgow) Charles Rodman and his neighbor Ceasar breaks free and defend Charles, but he is captured and send to a place full of chimps, the rise is a fact.This summer blockbuster was forgotten very fast in my country due Transformers 3. But was it that bad that it should disappear that fast. No, to be honest, I even enjoyed it. The apes due look like real apes and that makes it more enjoyable. There is naturally a lot of CGI but it all looks so real that you forget that you are watching a CGI flick. It takes a while before things go wrong. There are things going on but to see how the rise happens you really have to wait an hour. The action lays in the last part of this flick. It reminded me a bit of the story of I Robot were one Robot (Sonny) violates the rules and is learning things by himself. Caesar does the same. I liked it more than the remake done by Tim Burton. I know that a lot of people disliked Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes but give it a try and forget the saga for one moment.

There are no flashbacks to keep you on track. Is that bad, no because by doing so the story starts immediately. If you are not in the Marvel world forget it, you wont understand a thing what is going on.Clocking in over 2 hours it of course have some moments that you think, really, but overall this is a flick full of action with topnotch effects. And every superhero does what he normally does, meaning, spiderman is funny, the guardians listening to those old cassettes.This is really a Marvel world as it should be, but if you are not into that world you still van enjoy it but too understand it all it will be hard.

It's all clear what this is about and the opening sequence do explains itself throughout the flick. And the opening sequence is so really well done, even as it doesn't gave any blood still it gives you the creeps. The sound and the prowler, it all works.But it really asks a lot of the viewer to sit throughout this flick.

It even has something to do with Poltergeist so you can guess what you will see.It was never scary or whatsoever, I think it failed a bit due the entities walking around. They weren't believable at all. The acting was okay but it fails storywise. The entities walking around in real life makes it a bit ridiculous. When Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) encounters them it wasn't convincing for me. It was in fact a mixture between Asian ghost stories and European ghost stories.

Again, I am an old school effect geek so CGI is not my cup of tea. But, again, here is a movie full of CGI. I didn't mind because I knew that you needed CGI to make this flick. A big cheer to those guys. It's unbelievable to see what they did, already seen The Day After Tomorrow (same guys) but this is a lot more. Sadly it fails in storyline. And that's the reason why it only got a 4 from me. Be honest, it becomes even childish, this is one of those over the top Hollywood productions that is so ridiculous that a 8 year old child never would be frightened. The happy ending, the take off twice with a plane, some things that make you go huh? The subway almost crashing into that plane.

But comments doesn't mean a thing, they made Ghost Rider 2 a few years later. Was it all that bad. Well, for the story itself there was indeed not that many action going on to make it look like a Spiderman or Batman. But the Ghost Rider himself isn't one that's after bad persons like in Batman or Spiderman. He's more out to catch the devil's son and other bad spirits. So that means that you will need a lot of effects and it do shows here that a lot of money went to the effects used. I'm not a CGI guy but here you do need it and it all looked 'marvel'lous. I did like the acting except for Eva Mendes. She wasn't believable and her acting wasn't that great for me. She had two other things that attracted you to the screen and sadly they did in stead of looking at her acting. It was fun to see Sam Elliot again, again as a cowboy and old glory Peter Fonda of Easy Rider (1969) fame. Funny to see him in another bike movie. Nicolas Cage does what he does best and it shows. It's funny to see that a guy who was in a lot of blockbusters decided to go for the B-flicks. I know that there are a lot of haters out but I still love him.

Knowing that it was a blah blah flick with not that much action I do gave it a try and I must say that it wasn't that bad after all. It makes you think who is worse, the creation of the creator?Let that be what this flick is all about. But I can't go that deep into the story not to give a spoiler away but it is what it is. A human falling a bit in love with a robot but who is using who? On part of the effects this is indeed stunning. The robot Ava does look excellent. But be warned, it's on the edge of an arty flick so I can understand that not everybody will be into this kind of flicks.With only 4 actors in it you do need a strong story and excellent performances and that's exactly what you get. I was also surprised of the nudity throughout this flick, it do has full frontal on many parts.Can't say any more except that the title do tell you what you will get.Gore 0/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5",8,2,5,16 February 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," just watch it for the Volturi's
","I am a martyr, I guess. My wife suggested to watch Twilight 2 yesterday. I had seen part 1 and it was a hell to sit through as you could see in my review. But all the fans told me and tried to convince me that in this vampire (sigh) flick there would be action. I agree, there is action...after waiting 90 minutes. Again it's a lot of blah blah and again it's one for teenagers. I just can't get it what an adult could love in this peace of celluloid shite, or you must be into Titanic and others of that kind. In the second part Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has to choose between Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) a vampire and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) a werewolf. That is in fact the story, which one will it be...oooooh scary isn't it. For me the wrong part was almost immediately in the movie, the glistening Edward Cullen while walking in the sun. I was looking forward to meet the werewolfs but sadly it was all CGI, and not from a perfect kind. I mean, if you have seen 'Wolfman' their they use CGI too but much better and scarier. Maybe I am getting old but if I say An American Werewolf In London or The Howling I guess you all know what I mean. The best part is in the last half hour and takes only 15 minutes to watch. Yes, real vampires, the Volturi. That was the only part that satisfied me. I thought, hey, Aro Volturi is great, reminded me of Interview With A Vampire and wait a minute, Aro is played by Michael Sheen, Lucian in the Underworld franchise. He really is the only one that gave a great performance. The other Volturi were great too but didn't say that much. It is really those gang of Volturi that makes the movie watchable but sadly, you will have to take the lamentations of the others to get to that scene, doing that I always annoyed my immortal one with listening to the soundtrack and guessing who's playing now...do I need to say more? And waiting for the end credits to see if I guessed them right.",3,7,9,26 August 2010
Transformers," the best CGI flick I have seen
","This was a must see when it came out and I've just watched it again 5 years later and still it is one of the best CGI flicks I have seen so far. There's nothing else special in this sci-fi flick to see, just watch it for the effects.The story itself wasn't that weak at all a thing we don't see that often with such kind of flicks. And even the acting was believable. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky) did a nice job here as the main lead. Of course he's the looser here and becomes the hero, that you could tell even as the flick isn't started yet. His opponent Megan Fox (Mikaela Banes) became the new big thing after Transformers although she was a bit too young aged 21. But she was voted already as one of the sexiest girls on our planet. The producers new it and she was more sexy in the next episode but it also became her downfall.I enjoyed it a lot with all the action going on between the soldiers and the Transformers but also the comedy added. Here and there you will have your laughs. But if you want to see the best CGI so far then see Transformers.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",8,20,33,17 December 2012

Evil Dead," awash in blood and graphic violence
","Let be The Evil Dead (1981) be in my top 5 list of best horrors ever. So I was waiting until the evil came out to finally see another failing remake I thought. But have heard only positive things about the remake I had my doubts. At last, after a lot of stupid remakes this one kicks you straight in the face. In fact, it's based on the original one. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved in making this flick and Fede Alvarez (the director) did a great job for his first full feature.Let me first of all say this. If you can't stand extreme gory horrors than stay away from this flick. It contains shock gore just for the gore. If you thought this was going to be a supernatural ride then forget it. This is really one for the gorehounds. Does it look like the original Evil Dead. Of course not. Back then a few effects were done with stop motion. Here we luckily have the real effects and okay, here and there some CGI which I didn't mind at all. But to go back on the original. Yes, it do has the chainsaw, yes it do has the slapping door, yes it do has the evil faces from back then and yes we do have the woods attacking a girl, but not raping her like in the original. Was it scary? It never was scary at one moment but still, you will watch it with your mouth open. From the opening sequence you are immediately into the Evil Dead ride. Why I do give kudos to the director is that he made the movie he wanted to make but to please the old school fans he added references to the original.The acting of course had to be good too and luckily it was. But did they do jokes like in the original. Not really, that was left out here, admit it, we are 30 years later!Finally, I'm happy to see that they didn't give a sh*t towards the ratings. They made Evil Dead as they wanted to make it, it's full of red stuff. Not done like the new horrors with digital animation. This is old school, this is great, for me a must see for the buffs walking this earth.

Saw II," the real start of Saw
","Leigh Whannell was back in business to write part 2. But times did changed due the original Saw. James wan had left the building in came Darren Lynn Bousman who also did a bit of writing. He stayed until part 4. Torture Porn, as the genre was called was the next big thing so they had to focus more on the gore. And they did, Saw II started of immediately with a device killing a victim. Back again was Jigsaw, and here he took the most important part of the story, it stayed that way until the end of the franchise. The focus of the story was here more on one of the coppers who's child is captured by Jigsaw. On the other hand, we had to go back to the devices made by Jigsaw. And here we had a bit of the feeling like in Cube. Cube was also very original but part 2 failed because you have seen it all before so here we got a bunch of scum being hold captured by Jigsaw. To survive they had to play the game. There is a bit that naturally had to do with the captured ones but it is a bit too focused on them. There's a part that in fact nothing has to do with the story. And the weird thing is that Shawnee Smith was back again as Amanda and was captured again by Jigsaw, it looked so stupid but wait until the last minutes. Again, the writers decided to keep the best for last. The best acting was done by Tobin Bell again followed by Donnie Wahlberg. Dina Meyer wasn't convincing for me as a copper, sadly I have met her and congenial wasn't her middle name. But they brought in more devices and more blood and even more torturing done on-screen. The most creepy device was simply the syringes being used as device. Saw II was something completely different from part one but it was more a horror than a police story with an unpredictable ending.End for the horror buffs, again two references towards old school horror, one is a picture hanging on the wall with a kind of pinhead design, the other is when jigsaw is showing the way he answers, the last house on the left...Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,1,5 December 2011
Clash of the Titans," hollow story line crashed by the amount of CGI
","The remake of a cult classic. Ray Harryhausen was responsible for the classic of the same title in 1981. What he used was stop/motion and it still works nowadays. I liked that flick a lot. Hollywood had to touch the classics because they are out of ideas. Most of them are failures and this version is a mediocre of the original. I never went into any of the characters because the makers were more busy with the CGI used then with the story itself. It do has a few good moments like with the scorpions but there wasn't anything new to see. Th world of the Gods and the humans didn't work for me. It worked in Thor (2011) or in Immortals (2011). But in both those flicks we had a bit of brutality a thing we are missing here. Sometimes it even reminded me a bit of another failure, Van Helsing (2004). The problem there was too the fact that they forgot to put an actual story to it. Just have a look here. The metal owl that was important in Ray's flick is only shown for a few moments. What I did like and worked was Medusa.They couldn't make it without CGI and I have nothing against it as it works but here it took the overhand and you never really get into the story. While writing my review I'm thinking who played who and that's not a good point.Still, it entertains and for those never seen Ray's version it will deliver. But I was more into Ray's version. Maybe they went for a low rating so children could attend it at theatres. There's no nudity and no blood to spot. Yeah yeah, I know, one person is thrown in two by the scorpion but it is shown quickly.

Jurassic World," can't beat Jurassic Park
","It's been 22 years ago since the first Jurassic Park conquered the world and still being an excellent flick. A new generation of youth is ready to go back to the park and finally the much acclaimed Jurassic World is open to visit. I went to see the new breed of dinosaurs but wasn't shocked in what I saw.Going back 22 years it was stunning to see people walk amongst the first creatures who walked the earth. Even the story was great but nowadays those effects are seen in every movie. Just see what Godzilla did last year. So yes, on part of the effects it's all great but nothing new and the story isn't going to put you at the edge of your seat. This is exactly what it must do, no gore, no nudity, no shocking things, just a flick you watch with your whole family. Even if they are under 10 it's all watchable. And the story, well, it's what you've seen in the original one. Things go wrong at the park, and children have to be saved. The raptors are back again and their alpha is a human, can see coming from a stone age what they will do at the end. Predictable blockbuster to make the new youngsters at home warm to go back to the original flick(s). Pure entertainment.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",6,6,15,17 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," THE hype of 2009
","I must admit, I bought it straight away when it came out on DVD. Due the lack of professional camera's I didn't want it on Blu Ray. The same with House Of The Devil. When the movie came out, again, everybody who knows I'm into horror told me, this is one for you, or, watch it alone...in the dark. Hee haw, here come the bone people. I waited until the hype was over to watch it, what about that, ey? The same with Avatar. I am not going to review it, the only thing I can say is, 9 out of 10 for the CGI, 5 for the story. For me it was Titanic in space. To much about a love story. I watched the theatrical and the unrated version of PA to see what's the difference. Well, it's all about an alternate ending. For me the theatrical ending was better. The unrated one is rougher. But is it worth the hype? I must admit, it's the Blair Witch of the '00. It was made real cheap, no stage settings, no special effects (almost none), no more than 5 actors, unknown so far. And a director who was unknown before the movie came out. It made a lot of money and, sadly, they are in pre-production for PA 2. Leave it please. And again, there are already some rip offs of the movie. For a horror geek, let's say, it isn't really that scary. It do has his moments but most of the time it plays with your urban fears. For non horror people out there this surely will give you goosebumps. Yes, I also got my share of it the last 5 minutes. It starts of real easy, and it builds his tension, slowly. Oh yes, it was all figured out pretty well, the editing, the fast forward and it works. Somehow, you care about Katie. It could happen to yourself. There isn't any blood in it, not to mention I mean, no nothing really. You just have to wait until the demon or entity pops up. But it is the decay of Katie that get's you. What would you do when it would happen to you? Little by little the movie get's rougher. I can agree by watching trailers that people really jumped in their seats. It clocks in just under 90 minutes and that's okay. There's a 99 minute version, way to long. The last scene really got me, the screaming of Katie. The off camera suggesting what's going on, the...well watch it for yourself. Do some activity, plug it in your machinery.",6,0,2,18 May 2010

Further on you will have a love scene but how the cult react to that, another one that will disgust a lot.If you are into flicks about a cult and can stand gore and nudity then this is for you, otherwise you will left with a bitter feeling.Gore 5/5

Elysium," seen it all before but still worth picking up
","It's always a problem when first time directors are making a hit or a classic and are asked to make a big budget flick. Let M. Night Shyamalan be a perfect example. Here we have Neill Blomkamp who after directing a few Stargate episodes made a big break-through with District 9 (2009). He was the next big thing and here we stand with his SF big budget Elysium.You still can spot some District elements but Elysium will never become a classic because it does not add anything to the genre. It's just the villain becomes hero story. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth seeing and the acting is superb but it's a bit weak on the storyline. Not that it is a bad flick, it do jumps out of all the summer releases of 2013 and it do has suspense and excellent effects but I just had a bitter feeling when it was over.

Drag Me to Hell," a bit of a let down
","The whole horror scene was waiting for the return of Sam Raimi to the genre. And after years he finally did. Drag Me To Hell is his return, but for me it was a bit of a let down. Okay, I didn't expect a new Evil Dead but what I was waiting for was a new gory flick to be added to his fame, well, it isn't. The storyline is okay and the acting is okay but by returning with his old pals Nicotero and company I really thought that the effects wouldn't be what they are now. My God, there is so much CGI in it, hold your horses. Indeed, with the handkerchief you have to do it CGI, no probs with that, but when the anvil drops down, no way I can accept that from Nicotero. And was it frightening, not really, not for me, yeah, the scene's were you jump out of your seat are in the movie but somehow, it didn't work for me. And no gore is available, the red stuff flows but for Raimi, no can do. It's a shame that this movie is a major project. The geeks will have to deal with the fact that Raimi never will make another Evil Dead.",5,1,3,18 November 2009
Saw," instant classic
","People asked me why didn't you review Saw when it came out. Simply, back then, seven years ago, you had to wait almost a year for the DVD release. When it came out part 2 was already at the cinemas. So I had to wait until they finished the franchise which was last year. But then again, it wasn't that simple to know what DVD or Blu Ray to pick up, because some were bloody versions or uncut or directors cut. All versions I have are the longest versions, I do have the German collector editions on Kinowelt, they are all uncut. It was my wife who came home one evening, she had won a screening, from the cinema and told me, I just have seen Saw, this is for you babe. And indeed, it became one of my 'things'. What did it for me is the storyline. There are so many twists that you just couldn't see coming. It was based on James Wan's short of 9 minutes called, sigh, Saw. He directed it, Leigh Whannell wrote it in 2003. With that short they went out to hunt a production team who wanted to make it a full feature. Nobody really believed in it but they were so wrong, the merchandise and the franchise it created was beyond limits. Leigh Whannell also played as David in the short and appeared as Adam in the full feature. What attracted me was that it was in fact just a simple police story with the focus on two victims of a serial killer. But what you couldn't see coming was that it contained a bit of real squeamish parts. The red stuff do flows and it is just on the border of gore. Due the fact that there were some really messy parts it created a new genre called Torture Porn, one year later Hostel was released and was gory as hell, with a bit of the same story, torturing for fun. The end of Saw is the strongest ending I have seen so far because what happens isn't predictable at all, and due that people start talking about Saw as they did about the reversed bear trap. The focus here wasn't really on Jigsaw, the serial killer. He was involved but wasn't the main concern of the coppers. But viewers were tricked by the writer of saw. The acting itself was really sublime especially by the victims Cary Elwes. It's also weird that most of the original actors didn't came back in the other parts, only in flashbacks. But naturally it's Jigsaw that steels the show, what Tobin Bell did was really creating a new hero for the horror geeks. This is his best role ever for me. Is it me or my imagination but I clearly saw some winks to the genre. When the so-called boogeyman appears in the closet just look how they filmed him, you just saw his eye in the closet, Black Christmas 1974 indeed. And at the end the closing of the metal door, Texas Chainsaw Massacre indeed. This is a must see for horror fans or people who liked a good police story like Seven or In Dreams.

Mama," a lot of jump scene's and it looked great except for the ending
","Mama was the revelation of the film festival in Brussels. Everybody was screaming towards the screen and it even went so far that newspapers in Belgium were talking about THE horror flick to watch. So I did and I must say that I had mixed feelings about the flick. I don't have any problem with Guillermo del Toro. I liked his flick Pan's labyrinth (2006) and I even could dig his remake of Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark (2010). But there lays the problem for horror buffs. There's always something fairy tale attached to his creatures. Just look at Don't Be Afraid...The monsters did look scary but they were full CGI and they could come straight out of a Disney flick or Lord Off The Rings or The Hobbit. I think you know what I mean.Here the creature does look scary, even as it is done CGI, and the flick do has a lot of jump scene's that really worked. I even liked the story because the acting by the two children in the beginning in the cabin (after 5 years) was amazing. You just can't see what is coming and I sometimes even had the feeling that I was watching one of those Japanese ghost horror stories, you know, with the hair coming out of the wall or ceiling. We do have a bit of that too. I know that Del Toro was executive producer but that means that he delivers the money so his influence in the way it was made is clearly to spot. I was thinking, yes I can understand the hype but once everything comes clear about the mama ghost and the child it slowly turns in a bit of pathetic flick. For me the ending was a let down. I won't go into that part because a lot is already said about the ending. If you like horror flicks with a lot of jump scene's than this is surely your thing and somehow I enjoyed it too. It even became creepy at moments but the ending. You will love it or hate it. But watch it especially for Megan Charpentier (the red queen in the last Resident Evil) and Isabelle Nélisse as Victoria and Lilly.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,1,21 April 2013
Super 8," E.T. nowadays
","people told me to stay away from this flick because I probably wouldn't like it. The reason was that Steven Spielberg was involved. To be honest, I don't have any problems with the man, his early work I liked a lot, for example Duel (1971) and Jaws (1975) but later on he became tame and made flicks in the style of Disney, polished and made for the whole family. J.J. Abrams was also involved. Men, did I like Alias (2001 - 2006). It was so great and he really did add suspense towards the series and his early flicks but slowly (around Cloverfield (2008)) he also moved further to major productions although Fringe is still excellent. Both directors collide in Super 8 and it shows. After seeing it i thought, well, this is just E.T. for the next generation. The effects are sublime but nothing really happens. In fact due the youth involved it reminded me of E.T. and the army did ring a bell too, Close Encounters Of A Third Kind (1977), another Spielberg gem. You can easily spot that J.J. tried to do something with the monster, it do attacks but no blood or gore is added towards that monster. But the overall look of the monster (CGI) is laughable. You never see the monster until the last part and J.J. clearly tried to redo Cloverfield. I enjoyed the references by the youth who are trying to make a Super 8 flick towards horror and books concerning make-up. But further it had nothing to deliver even as the kids did a fine job acting.

Sinister I didn't watch back then but waited a few months. Somehow I had a bad feeling with this.And I was right. There was a bit too much of talking going on. And when the ghosts appear it looked a bit laughable too. Although that it had a few nice killings, sadly on 8mm. A true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) comes across some snuff 8mm. Je wants to know the truth behind it but it isn't what it looks, is it a serial killer or a ghost at work. It never scared me or gave me any jump moments. Even when the films over and things are over you could guess what will happen next, never okay if you have that feeling. The acting on the other hand is sublime but there was an overall look that never made it look like a horror. A mainstream horror clearly made not to have a R-rating.

","It's strange that I haven't reviewed this one earlier. I have seen it in 2005 and up to know still remembers it as a very good horror flick. But due to part 2 over here they released part 1 on Blu-Ray. The DVD I had was sometimes way too dark to see what was happening, but I knew what a LED TV and Blu-Ray could do with the blackest parts, ideal to see. I knew what was going to happen but still it does have it's moments. The originality lays in the fact that it is played by girls. You will only see one guy, sadly he dies quickly. just before he dies you know he's going to say something, that being revealed at the end. Not only the guy dies but also his child. From there on we start to know the characters. It's girl power and they are going to 'descent' a cave. Of course, showing off, one girl decides to enter an unknown cave but not telling the others. Things go from bad to worse. Blood flows copiously and even sometimes it becomes gory. The acting is superb. Being in trouble all secrets between the girls are revealed and that also give them something to worry about. Once the creatures appear, it's 100% horror. It's beautiful filmed, perfect editing and they knew how to use the score. I would classify it together with the Spanish version of 'REC' (better than the remake). And saying that people say part 2 is better...",8,2,5,21 December 2010
The Happening," first 15 minutes were great, but then it's one big farce
","What a great title because this happening is exactly what broke the success of director M. Night Shyamalan. Once mighty with The Sixth Sense (1999) and been called the next big thing I must say that Unbreakable (2000) still delivered the good stuff but from that moment his flicks were becoming laughable and let be The Happening one big sad joke.The only thing worth seeing are the first 15 minutes when people start falling down and suicidal tendencies are the hype of the moment without any explanation. After 15 minutes this flick has nothing to offer except boring situations, no suspense and even no horror or science-fiction. The only thing I could think of was indeed the fact that earth will one day take revenge towards humans because we are destroying earth but here it was laughable and one big farce.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," the fall of the robots
","Were Transformers (2007) brought us something new this brings us a thing that I have some problems with. On part of the acting I don't have any problems but it's the way some things are done and shown that made me think, what the hell, this is for kiddies. The effects are again sublime but I do had a few problems with some transformers. There are two small cars that can transform, once they did they really reminded me of Cars (2006). They had teeth that were laughable and they also act childish. That doesn't add anything and makes this flick going towards the jokes done in M.I.B. (1997). But not only that, the talking of those small spider robots I didn't like either. In the first flick they talk their language but now they can talk English with an accent and again it doesn't make them believable anymore. The story itself is rather good although it's written in two sentences. There's still a part of The Cube on earth, by coincidence it's in Sam's hands. Megan Fox is here two years older than in Transformers and she is indeed more sexy and could have been the next thing but she showed that her mind was a terrible thing to taste. She had said stupid things toward the director Michael Bay and towards others which has led to the fall of Megan Fox. From becoming a blockbuster girl she is almost not seen anymore. She only performed in Jennifer's Body (2009) that was worth mentioning but was broken down by critics. The end for Fox.For me The Revenge Of The Fallen is on the edge of becoming ridiculous but the effects made it worth watching. Watchable with teens due the way the robots are shown this time.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",7,0,2,18 December 2012
The Witch," about the Dark Ages and a family going mad
","Another flick that some will love and others will turn off after a few minutes because this is just about characterisation. Don't get me wrong, it's not your straight casual horror, this has other things to offer. It takes place in 1630 and we do follow a family who are extremely Christians but when their newborn son go missing and the crops fails they are sure that one of them is a witch. the language used can be difficult for some because they do speak like in that era. It's just about this family and towards the end you will see if there was a which among the family of it was all in their minds. The spoken words and the score used will turn a lot away but if you are fond of the dark ages and all witchery going on back then then this is a must see, if you think this is the next Witchfinder general (1968) with all the torturing then you are wrong, it's just mom and dad and their children. nothing to do with effects just a pure story.Gore0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 1,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Null,0,4,18 April 2016

","A friend of mine showed the trailer months ago of this weird cartoon. Being a full feature I didn't know if it would work out fine, face it. Food at a grocery store hoping to be bought to go to the great beyond, which means, leaving the supermarket. In fact the believe in the great beyond is what for humans is the believe in heaven and hell and God. We do follow a sausage and a bun, do I need to say more? yes, it's not for your toddlers to watch because it's all about sex and swearing all the time. There's even some horror once food is at the kitchen, they all think that they are eternal and are going to, well, just watch it once a potato is being washed and then skinned alive. It's all there, some fascism, racism, laughing with food that doesn't fit in, sure, it's all about humans. But it's all shown in a funny way, the names they have. Have a look at the disabled gum, anybody...Stephen Hawking...No Disney this time with the gangbang at the end, but 90 minutes of a no-brainer, and it's great.

Joker," Awesome
","So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5

Scream 2," still delivers good moments but some scene's are a bit too long
","Immediately after the hype surrounding Scream (1996) and the start of a new horror genre it was clear that part 2 was on it's way as soon as possible. Again directed by Wes Craven it should be another hit.Not that it was that bad but some scene's took too long (espescially towards the end) and the plot like in the original one wasn't anywhere to spot. But it is still worth picking up but not that gory as the original one. What was nice is that all characters were back with their original thespians and that did add something towards the belief in the story. Another success it became and the franchise was started. For me it's still okay but not a masterpiece like the 1996 flick. If you look to other flicks that came out picking in on the Scream success then this is a better one then the others.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7,2,3,15 September 2016
It Chapter Two," too long but still worth seeing
","So close after part one already a next step into the story. But people said it's better then part one but clocking in at 3 hours I was wondering if it could deliver.It (no pun intended) did here and there. Some scenes were too long, especially when we have throwbacks to explain stuff. That's okay if yoy haven't seen the first one but not needed if you have seen it. Some humor thrown in here and there surely adds towards the rating of It chapter Two.But still, it's a horror. And it's in that region that it's better than the first one. Full of jump moments and some really well done effects. Even so good that you started to forget Pennywise himself. But when he comes in he surely brings in the horror. The end is a bit the same of sigh the forst one, same house, same things to destroy him.Is it all that good, not all. Nope, what the hell with the killing of the child in the beginning. Nothing happens afterwards with her story. Still, I enjoyed it but a bit too long as said before.

Dark Shadows," hard to review not knowing the original series
","A bit of a difficult on to review as I haven't seen the original 1966 series. i knew that it had horror and comedy in it and that's exactly what we do see here. On the other hand I also didn't found it a typical Tim Burton flick.Johnny Depp is really looking great as Barnabas Collins, his stiff and on the other hand funny. There are a few good horror moments but in fact it's more about the comedy and situations. Not that it was bad at all. The original cast of Dark Shadows do appear at the party, sadly Jonathan Frid (the original Barnabas) died shortly after. What was funny was that we do have a gig of Alice Cooper in his clothes from the seventies. I liked that part a lot. I also liked the performance of Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) wasn't that bad neither. Still it's not my favorite Tim Burton flick but I enjoyed it as a starter of a horror night.

Kong: Skull Island," Jurassic Park mixed with Apocalypse Now
","Especially in the beginning before the enter the island were Kong lives this is a pure ode to Apocalyose Now (1979). The score used, the shots from the helicopters and the way the cinematography was done will remind a lot of people towards the old flicks about the Vietnam war. It's once on the island that the action really begins and it starts immediately with an apocalypse (no pun intended). The effects are stunning and it's from that point that this flick turns into a fight against the creatures on one point and another bunch of guys are trying to survive. From there on the mix between the titles said in my summary starts. But don't get me wrong. It's not a remake of King Kong (all issues). It stands on it's own and of we go in a flick full of great effects. Not a flick to watch with youngsters because when fighting against the creatures it's full of creepy suspense.Better than expectedGore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",8,6,10,28 April 2017

","Even as the story is predictable still this flick is full of suspense and action. And luckily not a love story because it's just on the edge sometimes that I thought, oh no here we go again, You know it, best friend is dead and his ex is falling in love with you, Well, maybe they do feel a thing but it's left out of this flick.And each time I thought, okay, the movie is over something happens or a twist is coming and we are back on track for a few minutes. They even fooled me in the beginning.Not a superhero like Bond or those kind of flicks but a pure action/revenge. Well done.

Arrival," mysterious Sci-Fi flick
","I really can't say what I was expecting from this Sci-Fi flick. 'Cause I mean, seeing trailers it showed me no action but it did showed me aliens. And being hyped as the flick of 2016 I went for it with precaution.It's not your usual Sci-Fi flick. This do has aliens but it's more about understanding them and asking why they are on earth. so there's to be honest no action going on and it's all about blah blah and going back again and again to the spaceship. But even as it clocked in around 2 hours I never found it boring. But I can understand that people seeking for shooting and action and horror or creepy moments will be disappointed. It does have a rather creepy score especially when they enter the spaceship. But at the end of the movie I was left with many questions. What about those 3000 years they are talking about. Why were they here on earth and why they left. On part of effects, even there it's low. So, this isn't going to be the next Alien (1979), it's more like Close Encouters Of The Third Kind (1977) towards the end but stretched for 2 hours. If you like mystery pick it up, weird it is and it do makes you think about it after wards.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,7,12 December 2016

","The surprise at the Oscars. So finally I got the time to see what's it all about and I must say. It's a simple story but it works out really fine. In fact, it's a story about home invasion but not in a horror way but in a normal way, lower-class invades upper-class.Even as it is spoken in a language that needs subtitles I had a smile on my face in some situations. But it's also weird what is happening in the basement. I had a bit of problems what is happening in the basement with the lights, it's funny but also a thing you can't believe.But I agree, I understand for a flick coming out of a country not known for flicks that this is Oscar worthy.

The Conjuring," better and more frightening then the Insidous saga
","James Wan, who had a break through with Saw (2004) was the kind of director I wanted to follow. Have seen Insidious (2010) his effort into the possession genre I had some mixed emotions. I didn't found it scary. The follow-up, Insidious 2 (2013) had the same problems as part 1, it wasn't really scary. But in between those two flick Wan decided to make a real scary possession flick like we used to see in the eighties. And let this be this one here, The Conjuring.Again, it's beautifully filmed and it surely had the feeling like those old school horrors. It takes a while before things go wrong but it just doesn't matter because I was sitting on the edge of my seat to know how this would end. What failed in Insidious, the way the ghost appear, did work out fine here. Even as they also walk around somehow it's more frightening than Insidious.

Scream," the flick that started a new era
","For years horror was a not done in Hollywood until this flick suddenly hit the screen. Why it started a new era was rather simple. Wes Craven, the director was done with all those horrors full with CGI and almost no gore. After the end in the mid eighties of the slashers it was time to go back and restart it he thought so Scream came out full of red stuff and gory moments.What also did work was the fact that it was full of questions towards the old school horror. The killer on the phone did ask who was the killer in certain flicks so horror buffs did like the trivia throughout Scream. But it just all fits together, the acting, the story, the gore, the killings. Wes Craven was back and how. Suddenly horror was back on the list in Hollywood and even as Scream created a franchise it also spawned a lot of new horror flicks until this writing. Horror was back and made money, even today.A must see for all geeks out there because it's full of horror and not that much of blah blah like we've seen in the I Know franchise.

Prometheus," some good moments but also disappointing
","And again I was afraid to see a movie in 3D. I mean, most of them are done to attract people because producers are afraid that their flick would flop. The same here, everybody was expecting so much of this prequel to Alien (1979) also directed by Ridley Scott. Naturally Ridley also moved forward in film making and were Alien didn't had a big budget, Prometheus had big money and it shows. The effects used are really unbelievable at some times but of course effects doesn't make a movie.It does, but that's for other science-fiction flicks with no history. But here everybody wanted to know what happened with the ship found in the original Alien. Remember that the crew of the deep space mining ship Nostromo are awaken from hypersleep to investigate a strange signal from a nearby planet. While investigating the signal, they discover it was intended as a warning, and not an SOS. This is what Prometheus is all about. Why did they send that warning signal.I was expecting aliens and facehuggers and all of that but nothing here at all of those creatures. In fact Prometheus was out in space to search for the origin of mankind. It's done by archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). They discovered that star maps of different ancient cultures (Sumarian, Maya's, Egyptian,...) all show the same configuration. Of they go to find the planet (LV-223) with money from Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Weyland do rings a bell toward the original Alien but the planet was LV-426. From there on we do have resemblances towards the original one, they have an android (Michael Fassbinder) on board and they do travel in hibernation. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the mission director is a bit afraid of the planet and warns them not to touch anything. Of course they do due circumstances and things go awry on the planet.From that moment I thought that it all would start but we already had a lot of talking and special effects. Sadly the monsters do attack and enter throats of humans but they leave soon and we have to wait until the final before some kind of octopus alien returns and attacks. The special effects do their work but still it is a bit of horror science-fiction and I was left with a hunger for the aliens to attack. This movie is more about the origin of mankind then were the aliens were coming from. There's indeed on alien to see in the last minutes, not as in the other alien flicks but an earlier version of it.On part of the acting I found Noomi Rapace doing well and somehow she reminded me of Ripley. Fassbinder was also doing very well but Charlize Theron couldn't convince me. Again she's playing some kind of ice queen and we all have seen that before. This prequel did remind me a bit of the prequel to The Thing (2011). It was just made to earn some money on the cult status of the original flick. Although that the ending of The Thing (2011), in fact the scene's seen in between the end credits, was stronger than Prometheus. Overall it wasn't that bad at all but it would have been better that it didn't had anything to do with Alien and it's followers. Here we do see the Gods (called Engineers) out there to destroy mankind, Nothing of that in the other flicks. Okay, maybe when they enter that terrestrial spaceship in Alien you can see an Engineer sitting in some kind of chair but nothing is said about that. I really was left with a bitter feeling. People who hasn't (anyone?)seen Alien will love this, you will see attacks of a squid kind of creature but for the followers it just doesn't deliver and explain.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,4,7,23 June 2012
Halloween," a classic still working nowadays
","What a classic this is. So low on everything just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre but still people believe to think that they saw gore and blood. But they were so wrong. It is the atmosphere and the way of filming that created this classic. Due the fact that there is a lot of talking in it still you are attracted to the screen because John Carpenter did an excellent job. But don't forget the cast in it who are all believable and giving the best of themselves. Halloween was low budget and started a new era in horror. The slasher genre. Friday the 13th was written soon after Halloween and they wanted to copy the story but on a location and look, another classic was born. Both had some kind of supernatural killer and a soundtrack that still sticks in your mind after all those years. Friday had K-K-K-Kill Ma-ma-ma-ma and Halloween had the well known riddle made by Carpenter. As I said before you also have to mention the way the camera was used. Extreme long shots and shots revealing things after a while. Funny was to see that on television The Thing(1951)was playing. John remade it 4 years after Halloween. But naturally Halloween had it's problems with releasing it on DVD. That's a strange thing because there's no gore or blood in it as I said before so in Europe it was released at 87 minutes, the US version was 93 minutes and the NBC extended version was 104 minutes. I have seen all versions in one day just to see where they have added something or had made some cuts. The difference between the US and European version lays in the fact that there were more cuts in the nudity. Okay, there wasn't that much nudity in it, only in the beginning and P.J.Soles making love with her friend. In the U.S; version there's more to see from her breasts then in the European version were they cut out the nipple shots. But it's the extended version that had a difference of 11 minutes. here in Europe it isn't that easy to find the extended version, it's available on a German limited release but it easy to get in the US. NBC bought the rights for 4 million dollar of Halloween to show it on television. But the Standards and Practice Department made a cut in the original movie so NBC didn't had a full feature anymore to broadcast. John Carpenter was asked to shoot some extra scene's to beef up the running time. John agreed and 11 minutes were shot in conjunction with the production of Halloween 2. Debra Hill brought John back for a 3 day shoot with stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. It was edited to the original feature ready for a NBC broadcast. For many people the extended version isn't a need to see but for Halloween buffs it's a must see. There were 4 separate scene's, the best being Loomis' talk with Michael when he was a child . The scene follows just after Michael has killed his sister, and it's the longest scene. We see Michael as a child, a part that was important in Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. Here you see Dr. Loomis talking to Michael at Smith's Grove but naturally he's not responding. Many had a problem with it stating it as taking the horror from Michael away because you can see his face and was wearing normal clothes. Another television scene involves Dr. Loomis discussing Michael's release with the hospital board. It didn't deliver an extra to the flick but it gets a bit deeper into the mind of Loomis. A third scene is of Loomis visiting Michael's room after his escape. The room is shattered and trashed with the word 'sister' scratched into the back of the door. The final scene involves Laurie answering her door and finding her friend being followed by Michael via a station wagon. So in fact non of those scene's had any gore or red stuff in it.I have said it before, it hasn't any red stuff but it's the score and the eerie atmosphere that gives the creeps. Some things just take too long before things happens but it is that waiting that works. Just look at Michael waiting disguised as a ghost at a door before doing his killing. A creepy shot, or the way he looked when he pinned a boy at a door. You can see that he had no feelings or whatsoever. A must have in a horror collection just like Carpenter's other flick The Thing. It still works nowadays, a classic.Gore 1/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",9,1,5,15 November 2011

","Was I looking forward to see this because as a kid I grew up with Wonder Woman. And watching it in 3D I thought this really was going to be good. But at the end I was left with a bitter feeling. The 3D wasn't special. The story was a bit weird and it was way too long. It reminded me a lot of Batman vs Superman (2016). That flick was also way too long and did had a rare story.I enjoyed Wonder Woman when the story was told were she grew up. Guess it took the first 20 minutes but suddenly a man comes ashore and he's the first man they ever saw but not only that and from there it's downhill, he brings war with him. So off goes Wonder Woman to help the soldier in WWI. Really? The effects were good but that doesn't make a flick especially with superheroes. And the fact that love also takes a whole bite throughout Wonder Woman. No, for me this was a disappointment. A bit like Suicide Squad (2016), You've seen the trailers and it all looks stunning until you sit back and watch the movie. The fact that Lynda Carter (the real Wonder Woman) didn't had a cameo made me only eager to see the 1975 series again. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",5,3,13,15 July 2017
The Woman in Black," Daniel did well and never reminded me of you know who...(HP)
","Another release from the new Hammer studios. This is maybe the most look-a-like Hammer so far. Still some will have nostalgia towards the old Gothic Hammers with Cushing and Lee but that's over. The acting done then and the way it was filmed is over. Back to reality. They really made a risk by giving the lead role to Harry Potter, I correct, Daniel Radcliffe. And naturally you will compare it to Potter but I must say that he did so well here and Potter is forgotten. So far so good and I would even go further. This time it was scary. Let me explain. It isn't a slasher or whatsoever, this is a pure ghost story but it do has some jump scenes in it. And I can understand that newspapers were writing about people screaming in their seats at the cinemas. That's because youth thought they were going to see some, sorry, Harry Potter stuff.James Watkins was the director here and I must admit that he knew his stuff by directing Eden Lake (2008), a flick I liked a lot. It isn't fast moving but it got my full attention. It's not a flick full of red stuff it even didn't got any nudity like the old Hammers. I liked it and I guess Hammer did good with giving Daniel the lead. It will attract old Hammers geeks and it will attract Harry geeks. On part of the effects naturally they used CGI but it didn't bother me because we are looking at ghosts. The best Hammer so far, I mean from the new Hammer.

The Wolverine," no real plot but watchable and bad 3D
","I always had mixed feelings about flicks about superhero's and the X-men wasn't any exception. Still, you watch them and sometimes are left with a bitter feeling. The spin-off Wolverine gave us a new twist on the X- men story. It's naturally all about the Wolverine Logan but we do have other characters from X-men in it so you have to know a bit of the story and The Wolverine is no exception. It doesn't stand on it's own. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) do plays an important role even as she's in it for a few minutes. Nevertheless, if you don't know any of the history you can watch it but you will be left with some questions. Especially at the end, be aware that, a thing we do see often nowadays, not to turn the disc on stop, even as the end credits are running suddenly we move back to the flick and it's a really important part. Nothing to do with The Wolverine but with the whole X-men saga. The flick itself wasn't that bad at all but you have to understand the Japanese world to like this picture because it all take place in Japan and has a mixture of Samurai and Yakuza. I had two problems with this flick, but one I could get over, it doesn't has any blood or cruelty all over the flick, sure, The Wolverine gets hurt but heals himself but I mean, when swords are battling with Logan, we never see swords going into the flesh, or when the wolverine gets mad and smashes his claws into the flesh it's all done off-camera. But I knew that before, it was rated 12 years. But I did had a problem with the 3D. It just never worked out. here and there but I never had the 3D experience I had with other blockbusters. The effects on the other hand are good but not sublime. The train scene is excellent but their were other effects like the healing that I didn't like at all.Mixed emotions again with the X-men..., simple story line and of course an open ending..For many the best so far in the X-men franchise.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," bizarre story
","I'm not going into what is right and wrong concerning comics and the flick itself because I'm not into those comics. I went to a private screening at the world premiere, the place was full with Batman geeks vs Superman geeks, the T-shirts showed it all so their reaction could tell a lot.I did like Batman, The Dark Knight (2008). For me the best so far into the franchise. Superman wasn't my thing but to see those two together it was worth the wait. Have seen it once over at the reception you could easily spot two camps, the pro's and the contra's and no in-between. And I must say that i really had to think about what I just saw. The opening I could dig with, again, the history of Bruce Wayne seeing his parents being killed. But then Bruce falls into some kind of cave and is levitated by bats. From there on this flick takes a weird turn. You move over to Doomsday and the world being destroyed and then suddenly Superman appears from the sky, a bit hard to take. Of course they become enemies but towards the end they do fight together against Lex the bad guy. Once they are out for a fight the story goes really awkward with monster coming in and Wonder Woman showing up. The effects used are stunning but sometimes it's really dark, especially in the world (Gotham) of the Bat. And things are filmed in extreme close-ups so you don't know exactly what you are seeing. When Batman is fighting that is great with all his moves and equipment used. Superman is great too, flying away and having his special eyes but I can understand that some will have their doubts about this flick. Not the thing I thought I was going to see but above mediocre, that I can tell.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",7,7,20,24 March 2016
Beowulf," excellent CGI flick with great performances
","I came across this flick due two reasons, the first one is very simple, it's cheaply to catch on Blu Ray these days and this is one you must see on Blu Ray. Secondly the director, Robert Zemeckis isn't an unknown name to me. He produced a few flicks in my genre, Bordello Of Blood (1996) and The Frighteneres (1996) and he went further towards Thi13ten Ghosts (2001) were he started to use CGI, it went further to Ghost ship (2002) notable for the opening sequence, full CGI. So it became clear that CGI was his thing, and even now as a director he's going for CGI, this flick and his latest one Real Steel (2011) are full of CGI. Beowulf is even a full CGI flick. Still he's most notorious with directing the Back To The Future trilogy.People who follow me on the Web do know that I'm not a CGI lover, it's so cold and especially in my genre (horror) it doesn't work at all but here it does work. It reminded me of Final Fantasy (1994) were the faces of the actors were digitally disguised. But Beowulf actually even had a good script. Even as it looks that you are gaming still you get involved into the characters and you are in the flick from the start. What also works is that once Beowulf is becoming a king things move further with the lie of Beowulf. It's funny to see that if it would have been made without CGI it rather would be a gory flick because the CGI blood do flow frequently. I wont recommend it to everybody but if you are into mythology then this is your thing or if you like fantasy than pick this up. On the part of the acting, they were all very believable and so many geeks were waiting for the mother of Grendel to appear out of the water to see her (Angelina Jolie) attractive figure. I liked this flick more then the Comic flicks that are out there because our hero has some dark secrets and isn't what he seems to be.

Midway," great WWII flick
","When I saw the trailer of this flick I thought, hell it's been a while since I have seen a flick about WWII. I grew up with them in the seventies and eighties. Knowing a lot about the battle at Midway but not all the details I was glad I have seen this war flick.It wasn't that bad and luckily it's about the battle itself and not all the love and wifes left behind so on that part I was satisfied. What i also liked were the fact that the Japanese did talk their own language.The effects also did had a big part in this flick and they were stunning. Towards the end you will see thefaces of the real heroes and what honors they received. After all it was a important battle in WWII.I won't compare it with the 1976 flick with Hston and Fonda, you just can't do it due the difference on the effects. Still, over here it flopped it was only one week in theaters but I enjoyed it, over 2 hours were over before I knew it.

The Purge," hey producers, purge yourselves
","After the success of Sinister with Ethan Hawke and the major success of Games Of Thrones with Lena Headey Hollywood had to find a way to make money out of both. Well here's the result, the weak The Purge.The story is very weak and even Ethan or Lena could convince me. In fact, the only one who convinced me was Rhys Wakefield as the polite leader. The story itself takes place in the future even as none of the future is shown. So that was already a big disappointment. Not only that, the story itself was rather weak and some things were so predictable that you can see clearly that this was made on the success of both leading thespians. I must say that there are some brutal moments but if you would like to see some creepy home invading flicks go watch The Strangers (2008), remember the masks. Or go see the classic A Clockwork Orange (1971) for the home invasion or if you want it brute see, A L'intérieur (2007). It do has a few good moments but Hollywood had to purge themselves before cashing in on weak projects, be ashamed producers!Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",5,2,4,3 September 2013
Godzilla," takes too long before Godzilla comes in
","One of those over-hyped flicks of the year 2014 so expectations were high. Have seen it in 3D I only can say that I liked the 3D even if it wasn't that stunning like in The Hobbit franchise but it do works sometimes rather good. On part of the story itself it was okay but hey, shouldn't it be going all about Godzilla? Mostly you don't watch these monster flicks for the acting but you rather watch it for the monsters itself and there lays the problem. The main actor Godzilla itself isn't that much to catch in this flick, that's a bit sad because I was left with a hunger after one hour with the only question, when will he come? Once Godzilla is there the action really starts and the CGI and effects used are indeed okay but by then it's a bit too late. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a bad flick but face it, we are overwhelmed with monster flicks the last years (Pacific Rim (2013) for example) who are full of action between the monsters itself and that's what Godzilla is in fact all about, Godzilla do saves the world after all.It starts rather good with excellent performance by Brian Cranston we all know of Breaking Bad and I was hooked on the screen. But once we move further 15 years it just starts to become a mediocre flick. I wasn't alone watching it and all I can here was where's Godzilla? Still worth picking up if you do like flicks about giant monsters and naturally Godzilla lovers will have it in their collection but at the end of the day, it wont stick in your mind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,5,9,13 November 2014
Life," not a straight horror but still worth picking up
","Now that I have seen this science-fiction horror I do understand the low ratings. I mean, for me it wasn't that bad after all but it surely isn't an Alien look-a-like. Not that it has to be but by which I mean. There is action between the crew and the creature but there's more in the story then pure horror.By doing so you move away from a scary flick into a deeper story all about love and friendship. But look, I don't want to be negative. It is still worth picking up because the creature from Mars is still a nasty one. The strength of Life lays in the fact that all characters do have a leading role and that some die rather quickly. It's a new way of making films or series these days, Just look at Game Of Thrones or The Walking Dead, they do the same. But mentioning both series, they do offer gore and horror and a lot of red stuff.Life doesn't do that but the effects are also stunning. For example blood do moves strangely out of bodies, weightless remember in space.I liked it and the ending is indeed super even as I thought this could happen, it simply did. Worth seeing for the creature and the 'space' effects.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,2,13 September 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," childish jokes but it works out fine
","Ahaaaa, what is this for a weird flick I can tell you. It's pure stupidity and the kind of humour that isn't for anybody but I enjoyed it somehow. Let me be clear, it isn't for all the geeks out there. I can't say that I laughed it out loud like some British zomcoms for example. But what makes it also worth seeing is that you are just looking for the jokes here and there and the fact that you forget to watch the effects used, they are worth seeing, climbing on the walls, changing into bats, you know your typical vampire stuff.You love or hate this flick, as simple as that.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 2/5",6,2,4,6 September 2015
Deadpool," annoying
","A colleague at work told me that this was going to be a flick I would like. I do like comedy but mostly US humour isn't my thing but I must say, this surely hits it.What I did knew was that it was all about a superhero but there's more than that. My summary says it all. Deadpool, the character, is annoying as hell and that's the reason why you start loving him. The effects used are stunning, some situations are as funny as hell (his small hand and his...) and I surely did laugh with the sex scenes that occur with some holidays. The Halloween part and the teeth while giving his girl oral sex, well, you must just see it. And here we have it, Ryan Reynolds as deadpool does give the best he can and it's an excellent performance. And did we ever see Morena Baccarin more sexy than here as a stripper?But not only the acting is above mediocre as are the effects also references toward other actors and flicks are funny and the score used, well, for the people grown up in the eighties it will be a ride down memory lane. If you go watch it be sure to stay until the end credits are over because you will laugh it out again and he surely tells you the truth about cinema's. After Guardians Of THe Galaxy (2014) and Ant-Man (2015) another excellent superhero flick but this one here with an excellent twist.

Fast Five," moves away from street racing to a real action flick
","I only though that it could go downhill with the franchise but I can say that this was another great entry. Maybe some will have difficulty with the idea that the street races are a bit left out of this flick and the story sometimes is a bit exaggerated. The gang surrounding Don (Vin Diesel) are almost fighting against the world but the franchise had to fight against other spectacular flicks (the ocean series a bit like this concerning old friends) so they decided to move a bit further with great effects and some nice stunts with cars. In fact this is just a reunion of characters seen in earlier entries but this flick also brought in Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs). Of course you could see from the beginning that he and Don should have a fight man against man and they did. Also from now on you should have seen the earlier flicks to understand who's who and what their specialities are. There are enough flicks in this genre but for me the use of the cars gave it an extra thing to watch. Even this time we do have some goofy situations between the characters that gives it also something to watch. To say it's the best so far I can't really say because this one moves away from street car racing towards a really action flick. And it do has a lot of action. There is a part were things drop down a bit after halfway through the flick but the ending delivers the goods again. And to be honest, Vin isn't the best here. Were he carried part 4 here Dwayne is taking over, Vin has a few clichés to add but still, a great flick. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7,0,1,26 September 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," the best part of the trilogy
","Again, I had to suffer watching Twilight. I am not a fan of the franchise but i had to see it due my reviews and being a horror geek. For me this was the best part. Here things go on and it's not all about talking and blah blah like in the first part. Again, Bella Swan can't decide who to choose, the vampire or the werewolf. If i had to met a girl who can't choose after all that time then she isn't worth waiting for. Anyhow, she even cheat on Edward Cullen by kissing Jacob Black just in front of him. Some parts were really enjoying but again the best parts are without the two leads. Still, for me the use of CGI wolfs is the let down of the movie, and they are bigger than a human...Like many have written, if you are into Twilight you will like it otherwise leave it as it is. Some nostalgia was in the picture for me, the lead singer of old school goth band Bauhaus has a appearance of maybe 30 seconds, but what a great performance. I guess I will plug True Blood in the DVD player to see something good.",4,8,11,14 September 2010
Annihilation," it's not going to be for everyone
","Be honest, everybody is talking about this weird sci-fi flick. And once it came out it was available on Netflix so the whole world could watch this. And so I did and was it worth the hype. Welll, those who can dig arty flicks it's one for them. It's slow-paced and it doesn't have some action to make it an action flick. On the other hand, being a sci-fi even that is so weird because the shimmer is in fact the rare thing that is on earth. What it does is explained all over the flick and for some the explanation can be to hard to understand. But it's also filed under horror.On that part I can agree on so many ways. It's never scary and you can see it coming when the creepy parts are there but the effects used for the horror are really top-notch gore. Being a rather gory flick makes it not watcghable for the squeamish. If you can stand a slow-paced flick with a weird story and nice effects overruled sometimes by pure gore it's surely is one to stream on youtr Netflix account. The gore did it for me and the effects but being so slow is what takes it a bit down on my rating.

The Cabin in the Woods," finally one of the hyped flicks of 2012 that delivers
","What is it with the year 2012, so many flicks are hyped and most of them I just couldn't care, we had The Hunger Games which I found boring. We had Detention which was okay for the effects but just didn't deliver what I expected from it. So a bit of anger to plug in the next hype. The Cabin In The Woods. Luckily for me this flick did deliver.But I must immediately say that I can understand why people hate it. It is an ode to the horror genre and also they laughed it loud out. Why it is an ode, face it. I see things coming straight out of The Evil Dead (1981) like the zombies being awaken by a book. I see some kind of Box used in Hellraiser (1987). I do see elements of Cube (1997) towards the end and even a bit of Wrong Turn (2003). And there's even so much more like the white masks, or the way the killer zombie looked. When we go to Japan, that also rings a bell. So much of an ode.But it never gave me some jumpscene's. You can see things coming from miles away and on the other hand there are things that you say, wow, what a surprise. And even one actress is here to see as a big surprise. Naturally being filed under horror you do need like in the old school horrors the whore, the dummy, the smart ass and so on. We do have it here, we even had a bit of nudity from Anna Hutchison (Jules). And of course our female heroin.The acting did also give it an upgrade. They all looked believable but be aware that some do exaggerate because it's needed in a comedy/horror like this. On part of the comedy I didn't laughed it out that much, there's one scene with the titties that is funny but that's it for me.The effects are amazing in some scene's and the end, well, that's were people discussing about. You like it or you hate it. All horror creatures ever released are watchable in The Cabin In The Woods. I loved it and finally one hyped flick of 2012 did deliver. Never that gory at all.

Mad Max: Fury Road," strong first part, mediocre second part
","If you haven't seen a Mad Max flick don't be bothered because it doesn't follow what happened before, well, some flashbacks may refer to it but still, it do stands alone this flick. On the other hand it is a typical Mad Max flick so for those who are into post-apocalyptic flicks this is a must see.Never had any problems with those kind of flicks for me it clocked in over 2 hours and that was way too long. The first part (until they start driving) is okay and enjoyable but after a while the only thing we get to see is driving and driving and collisions and crashes and a predictable ending. I admit, that does make a Mad Max flick but it took to long.On part of the effects it all worked well, some are done in-camera the others pure CGI because it couldn't be done for real. So if you aren't into post-apocalyptic flicks style Mad Max then don't watch it if you think you will see something new, but for the geeks of Max, watch it.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7,1,6,16 July 2015
Warcraft," great story even if you don't know a thing about Warcraft
","I know nothing about the world of Warcraft and I never played the game so I was a bit afraid to go watch it because, could I understand the whole Warcraft world and the characters? So if it do fits into the Warcraft world I can't say.What I can say is that it was a marvelous flick. I was immediately into the story and characters and it never bored me at all. The effects are really stunning and the world of the humans and the orcs does really work. If you are into fantasy then this is really a must see. It's a bit heavier then the Lord Of The Ring flicks or The Hobbit flicks because here you do have gory shots like heads being axed, or heads being smashed by the orcs.If this really is the beginning then I'm looking forward for what's to come.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," action action and action
","The best so far, action all the way and a CGI eye candy. I especially liked the first minutes of Dark Of The Moon because they used real footage from the moon landing and the who and why suddenly Russians and Americans wanted to go to the moon, because there was something on the other side, the dark side of the moon.I was happy that the stupid humor from Revenge Of The Fallen (2009) was left out of this flick. And the voices of the robots that annoyed me in Revenge didn't annoy me here somehow.Also have a look how Megan Fox was finished in this flick due a few sentences and if you listen closely yo can spot that Michael Bay finished her off. Out Megan Fox and out was her career. The new comer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly the new love of Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Shia performed excellent again, Rosie was just in it for her body and legs. Alos on board was John Malkovich (Bruce), always nice to see him but his new teeth made me watch that in stead of the flick itself. I would also like to mention John Turturro as Simmons, he's so funny.The effects are again extremely well done. The start of this flick and Buzz Aldrin being involved made it all more believable.

Warm Bodies," remember Twilight?
","I already had mixed emotions when I see the add saying it was also a romance. That brought in mind immediately the Twilight series. A thing that just wasn't out for me being a horror buff. Sadly I had the same emotions while watching it, not only that, it's also slow so the remote control was in my hands to stop this flick which I finally didn't do due the name John Malkovich, but he also couldn't save this flick. he's doing what he has to do and that's playing the pain in the *ss, what he does best.It started okay and I had a bit of a smile on my face when R, the zombie, is telling about his life and it even had a few funny situations like walking to town where R stated, God it will take a while like we are walking. But from there on the romance comes in. Still R stays a zombie but towards the end it's just some Twilight or Romeo and Juliet situation that it really is out there for teenagers. I don't think that any zombie buff will like this very much. Yes there are head shots but for a zombie flick it doesn't have any gore or blood. The CGI used looked nicely done in the beginning and it didn't mind me at all but it was really the story that makes it not watchable for me. Strange to see so many positive things about Warm Bodies but for me it was the next Twilight trash. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0,5/5",4,4,8,17 June 2013

","Don't ask me why but flicks with Tom Hanks aren't seen on my part of view. I don't know why, is it his way of talking I just can't tell so let that be the reason why it took me so long to watch it. Flying to New York with my family lately it all came back to me that a plane ditched on the Hudson and going back to this flick I totally forgotten that Clint Eastwood directed this flick. And he never let me down. Not as an actor and surely not as a director.Due this being a flick about a real event happened there's nothing bad after all in this flick. It's just sitting halfway throughout this flick that you could follow the disaster itself. And it took me by my throat about all those theoretic people trying to nail the captain and his co-pilot due loosing the plane in the water. Can't say more then that our I would be spoiling.

Furious 7," over the top
","This is a bit hard to review because we all know what happened due filming this flick, the sudden death by car accident of Paul Walker. Excellent the way he's seen throughout this flick and in the last minutes were Vin Diesel is saying stuff towards him and an ode is shown towards Paul I can understand that some fans will wipe away a tear. It's really sad what happened of course but we are stuck with part 7 and for me it was all over the top.it picked up were part 6 left and that was fine until the cars come out of an airplane. From there on the whole movie is an over the top action flick. If it would have been a movie on it's own it would have been great, style 007 or Mission Impossible but hey, face it, it is still Fast And Furious. We do have car chases and naturally in the beginning German Junk Car lost it from the US Muscle Car, that was good but overall, it was more about the action. The car jumping from building to building, doesn't fit for me in a F&F flick. So I'm left with a bitter feeling. It do has an open ending so up to part 8 but really, let's go back a bit more towards the cars in stead of action like this. Part 6 was fine to see and is was just limited in action to not exaggerate the action.
