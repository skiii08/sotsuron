Angels & Demons," No Angels here!!
","If you truly wish to experience Angles and Demons read the book. The film is a long, tedious and disappointing history lesson. It lacks the drama and tension compressed in the page turning book. The cast cannot be blamed as they are at the mercy of a Punch and Judy script adaptation. Tom Hank's take on Robert Langdon is dull and uninspired; by the end of the film you are left wondering who is Robert Langdon? The Robert Langdon we see is a rambling bland man who cares a lot about absolutely nothing! He likes symbols, I get it, but love of symbols isn't enough to fly you to Rome and start dodging bullets! what is his motivation apart from ego? There is simply no depth to his character. What are supposed to be tense moments fall flat to the point that you don't care if a character is drowning, being burnt alive or branded with a hot iron rod.Howard's Direction is over the top, his attempts to create atmosphere do nothing but make the scene look forces and overly CGI'd.Save yourself two hours of life, go to the book store and buy the Dan Brown version. The journey on the way will be more thrilling than the film.",1,16,40,20 May 2009
