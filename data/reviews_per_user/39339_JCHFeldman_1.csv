United 93," Attempt to elevate official lie to a myth.
","As more and more Americans are coming to realize, the story of Flight 93 is total fiction, lacking even a shred of truth. While many in the World have recognized that the U.S. Government's 'script' on 911 was a big lie designed to get Americans to accept the inevitability of war and to accelerate the assault on civil rights, Americans for the most part have remained in a state of denial over the reality that 911 was an inside job. This film merely takes the 911 official hoax to a new level by injecting a sense of 'humanity' into the fabrication to make it seem more 'real.' But a lie is a lie, and whatever talents were brought into this picture cannot disguise this fact. I would not recommend that anyone see this movie since--as a matter of principle--liars should not be rewarded for their lies. The film also does a terrible injustice to the victims of 911.",1,16,53,4 June 2006
