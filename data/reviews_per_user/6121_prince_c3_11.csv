The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," How come any one like this movie
","Well, I don't want to sound rude or offensive. Also I don't come out and write reviews about every movie release every Friday. But as I was expected after watching this low standard, crappy quality, soft porn in the name of movie making, I was expecting all the negative comments and not at all expecting any positive reviews from even the die hard fans of Twilight. But by looking at only 1 positive comment and rating out of 55 negative comment made me think, what happen to the new generation, but I don't blame them, they are all kids of 15-24 years and haven't seen or know what movie making or what is Hollywood stands for. If these kids really wants to watch the so called Vampire and Werewolf movies and some quality into fiction. Go watch Interview with Vampire, Dracula and few others. But this is total insane, in fact this series totally kill the future of vampire and werewolf movies, I really like this genre and been watching these movies since I was kid, but the quality and drama and crappy acting of the entire cast, on the top of that the crappy direction which is so low in standard that they kill the prospect of future movies on this genre, people would start thinking and comparing any future good or bad movie with these movies and certainly those movie will get killed before even given a fare chance. I strongly recommend that the censor not only look for offensive scene and language but they should look for quality of movie making and ban these kind of low standard movies and director altogether. At least there is some chance of Hollywood to regain its past glory. Now a days Japaneses, Korean, Spanish and Mexican movies are far better and superior in quality.",Null,7,12,21 November 2011
In Bruges," Capture the essence of humanity and The Bruges
","Yes, Only few movies I wrote reviews about and among those few only very, very few I gave above 7 ratings and In Bruges is among very, very few. Watched it several times and realized that I had to review this beautiful movie, which in short span capture the essence of humanity, guilt, emotions, friendship and humor. I could go and on and write 10 pages, but those 10 pages would be just repetitive of most of the 400 plus comments which already written about this movie. Excellent and outstanding performance by Colin Farrell, he surpassed his London Boulevard performance in this movie. Brendan Gleeson, one of the memorable work. Short but the integral part done by Ralph Fiennes, exceed expectations. Supported well, by other actors. The way Martin McDonagh captured the sleeping and pristine beauty of Bruges with background of intense story was simply outstanding.Even midgets were funny and brilliant.",8,0,3,5 January 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Christoph Waltz 10 Stars Movie 1 Stars
","Well, I can't write the review without repeating some of the reviews most negative reviews which I found only honest reviews. All other Reviews are either from Studio people and friends of Director. Beside that the most amazing and annoyed thing is how come a respectable site like IMDb gave this worthless crap, well, not totally, with all due respect to Christoph Waltz 10 minutes, gave this movie a 8.3 stars seriously which would cast the doubt on very credibility I have on IMDb reviews. Though I understand that sites need money to run and every now and then they compromise some ethics and take money to give high rating, it's all business at the end of the day. These days nothing is reliable let alone reviews on IMDb. This movie is nothing but bad and worst kind of propaganda movie I have seen on WWII. Kind of boring showing the same crap again and again, Jews Victims, the brutality of the Nazis and all. Well, it seems that the Oscar jury mostly consists of aging Jews because every crap movie based on WWII brutality, brutality against Jews only, no movie that shows how much Russians/Germans/Japanese or Non-Jewish people killed which account for more than Jewish ever gets an Oscar. So Quentin Tarantino thought that in his long career, he doesn't have much chance of getting an Oscar so he studied and found out that the easiest way to get Oscar is to make a movie about WWII, showed the same crap of brutality of Nazis against Jews as subject matter get an Oscar which of course boost the career of any director in Hollywood.Watched over 100 movies on WWII subject and every movie whether or not based on fact shows same dumb things, how come Germans get themselves killed like a bunch of fools, in this movie they just have two guards to protect hundreds of top notch German officers including Hitler?Anyway, bottom line so much has been written negative about this movie still wondering when 3 out of 5 reviews are negative never seen in history that the movie still gets 8 stars. Doesn't its shame that when a movie given a 8.3 star ratings count with some of the greatest movies? How come such a crass and worthless movie like this count with those movies, isn't that an insult to all the great actors and directors and people behind those great movies? Next time IMDb should be carful before jack up the rating, not only they are losing credibility, but they are insulting the great legacy of Hollywood.",3,1,3,8 January 2015
Shutter Island," Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?
","Well, pretty much good, better, best and worst has been said about this movie in 950+ reviews and it's kind of rare that reviews are somehow divided because as it happened after watching this movie my friend and I was totally engrossed and left the theater not knowing what really hit us. Because we were not prepared for anything like this from Scorsese or Dicaprio, we know they both are capable but not on this scale. At the same time two other friends outrightly rejected this movie as anything but great. So, that's how the audience would be divided you either liked it or you hate it. Also, those who don't like it much doesn't mean they don't get this movie or they don't know how to decide the movie, I believe they don't want something this hard to take it easy. They must enjoy comedy and light tragedy, but not something of this scale. Because I know my friends they can't digest dark movies with lots of emotions, emotions that involve tragedy, not some dog got killed and like that. And, by GOD from first shot to last shot this movie getting bleaker and bleaker until the last line which not only sums up the entire movie, but, it was so sad and bleak that I couldn't able to get off the seat even after it finished for few Min's.Making a tragic and dark movies is one thing, but making people feel the atmosphere, hopelessness, emptiness, the coldness, the suffocation feeling is not everyone's cup of tea, but Scorsese nailed it and you can almost start feeling yourself in that asylum and confined in that wall, you could almost feel the wet and cold walls of that Island and couldn't help yourself but look for an air to breathe.Mind that I didn't say a word about the story or what that movie is all about. It's about the human mind and complexity of human relation.Also, most important if you watch this movie as simply like Paranormal activity kind of horror, then you will wouldn't get the point or movie at all. At the same time if you don't give attention to the overall atmosphere, the time period, especially the dialog then you would definitely miss the movie and that's happening with my friend they totally missed the point because they watched it unprepared like any other horror movie genre. But, this movie is not a horror movie in a sense, but, it's scary to the core, not jump scary, but you would question the life of human and what human is capable of.Each and every dialogue are weighted and worth every second, but few of the dialog just stayed with me.When Warden told Teddy: If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you? Teddy said give it a try with a look. My goodness, that shows the true human nature.But the best one as per me is the one before credit rolls.When Teddy finally realized who he was and why he was here and his real identity, he looked at Chuck and said: Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?",8,2,4,19 October 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Almost perfect...I mean almost
","Well, this movie was totally a different Genre compare to all the CGI movies these day running's. Basically, after seeing all these so called comical movies, it's been a long time when a movie with real humans, with real human issues, real human tragedies to watch is a feast. I believe the major set back for this movie was, when the director decided to give it a black comedy genre. Basically, this could be as good as Francis McDormand Fargo, but I believe she still should win Oscar for her performance in this movie too. This movie shouldn't treat as black comedy. Everything about this movie, cinematography, direction, acting especially all the leading characters, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell and of course the very best Francis McDormand did an awesome job. Except with a few major flaws, first and foremost the comedy part of the movie, there isn't anything wrong in few dialogues, but labeling it black comedy for me took away the essence of this movie, this movie could be very, very tragic. Second, it could be possible that a racist cop could have a change of heart from a dead Supervisor letter, but practically not possible. So, if both characters allowed to grow and Woody character instead of just letter showed his love by his actions, could have made it more believable. Overall, the movie was really awesome and one of the best so far in 2017, especially amongst all those humans animated super hero movies. Before this I really like Jackie Chan The Foreginer.",6,2,5,3 December 2017
Divergent," Paid Publicity and Paid Critics
","I usually don't write reviews and on occasion when the movie is really amazing or when movie is really worst, but that movie still end up with above 6 ratings by Critics. So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous.",3,39,72,23 March 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," The fault in the ratings
","Well, IMDb please, please, please....I trust your ratings so much so that, every time whether its in Cinema hall or on Netflix or anywhere else, even before renting DVD from red box I always check IMDb ratings before deciding whether to watch or not. When I see 8+ rating. I didn't bother to click few pages to read the user reviews seriously my bad, I wish I would have time to read few pages instead of blindly believing the some paid reviews and paid rating by IMDb.My cousins were pulling and honking car horn waiting outside so I just gave in. Lesson learned. I wont trust on IMDb ratings again. Also, I was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that, but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of Godfather,The Shawshank Redemption,The Lord of the ring series,Good Fellas, Star wars and likes, its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them. People might be thinking or comment that this reviews comes from insensitive person or I don't have heart. Seriously my cousins and I seriously tried to cry but we all end up laughing along with few other fellow like us and also got the wrath of some bull...teenagers who saw this movie as some sacred text like Bible being translate to movie?OK, now come to the story our pretty Shailene Woodly got cancer and dying very depressive, but why every time they end up in support group and all the good Christian and the worst of the movie was not her, in fact she save the movie else we all would be out of cinema hall in first 15 minutes, the worst part of the movie was that Chocolate face Ansel Elgort seriously this guy can only be her brother and he should stick to brother's and kind of looks because he is so emotionless even on most emotional scenes. He act like he is acting badly. The cigarette scenes were most terrific. Then comes the author part, seriously! a author of some unknown book are in seclusion and drunkard, he was not John Gresham or Stephen kings or some Pulitzer Prize winner author who hasn't got any good book and now in hiding...Not only that the author has no respect for cancer patients or something like that he was rude, drinking all the time and insult our protagonist. Next comes our 18 years old so called virgin boy had sex where? Well, at Anne Frank memorial and that was highly encouraged by applauding strangers, I mean seriously!!!!How much pain one can bear does this director has any idea? So the worst is not yet over by this time we were so bored but to keep our self busy and in fact start enjoying the comedy, so we start playing games who will die first Elgort or Shailene...so by this time I know so much about script I told them what would going to happen and who will die first and how it ends...surprisingly that's what happen, because the script and screen play was so shallow any 6 years old could predict.Please, emotions are set aside and reviews of teenagers are one thing, please IMDb remove the 8+ rating and give it a true 2 or at most 3 star ratings and please stop insulting movies with 8+ rating its offensive.",1,20,46,19 October 2014
Revolutionary Road," Shattered dreams of all the Ordinary lives
","Well, just shot of giving 10/10 for lots of reason because I strongly believe that nothing is perfect and giving 10/10 mean that its perfect, like they way Frank and April Wheeler think about their lives in suburb Connecticut. This novel is about the lives which was true in 1950's and its true in every era, its timeless. The dreams of ordinary middle class suburban peoples, their lives around their houses and dreams. But the same people wanted to achieved those dreams and try to fulfill those promises but in the end, they forced by every possible circumstances to live the lives they hate about. They have to work to the place they hate about it, but they just cant control those things. AS THE LIFE IS A DIAMOND, AND ALL THEY HAVE TO LICK THAT DIAMOND EVERYDAY AND LIVE. Some people cope better by lying to themselves and some people couldn't cope in best possible way and like their dreams their lives will shattered in thousands pieces of glass. Frank cope and understands the practicality of his life and his family life, he worked hard at every opportunity and already compromised to the life, to the future he has to end up with, but his wife tried another way out, the whole new future and wanted to give a try, a try too hard and when she sees no hope of that future and that dream she took extreme step. As far as movie is concern Sam took the book and made the movie as close as possible, he literally took back to 1950's. Acting wise, well, I was hoping a brilliant performance by Kate by all means and of course she performed brilliantly, but the one actor who did more than his fare share of role, it was Leonardo, he just blow me away with his acting. He acted so well, in the role of Frank that, you will feel sympathy, sorry and sorrow for Frank and Leo made it possible. Its so sad that neither Kate nor Leo got an Oscar for this which they rightly deserve. This is one movie which always be in the top 10 list of most depressing movies.",9,0,0,30 November 2011
Amadeus," Justify the Genius in all respect
","Well, so much has already written about this movie, adding to the same format doesn't make sense. As a critic of period movie I watched the whole movie few times just to find out any flaw and loose ends anything that make this movie less than perfect but alas after watching several times, every time I end up lost at one or the other part of the movie, what would I say about the acting, both deserve Oscar and both did justify their roles, more than any one else it was F. Murray Abraham movie and wow he did so brilliantly the hatred towards Mozart, the jealousy, the secret admiration, the acknowledgment of his work and face expressions after listening to his music. The way he possessed hatred towards GOD, that GOD has given him obsession but lacks the talent that Mozart posses.Though I am not very much into opera and Mozart or Beethoven kind of music but after watching this movie I got so much interested bought all the records of Mozart just to pay tribute to the genius which of course born once in thousands years, yet he lived so little just 35 years, imagine if he has lived till 60 or 70 years then we wouldn't have look for another Mozart or we wouldn't have appreciate Beethoven?Bottom line this kind of movies are neither everyday affair nor we expect this kind of movies to made very often, that makes them rate gem. A MUST WATCH.",9,1,3,4 November 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," A homage to Movie Making
","Well, more than two thousands comments and mostly positive why I need to write the comment for the simple reason I wants to pay a small homage to movie making and proving to the world that still every now and then Hollywood still come-up with rare gems. I watched this movie so many times and every time I sit through this movie from start to end which is quite rare these days to stick to a movie for more than 2 hours without feeling the patches of boredom or feeling the movie being bit long. I am still not sure what happen to Oscar which don't give best actor award to Morgan Freeman or best supporting actor award to Tim Robbins, well its really unfortunate. There is a saying about great movies, that great movies just made themselves and that's about it, you cant just make them again and again and among several of those great movies this movies will always stands. Frank Darabont will always be remember for his two outstanding work one is The Shawshank Redemption and another The Green Mile.",10,0,0,21 October 2013
The Social Network," Best Comedy/Horror of the year: Wakeup Hollywood
","I am not sure where the Hollywood is heading. I pray and hope this film though already nominated for Oscar shouldn't win, if Oscar judges give this film the best film award then GOD bless Hollywood they cant go anything lower than this in worst Hollywood cinema.They already start heading down south in making movies. I wont believe when it won the golden globe and I bet this movie won because it was lobbied like our senates. First of all 2003 showed in the movie like 1940's, so If any sane person and those who are raving about this movie giving some 8 stars and above, I request them to go and watch Beautiful Mind. Even that movie was not brilliant due to the fact that the events were manipulated but at least it was story about noble price winner mathematician not some crappy cheat guy. But this is a movie about a douchebag and of course director got undisclosed amount of money from facebook founder douchebag Mark. He almost made us to believe that he was a good guy but in reality he was the biggest douchebag and looser who did not invent anything except steal the idea and modify with his own crap and put it for the world and pass it like he is the inventor. Not only that he betrayed his only and real good friend, he ditch everyone around him. The director showed that video piracy, audio piracy, illegal download of music, stealing ideas and everything is fine. I guess how would he feels if this films watch on pirated DVD's and he has to bear the loses:) This is the high time Hollywood should wake up and start looking for real Cinema, there was the biggest conspiracy for Inception because it was brilliant movie but since its against the very own set of rules of Oscar judges and it wasn't made by or about any body like Mark so they don't give Inception enough credit or put Leonardo DiCaprio for best actor for this movie. What make them give Jesse Eisenberg a best actor nomination I don't understand what all he did in the movie was looking like nerd by wearing dirty hoodies and blank face no emotions and nothing to act about. I don't think a real Harvard dress like that. I guess people should start watching real cinema of 50's and 60's to get to know the quality of work Hollywood used to produce and compare with today's crap they are making to know the difference.",2,0,4,18 February 2011
