Casablanca," A Truly Iconic Film
","Casablanca (1942) is a great film that uncovers the pain and hardship that individuals had to deal with while living in a world that was at war. Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, acts as the self-tortured protagonist, someone who 'doesn't stick his neck out for no one'. His character is powerfully dynamic and gripping, one cannot predict his actions. The casting and character writing are quite superb, everyone complements each other and Rick and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) create a powerful, passionate foil. The direction and lighting of the film are also very complementary to the great final product. Throughout the film there seems to be two different color and light schemes. The flashbacks offer bright and pretty light to go along with the uplifting flashback storyline. Once back in the bar the lighting is dark and ominous, giving the watcher the idea that something is not right in Casablanca. Casablanca has become an iconic film for numerous reasons, but one reason stands out. This film is about the struggle in a worn torn country and the struggle with ones past. To put it simply this film is real. There are very few false ideas and false feelings. Only films like this can stand the test of time.",9,1,2,20 October 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Not a favorite, but a landmark
","D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) is a solid film, but to me it doesen't translate as great. I believe this film is sub par for many reasons, granted this film was made in 1915 and grossed over 10 million dollars, but it seems that the beauty and art of other early silents is lost in The Birth of a Nation. Unlike Sunrise or other silents, The Birth of a Nation lacks the powerful cinematography and the undeniable romantic story. Griffith seems to struggle with the lack of sound, there are many subtitles inserted throughout. He also over zealously uses a soundtrack throughout the movie, something that seems unnecessary. Perhaps I am spoiled by the artistic creations of Murnau, but Griffith and The Birth of a Nation do not get me too exited. The stationary cameras, and the quick edits paired with non-complimentary sound gets boring in a 3 hour film. That is not to say that The Birth of a Nation was not an influential film. To create a 3 hour epic in 1915 was unheard of, people flocked to the theaters to see this film, it created controversy and it grossed over 10 million dollars. Overall I wasn't so impressed with this film, but it is an obvious landmark for movie making history.",6,1,2,10 November 2009
The Graduate," An Iconic Film
","Two things struck me most about this film, the music, and the amazing, iconic cinematography. Nichols somehow fuses the beautifully, the product is a truly stunning film. Nichols creates an inner voice within Benjamin Braddock through the use of powerful cinematography and a great soundtrack, this inner voice is what makes this film so great. With the Hays Code now gone actors, directors and cinematographers had full creative and artistic freedom. So many doors were opened in the world of film in the late sixties, and it seems as though The Graduate led the way. Everything about this film is great, the storyline is so simple yet so complex. Everyone can relate to these feelings but no one knows how to deal with them. Benjamin Braddock is such an easy character to relate too. With that said, it is obvious that The Graduate is a truly iconic film and it deserves every praise it gets.",9,0,0,10 December 2009
