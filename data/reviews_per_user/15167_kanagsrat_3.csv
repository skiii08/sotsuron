Angels & Demons," Note to self... Never go into cinemas expecting brilliant books to turn out brilliant in film
","Geez where to start?As i am writing this review, I just came came from the cinema watching Angels and Demons and boy do i have a lot to say.Now, you(as the reader) have probably read other people's reviews, and they all have the same message: huge chunks of the book were missed in the movie and boy is this message true. Now, I perfectly understand that for a 572 page book to be portrayed in film, there have to be chunks missing from the film that are in the book. However these chunks were so imminent it was almost laughable. Overall, i was disappointed by the movie, but there were a couple of good things which is why i am going to list the good and bad's of this movie.Good:1. Special Effects were brilliant 2. Due to not being allowed to film in ST Peter's square, i thought the set designers did a fair job of duplicating the square. 3. Armin Mueller-Stahl did an excellent job of playing Cardinal Strauss. 4. Ewen Mcgregor did an OK job of the Camerlengo.Unfortunately those points were the only good points i could think of.Now lets move onto the bad points,Bad:1. Where is one of the central characters, Maximillian Kohler (Executive Director of Cern) in the movie? Unfortunately i don't see how the screenwriters could have missed that. 2. In the book, Vittoria Vetra was the feisty yet sensual Italian women. In the movie Ayelet Zurer did an absolutely horrific job of playing Vetra, Zurer was bland, it was almost like she was forced into playing Vetra by the casting directors because of her unmissable beauty. Honestly, sorry to say this but the way the movie was going it seemed like there was no point in having Vittoria Vetra in the movie, because she had absolutely no influence on saving Vatican City, unlike in the book! Also, she had no chemistry with Robert Langdon in the movie once again unlike in the book, overall her presence was simply pointless! 3. Only 3 cardinals died, all 4 were supposed to be dead4. Cardinal Strauss is actually Cardinal Mortati in the book, once again a lazy stroke from the screenwriters.5. Cardinal Mortati was supposed to be pope, not Cardinal Bhaggia5. Learnardo Vetra is given another name in the movie, and nowhere in the movie was he mentioned as the adopted father of Vittoria Vetra, in the movie Vetra describes him as, 'My research partner'6. The last symbol was supposed to be the Illuminati diamond, but instead it was keys.7. Vittoria Vetra is not with Robert Langdon in he Vatican Archives (honestly i didn't mind about this, but yet again this is another mistake from the screenwriters)8. The assassin isn't supposed to be like an academic with glasses, he was supposed to be creepy and of the Islam faith.9. There were no flashbacks unlike 'The Da Vinci Code'10. Ron Howard is a bad director11. Both screenplayers obviously didn't do their research.12. Unfortunately Tom Hanks didn't do it for me as the symbologist: Robert Langson in Angels and Demons.13. The acting overall, bar Ewen McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl was really bad.Honestly, i could go on and on about this but i wont bore you to death.Your also probably wondering why i gave it 5/10 since I've been so critical about it. Its because i have some sympathy for the screenwriters (despite me being critical towards them as well) for trying turn a masterpiece novel into film. Also, the special effects were good so i gave it some extra marks for that. But where it fell was the absence of important characters, poor acting and poor directing.Overall, a word for the wise, don't go into the cinema room expecting a brilliant book turning into a brilliant film because that is never the case as proved by Angels and Demons.",5,5,12,16 May 2009
The Hangover," Cant wait for Hangover 2!
","Wow, what a movie! The Hangover was a brilliant portration of 4 best friends who go to Las Vegas for the Groom: Doug Billings (played by: Justin Bartha), bachelor party 2 nights away from his big wedding day. When they get to Las Vegas they get drugged and drunked on that night and the next day completely forgot what happened the night before! And whats more, The Grooms missing! In addition to that there is a tiger in the hotel room, a baby in the closet, a Chinese man in the trunk of the car and the list goes on... Then the 4 friends who now are 3 go on a frantic chase to find their best mate who is supposed to get married the next day! The adventure is just beginning as they get up to very mischievous activities... The concept was simple, but it was the characters that made it for me: Phil Wenneck (played by Bradley Cooper): A school teacher who likes to be authorative and demeaning of everyone, but has a soft side and at times can be sensitive, and most of all he likes to have fun! Stu Price (played by Ed Helms): The Dentist nerd who is on the verge of proposing to his aggressive and 'mean' girlfriend.Alan Garner (played by Zach Galifianakis): The dimwitted brother-in-law of the groom. Has no common sense but has a big heart and loves all his friends.And Finally....Doug Billings (played by Justin Bartha): The nice hearted husband to be, who everyone loves and gets along with, however he goes missing after the boys' infamous night in vegas.All these characters created such a brilliant mastermind comedy, the actors played them to perfection and no one 'overdid' their character. Also credit has to go to the director: Tod Phillips who in my opinion is the best director of comedy there is. And lets not forget the brilliant screenwriters who made up this amazingly funny film: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. The cinematography was beautiful as it captivated the hustle and bustle of the fantastic Las Vegas City.Overall this movie was comedic genius, and the best part of the movie is the ending which explains everything that had put a question mark in your mind prior to the ending.A MUST SEE FILM! BRING IT ON THE HANGOVER 2!",10,5,8,1 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," JK Rowling must be embarrassed
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where to start? One movie i was eagerly waiting to see it in the cinemas and then to find out it is complete utter rubbish. These are the reasons as to why i believe this to be the case 1. The movie barely contains anything that is in the book, eg The maze scene, in the book there are suppose to be dangerous mythical creatures that attack Harry and the other contestants, in the movie there are no creatures of any kind, its the hedges that attack the contestants, whats up with that? 2. There are definite plot holes in the movie like when Harry looks at the dead Barty Crouch and goes to alarm Dumbledore, then when he sees Dumbledore he completely forgets about it? What on earth, how can you forget a thing such as a person murdered? 3. Mike Newell (director of this movie) is the worst director in a decade.4. Where is Dobby and Winky the house elves? in the book they are two of the most central characters 5. David Tennant did not portray Barty Crouch Jr at all well, he was way too old for the role.6. When Harry talks to Sirius in the fire, you cant even tell its Sirius, so how on earth can Harry tell its Sirius? 7. Michael Gambon does a horrible job of Dumbledore, Dumbledore isn't meant to be aggressive as seen in the movie, he is meant to be calm in any situation, clearly the screenwriters and Gambon didn't think it through.8. If JK Rowling wrote the series, why cant they rely on her to do the screenplay? it would make much more sense.9. Viktor Krum barely has a speaking part in the movie, we as the audience should have seen the chemistry between him and Hermione much more.10. Finally, anyone who gave this movie a high rating obviously isn't a potter fan and hasn't read the book properly or not at all.Overall, I'm sorry for this movie, i feel sorry for JK Rowling who's masterpiece has shattered on screen. Hopefull HP6 can live up to its expectations.",1,2,5,1 May 2009
