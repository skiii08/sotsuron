Skyfall," A terrible film, I wondered when it would end, and wished it would be soon
","Unlike other reviewers, I found nothing to recommend this movie at all. The plot was poor, and dialogue, such as it was, was hopeless, the acting stilted and suspense non-existent. You can usually tell within a minute or two of whether a film will be worth watching, and this one was firmly in the No basket. So what did we get? It started with a whole lot of routine chase stuff, culminating in Bond falling apparently dead into a river, where we're treated to some gee-whizz underwater shots of his 'drowning'. Next second, he's walking smartly down the corridors of power, fresh as a daisy. How did this happen? Was it 'with a bound he was free' the classic text so beloved of scriptwriters who've boxed their star into a corner? It didn't get any better. I kept looking at my watch, hoping it would end soon. The early bond movies had style. This one was a waste of space. I've awarded it a 1/10, but would happily give it no marks at all.",1,7,11,3 March 2015
