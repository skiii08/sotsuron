Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Despite bad reviews this movie delivered what it promised.
","An awesome movie.  I'm not sure why the critics collectively decided to 'dis' it.  Perhaps they wanted a human interest story like Hans and the princess from episodes IV-VI.  Other than the love story, everything else I've come to expect of the star wars saga was there.",10,0,0,29 May 1999
