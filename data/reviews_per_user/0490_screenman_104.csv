Alien 3," More Is Less.
","You really do have to feel sorry for Ms Ripley; she must be the unluckiest lady in the galaxy. Lost in space for 57 years, outliving her own daughter, blamed for sabotaging a spaceship, stitched-up over a 'phoney' alien, demoted from flight-crew to fork-lift driver, stricken with ongoing nightmares and then tricked into going back and re-living them again. On top of all that, she finally gets infected by the alien, jettisoned once more into space, a child she fought so hard to save gets drowned, a marine she begins to develop romantic attachments to is killed, and finally; she crash-lands on a penal colony crammed with murderers and rapists - and oh-deary-me, another alien.You wouldn't perhaps want her as a friend.'Aliens' - an absolute cracker of a movie - ended on something of a victorious note. Most everyone was wiped-out, but the aliens were done for and she found a surrogate daughter to replace the one she outlived. There was also a nascent love interest in the form of Corporal Hicks. It was about as near to a fairytale finish as any genuine dragon-slaying horror movie could get. And the franchise should have ended there. Sadly; it didn't. Those grasping Hollwood moguls could see only more dollar signs.'Alien-3' had an impossibly hard act to follow. There were no more shocks or suspenseful moments left in the system, no more creepy scenarios in dimly-lit mysterious places that hadn't already been exploited, no more pools of drool to leave you wondering what came next.There was quite an interesting beginning, with brief explanatory glimpses sequenced to the accompaniment of bewitching choral voices. Some interesting visual effects were complemented by a suitably robust audio and sound-effects package. But after that it was simply more of the same: Ripley the knowing witness attempting to convince the sceptical inexperienced. Until the beast makes a showing, and once again she has to save everyone's ass. Feminism can be taken to implausible lengths.It's yet another small, hostile world. We seem to spend most of our time in poor light, etc, etc. There are some interesting and equally crass mood sequences. At times, Ms Ripley becomes tiresomely evasive, especially with the doctor - well played by Charles Dance.He heads a curious mix of British character actors that includes rumbustious Brian Glover as the colony's scathing warden, and Pete Postlethwaite as one of the inmates. It seems an unlikely place for Yorkshire lads to have wound up.With an inevitability that is barely interesting, the alien begins systematically bumping them all off. None of the characters are particularly likable or memorable, so it's hard to care for their loss. Dance's character is arguably the most sympathetic, but he gets creamed pretty early in the list. The whole thing is pretty grim, dismal and down-beat. Ms Ripley herself commits suicide in the end (not that it spared us further sequels). The un-killable alien is finally killed in a way that is quite preposterous.And that's more or less it - until next time.It may be that I do the movie a dis-service, but as I say; coming hot on the heels of such an edge-of-the-seat smash-hit like 'Aliens' it could hardly assume any other guise than an anti-climax. If the first two episodes had been less entertaining this might have seemed to shine more brightly, but it wasn't meant to be.Worth a watch if you get the chance, but it certainly isn't worth a purchase or changing you plans to stop in and see.Since this outing there has been 'Resurrection', 'Alien vs Predator' 'Requiem' and probably 'Daleks Defy Face-huggers', with 'Blob meets Drool', each featuring Sigourney Weaver in increasingly silly situations. But; money talks.",6,67,70,19 August 2008
3:10 to Yuma," The Train Was Late.
","The train was late and frankly, the way this movie dragged out, I wasn't surprised. Probably the wrong kind of baddies were on the line.Its original 1950's version never struck me as being a classic by any definition. More a poor man's 'High Noon'. But this remake tries to do better, and for the most part succeeds. Though it does this by robbing a few ideas from other westerns. To begin with, there's a raid upon an armoured stage-coach with a reverse-mounted Gatling-gun. It's an idea straight from 'The War Wagon'.Russell Crowe is Wade, captured leader to a bunch of outlaws. Christian Bale is Evans, the down-at-heel rancher with cash-flow issues who accepts a job too many. Taking pattern from Eastwood's revival, there is a lot more attention to period detail and authentic ambiance - oil-lamp lit interiors, scruffy attire and so on. Which makes for a believable but all too gloomy view. Crowe trades his Roman or nautical trappings for those of a western outlaw and offers-up his stock character delivery. It could just as easily be 'LA Confidential' with horses. Somebody needs to tell him that there's more to acting than just putting on clothes. It would also help if he discovered a voice. Another 2 hours of General Maximus Gruntus gets a bit too much for my ears. Bale, on the other hand, is as Baleful as ever: Believable, but not exactly likable. He needs to laugh once in a while. I grew up with westerns that were almost operatic in their presentation - a concept even Sergio Leone endorsed despite his many modernisations. This 'new realism' needs a very careful hand to make it work as well. Eastwood managed the transition, but this one throws a shoe.A lot of the movie entails a chase. The small posse escorting Wade overland to catch the train is seldom more than a couple of steps ahead of his gang, now led by a second-in-command about as homicidally-disposed as 'The Terminator'. Along the way, there are various 'issues' and psychological 'conflicts' most of which are scarcely believable. You just don't let a dangerous villain have his hands free, to attack his escorts, snatch guns and shoot them. It would be daft enough once - but 3 times? I mean; c'mon! And if he talks too much (hints of Hannibal Lecter) - you just gag him.Towards the end, the gang catch up whilst they're waiting for the train, and there's the sort of preposterously over-the-top and frankly unbelievable shoot-out that made 'The Wild Bunch' so memorable. Even here it's taken to excess. The ending is also turned on its head.I never understood the psychology of a hardened villain facing life imprisonment at the very least - and more likely the gallows - suddenly experiencing a 'Damascus episode' and assisting the man who would take him their. It seemed implausible in the first movie and no less so here.What the movie does well is commendable. But it's basically a hodge-podge of other ideas shunted together to make an over-long, excessively violent melodrama. It's like a fantasy staged in a museum.Worth a watch for the good bits, but not exactly collectible. Try 'Last train From Gun Hill'; it's a similar theme but in the grand 1950's operatic style.",6,1,2,28 March 2011
The Sound of Music," Sometimes you wish the Germans had won.
","People are moved to watch films like this for the same reason they slowdown to gawp at road accidents. There's a sickly fascination to be had. A there-but-for-the-grace-of-fate-go-I-ism. It is so overblown, so saccharine-sweet, so bloody-goody-two-shoes, that you can't believe it's happening. That's why it's usually shown at Christmas, the only time appetites and sensibilities are robust enough to prevail. It's like an over-stuffed turkey, a great pile of mince pies dusted with icing-sugar, a portion of pudding too big to eat never mind digest. Seem-splitting, constitution-challenging, hernia-inducing, gut-busting feelgoodness. Nobody swears, nobody farts, nobody has a run of snot, or halitosis, or spits crumbs at others while they're talking. Nobody leaves a floater in the toilet. None of these are her favourite things.They're all so practically perfect in every way, Mary Poppins wouldn't get a look in. Which is just as well, because she was shot down by ack-ack over Dresden and died from a perforated brolly.People like this only ever existed in the imagination of Rogers and Hammerstein. They're not real. They're a cartoon exaggeration, a benign behavioural tumour grown monstrous with self-delight. You know it. Yet something inside you still wants to believe it is possible. It could never happen to you, though - only others. Like a road accident. Better drive on quick; Christmas arrives earlier every year.More sherry trifle, anyone?(BURP)'Scuse me.",9,2,9,16 April 2006
Spartacus," Swords 'n' Sandals In Action
","Although a little wobbly in its production here and there, on account of the conflicting 'professional' interpretations between Douglas and Kubrick; this movie has certainly stood the test of time.Considered pretty bold in its day for the graphic representation of Roman cruelty, some of the scenes still hold up very well and help underline the slaves' motive for rebellion.There's a host of big names from that age of movie-making. Douglas has invariably played firebrands of one stamp or another and here he fits the sandals of Spartacus as well as any. His full and extensive remit of acting skills are put on show. Tony Curtis as Antoninus, his close friend, is rather less convincing; he doesn't do 'serious' quite so well as comedy.Ustinov bumbles along as Batiatus, owner of the gladiator school. Olivier brings a stately gravitas to Crassus, Jean Simmons is a scrawny but adequate Varinia. However, I believe the best part is played by chubby Charles Laughton, who is absolutely believable as the crafty, but basically decent political manipulator, Gracchus. In a script that is unusually intelligent for the genre, he definitely gets the best lines, and delivers them with convincing panache. He steals every one of his scenes, even those including Olivier.Indeed, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bum role here, with reliable Woody Strode playing a doomed gladiator stricken by misguided loyalties, and a cameo from excellent Herbert Lom as the fixer Levantus.The political squabbling is actually more entertaining than the fighting. Let's face it; we've seen hoards of men in a sword-wielding scrum so often it's almost a period cliché.But the set-piece deployment of the Roman army is wonderfully realised. I don't know how many extras were engaged in this all-too-briefly observed spectacle, but I've never seen an army look so believable or so bloody intimidating. We watch from the slave perspective at each separate legion marching steadfastly forward with lock-step precision over the rolling meadows, just as they must have done during the centuries of Roman rule, indomitable, irresistible, suppressing everything in their wake. And then a second army is seen in the distance, following on from the first. It required extraordinary visceral courage to stand in the face of this expert machine.When Laughton isn't amply demonstrating the decadence that is the other face of Rome, Olivier adds additional icing with an attempt to seduce Antoninus. In a sly metaphor, choices in food are compared to tastes in sexual appetite that could be an object lesson for sophisticated homosexuals the world over, and must have been astonishingly daring for 1960. Once again, the extremely clever script shines through.There are many other excellent set-pieces and situations. Camera work is as expansive as widescreen production demands, but there is plenty of subtle intimacy too, with well-judged lighting throughout. In general, I like the music; though the martial bombast of Roman anthems tend to batter your eardrums into submission. There's a nice 'romantic' theme for the scenes depicting Spartacus and Varinia.The more recent 'Gladiator' added absolutely nothing to the 'conflict of loyalties' story, or the sword 'n' sandals genre, except - as one might expect - in the CGI department. Quite the contrary; I thought it inferior in every other way. Certainly the latter's script couldn't hold a candle to this one. And come to that; neither could the lead roles.If you haven't already; give 'em a whizz and see what you think.",8,2,5,18 December 2008
Training Day," Adequate
","With two very engaging actors taking lead roles, in the form of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, this movie seemed to promise a great deal. Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.The beginning was almost a cliché of the genre, in which Hawke as naive rookie gets treated with cynical contempt by his street-wise bad-ass mentor, Washington. The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times. It lights up predictably, shines brightly for a while, but fades without much flair. Worth a watch if you get the chance, but not recommended for any particular quality.",7,13,19,10 May 2009
Chinatown," Wonderful Movie
","I can hardly believe that this movie is 35 years old. It is so fresh and appealing; it might have been filmed yesterday.Polanski has given a Technicolour take on the noir genre and come up trumps. There are no technical aspects with which I can take issue.Jack Nicholson turns in a splendid performance for a Hammeresque gumshoe of the period, easily as good as Bogey or Mitchum - Sardonic, cynical, unafraid but still very human. I'm surprised he didn't do more. Whilst Faye Dunawaye makes an equally plausible take on the 'broad who is damaged goods'.It's the usually convoluted tale of a private dick retained to investigate a missing person and then finding himself in a whole mess of hot (read cold) water. An especial challenge for Nicholson is that less than halfway through the movie, a switch-blade thug (played by Polanski himself) opens his nostril. For most of the rest of the time he is forced to play his part with this clownish, carbuncular dressing on his nose. That he still continues to offer an entirely believable performance is a measure of the great man's talent. A lot of actors would simply have refused a role that so obviously disfigured their pretty faces.All of the other ensemble turn in sterling performances, too.The vintage period is captured extremely well. There are some wonderful choices in motorcars.Script is slick, witty and hard-edged, just like a good noir should be. It certainly pays to listen.And finally, no movie is complete and many are spoiled by an inappropriate or unmemorable music score. Here again, 'Chinatown' hits just the right spot with a slow jazz number, headed by a maudlin trumpet lead. You won't forget it.Thoroughly gripping entertainment in every aspect, no technical issues to criticise; what can I do but give it 10 stars?",10,3,5,12 September 2009
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Hilarious In Every Way
","No other movie has so eloquently demonstrated why religious zealots have no sense of humour. They take themselves too seriously. They are stuffed so full of self-righteous piety and bumptious arrogance, that they are themselves the best comedic subject, just ripe for lampooning.The Python team saw this clearly and hit the ground running. Here we had a group of anarchic comedians who were not only hilarious, they were highly intelligent and educated. The perfect formula for pricking establishment egos.In this movie we see every aspect of human institution being taken to the cleaners. There's dictatorial but dim Roman soldiers epitomised by John Cleese's centurion, steadfastly correcting the Latin grammar of a rebel's graffiti. There's oh-so-politically-correct tub-thumping Marxist plotters, obsessed with nomenclature and for whom holding meetings is the be-all and end-all of insurrection. There's the wonderfully-observed scene in which Brian - chased by adoring multitudes - drops his gourd and then loses his sandal, each of which are picked up and held as 'signs', and already we can see the mob splintering into two deluded factions of the same ideal, like Catholics and Protestants, Sunnis and Shias.There's Brian's mum as a bigoted old fruitcake who comes out with a line that will surely prove to be as immortal as any from the gospel texts 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!' This isn't just a thoroughly deserved mockery of religion, it's a custard-pie in the face of human arrogance and vanity wherever it may be.Definitely one of the funniest movies ever made. A modern-day equivalent taking on Islam is long overdue and even more deserved.",9,0,3,23 July 2009
Star Trek," Silly, Shallow & Boring
","What a load of twaddle! Here is a classic - as an example of trying to make a movie work entirely on the basis of special-effects.The outset already had me yawning. We see the captain of a starship left on the bridge as his pregnant wife is evacuated along with the surviving crew. He gets to play his disposable man routine while she's giving birth. Trite or what? When will women finally become so emancipated as to start sacrificing themselves for their men? How many centuries before males obtain equality? From then on it's downhill all the way. Even the special-effects are second-rate. Characterisation is two-dimensional. Storyline is the typical mishmash of space/time paradox. There is the usual long-standing grudge, the usual fundamental misunderstanding.The original crew had been in the business so long through TV and the big screen they were typecast. But - my-oh-my - they had CHARACTER. These juvenile chuckle-heads have all the charisma of bowling pins. Trekkies got short-changed big time here. And I'm not one of them.Save your patience. It's on TV as I write, halfway through and I've given up. Get DVD's of the original cast. This twaddle is a non-event.",3,7,11,8 October 2011
Amistad," I Suppose It Had To Happen
","So now Big Stevie gets to give his take upon Negro slavery. And true to form it's a cheese-fest.Able Anthony Hopkins sets aside his liver & Chianti to play the role of advocate in a movie based upon a 'true story' of shipboard slave mutiny. It's all in a good cause.The Yanks demonstrate that they really are the true advocates of civil liberties (not the Brits), and defy the old European colonialist ways of Spain, France, England et al. It's wordy and well-intentioned. But it's schmaltzy in a way that can only come from a Jewish director, and whilst that may suit the sensibilities of an American audience, it doesn't cut half so well across the pond.Spielberg has an eye for detail and both sets and costumes are nicely presented. Script is adequate. The best bits are supposed to be uttered by British Tony, but he brings a rather bumbling personification to his character that rather spoils the enunciation and emphasis. I just don't think he cuts it as a Yank. Maybe Chas Heston should have tried his luck. Other technical issues are up to snuff.We all come away suitably chastened for our past disgraces, but redeemed by our repentance. Slavery is abolished - hurrah! But just try telling that to the Negroes in the American south long after the civil war. Even up to the 1960's they were being murdered with impunity.And here's the culminating irony: those very races and tribes for whom we abolished slavery, still carry on enslaving each other to this day, just as they did long before Whites ever set foot in Africa. It's a funny old world.If you fancy a bit of moral flagellation this may hit the spot in a rather tedious and self-righteous way. But once is definitely enough unless you're a masochist.",6,4,8,22 September 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Yet More Zombies!
","By now (2012) I've grown pretty weary of flesh-eating zombie types. They've become a whole genre to themselves. From the endless 'Resident Evil' to Big-Ears' 'I am Legend' on to the no less eternal 'Walking Dead' TV serial-thon. Why do they have to eat flesh all the time anyway? It's clear that they don't actually need it because they can go for weeks without so much as a nibble. Why can't they have a positive fixation like painting & decorating or flower arrangement?Well, this 2004 remake takes Romero's original and gives the cadaverous ones an Olympian turn of speed. The result is much more dramatic. Chases are truly hectic and confrontations are more in keeping with werewolves or Aliens. The movie takes a pretty dystopian view about the consequences of social breakdown. There's very little heroic stiff-upper-lip stuff and a lot more looking out for number one. Against such dire consequences, it's probably much nearer the mark. It's one thing to go to the guillotine for someone, but quite another to be eaten alive or changed into one of them yourself. Methinks Sidney Carton would take a raincheck here.Most of the takes are pretty solidly put together. Looks like the directors hired a genuine shopping-mall for the weekend. There's lots of believable conflict between the survivors and plenty of extremely tense action sequences when zombies turn up, fast, furious and very ravenous. Editing is sharp and well observed. Lighting & sound do the business. There's no happy ending.Character development is more detailed than the usual slash & gnash offerings. Most of the dumb things people do are plausible, even though I often found myself saying 'oh-no; you don't want to do that' or 'why don't you try this?' At least I was drawn into their dilemma. But having said as much; I wasn't particularly inclined to empathise with any of them either, which left the story with a shallow texture.Altogether it's a decent watch. Certainly I would recommend a viewing. It's at the top end of the zombie market, for what that's worth.",7,0,1,9 April 2012
Hostel," The Bates Motel Was Cleaner.
","This movie isn't so much horrifying as sickening. I'd been warned that it was of the 'slasher' genre, but these days that can mean anything.It begins, quite frankly, as utter tripe. Three boring young men engage in one sex-n-drugs session after another. They are seriously hedonistic - I think I get the message. This preamble goes on for so long that I only persevered with it to find out how the slashing started. It is slow and contrived, to say the least. The director just doesn't seem to have a clear idea as to how he is going to disclose the plot.When the slashing does start it is of such a graphic nature that I was moved to mute the volume and look away. You can call me squeamish if you like, but I think anybody who finds movies entailing torture and cruelty of this kind the least entertaining would very likely be the sort who - given the opportunity - would pay to participate. I suspect they would be masturbating as they watched.After two of these young man are taken and butchered, eventually, the third gets his come-uppance. But he manages to effect an escape at the cost of a couple of fingers. And it is here that the plot finally begins to reveal itself and things start to gel.I like a chase movie. And after a few executions of his own, our victim now has an opportunity to escape. I rather thought that when he went back to spring the oriental girl, he was pushing his luck and would be taken again, but no. The bit with her eye is too gross to describe. With the bad guys on his case, he and the girl head for the station. Her suicide in front of an oncoming train is almost inevitable. You can see them both coming a long way off. Such is vanity.Naturally, I had expected a twist. These cheap shockers almost always have 'em. But here it is one of revenge rather than recapture.Somewhere in this crude, voyeuristic mess there was the basis of an extremely tense and exciting movie. If the director had just got on with his story instead of obsessing over the orgasm, he would have saved celluloid and plenty of money whilst delivering a far more coherent plot, and three-dimensional characters we could care about instead of so much giblet-fodder. By the same token; had he toned-down the snuff-like brutality and emphasised the tension and the chase, this might have been a thoroughly gripping suspense drama.How many times have modern film-makers got to be reminded that its not necessarily what you show that matters so much as what you don't show. Imagination will fill the gaps. Clearly; these people assume we have as little of that stuff as themselves. They should be compelled to stop-over at the Bates' motel and study the shower sequence. There's not much point in commenting upon the technical aspects of production; there's just so much wrong with it up-front.Finally, rather than locating it in peaceful Slovakia, perhaps the hostel should have been more aptly set in Serbia. Recent events demonstrate that there is no shortage of mass-murdering psychopaths in that merry little land. You could almost say it was the national pastime. One suspects that their tourist board would have helped fund the enterprise.I'm afraid I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone for any reason. Only the last 15 minutes or so begin to measure-up, and its hardly worth being put off your dinner for that.",3,0,2,25 September 2008
Billy Elliot," Kes With Tights.
","Set against the disastrous miner's strike of the 1980's (unless you were a policeman on over-time pay), we find young Billy Elliot. He is too much of a kid to grasp the enormity of social and political issues. He is an observer. Things happen around him and implode upon his family life.But he definitely has no desire to go down t'pit. His sights are set elsewhere - as a dancer.In the steadfast working-class world of coal-mines, pubs and self-respect, nothing could be more out of place or less macho than dancing. Something for posh girls, perhaps, but certainly not working-class boys. Ballet? It's the stuff of pansies.The conflict between the two extremes is almost a cliché in itself. But we can let that pass because it is sublimely acted, and the contrast between Billy's aspirations and the turmoil of the times is realised with heart-rending authenticity.What is disappointing is that the movie appears to confirm the prevailing prejudice by actually casting Billy as a homosexual. It's as if all of those gruff, bluff voices at the working-men's clubs have collectively announced 'Thar - I tou'd thee so!' Perhaps many dancers are homosexual. But it doesn't follow that all homosexuals want to be dancers. It may also be that most ballet dancers in particular have what might be called 'an ambiguous sexual identity', but this movie tends to underscore the prejudice as a presumption. In doing so it over-simplifies Billy Elliot's dilemma by associating his desire to dance with emergent homosexuality. Life is not always that straightforward. And I personally think greater depth would have been lent to his character if he had been portrayed as a heterosexual youth coming to terms with an urge to dance whilst at the same time having to confront all of the contrarian elements of his inherent masculinity and expectations of manliness. Scripting him as 'gay' might have been politically-correct, but it glosses-over what could have been much more complex drama by suggesting it as an explanation in itself.In 1970, we saw another young Billy in the movie 'Kes'. It was filmed and acted in a much more understated way which - although offering a less dramatic take on life, and therefore often dismissed as 'boring' by those not born of Yorkshire stock - nevertheless offers a more authentic view of life as it was 'oop north' in the days of the pit.'Kes' is also more realistic because his family are neither enlightened nor supportive. Although he craves escape as much as his later namesake, we all know that there is no hope for him. The mine will surely swallow him up (though 13 years later he'll be out on strike).Billy Elliot, then, is very much 'Kes' revisited. Where Billy was left in 1970, alone, neglected, hopeless and cradling a dead kestrel; this time our hero is spared his dismal fate and given opportunity and hope. It's a feel-good movie with a happy ending. But it seems bogus for all of that. How many miner's sons become ballet dancers? I'll stick with 'Kes'. It's grim, but at least it's 'true'.",7,1,2,10 August 2008
Insomnia," Starring Al Pacino
","With Little Al topping the leaderboard no movie is ever gonna be a dud. And once again he does his stuff. The movie has an unusual mix of leads, with Pacino playing a seriously flawed cop who shoots his partner in a way that may or may not be accidental. He then tries to cover it up - which clearly is deliberate. Unfortunately, the villain - this time played by stereotypic nice-guy Robin Williams - sees him do it, and a curious relationship of mutual secrecy bonds between them. Williams does the creepy-psycho thing so well I'm surprised he hasn't been called upon to do it more often. Here, he plays vulnerability with an oleaginous edge that is enough to make you shudder. When not murdering, he's a crime-writer; so he knows all about crime. Hilary Swank plays an Alaskan rookie detective. She brings a nice mix of trust and suspicion to her role.Most of the action is set in big old Alaska during the time of midnight sun. Hence the title of the movie - Pacino's detective can't sleep in the endless light. Quite why is unclear. They have pharmacies up there. And a good shot of local red-eye will send any weary soul to the sack. Certainly I never experienced any problems.It's a decent if rather formulaic who-done-it, which we soon know. Then it becomes a psychological thriller. We've seen it all before. Flawed cop, flawed villain; one means to be good but fails, the other means to be bad and succeeds. The rest is dressing. There's some nice views of Alaska's big outdoors, but even here a lot more could have been done. Greater use could have been made of the tremendous scenery to emphasise the cop's sense of isolation and the littleness of his purpose. An encounter or two with wildlife would have contrasted with human aggression, and so on.Still, it's a solid work with interesting cast. I thought the clumsy shoot-out at the end a bit of an anti-climax after so much intellectual scheming. But there you go.Definitely worth a watch, but not exactly collectible.",8,0,0,1 August 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," From Several Days Later.
","The millennium has seen something of a resurgence in those disaster movies that were so popular during the 1970's. And there's a logical case; special-effects have advanced in leaps and bounds during the last 30 years, whilst CGI has added a new dimension to their scale. With the possible exception of 'Towering Inferno', earlier disasters simply couldn't be addressed in a sufficiently epic way and at the same time appear believable. Check out 'Earthquake' and you get the picture.But are the new breed actually better movies? Roland Emerich's 'The Day After Tomorrow' is about as good as the modern genre gets. There's a nice beginning with wide sweeps of polar ice viewed from a low-flying plane. The credits roll to an equally beguiling orchestral piece as seemingly endless vistas of frozen wilderness sweep past at a speed that is choreographed to the musical tempo. It's a promising start, at least.We home-in on a group of scientists who have the astonishing misfortune to straddle the very point where this particular ice-sheet cracks. It's extremely tense, and for the most part, completely unbelievable. Quite why the ice cracks, separates a few metres, and then just stops, is left unexplained. It should have just glissaded down to the sea - shouldn't it? The team is led by Dennis Quaid. He's an unfortunate and rather unlikeable choice as a starring role, like a block of wood with a frown.Next, we are plunged into the usual 'knowledgeable expert not taken seriously by authorities' scenario that has typified every disaster movie I can remember. Politicians should go the the cinema more often.After that, the special-effects go into overdrive. Which is just as well because the story, the acting and the script hobble along like a group of heroes in an icy wind. There is a stupendous tornado sequence. A tidal surge engulfs Manhattan with one of the most astonishingly-well realised pieces of CGI ever presented. Brief as it is, this is without doubt the high-point of the movie. Superlatives are certainly tested. Then comes the chill. And once again it is done to perfection. Small details like multiple windows shattering in sky-scrapers and flags turning solid at their staffs are nicely observed.There are also a few little surprises, like an abandoned Russian freighter that drifts into the downtown floods.And that's about it. That's pretty well all one remembers: a series of colossal special-effects tableaux. The story, the actors, their acting, the script, they are so diminutive and mediocre as to be completely overwhelmed by this CGI juggernaut. Jake Gylenhall plays tacit leader to a group of prissy, preppy, privileged teenage brats. Of all people, they most deserve a grisly death. Pity Micheal Myers isn't in town. And, of course, he plays the role of hero to his particular bit of totty, for which he is suitably rewarded with a slice of sex. Some things never change for males no matter how emancipated their females become. The disposable man: that relentlessly anti-male sexism in our society; it just goes on and on (check-out the by-gender casualty lists of allied forces in Iraq, or the industrial accident fatalities in civilian employment, like - say - the building industry).Likable Ian Holm plays the token foreign-bloke-with-brains. He's British (ah - that 'special relationship' again. Even in such domestic adversity Hollywood hasn't forgotten us. Thanks, Roland). We know Holm's British because his staff watch that curious ancient ritual called soccer. And they do it without swearing, which is something I've never heard before. When he's not being a rebellious android trying to choke Sigourney Weaver with a rolled-up magazine, Holm brings a warm human empathy to any role he plays. But typically, his is the only character I feel moved to care for; the rest are welcome to the freezer, with my compliments. Various other B-listers make the most of their wretched lines before flood or frostbite overtakes them. An uncredited Japanese bloke gets brained by a melon-sized hailstone whilst talking to his wife on the mobile phone, and that's the Orient represented.It's well worth watching to see those very special effects in their entirety and in sequence. If you choose to watch it more than once for the same reason, you'll need to be ready with the 'mute' and 'fast-forward' controls on the handset.Five of my seven stars are awarded on behalf of those people we don't see in the backroom. Those we do see collect the other two. Better than the 1970's? Well, if only the acting, and script had kept pace with the special-effects! But they haven't. If anything, with an ever-greater dependence upon backroom boys to come up with the goods, those much more needful things of story and script have, instead, been neglected. Really big movie stars like Paul Newman and Tom Cruise had (and have) a considerable input to a movie quite beyond their acting. Maybe that's why this flick doesn't have any. And maybe that's why it should have had.",7,1,2,20 September 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," The Zombies Keep Staggering On...
","I can't deny that the 'Resident Evil' franchise is a well-made package. The first one was quite intense with some seriously creepy moments, to say nothing of horrific beasties. But - my goodness - it's been milked for every dollar.In this latest and limpest episode, the techno-beasties are absent. Now it's just 'Dawn Of The Dead' meets 'Matrix'. And if that sounds like a very favourable comparison - it isn't. 'Extinction' doesn't come close to Romero's classic old sequel in terms of tension, plot or simple black humour. And Jovovich's pasty-faced plain-as-a-plank heroine could never be a 'Trinity'. The Zombies versus superwoman plot just wanders into set-piece snarl, leap, kick, snarl, leap, shoot hokum. She's even immune to their 'vampire' bite so it's no contest for the rotting ones. Otherwise there's a big bunch of survivors speeding around in trucks with needless abandon who get progressively wasted by recurrent zombie attacks.The next old idea to be recycled is Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Crows have been feasting on the double-dead stiffs and getting infected. Suddenly, they are gathering around the survivors by the hundred, just like Hitch's classic. Zombie crows? big deal. What about the zombie rats, and the zombie flies? Maybe they'll arrive in the next instalment.This is the fourth course in the dead-flesh menu, and if you ain't replete by now; you'll never be. For me, the hors d'oeuvre was feast enough, and whilst it gave plenty to chew on, even that seemed a bit over-done.I've given it 6 stars because what I saw (about 90%) was well made in most technical aspects. I just couldn't be bothered to watch the end because I've already seen it in the first three instalments.First is best, otherwise the franchise is strictly for the game-fans.",6,1,5,12 April 2011
Cloverfield," Not A Bad Effort
","Frequently compared with 'Blair Witch' as an amateur's movie legacy of terror at ground-zero, 'Cloverfield' comes with a much bigger budget. The scenario spiralling out of control presented from the uninformed 'everyman' perspective rather than that of the more traditional 'expert' was also attempted by Spielberg in his rather hammy, over-the-top borathon remake of 'War Of The Worlds'. Well; Cloverfield is considerably better.The problem - for me, at least - is the lengthy scene-setting preamble. We are treated to a tiresome, hedonistic party of young people, getting highly sexed and pretty drunk, quibbling about their shallow little lives. On and on it goes, with the wobbly hand-cam making for a dizzying sensation. Can there ever be anything more boring than movies of other peoples' parties? For me, it was almost a turn-off.However; for those who stay the course, when things liven-up, they are worth your patience. The wobbly-cam comes into its own. There are some truly excellent scenes of disaster, panic and general chaos, that I would have liked to have dwelt on for a little longer; a great deal of imagination and no little money must have gone into their creation. In the dark, the CGI joins are seldom evident. The main monster is enigmatic and imperfectly seen, which really works better than full-frontal. Late in the movie we do briefly come face-to-face with it in the park as it devours our cameraman, and I found the revelation disappointing - a bit of an anti-climax.As well as the biggie, there's any number of small dog-sized terrors like shrimps or insects that are fast-movie and vicious. So it's not just a case of hiding in a doorway till the 'Godzilla' thing has blundered past.There are plenty of taut little shocks. The set pieces - what can be seen of them - seem excellent.But despite all of the positive technical issues, I come back to the old bugaboo: STORY. It's something that happens to people you are induced to care about. And once again; I wasn't persuaded to give a toss about any of the characters. They are the sort of shallow young brats that inhabit every gore-fest. Freddy Kruger's been dispatching them for years. You'll find 'em in 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'Wolf Creek' - where not? In fact I don't believe I saw a single character above the age of thirty-five. A better mix and more interesting relationships as well as more clearly defined and less stereotypic characters would have been a big plus, and this is where 2 of my stars were lost.As a comparison, I found all of the characters in 'Pitch Black' rather fun, each had something to say, and I was sorry when the got axed.Still; it's got plenty going for it in the effects, sets, and suspense department that are well worth a watch. There's just this rather unfortunate hole where STORY should have been. Some survived, some died. I think the monsters got killed. That's it.",7,1,2,8 June 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Engaging Black Comedy
","Few other than Tim Burton could have realised such grand, brooding, black comedy as 'Sleepy Hollow'. It's filmed on a sumptuous scale and positively oozes Gothic terror.This movie could be said to have 'made' Johnny Depp, who gives an excellent turn as the would-be Sherlock Holmes, a police detective dedicated to the logical evaluation of crime, only to be dispatched to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, where everything BUT logical crime prevails. There's a hint of 'Edward Scissorhands' in some of the style and characterisation, but Burton makes this movie unique in its own right. Filming is highly evocative. There's tremendous depth of focus in some takes, when the whole world seems to be minutely observed. At other times, night and mist are used to excellent effect. Under the phantom horseman's dire spell, the village is drained of colour, there's a damp, eerie sunless gloom even to the daylight. Architecture is imaginative, set-pieces highly detailed and well chosen. Close observation is rewarded, as indeed is repeat viewing; the makers having slipped all manner of sly details that may go unnoticed first time around.I would have liked a slightly clearer development of the plot; there were moments when it seemed a bit haphazard. And the otherwise excellent theme and incidental music was occasionally too strident for my ears. But these are small enough whinges. The cast do a decent job with an adequate script. There are plenty of familiar faces, with Chris Walken as the phantom and Micheal Gambon as a conspirator.This is how Hammer should have made their vampire, werewolf & Frankenstein movies, Though neither the imagination, creativity or budgets were available in those days.Engaging, unique and well worth a watch, though lacking that essential WOW factor.",8,0,0,19 January 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Classic Hollywood Cinema.
","Featuring two of the most iconic actors of their generation, 'Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid' was one of those instant classics that came from that particular period. 'Midnight Cowboy' was another.The two title protagonists are played by Robert Newman and Robert Redford, both at the height of their powers. One is a very talented gunslinger, the other isn't. Both are very good friends. Each has reached the special level of intimacy that takes the other's strengths and weaknesses for granted. They do not compete; there's no need. They are what we would now call: mates.Although the movie is usually classed as a western, it is more a comic opera, like 'Midnight Cowboy' or 'Grumpy Old Men', that is partly set in the west. In fact, half of the action is set in Bolivia, which few would associate with the traditional Hollywood western.The two stars play their roles with an easy economy that is beguiling and entirely believable. They are great fun to watch. Other actors are lesser known but fill their roles without criticism. Filming is wonderful. Great use is made of the American west, and lighting is often sublime. They are on the cusp of the 'great change' that was quickly overtaking the 'wild west', a point emphasised by the emergence (and dismissal) of the safety bicycle.Theme and incidental music is often criticised. You like it or you don't. It was the director's choice, and he chose most other things. I'm happy to take it with the rest of his choices.This is an extremely funny, slow-burning masterpiece that takes its time and draws you in to its slightly 'MASH'-like humour. A movie of the same period. Don't think of it as a western so much as a comedy set in the west and the south. The stars and their parts make it what it is. The ending is comic and - although tragic - too quick to be the stuff of pathos.Highly recommended. It still knocks spots off many later offerings.",8,0,1,25 April 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Flashes In The Pan
","It's one of those continental movies that are so full of 'imagery' and 'symbolism' and 'metaphor'. Mostly, you either like them or you don't.The special effects within the labyrinth itself are really quite excellent. The civil war scenes in the contemporaneous real world are also no less graphic in their display of violence and suffering.The whole movie has a surreal feel in a way that perhaps wasn't intended. It's like an amalgam of 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park', but with the director blown out on LSD. If anything, it seems to have an identity crisis. The lead player who moves between the real world and the labyrinth is a child. That would suggest a juvenile target audience. But the graphic brutality depicted in certain military scenes, not to mention some of the creatures in the labyrinth would hardly be suitable for young viewers. Just because it's arty doesn't mean its fit for kids. For the most part I found the story formulaic and largely predictable. The ending was particularly twee, with the blood dripping down from the child's hand into the underworld fountain. Very prosaic, and so 'symbolic' of maudlin Spanish sentimentality.This movie does at least prove that Iberian cinema is catching up with the English-speaking world. Though it clearly has some way to go.",6,3,7,11 October 2008
Alien," Slightly Disappointing
","Originally watched to a packed audience at the cinema, I found the movie slightly disappointing after the book and the hype.I have the first three on DVD (they're the only ones worth watching) and it is certainly true that this movie has withstood the test of time. It is eerie, horrifying, and extremely tense, with excellent sets and acting performances all round. There really is very little to fault.I'm still a little sceptical about the huge (apparently gravitational) voids containing breathable atmospheres in the spaceship, yet with no obvious means of replenishment. I also find the contrasts of technology a little hokey. The grubby engine-room of the Nostromo more resembles a coal or diesel powered steamship, whereas Ian Holm's character 'Ash' is an android replicant so minutely realised as to pass muster for human to all but the minutest scrutiny. That lot just doesn't stack up.I'm also sceptical about the absolute and exclusive trust everyone places in the medical officer. I would expect such a small, close-knit crew to take a much keener interest in the plight of one of their number, particularly considering his bizarre and horrific condition.Still; get your head around that lot and it's a heavy-duty horror trip of the first water. You'll be hard-pressed to keep still in your seat during some of the more sinister moments. You'll likewise be as hard pressed to keep from laughing when Ash - literally - loses his head.The whole plot was fully realised a few years later in its riveting sequel 'Aliens', and that continues to be the absolute business for me. Only Carpenter's 'The Thing' challenges for the crown.If you ain't seen 'Alien' your horror movie education isn't complete. And you'll want a big screen and an equally big sound system to do things right.Very Highly recommended. Pleasant dreams, now.",8,1,3,8 June 2009
Taxi Driver," Creeping Madness
","A comparatively youthful Robert DeNiro plays lead in the role that might be said to have 'made' him.He is Travis Bickle, a former Vietnam marine turned misfit. Unable to sleep, he resorts to nocturnal taxi-driving in New York. As a character in decline, he is almost a classic example and maybe even voice for all of those similar loners who gradually lapse into psychosis, only to impact upon public consciousness when they decide to correct what's wrong in the world instead of what's wrong in their heads. Bickle has all of the symptoms. He lives in squalor, he's obsessed with physical fitness, he's a gun-freak, he can't make it with women, and all he sees is depravity. But he has a Walter Mitty complex, with preposterous fantasies about himself and some personal destiny for which fate is grooming him. A week never seems to pass when we don't read about just such a case in the papers, with all of the tragic consequences.Much of the movie is inevitably filmed at night with harsh contrasts of darkness and artificial illumination. People and places are imperfectly seen. Sometimes just a flash of expression or a vignette of drama is all we glimpse and must infer the rest, even as Travis Bickle does. Scorsese has worked hard to present nocturnal New York as a sort of hell-on-earth, a breeding-ground for anger, resentment, disappointment and distempered fantasy. Though it's really no different from most major cities today.Like so many people of his stamp, Bickle accumulates an arsenal of guns. At one point, whilst shopping, he interrupts a robbery and shoots - perhaps fatally - the young black culprit. We never know. He departs leaving the furious shop-keeper beating the prostrate robber's body with a baseball bat.At last, in an attempt to 'be somebody' he attempts to rescue a young whore. In the course of it he takes his arsenal and enters the tenement brothel. Without ceremony he begins shooting. It's violent and bloody.But Scorsese clumsily attempts to rescue the fat from the fire. Towards the end, we see a series of newspaper cuttings in which the media have depicted Bickle as some 'hero', engaged in a shoot-out with mobsters. Finally, we encounter him in his cab once more, seemingly balanced and peaceable. It's a highly implausible caricature. The media have often shown themselves to be very quick at pre-judging heroes and villains, but truth eventually comes out. The police could hardly have failed to determine from his handprints on the discarded (and unlicensed) firearms as well as the various holsters and knife-sheath on his person, that they were dealing with a vigilante. The young hooker may have spoken in his favour, but the evidence would've made it pretty clear that he went to the premises tooled-up for serious trouble. As the girl was still a minor, he could and should have just called the police. It's still a very engaging analysis of an outsider on the skids even so.",8,0,0,25 March 2012
Fargo," Unmissable.
","Another commentator has described this movie as one he never wants to end. And you can't say fairer than that. It slyly draws you in with its understated style, and acting that is so perfectly believable, you become fully absorbed in the details.Whoever dreamed-up the idea of a small-town heavily-pregnant female police officer turning detective and unravelling a hideously brutal series of crimes, that culminate in a confrontation with a wood-chipping machine? It's the sort of weirdness that happens in real life rather than the all-too-often implausible movies.We watch a succession of scenes that trail each other like the sets from an opera. Small-town American life in winter in captured with a wonderful phlegmatic simplicity. People just get about their business, whilst meanwhile something monstrous is unfolding.William Macy plays the husband who hires a couple of ruthless goons to stage his wife's kidnapping as an extortion plot. But neither have the wit or wisdom to do it right. Steve Buscemi & Peter Stormare play those goons.Frances McDormand is the WPC who is landed with the job of finding out what's happened. She is neither a graceful nor a pretty woman, and proves once more that females don't need the face and figure of Pamela Anderson to make truly deserving contributions to cinema. Well done, the Coens, for realising this. The little dalliances between herself and her artist husband are touching and funny, and one wonders why other couples cannot be so mutually respectful and accommodating in real life.The sub-plots are supported by funky theme music that segues each along at an unhurried pace, gradually wandering into weirdness, and contrasting their loving normality to the final nightmarish denouement.And she tries to make sense of it all in her simple small-town way. It's such a nice sunny day after all. And just for some money...It's hard to tire of this movie. For all its black humour, it's a personal pleasurable experience. I really ought to give it 10.Watch it yourselves if you doubt me. Or read the other comments.",9,0,0,10 May 2008
The Italian Job," You're Only Supposed To Rip The Bloody Title Off.
","Like many people, I was prejudiced by the title. It betokened yet another hammy Hollywood re-make of an earlier and far more engaging movie, but with the dubious improvements of a bigger budget, more pyrotechnics, and some inevitable CGI.And - that's more or less what we got.It began slickly enough with a tense little heist episode set in the back-waters of Venice. This served as entrée to a boat-chase that was so clearly ripped-off from 'Puppet On A Chain' and a couple of inferior Bond movies that the makers might have borrowed one of their less iconic titles instead (Oh gosh; surely that wasn't another gondola being chopped in half!)The gold they made off with was actually Ukrainian. And that was were the 'Italian Job' ended.What followed was a needlessly violent double-cross, a bout of self-indulgent grieving that I thought would never end. And, of course, revenge - a very long revenge. There were one or two occasions when I was genuinely bored.That initial heist in Venice was simple, self-explicit and therefore quite involving. However, the rest of the movie was played out in San Francisco (yawn) which is obviously a much cheaper location, being just down the road from Hollywood. There's no obscure, crooked bureaucracy or foreign language to get your head around either. But I've seen it in so many movies by now that I could surely draw a street-plan from memory. And it was here that a presumption of audience stupidity set in, and things began to happen with practically no explanation at all. It was high-technology, you see. Viewers had to be computer whizz-kids. You either understood it or you didn't. I lost count of the frequency with which I saw fingers deftly running-over keyboards with little or no explanation. And likewise there were brief shots of data flashing up and across screens, but again with no additional clarity. Basically, the message was that a laptop in the hands of big enough nerd could work miracles. I wasn't convinced. Then, without the least introduction, new characters just popped-up to fill plot gaps, including one huge fat 'fixer' like Jabba the Hut. Fifteen seconds of fame for him (and perhaps a crash-diet to follow). After the 'Puppet On A Chain' chase rip-off, we were next treated to a 'Bullit' chase rip-off through the streets of San Francisco, and finally a rip-off from the original 'Italian Job' with mini-cars chasing through storm drains. I also spotted a number of other little out-dated and stolen clichés, but frankly - just one day after viewing - I have already forgotten what they were.Memorable, this isn't. Since 1969 I have seen 'The Italian Job' many many times. I know how it goes and how it ends. But it's such a fun feel-good movie that it still entertains me today. This? I don't expect to see it again.'Story' I was once told, is something that happens to somebody you have been moved to care about. And there's the rub. Like so many other modern movies; I couldn't care a hoot about any of these implausible two-dimensional plastic characters: not them, or what happened to them. The standard Hollywood 'pouting totty' was the least plausible of all. Though naturally; she wasn't just a pretty face; she also happened to be an expert safe-cracker and rally-cross driver too. A sort of latter-day Lara Croft. Quite. It's no more than I've come to expect in this age of emancipation.Perhaps they should have called it 'All The Crime Caper Movies You've Ever Seen Rolled Into One Job', or maybe 'Ocean's Eleven Clichés'.There are worse offerings to watch, but you could pile-up a much bigger stack of better ones - unless perhaps you're a computer-nerd.Nice title - shame about the film.",5,7,14,20 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I Never Read The Book.
","And this movie is as good an explanation as any. It goes on, and on, and on.It's basically a 1-hour drama, that's been stretched into 3 by the simple expedient of drawing-out every detail. Unfortunately, most of them seem to exceed my attention-span, and I find myself constantly willing the thing to move on when instead it lingers, and lingers. On a face, on an expression, on a parting, on a re-union; every take is d-i-s-t-e-n-d-e-d as if in some kind of slow-motion celebration. Speeches are endless, verbose and largely uninformative. Revellations that could be made in a single line pour out as thickly and as gradually as cold molasses. This is exactly how I found Mr T's book.The bottom line of any story is this: do we begin to care about the characters? Well, I certainly don't. I couldn't care a toss. They could all get swallowed-up by the evil-one with good luck and begone. And who needs to care about a wizard that is apparently immortal, but yet can't spot a double-cross from his own boss. Crikey; even I could see that one coming; it was Christopher Lee, for heaven's sake.There is no arguing with the splendid camera-work and lighting. Likewise the special-effects and CGI are surely beyond criticism. Real and imaginary landscapes blend in a seamless testament to back-room creativity. The idea of a tiny all-powerful trinket is also very intriguing. But the endless meetings, the endless goodbyes, the endless battles, the endless monologues, the implausible mood-swings, the maudlin sentimentality, the shocked, staring, angry, knowing, expressions that linger, linger on, gobbling-up the celluloid and the precious moments of my life, and the sheer tight-arsed-ness of a movie that takes itself more seriously than its viewers, ultimately breaks my heart and has me reaching for the coffee pot.Clearly, I am not a Tolkien fan. But I shouldn't have to be in order to enjoy this movie. Neither am I a fan of Alistair Maclean, but I still enjoyed 'Where Eagles Dare' & 'The Guns Of Navarone'. There have been no less than 2 sequels, which I understand to be equally pompous and boring. Lord bless the name of Tolkien. I will never live long enough to see them.",6,1,7,14 September 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," More Of The Same
","If 'The Matrix' was a nerdgasm, and 'The Matrix Reloaded' another nerdgasm, 'Revolutions' is what happens after the 'gasm - but without that sense of satisfying warmth. It's floppy, disappointing, and with a hint of recrimination.Neo and the gang are whizzing about in their black macs as usual. Mr Smith is doing his sunglasses 'n' suit routine. They're still flying about fighting. The sentinels are still on the rampage. There's so many special effects that you can't take 'em all in at once, which is pointless. And the script - ah; the script, more verbal hokum. In short; it's become a parody of itself.The original deserved its reputation for ingenuity and special effects. But that was it. The franchise really didn't have anything else to offer. But those Hollywood moguls can't help themselves. If they make a fortune; there just have to be sequels. They have to squeeze the tube out completely. Even if the result is tack.We've seen it with the 'Alien' franchise; we've seen it with the 'Terminator' franchise; 'Halloween', 'Friday 13th', 'Predator', and so on. Looking back, I don't think I could discern one 'Matrix' from another in my memory. They're all just a collective gloomy continuum. Thank heavens Carpenter left his 'Thing' as just a stand-alone classic.I'm sure there are nerds out there who can manage a third erection. Well; not me. The first two just weren't that good. No; I'll have a whisky instead.Don't play with yourselves too hard - you might go blind.",5,0,0,9 October 2010
The Thing," Top-drawer science fiction.
","There are some movies that qualify for the definition 'classic' and this is surely one.Carpenter has made a number of interesting horror/suspense movies, but it is THE THING that truly ranks as his masterpiece.The plot is almost as old as the creature. A group of people go somewhere isolated, stumble upon something very nasty, and seem powerless to deal with it. But it is also a bit of a who-done-it, leaving the viewer to second-guess which amongst a group of suspects might be the real villain. A nice little job for Poirot.The story unfolds with some Norwegians in a helicopter chasing a runaway dog into an American Antarctic research station. After a brief skirmish both are killed. Two of the American team then fly-off to investigate the Norwegian base a few miles away, unaware that the enemy - in the form of the dog - is now already within. What they find at the Norwegian base is chaos and death, and a grotesque artifact burned and frozen in the snow. They bring it back.The artifact must be seen rather than described, and gives rise to one of those truly classic moments. It is placed on an examination table in the medical facility and unwrapped to the bald explanation 'we found this'. 'This' is not clearly seen. The camera shifts at about waist-level between the tightly clustered men, switching between tantalising glimpses of bizarre anatomy and expressions of shock and disgust amongst those assembled. One feels like a child struggling to see beyond a crowd of grown-ups, which heightens the sense of vulnerability. What can be seen is slowly thawing-out; it glistens and drips, as chilled vapour rises.The undoubted star of the show is Rob Bottin, for this and many other frightfully disturbing effects. They are all the more remarkable for a movie that predates computer-generated imaging. What you see is pretty-well what you get: shocks and gore a-plenty. During my first viewing in 1982; when the infected dog's head split open, someone actually ran out of the cinema.The movie unfolds with sustained periods of slowly-building tension inter-spaced by moments of almost hallucinogenic monstrosity. As it gradually becomes evident that this thing could be anyone, members of the group no longer trust each other. That, and the stifling intimacy of small rooms and narrow corridors add to a sense of paranoia.Carpenter employed Ennio Morriconi to provide the music score. This was a wise choice because Mr Morriconi is able to dilate upon the simple themes of horror and suspense in the way that only a professional musician can, evaluating the impact that events may have upon the broader spectrum of human feelings. There is a particularly well-rendered piece during the flight to the Norwegian base, in which the helicopter is seen in long-shot against the huge expanse of frozen wilderness. The music is weighted with string instruments and imparts a sense not so much of horror as one of tragedy and despair - which is what this organism truly represents beyond our own simple fears: the utter destruction of all life on earth.And where there is no music, there is the endlessly moaning wind.The set pieces are simple and entirely believable, from the cheesy common-room where you can almost smell tobacco and stale socks, to the dank frost-bound storage areas. The wrecked Norwegian base is sublimely executed. Notice the pink tinge around the block of ice from which the original fossil was apparently cut, hinting of organic tissue and unpleasant circumstances.This is, strictly speaking, a 'B' movie. It contains no 'stars' except perhaps Kurt Russell. But because of their unfamiliarity on screen, the other actors are all the more plausible as ordinary people. They are aptly chosen and play their parts with understated conviction. Radically, it is an all-male cast, so there is non of the 'romantic' digression expected in most other movies. You are given nothing else to consider but the creature and how to deal with it, just like the actors themselves. This focuses thought and draws you into their dilemma.Horror aside, if you're into thought-provoking science fiction, this is the stuff. The most disturbing element for me was the realisation that such an organism could exist. An anti-virus: this is one that instead of changing host cells into copies of itself, rather assumes a similitude of the organism instead, thereby also inheriting its intelligence. Such a thing could leap 4 billion years of evolution with just one single infection. Imagine HIV with a 3-figure IQ; truly, the stuff of nightmares. I've docked a point because I am fed-up with Hollywood helicopters that apparently can't hover. The Norwegians could have done this and simply shot and bombed the dog to hell. I also think that someone on the American team would have considered putting the animal into quarantine, at least until more was known. After all, the Norwegians would hardly be chasing it for fun. It might perhaps have had rabies. And all animals - including humans - have fleas, lice, or just skin mites. These would likewise be infected and infectious. Then, being nosey, I wanted to see inside the spaceship. Finally, check-out the scene where the monster has absorbed the other dogs and throws-up two big arms to punch a hole in the roof. As it hauls itself up, you hear the sound of a squeaky winch or block-and-tackle, which one suspects is what they used to lift it; but whoever forgot to oil the wheels also forgot to edit-out the noise.The quirky ending suggested a sequel, but - for whatever reason - it never happened (good job Sigourney Weaver wasn't in it).Don't dwell on my nit-picking though; this is definitely a collector's item. In half a century, movie buffs will still be talking about THE THING.",9,0,1,4 March 2006
Armageddon," Utter Rubbish
","Well, for those who thought 'Deep Impact' was lacking in essential cinematic quality; here's 'Armageddon' to trump their disappointment.This movie is not just bad; it's so expensively bad that it beggars belief. I really don't know where to begin, so I won't try. Those who gave it less than 3 stars saw it for what it was. Those who gave it more (and - yes - I know where you live) are in desperate need of an intellectual enema.Which leaves me to ask these questions. Why couldn't Hollywood make an asteroid collision movie that would answer to an IQ above 100? How is it that an industry that can serve-up blinding science-fiction thrillers like 'Aliens' and 'The Thing', as well as thoroughly enjoyable fantasy romps like 'Star Wars' can also dish-out such preposterous tripe as 'Armageddon'? It's a paradox. And for me it's insoluble.Don't waste time or money. This is the sort of space debris that is becoming an increasing hazard to satellites.I cannot disavow it enough.",2,4,7,12 July 2009
Pitch Black," An exceptional science-fiction movie.
","This movie came as a nice surprise. I thought I had just about sampled everything: Strange worlds, beastly aliens, and the almost obligatory morphing. What else was left? Well, with 'Pitch Black' its more of the same. But the flavour and the texture are refreshingly original.The opening moments are formulaic enough, but they're neat and accomplished. A spaceship in space - yes. Even the director didn't care for that, which is a good sign. But it's all okay, and the camera doesn't linger. There is a very well chosen music-score that has a satisfying metallic quality about it suggestive of catwalks and airlocks that bodes well for the rest of the movie. It immediately feels like a complete package - you're there, right with them, out in space. Excellent.Vin Deisel has a rare and remarkable voice, it compares with that of James Mason or Richard Burton, and his silky, cynical narration at the outset carries a chill.Things begin to happen very quickly. There are interesting angles on old effects. Tension and conflicts arise and develop well.And that's how the movie proceeds. It's the old formula again: a group of people go somewhere remote and find something nasty they don't know how to deal with. But every take has a sly, new angle that keeps you guessing.Some very clever work is done with light - there being a world in a planetary system with three suns. And the special effects, although by now almost certainly CGI, offer plenty to admire. A developing eclipse is extremely well-observed and fascinating to watch. Check-out the contra-rotating rings around the planet, and the aurorae in its high atmosphere. Someone put an awful lot of thought into this. It's one of the most visually beautiful events I have seen in a sci-fi movie. And I do assure you, I have watched it a lot of times.The sudden appearance of the aliens is another surprise and spectacle. They go on to be suitably hideous and badly-behaved.One of the other real treats is the disparity of characters and the quality of their acting. I am only slightly familiar with two of them, but they all give a sterling performance. They are the best case yet for using cheap, hungry unknowns rather than squandering megabucks on big-name stars who can ultimately do no better. The slick, terse script brings conviction to each player. You are moved to care for all of them, despite their obvious vices. And you come away wondering what you would do in their shoes.On the surface of the planet, the incidental music changes to a kind of aboriginal percussion riff. It's simple, even minimalist, yet once again it suits the circumstances perfectly well.The whole thing hangs together as a piece so well that movie-making looks easy. It's only when you see some of the other pigs that you realise it's not. This one isn't perfect, but I don't intend to nit-pick; I like it too much.Excellent directing, good story, well-chosen music, solid script, believable acting, beautiful special-effects, sound and lighting. Just add popcorn.",9,0,1,21 March 2006
North by Northwest," Classic Hitchcock
","'North By Northwest' opens as angularly-presented credits merge slickly into the facade of a modern office-block. The work sets a trend for Alfred Hitchcock's quirky and original thriller.Cary Grant plays a perfectly normal, urbane (gosh; you can say that again) businessman who is mistaken for someone else. And if that isn't trouble enough; the someone else doesn't actually exist. He's a fictional front created by the secret service. But they've done such a good job that nothing this schmuck can say will convince the bad guys that he is who he claims to be, and not this mysterious nobody.Hitchcock leads us through a wonderfully convoluted and suspenseful plot. Our hero survives his kidnap and attempted murder. He becomes a suspected murderer himself, and is pursued by authorities and traitors alike.Eva Marie Saint plays an American agent femme-fatale (she's the sort of pretty blonde that Hitchcock couldn't keep his hands off). James Mason plays the master criminal with coldly-confident aplomb, whilst Martin Landau plays his sidekick with more than a hint of homosexual jealousy. Set pieces and locations are extremely imaginative, especially the showdown at Mount Rushmore. There is also a wonderfully unconventional house. And, of course, there's the crop-dusting plane.I may be out of tune with popular opinion here, but if there is a single bum note in the whole movie it is the star himself. I have never understood the appeal of Cary Grant. His oleaginous features and strange whining voice seem completely unsuited to the role of action man. Frankly, I can't think of a less suitable choice. Gregory Peck would have given an equally suave turn whilst bringing some much-needed gravitas to the role. It is hard to imagine Grant not having a glass of bourbon in his hand throughout the movie.Still a great - if dated - watch, but spoilt by the limp-wristed urbanity of its over-hyped star.",8,0,3,6 November 2010
Knowing," Silly Sci-Fi
","'Knowing...' Yes.First big turn-off for me was the claim 'starring Nicholas Cage'. Cage is usually the first choice in a B-movie that has pretensions of being grand. He takes the concept of vulnerable hero into wearisome extremis. He's a one-dimensional actor, and that's what he does. Here, he's a widower tortured by memories relating to the death of his wife. Yes; that tiresome old chestnut. He's a science Professor, single-dad and he hits the bottle. Get the picture? Still, a trailer depicting a passenger-jet crash caught my eye and suggested further interest.What develops is a slow-burning (gosh, you can say that again) yarn about - well - almost everything. There's children involved; which, in an American movie, is usually a very bad sign. A strange script comes to light, written 50 years before, that appears to predict most every disaster up to the present time, and then beyond. At some stage mysterious men in black begin appearing and start handing out... pebbles. Mysterious men handing out pebbles? Very, very mysterious.The air-crash occurs as predicted. And mighty impressive it is, too. The movie then movies into its second phase - whither the secret knowledge on the script? Now Cagey enlists the help of a single mum (handy) and we embark upon a 'Da Vinci Code' style investigation that entails a lot of running, fast driving, scarcely-audible whispered dialogue in gloomy places and self-indulgent navel-gazing. Pebbles keep turning up! What's the score? Well, it seems there's a culminating disaster in the pipe. We're doomed. And these MIB turn out to be extra-terrestrials in disguise who mean to save our species - and some rabbits. But for some reason they're only taking children. Why no adults? Ah that's something we are left 'unknowing'. Why this long-winded 50 year old prediction-mystery? That's unknowing as well. What about - The Pebbles, then? They come from a dried-up river bed near the alien pick-up point. Significance unknowing, but mysterious.So that's it. The Earth gets cauterised. A (very few) kids get saved to grow up into feral adults like those in 'Lord of the Flies'. There's special-effects a-plenty for those who manage to stay awake. Booming cords to prevent the bored from falling asleep, with enough base to burn out your sub-woofer. And that's about it. Put 'ET', 'Signs' 'The DaVinci Code', & 'MIB' in a blender; here's the result.It stars Nicholas Cage; let that be a lesson to you.",5,1,6,20 November 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Machine Stops.
","It's such a pity that Hollywood seems almost incapable of realising when a franchise has run its course. So, they go on. And on.Two terminators were quite enough. The first was a creepy, almost B-movie horror flick - simple, but eminently well presented. 'Judgement Day' on the other hand, was a truly epic work of science fantasy. Between the two they used up all of the ideas associated with the concept. There was nothing else to play for. So why then not finish on a high note? Because there's still money in it; that's why. Like prospectors mining gold, they just can't accept that the vein has run out.OK, what else can we do that's new? I know; how about a female terminator? We can always build a story round that. Yes. Actually, the T1000 of 'Judgement Day' was itself capable of completely mimicking any human females it killed, so what was the point of a dedicated design? I won't go on. Objective critics have seen all of the movie's shortcomings. Only nerds sat back and gaped in awe at this one.Yes; the new effects were excellent. The tanks that had a hint of 'Robocop' about them were highly believable hokum, as were the flying machines. But we'd seen them all before, just fewer in number. The acting was plausible but hardly set the screen on fire. Arnie actually looked bored in this outing, which is something of an acting revelation for him. And the script was - well - cheesy.Judgement Day it transpires was, after all, unavoidable. It took an extra two hours of repetitive, rehashed celluloid mayhem of slaughter, truck-chases, and shattering glass to tell us that? I don't think so.Watching inadequate sequels to favourite movies is rather like seeing old friends dying from some wasting illness.",5,1,2,3 July 2008
U-571," Best Worst Submarine Movie.
","With all of the new advances in sound and visual technology, there was ample scope for a truly authentic, modern American re-make of the classic 'submarine movie' of the 1950's and 60's. And heaven knows, it doesn't require much study to realise that Yank submariners played a huge part in the war. The Pacific war, that is - not the Atlantic. There were some tremendous daring-do escapades with memorable victories. In fact, I understand that the American fleet was the most successful submarine fleet of the war, with also fewer casualties per unit vessel. They accounted for over half of all Japanese maritime losses.Movie-makers don't need to invent heroes and scenarios then; they are already spoilt for choice. So why this? Why a completely fictitious movie not only about an event that didn't happen, but a travesty of true naval history? I believe it is generally agreed that the 'enigma' capture was a British success. The Yanks weren't even there. Moreover when Britain began supplying the USA with intelligence intercepts garnered from its application, they were ignored by their naval high-command, with appalling consequences to coastal shipping. But then, Hollywood's air-brushing out of American mistakes and British successes is almost as inevitable as the type-casting of Germans as dumb, robotic bigots. It's not something to take personally. Though after all this time it does get a bit tiresome.Audio-visually at least the movie was right on the money, especially if you have a decent home cinema. Bangs and clangs come over solid and visceral. There was clever, though rather obvious use of CGI. Little issues of personal tension didn't harm the rather shallow Alistair Mclean style plot and gave a little substance to its equally shallow characters. Unfortunately, all the old clichés were stowed aboard too: conflict between skipper and first officer ('Run Silent Run Deep', 'Up Periscope', 'Crimson Tide'), cat-and-mouse conflict with a destroyer ('The Enemy Below', 'Das Boot'), diving below the vessel's test-depth (Yawn - 'Das Boot', 'The Enemy Below', 'Ice Station Zebra', 'Crimson Tide') and so on.And there simply isn't enough space to enumerate all of the tactical-technical errors that could have been avoided with just a little research.Like so many Hollywood offerings today, - 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbour', 'Gladiator' - a wonderful opportunity was abandoned in favour of crass spectacle. Instead, we got a movie that shamefully ignored all of the American submariners' sterling accomplishments - true episodes at least as remarkable as those depicted here - in favour of well-engineered, implausible, and frankly misleading pap.Don't worry about snubbing us Brits. We're thick-skinned and used to it. But if I were a Yank instead, I would regard this movie as an act of treason, so shamefully does it disavow their true nautical heroes.It's a pity the director didn't just update 'Torpedo Run'.",5,35,55,17 January 2008
"I, Robot"," Seven Stars Is About Right
","Will Smith stars as the clichéd cop-with-attitude, and it's particularly an attitude towards robots, in this otherwise fairly formulaic who-done-it.Set somewhen 'in the future' where technology has advanced in a curiously ad-hoc way. Robots are apparently commonplace. Strangely; they are all of the same type. The kind of variety we might associate with - say - vehicles has not apparently been realised in the world of robotics. There, the i-Pod clone appears to rule.Some robots are good. Some are bad. One is uniquely smart, like Johnny-5 from 'Short Circuit'. When their inventor dies in a fall through a window, this prodigy becomes Will Smith's prime suspect. Though things are naturally more complicated, and the conspiracy runs deeper.At a technical level, a lot of money has been spent. Music and especially sound track are competent. All other issues such as lighting and editing are on the money. The whole thing is just a wee bit too formulaic for its own good. But special effects vary. The CGI is often so naff that the spell of believability is almost broken. The robots in particular lack substance. Sometimes its almost like watching two movies simultaneously, one with humans in it and another cartoonish equivalent featuring the CGI cybernetics. Which, of course, is exactly how it was put together. It takes a REAL machine to look REAL - as in 'Short Circuit'; but clearly the hundreds of robots featured here could not possibly have been individually constructed within a viable budget. It's just a pity that at least one two were not; that would have greatly enhanced plausibility.Finally; Will (lobes) Smith was the least suitable lead. He himself has the face of a cartoon creature, and what with those preposterous ears of his it is almost impossible to take him seriously. He may not be a comic, but he's certainly comical. A more serious actor would have raised the movie's threshold considerably. Perhaps Denzel Washington...This work is a Hollywood fantasy take on Asimov's academic fiction. It's worth a watch, but just don't expect any serious evaluation about life and personal identity; there was more of that even in T2. And don't look too closely at the CGI/human interface. Finally; try not to laugh at Will Smith's Mickey-Mouse ears.",7,0,1,20 May 2010
The Alamo," Yet Another Alamo
","It's the third millennium and time for yet another revisionist movie. Most commentators seem to agree that this version of the Alamo siege is the most historically authentic of them all. Well, that's as may be. I'll have to take their word for it. I'm no student of American history.However; it is supposed to be entertainment. It's a movie. It's not billed as a documentary, nor even a docu-drama. If I really want historical accuracy I'll opt for a documentary. Or read scholastic history books (though even they are often inaccurate). When I watch a movie, I want entertainment. I'd like authenticity too - but not at the cost of viewing pleasure.This revisionist piece stars Billy Bob Thornton, along with wooden Mr Quaid. Adequate, but not exactly top drawer. It runs for some 2 hours 17 minutes, but - goodness me - it seems a great deal longer. I felt as though I had sat through the entire '13 days of glory'. I don't believe I have ever experienced a more gloomy, maudlin, self-indulgent piece of theatre. Incidental music assumed the substance of a dirge.There's also a fair share of soul-searching in John Wayne's original epic, but that's offset by spectacle, comedy, and irony in the grand old style of Hollywood sagas. Wayne's 'director's cut' ran for well over 3 hours, but was hacked down to about 2 and a half for its release.I love John Wayne's version. It may be preposterous, over-blown, and have little regard for truth. But it's a truly great movie - lavish, well-paced with progressively-building tension, and beautifully filmed. There's a script that intelligently meets every dramatic turn, with characters that are interesting and varied. And, of course, there's Big John himself - larger than life, full of panache and unique style, and a tremendously capable actor. He's balanced against Richard Widmark's surly, scathing Bowie. And the whole thing is bolted in place by a grand music score from Dimitri Tiomkin. As a movie; it's a classic tour-de-force on par with 'Zulu'.Give me Wayne's romantic mythologising any day. As they say in 'Liberty Vallance' - when the legend becomes truth, print the legend'. Purists are welcome to Billy Bob & Wooden Quaid's revisionism; for me it's just a relentless bore and a half. Despite its presumptions of historical fidelity; I didn't enjoy watching it. And what's the point of that?Not recommended.",4,1,4,16 August 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The typing-error-with-muscles never did it better.
","This was one of those sequels - like 'Aliens' - that was superior to its excellent original. Far superior.For many years it set the benchmark in every aspect of science-fiction special effects and edge-of-the-seat action. Sound engineering aficionados tested their home-movie gadgetry on the basis of its tremendous sound score. Check out the moment when a terminator stamps on a human skull. You hear a heavy, ringing clunk of metal, a reedy crunch of bone, and a thumping impact as the foot hits the earth beneath. The sounds, in almost instantaneous succession, exactly interpret the imagery and the anticipation of the viewer. That's how it's done. It looks simple, but it's an art in itself.How to begin a movie about machines taking over the world? Simple; You demonstrate that it's already happened, with opening shots of multi-lane highways choked by ever-demanding vehicles. It's just what we'd do with robots - a theme taken up by the later and inferior 'I Robot'.Those few minutes of opening sequence are alone worth the price of admission. As credits roll we see a fire-storm in slight slow-motion to choreograph with the wonderful theme music. It doesn't sound like music for a horror film; it's a romantic composition that wouldn't be out of place in a Jane Austen period piece. It's a human theme. But slowly and surely, as the hideous muzzle of a cyborg condenses from the flames, the metallic tattoo of the original rises to dominate and usurp, foretelling human overthrow by their creations. A new terminator is on the case. This one's a shape-shifting mimic called a T1000. The 'Arnie' model is now old-hat. Once again this movie set the standard in CGI morphing techniques. Both cyborgs get to battle it out for the life or death of a child who will grow to destroy them in their future. Script is taut, brief and solid. Directing is flawless. Everybody acts their part with conviction - even the wayward kid. Violence is brutal and hideous. Destruction is magnificent. Trucks are wrecked as a matter of routine. A caterpillar-tracked robot of the future, briefly glimpsed in cameo before going-up in flames was reputed to cost $30,000 alone. It's a blank-cheque movie that deserved every penny.There's a poignant scene somewhere in the desert, where the heroine - played by Linda Hamilton - is seated in the balm of the evening. A westering sun mantles the world in a golden glow, kids can be heard laughing and playing, a Spanish guitar whispers peacefully. It's a moment of beautiful ambiance. But she slips into a doze and dreams a dream of nuclear holocaust depicted with such terrifying vividness as to be an object-lesson in nuclear disarmament. Everyone at Bombs-Are-Us should see their family depicted in this way.If you look close you may spot some faults; I didn't. And it's easy to argue about the logical impossibility of it all. But if this movie doesn't make you think and feel and wonder - then you must be a machine yourself.",10,5,8,18 March 2006
Heartbreak Ridge," Disappointing
","Directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood, of whom I have been a fan on either side of the camera; I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with his work here.It is formulaic to the point of prescription. I don't think I see any scene in this movie that I haven't seen elsewhere. An already quite clearly ageing Eastwood is far too old for the part. He just sleep-walks his way through the role of a grizzled platoon leader, out to whup some misfits into shape. The humour is entirely predictable. The jokes come trudging-up with the inevitability of an old soldier, when they really ought to have faded away. There's the inevitable personal conflicts, a little bit of love-interest in the form of a female bar-keeper, and so on. Even the combat sequences are pretty stagy, with unimaginative location-work.I've watched it two or three times, now. Each time I wonder if I fell asleep or something and missed the good stuff. But not so; it's exactly what it is: a completely formulaic military vehicle, but one in which the wheels don't actually fall off; they were never fitted in the first place.Shame on you Clint. Though your other stuff's made up for it.",5,13,21,23 July 2009
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Then
","Viewed in retrospect, Coppola's ambitious, sprawling, statement on the Vietnam war, has the appearance of a crack-smoker's nightmare. It certainly doesn't live up to the hype of yesteryear.The intro is now surely one of the most boring in movie history, depicting what appears to be a dream sequence in the hero's head as the credits come and go. Youthful Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, wishing he was back in the war. Alternately we glimpse a montage of helicopters and pyrotechnics, interspaced by images of his troubled, staring eyes. It's over-long. Already I'm impatient.We eventually learn that he has been selected for a mission to assassinate some rogue Colonel. So; off he goes.The core of the movie takes us through a fairly typical series of set-piece 'Nam clichés. Contempt for authority, loss of mission belief, disobedience, paranoia, psychosis, military blundering, slaughter of the innocents, disconnected officers; all the recurrent themes of the genre are addressed with a suitably heavy hand. If US forces really are so dysfunctional; it's hardly surprising that they lost. For much of the time Sheen's voice narrates his thoughts about the mission, its renegade target, and the world about him. That also is the stuff of cliché.None of the characters excite our particular sympathy. They are all largely 2-dimensional; their inclusion simply fits a predetermined scenario. And when they die, we don't really care. Even Sheen's Willard is coldly unappealing.Eventually, after yet more set-piece - and frankly ridiculous phantasmagoria - we are face to face with Colonel Kurtz: Willard's nemesis. This character is 'played' by Marlon Brando, who was already a fast-fading legend. We only ever see him in half-light because he was, by now, and quite rightly, so self-conscious about his appearance that it was a condition of his involvement in the movie. He babbles slowly and incoherently as lunatics are apt to do. The encounter is such a darkly plodding and tedious experience that it's almost a book-end to the beginning. Eventually, the deed is done and it's time to go.Accolades were heaped upon this movie. Perhaps in its day they were deserved. I think they had more to do with the inclusion of that Lord God Of Stardom (read preposterous fat clown) Brando, than anything else. He had already assumed such a cult status, almost any movie in which he featured was deemed to be a classic. But fans who remember that hungry young cannibal on the waterfront, will find him a contender for nothing more than 'Booby of The Year' in this production.It is sumptuously filmed in vibrant colour and has a stellar cast who pop up and vanish like gooks, including a make-tea-and-miss Harrison Ford just 2 years after a dominant role in 'Star Wars'. The script is likewise below par. That so-oft-repeated 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' courtesy of a fleeting Robert Duvall is memorable for no other reason than being the only line worth quoting.If you're high on something at time of viewing then you may connect with the imagery and 'message', but by any sober evaluation, it's meandering, over-blown and pompous. Not recommended. I actually gave more points to John Wayne's uber-simplistic but at least coherent 'Green Berets'.",5,2,6,10 March 2011
Van Helsing," Hammer Never Did It Like This
","Not to be compared with the under-funded, frequently pretentious, but still enjoyable Peter Cushing sorties, 'Van Helsing' is a rip-snorting out-and-out swashbuckling, tribute to the whole Hammer horror genre.The stuffy vampire-fighter of yore has been upstaged by an Indiana Jones character. Bookish, educated, but fundamentally a man of action.And what action! The movie begins with him taking-down an extremely ogreish Quasimodo type (Mr Hyde) in a bell-tower. Later he is transferred to field-duty in vampire country, where he teams-up with a demented power-girl who has her own vengeful agenda against the powers of darkness.Dracula has got a plan so cunning it would boil Baldrick's brain. And for this he requires a werewolf and Frankenstien's monster. So; with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde we more or less have the lot. Special-effects and CGI are absolutely mesmerising. The latter are, without any doubt, the best that I have seen, and go largely unsung in the movie as a whole. Likewise there are some wonderful set-pieces that give a whole new definition to 'gothic'. Van Helsing also has some wacky, James Bond-like gadgets such as a machine crossbow that shoots silver bolts.Camera-work is excellent. Some of what appear to be micro-camera panning sequences merge with the astonishing CGI effects more seamlessly than those of the 'Rings' trilogy. It is, as they say, a roller-coaster ride.Hugh Jackman is not a particularly commanding screen presence, but here he fills his boots at least adequately. Kate Beckinsale is likewise rather a lukewarm heroine tricked-up like an extra from the 'Rocky Horror Show'. They both have the rather blandly handsome looks of cyberspace avatars, as if they themselves were computer generated. Together they make the most of an exceedingly cheesy script.Shuker Hensley gives the Frankenstien's monster genuine humanity (no irony intended), Mr Hyde lets Robbie Coltrane join the fun, whilst all are upstaged by Richard Roxburgh as the campily expansive Dracula.This isn't serious stuff. It's not a corny morality tale. It's a joyously tongue-in-cheek romp through the whole horror genre that put wine and cheese on the tables at Hammer studios over so many years. But it's done with flair, style and just the right touches of shock and sentiment. If you can stay with the ride; for 2 hours it will absolutely enthral you.",8,1,3,2 November 2008
Dunkirk," So - Where's Dunkirk?
","For grey-haired Brexiteers like me, weaned upon a diet of 1950's British stiff-upper-lipped-ness (BSULN), a modern movie re-kindling that - now long lost - spirit was surely a must-see. I hadn't been to the cinema in donkeys' years; put off not so much by modern movies (which are bad enough) but by audiences of ignorant huge-headed bag-crackling crisp-crunching gas-bags who came to ruin the whole experience. And with a comfy chair, big HD telly and unlimited Stella, it would take something special to prise me off the cushions and fork out over £13(!). Well, if any word might do it; 'Dunkirk' might. If ever a word conjures up notions of legendary BSULN - Dunkirk is that conjurer's word. I have a DVD of the much cherished 1950's version featuring those grandees of wartime spunk, John Mills and Dickie Attenborough, not to mention a reassuring dollop of Bernard Lee. It's an excellent work from start to finish. Every aspect of the great debacle and culminating 'miracle' is included and carefully edited into a coherent story, from home-grown civilian cynicism about the 'phoney' war, the collapsing French defence, discussions at High-Command, desperate British regrouping, French refugees, mountains of abandoned logistics, slaughter on the beaches and final deliverance. It ain't no masterpiece, but it's a very coherent, sterling work of typically understated performances, representing people with sufficient depth that you can care about them and their fate; all re-created by character actors who actually experienced both the war and the times.Cut to yesterday. This modern take on the great event is shallow in the extreme. Oh-sure; the combat scenes are visceral enough with sound levels fit to cause tinnitus, but coherent story telling? believable characters? An overview of the great historical event? Forget it! Considering the makers of this movie had almost unlimited funds and CGI, this should've resembled a Cecil B Demille epic. There were supposed to be over 350,000 allied soldiers trapped in Dunkirk! I swear I've seen more people in Tesco's at Christmas than are depicted here. The beaches seem practically empty. And those people to whom we are introduced appear two-dimensional, like cardboard cut-outs.The 'collapse' is depicted by about half a dozen British Tommies walking negligently through suburbs, evidently unaware of the war, only to be mown down. One survives and encounters the French rear-guard. That's it. Time for a crap on the dunes. They're deserted, so what the hell? After that, there's a series of small set-piece conflicts drawn progressively together by the choppiest editing I've ever witnessed. All the characters are two-dimensional and unexplained. There's no back-fill story at all. A quite disproportionate amount of time is spent aloft with the RAF. Three whole Spitfires are presented almost reverentially, as if they alone turned the military tide. They skirmish with bombers and fighters, shooting down all they encounter with one quick burst of gunfire. The last one, running out of fuel, gracefully lands on the beaches of Dunkirk, in mellow westering sunlight, as the strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations grind away at half speed. It's frankly mythologising of the most juvenile kind. I almost laughed. (And incidentally; that Spitfire was travelling northeast along the Belgian coast, so the sun would have to be setting in the opposite direction!)If you're a millennial - the sort who wanders vacantly about the streets gaping into the screen of a mobile phone; someone with no more depth of character than those depicted here; raised upon revisionary history and brain-washed into being a bien pensant of the glorious European Union, this movie will seem as authentic as your friends on Facebook. But if you're of an earlier generation; you might want to watch the 1950's version at home, on the big telly, with the unlimited Stella. It's better in every way.",2,120,221,9 August 2017
Aliens," Could Hardly Be Improved.
","Rarely does a sequel do greater justice to an idea than the original. But 'Aliens' manages it in spades.The music and sound score alone are absolutely mesmerising. If you haven't got a good system, you're missing-out big time. Here's a simple thing; just listen to the 3 latches locking into place when Ripley's 'lifeboat' is recovered by the deep-space explorer. You can't see them, but you can hear them, ker-k-link, each in succession, right around your sound stage. The noise tells you that they haven't just latched, but latched and locked. Listen with you eyes shut, if you don't believe me. It's that meticulous attention to detail both aural and visual that makes this movie a true work of art. There really is no need for the sounds to be there at all. But they are, and they convey complete fidelity to a scene that lasts just seconds. Here's another. When the marines are crossing the rain-swept depot to the airlock, its windy and wild. When they get inside, the ambiance completely changes. it's still noisy, the wind continues, faint but audible and there is lots of dripping water, but now there's also a strange, claustrophobic intimacy, and I'm quite at a loss as to how that has been accomplished. Yet the mood-change is hair-raisingly palpable. These set pieces are completely seamless throughout the movie. Strange, gloomy, suggestive, broken; the ghost of dead technology appears to haunt them as much as any alien demons. A thin, whining, electronic note does the work of tense music, it suits the circumstances perfectly, as well as providing a foil to any ambient sounds that the engineers and director thought appropriate.   The sound and sets earned it two well-deserved Oscars.Tension builds and builds again. It's a fairly well-worn formula of gradual attrition. Ripley's valliant rescue of the ambushed and trapped space-marines must have any viewer at the edge of their seat. And on it goes, tighter and tighter, until finally we are squeezing through air-ducts. Acting is pretty formulaic but entirely believable. People we've quickly grown to like get killed suddenly and nastily, smug Apone, and macho Drake. The alien queen brings the movie to a perfect climax. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was absolutely no CGI in this. Proof enough that it isn't actually needed, and is never as good as the real McCoy. And the script, by the way, is excellent.As a comment upon sexuality and survival it is a very telling one. The female is deadlier than the male. It draws from a simple Darwinian premise, that she makes a greater investment in the production of the young, and will therefore go to more determined and ruthless lengths to ensure their survival. She knows her genes are in the offspring: momma's baby, poppa's maybe. Males are simply expendable seed-carriers of convenience. I've docked a point for what strikes me as technological incongruity. The continued use of old-fashioned 'querty' keyboards for example, and CRT/VDU. The latter have all but gone to the scrap-heap now, never mind hundreds of years hence. Check-out the roll-up screens in 'Red Planet'; now that's more like it. Also, a sophisticated android like 'Bishop' surely suggests the probability of 'mechanised' marines. Or at least, a self-propelled remote for entering the alien hive. Bomb disposal squads already have those today. Bishop himself should have been able to simply plug-in and interface with the uplink. Or even communicate by WiFi. Though these things would compromise drama, their absence compromises its science-fiction credentials. And I am certainly no purist. But, golly-gosh! - nit-picking aside; this is an absolute crackerjack of entertainment.I believe it has only one other challenger for the crown of greatest sci-fi horror movie - Carpenter's 'The Thing'. You split 'em; I can't. It's 22 and 26 years since their creation, and no-one has managed to raise the bar. What does that tell you?",9,20,27,3 May 2008
Duck You Sucker," Hard To Define.
","Sergio Leone created some memorable movies. Mostly they're remembered for their irony, comedy and Clint Eastwood. 'A Fistful Of Dynamite' is probably his least well remembered, and that's a pity because although it may not be the masterpiece that some would claim, it is certainly an epic. It contains all of his flawed genius. There are the usual needlessly drawn-out episodes, the irrelevant digressions, and of course his trademark wretchedly dubbed voice-overs. But amongst these are the stupendous vistas of the barren 'west' (usually somewhere in Spain), the minutely choreographed operatic confrontations, and his other great asset; the soaring, beautiful music from Ennio Morricone. Much of the emotional impact of this movie is down to Morricone's lyrical interpretation of the moment. I believe that his interludes at least equal those of 'The Mission', a movie that is usually regarded as his master-work. And for the first time we have what I might call a serious character actor, in the person of Rod Steiger. A few years earlier he won an Oscar for his part as the bigoted racist policeman in 'Heat Of The Night'. Although never a handsome heroic figure in the mould of Eastwood or Coburn, Steiger could nevertheless act either of these men clear off the screen, and here brings to a role the sort of gravitas that was so lacking in other spaghetti westerns.Once again we see the histories of the protagonists reprised in occasional flashback. They fit pretty seamlessly into the story-line and pad out what in this case would be a rather two-dimensional character of Sean Mallory, represented by Coburn. The story is the old one of revolution and its betrayal. In response to a throwaway cynicism by Coburn, Steiger's Juan Miranda spits out a furious denunciation about poor people serving as cannon-fodder for contemptuous academics. It is entirely believable as well as true. And there is no shortage of betrayal in this movie. As a consequence of which, in one particularly tragic scene, Steiger's family are annihilated. His unspoken demonstration of grief and despair at their discovery is heartbreaking to watch. It is an object lesson in body language and facial expression that many a modern movie-star should take as example. And Morricone is right there on the money, with a lament to make you weep. I said that this movie was an epic. And any who doubt me should pay close attention to the scenes in which captured revolutionaries are being slaughtered at a railway siding. The camera pans across huge pits in which hundreds of extras are being executed by soldiers in a take that could have been lifted straight from 'Schindler's List', had that movie come first. Later, we see a great disorganised mob attempting to board a train. The chaos of disparate people, possessions and props, the animals, dust, steam and noise create a genuinely authentic appearance of society in meltdown. You could hardly believe that it was all manufactured. And once again I wonder if it wasn't an inspiration for Spielberg's take on Jewish 're-settlement' so many years later. If this were not a Sergio Leone western with all its cheap jokes and visual gags, but instead emphasised the issues of revolution, it would be an acclaimed work with a reputation to rival that of 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Lawrence Of Arabia'. But as it is, it must jog elbows with the trivial though similarly titled 'Fistful Of Dollars', whilst standing in the shadow of the much more popular 'Once Upon A Time In the West'. Such a placement does not do this movie justice at all. Because of the typical - and at times, rather crass - Leone gags and operatic drama, it is difficult to appreciate the monumental moments of conflict and the quiet interludes of personal reflection with which they often jar, making this work difficult to define as a piece. The director seems to stray beyond his commercial and popular mandate into the world of serious political commentary where his cheap humour has no place. He clearly demonstrates that he can indeed do both, but not perhaps in the same movie. One thing I'm pretty sure of; it will entertain you in ways that you wouldn't expect, and some scenes will stay in your memory for a very long time - as indeed will the music.",9,1,3,13 July 2008
The Usual Suspects," Beyond Superlatives.
","There's so much to praise about this movie and I find it's all been said.Right from the opening you just know its going to be good. That wistful gypsyesque theme music with its hint of eastern Europe, a perfect foil for lights playing upon the water and the origins of the story.And it just gets better and better. A group of characters in a line-up almost playing it for laughs. But all of them finely observed and sufficiently unique without being derivative.There's a plot with more twists and turns than a back-road in Kent. And the corners are just as blind.There's a mysterious master-figure who you don't want to know and really don't want to cross.There's drama, comedy, tension, wit, dialogue, script and more.It's directed with stealth. The plot moves quickly and slowly. It jumps a groove and flashes back. The viewer is playing catch-up right until the very end, with its utterly outrageous denouement.It's a serious movie, but its so well made it's actually fun to watch. And afterwards you sit for a few moments quietly mesmerised.It's certainly no moral movie. It couldn't be called an epic. But it's a masterpiece.If ever proof were needed that cinema is an art-form, here it is. There are plenty of directors out there who must agonise and blush to see how feebly their own efforts compare.Watch it and luxuriate in the craft. If you see no other movie in the world, see this one.And that's about it.",10,1,3,26 April 2008
Resident Evil," Pot-Pourri Horror.
","This movie tries to be a lot more clever than it is. The dream-like opening sequences are intended to endue it with a gravitas that is simply never realised. Likewise, the rather art-house flashback sequences in glorious black and white with a graveyard setting, all merely create confusion because their accomplishment is clumsy rather than deft. It would have been far simpler, better, and less confusing to have taken the straightforward approach with a solid, logical 'rescue' movie like 'Aliens' - which it very much resembles - and sort out the conspiracy later.Once we finally know what is going on, the story gets into its stride. Set pieces are excellent and the pacing and revelations likewise. There are lots of strange-sinister environments - again, like alien/aliens - that leave you guessing what might turn up.What actually turns up is every cliché known to horror movies. There are - Zombies! And they're - flesh-eaters! It has never been explained ever, since the 'Living Dead' franchise why zombies are so picky. They won't so much as nibble each other, but give them a living human and they fall upon it like wolves. Why? protein is protein, after all.There's also a chamber of horrors into which most of the commando team blunder only to get wiped-out - once again, like 'Aliens'. But there's also a hint of 'Cube' about it, because this really is a booby-trap, and people get diced in much the same way.There's a malevolent computer like Hal of '2001', which needs to be shut down before it kills everybody. There's a deadly virus (where would we be without a deadly virus?) that also turns people into zombie flesh-eaters. There's even a pack of zombie dogs, that appear to have lost all of their hair for some unexplained reason. It makes them look more ghastly - and that's probably the reason.On top of all this, there's a really shocking beastie with big claws and a very long tongue - 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1957) - popping-up there, by the looks of it. And there's a riotous train ride with the villain on board, not so far removed from 'The Wrong Trousers'.And, last but not least; the mission is time-sensitive. So we all know the clock is ticking...If they don't get their arses into gear, they suffer a permanent lock-in - rather like 'The Crystal Maze'.The cast are about as unmemorable a bunch of players as ever graced a B-movie. Apart from the blonde communist typing-error, Jovovich, none of them register a single point on the Richter-scale of acting ability. An Hispanic female (called Rodriguez, would you believe) suffers from some strange opthalmic condition whereby she is permanently looking upwards. It is not a very endearing characteristic. Whilst Ms Jovovich's high point was to fall through the roof of you-know-who's taxi in 'Fifth Element'. One suspects that she must have fallen onto numerous casting-couches first. Frankly, I have seen more human emotion expressed by a pair of buttocks than I have seen manifest in her face. That blank, pale, uncomprehending stare has now become a staple at the check-out queue of my local Tesco's. Usually it is accompanied by a black-haired, bull-necked, block-headed lump who's eyebrows meet above the nose. Pretty, they certainly ain't. Such is European integration. Ms Jovovich also engages in the sort of gravity-defying wall-walk that 'The Matrix' made fashionable.There's a clever little shock-ending that is very well accomplished; it leaves you in no doubt that things really have gone pear-shaped, and looks like the origins of all 'Living Dead' movies.Soundtracks and incidental music are drawn from a variety of heavy-metal and thrash-rock tracks with which I am unfamiliar, and don't really add much atmosphere to the movie as, perhaps, simple silence might.And that's about it. Don't expect too much. Don't ask any questions. Just sit down with your six-pack or whatever, and watch. It's a well-made B-movie. The six stars I've given it more reflect the quality of set pieces and special effects than anything else.",6,1,3,21 June 2008
Quantum of Solace," Quantum Of Humdrum Tedium.
","Daniel Craig is James Bond, shaky and un-stirring.In this effort, the franchise seems to have descended towards the lowest common denominator of crash-bang shoot-em-ups.It more-or-less began with a completely unbelievable car chase, filmed at such a tempo that would defy the best efforts of a computer-game geek. Things happened so fast that there was barely time to observe, let alone digest them. Images began smearing even on my humungous old Trinitron obelisk. There was hardly time to anticipate tension and consequence; very quickly it grew tedious, dis-involving and frankly repellent. I kept wanting 'story' but all I seemed to get was 'action'. And it was LOUD.So the movie went on. Short, humdrum interludes of 'exposition' became punctuated by explosive bursts of utterly preposterous and boring special-effects. Movie makers, nowadays, seem not to be testing the frontiers of CGI so much as the limit of viewer gullibility. I have to say that they've long since discovered and exceeded mine, and this piece is well into implausibility land. Quite honestly; 'The Wizard Of Oz' is more believable, even as a story.If you like this brave new world of CGM's (Computer Game Movies), then you'll likely give this a high score. Maybe you'll even win a replay. But if you were brought up on STORY and CHARACTER, then - like me - you'll begin to lose interest shortly after the credits have rolled. It was the suave and sophisticated elements that raised Bond above the other macho types. Here, he's just another homicidal thug.Can't Recommend A Purchase.",4,5,7,27 March 2011
Independence Day," Racial Supremacist Propaganda With Special Effects.
","Roland Emmerich certainly loaded this movie with astonishing special effects, and set something of a demolition standard. The infernos released by the alien vessels upon various landmark buildings are really quite stupendous. But - oh-dear - what a wretched, predictable (and arrogant) piece of ham it is in just about every other department. I lost count of the number of gaping stares the camera lingered upon. I likewise lost count of the number of clichÃ©d comments in a script that was surely written by a committee composed of those adolescents who wear their baseball caps back-to-front, call each other 'dude', and conveniently possess IQ's that can be measured on a clinical thermometer. It was clearly intended as a 'God Bless America' movie, as implied by the title, and though I've no problem with yanks slapping themselves on the back from time to time, this was just a little too blatant for good taste. I'm going to risk accusations of anti-semitism here and suggest that the subtext for this work was 'American Jews save the world for an ungrateful humanity'. We have a Jewish scientist (played by Jewish Goldblum). He and he alone solves the riddle of alien invasion methodology. He and his arrogant Jewish father manage to secure seats on Airforce One, where this father goes about reminding everyone how his son has saved them all. Later, Goldblum is sent to the alien mothership where he manages to foul-up their computers with a virus. After that it's gung-ho all the way. Brains can be safely left behind.There is one particularly offensive scene in which the father is attempting to induct a group of people into a Jewish ceremony. One person declines, remarking 'actually I'm not Jewish' to which this Zionist bigot responds 'Well, nobody's perfect.' It's supposed to be funny. And to those building illegal settlements in Palestine; it probably is. Yet I cannot imagine any other religion in which such a comment would have been allowed to pass unchecked. Certainly if the refusenik had been Jewish and had received a similar discourtesy, the movie would never have gained release. It's Jewish backers in Hollwood would have made damn sure of that (not that its Jewish Producers and Directors would have included it in the first place). Whereas if this slighted individual he'd been Muslim, There would likely have been demonstrations and death threats. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants however can have their feelings abused with impunity. The other people to feature favourably are both of Afro-Caribbean race. Will Smith plays a preposterously gung-ho fighter pilot, stuffing it to the aliens, whilst his wife engages in civilian heroics on the ground. Together, they form a kind of ethnic apologia. They may be black, but they're still useful.The US president is unfortunately still Christian (well; no nation's perfect), and interestingly he experiences a telepathic event with a captured alien, in which he describes them as a plague of locusts that go about the universe, using up resources wherever they can be found. That selfishness alone apparently justifies their extermination, though his insight might just as easily be a description of humankind. As HG Wells once asked in his War Of The Worlds with reference to our treatment of other terrestrial species: 'Are we such paragons of mercy...?'Throughout the movie, these aliens are depicted as ugly, violent, smelly, and ruthless - almost as bad as Christians. No emphasis is given to their considerable scientific and technological superiority, or the fact that they appear to function as a harmonious people. They're messing with God's children on God's own Earth, and that makes them pariahs. No prizes for guessing who sees themselves as the new master race.This is not a movie for people with brains, let alone morals or conscience. It's a shoot-'em-up of the most banal and tasteless nature. It appeals to the worst instincts and bigotries of the narrow-minded whilst masquerading as a nationalist set-piece. Frankly; in every other faculty than that of special-effects - it stinks.",3,4,8,5 July 2008
The Dirty Dozen," Formulaic
","Although it was considered to be a pretty ground-breaking movie in its time, today it comes across as over-long, predictable, and formulaic.The story premises that a bunch of criminals can be trained to commit slaughter behind enemy lines. Quite why such a dangerously rebellious team would be considered more fit for a stealthy mission than specialised outfits is never made clear. And really; the disbelief begins there.Once selected, they are trained in various techniques. About three-quarters of the movie (I never actually timed it) is dedicated to this whipping-them-into-a-team business. It's far too long and discursive. We don't actually see much of the training, just vignettes. There's also a lengthy war-games episode where they get to prove their worth.Along the way there are plenty of little gags with humorous twists of military music lending it the flavour almost of a comedy drama. 'Kelly's Heroes' comes to mind.The cast contains some of Hollywood's top drawer. Lee Marvin, Ernie Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Robert Ryan, Telly Savalas and many more give decent turns for their money. The script isn't too bad either. Otherwise the mission is just another standard juvenile shoot-em-up. The Nazis are - as usual - arrogant and stupid (you wonder how they managed to conquer Europe). The 'Dirty Dozen' get winnowed down to one. Curiously, one of the stockade MP guards also goes on the mission. Did he volunteer? For a fantasy war-time actioner, it doesn't get close to 'The Guns Of Navarone', 'Where Eagles Dare', or the already mentioned 'Kelly's Heroes'. It's got more in common with 'The Wild Bunch'. As to the mission itself: Herding a large group of German Army Officers along with their wives & girlfriends into a cellar and incinerating them alive with gasoline would surely amount to a war-crime by any reasonable evaluation. It's outrageous, scarcely any different from what the Nazis did to the Jews. Sadly, it also typifies the inveterate sense of western moral superiority that has dogged its international relations for so many decades. We are in the right so we can do as we like.If you haven't yet seen this movie then it's well worth a look. But far more tense or humorous, intelligent and believable wartime actioners both fantasy or otherwise are out there, not least the three just mentioned.",6,2,4,13 November 2010
Gone with the Wind," Definitely not my scene
","There is no doubt in my mind that this is an excellent movie. I cannot fault the acting, directing, set-pieces, wardrobe, photography, whatever.The trouble is - I detest it. Which probably means I detest the story; though I have not actually read the book.I first saw it as a child. Hauled off to the cinema by young parents who I suspect couldn't afford a baby-sitter. It's not a movie for kids. It's epic length cannot sustain juvenile interest. I dozed and woke as kids do. But I particularly remember waking to see its heroine mercilessly beating a pony she had driven to exhaustion, until it collapsed and died in harness. I was, as we say, gobsmacked. It was the first time I had seen female brutality depicted anywhere. This single scene coloured my entire interpretation of the movie. It was many, many years before I would sit and watch it again.Even though I have learnt to appreciate the sumptuousness of its cinematic qualities, I remain as bitterly entrenched today about its leading character as I was so long ago.I just cannot understand how such an utterly unworthy individual as Scarlett O'Hara can be cast in the guise of a heroine. She is the most feckless, ruthless, spineless, selfish, vain, manipulative, scheming pariah imaginable. She possesses not one redeeming particle of virtue. She will do anything to anyone in order to have her own way. To see her strutting petulantly about in a street littered with thousands of dead and dying soldiers still has me reaching for something to pelt at the screen.Feminists have represented her as some kind of ideal: a strong woman succeeding in a man's world. Well, if these are the qualities they admire - heaven help any world. Scarlett O'Hara is Uriah Heep with 'umbleness supplanted by arrogance.A male cast in a similar light would receive a very grisly and appropriate come-uppance indeed. And for me that is where the movie (and presumably the book) fails. It is the most amoral thing I have ever seen. Even at the end, when the comparatively decent Rhett Butler finally begins to realise the true extent of her malignancy and 'frankly doesn't give a damn' any more, she remains quite unabashed. 'Tomorrow is another day': she'll go on being as base and self-centred as ever.The moral of the story seems to be this: if you really are rotten enough, you can survive just about anything. To create a masterpiece and place a rodent at its centre is either irrational or surreal.",8,1,2,1 April 2006
Legends of the Fall," The Dregs Of The Day
","Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and 'American') so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'.But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face.And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe.But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up.The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.",3,4,9,22 February 2012
No Country for Old Men," Interesting
","Although based upon an original novel, I was surprised at the plot similarities of this Coen brothers work to their earlier 'Fargo'.Both featured a nest-egg of money. Both featured a sullenly psychotic baddie. Both featured a hick law-enforcement officer out of depth with the viciousness of modern crime. And both featured small-town America and the human struggle against wilderness. In 'Fargo', winter snows set the backdrop; in this movie, it is the sweltering desert.Another movie to draw an emphatic de-ja-vu is 'A Perfect Plan'. In that work, three friends stumble upon a case full of crime money in a small crashed plane. All on board are dead. It's winter, and Fargo-like snow blankets the world. But soon there's a ruthless criminal enforcer on the case.In 'No Country For Old Men', a trailer-trash hick stumbles upon a desert drug-deal gone bad. Once again; everyone's dead. There's a pick-up loaded with dope and a case with $2million just ripe for picking. Actually there's one survivor, and this basically good-natured hick has a nocturnal crisis of conscience and goes back to help him. By then, others are on the case, and he is discovered and a marked man thereafter.One of those in the hunt is a 'Terminator' type assassin. Unstoppable, almost indestructible, he has absolutely no mercy. And he has a very curious (and improbable) weapon. We've seen his kind a dozen times. Think of 'Collateral', think of 'Assassins', 'Death Wish', and many more.Despite all of the familiar and formulaic stuff, the movie still makes very compelling entertainment. It is filmed in a washed-out print style reminiscent of French film-noir. The pacing is often very slow with sometimes meticulous attention to small, seemingly insignificant detail. But that only compounds the interest as it leaves the viewer constantly second-guessing their relevance to the plot, causing surprises and unexpected twists.The titular 'old men' are of the Sheriff's generation. He is convincingly played by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones provides both a voice-over narrative and also plot-infil as his experience and deduction cement any stray plot threads together and offer some topical commentary. As a presence in the movie, he is more of a cameo than a star. And perhaps in this regard the movie should be viewed as an entity in itself - as indeed all movies should be; it's just not usually possible to do this with over-paid and over-hyped stars invariably hijacking them as a vehicle for their own egos.The Coen brothers have seen to it that this hasn't happened. This movie is a complete work. It is fascinating from start to finish, with lots of interesting camera work, location choices, shocking drama, a good script and solid performances from the players.It takes great skill to produce work like this. I am not surprised that it won 4 academy awards. The Coens have produced one or two bummers, but when they do it right, they do it very well indeed.Highly Recommended. (Currently £3 at Tesco's).",8,3,5,21 October 2010
Batman Begins," Batman Bores
","I caught this offering on a freeview channel. And at first I began to wonder if the listings had got screwed-up. Where was Batman? For a seemingly indefinite time, somebody - I suppose it was Bruce Wayne - was faffing about in what I think were the Himalayas. They were mountains anyway. There was a bald-headed monk with a self-satisfied gaze like a hang-over from Quai Chang Kane's adventures, and Wayne getting the crap kicked out of him frequently. Here, I gather, was supposed to be the 'why he became Batman' expose, but the whole boring and verbose pantomime went on for so long that this little grasshopper dozed-off before he could grasp the pebble.I've awarded 3 ex-gratia stars for whatever I missed because so many people rave about this movie. But judged by the 20 minutes or so of what I did watch I'd offer no stars at all as it couldn't even sustain my attention enough to keep conscious.I would suggest aspiring viewers fast-forward to about halfway through. Presumably it livens-up a bit.",3,4,6,22 April 2012
Zulu," Unbeatable.
","I don't hand out 'tens' very often, but few will question my choice here.From the tremendously visceral theme music to the wonderful African back-drop; this work has it all.It is the siege of Rorke's Drift. With a cast that still seems to embody the entire Zulu nation, and many of Britain's acting cream, we see this famous battle come to life in a way that could never be beaten even today. Special effects and CGI are no substitute for the real thing.There's the quiet beginning with a bridge to be built. A sly little comedy of manners about army protocol is played out between Stanley Baker's Lt John Chard and Micheal Caine's Lt Gonville Bromhead. Then the bad news arrives. From that point on there is a simple choice: cut and run, or make a stand.The sense of impending doom is built-up to a point that is almost tangible. People are seen to be fleeing the dreaded though as yet unseen Zulu hordes as, to the disbelief of his fellow officer and most of the enlisted men, Stanley baker's Chard quietly sets about turning their group of mud-huts into a defensive garrison. It looks like military suicide.In due course, a curious noise is heard like the approach of a distant train. It is the beating of thousands of clubs and spears against hide shields.There are so many excellent acting turns in this movie that it would be pointless to list them all - at least as many as there were Victoria Crosses won. The battles are epic in scale at times, whilst being ferocious, bloody and intimate in hand-to-hand detail. No quarter is given by either side. The conflict and its drama is absolutely believable. It's bloody, ruthless and glorious. Yet at the same time, there is no excess, no gushing arteries or decapitated heads.The story is told; frankly, for the most part honestly, with very little racial bias or imperialist gung-ho.The colours and still wonderful. The camera work and editing absolutely first-rate. The pacing, tempo and duration just about perfect.I have seen this movie many times and it is scarcely less gripping and engaging than the first sight. If there's any attempt at a re-make - perhaps in a more modern politically-correct context; it will surely fail.This is a unique stand-alone war epic. I love it. I can find no fault. It gets the 10 stars it deserves.",10,1,3,14 July 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Welcome To Hell
","I have never understood Hollywood's love affair with Tom Hanks. He's no more than ordinary both in appearance and as an actor. Perhaps that's what they like; the stamp of the common man. Well for me, he's a turn-off. Him, Costner and Cage; I can't help taking points away when any of 'em show up.All that said; this movie opens pretty quickly into the most spellbindingly visceral battle sequence ever shown on film. It really is a tour-de-force. The withering German machine-gun fire wiping out man after man before they've even set foot ashore is terrible and shocking to behold. Truly those weapons made flesh all but obsolete in battle. I am not a Spielberg fan either. His delight in maudlin sentimentality - or 'schamltz' as it's called - knows no boundaries. Neither does his childish irony. But when it comes to large set-piece special effects, he has no master. The few minutes of beach landing are alone worth the price of the DVD. It's as close as you can get to the real thing and still leave the cinema alive. I'm told that a group of vets got to see this movie at a private showing and gave this sequence a standing ovation. You can't say fairer than that.Afterwards, the story moves on, with Hanks and his remaining squad looking to find Private Ryan, who is the only surviving son in a family stricken by war. And here Mr Spielberg falls into his usual routine of hokey irony. There's a suddenly collapsing wall that reveals Germans on the other side. There's a German humanely allowed by Hanks to simply wander free, only to re-emerge as his assassin, there's a case of mistaken identity that's milked for every silly little nuance imaginable. And there's a lot more. Like I said; it's often childish.There are other interesting and engaging conflicts, though they pale in comparison with that full-on intro. There are excellent set-pieces, authentic gunfire, and believable slaughter. Editing, lighting and all of the other technical issues are right up to the standard you expect from Big Stevie. Yet most of the second 2 hours fail to answer that hellishly vivid beach landing. It's a measure of how strong the one is, and how weak the other. We are left with a slow, flagging, and largely forgettable odyssey.Highly recommended for that opening assault. That's where my 9 stars have gone. The rest is simply in at the price, with Spielberg's juvenility and Hanks's irritating voice for good measure.I would like to see a movie about WW1 treated with the same ruthless candour. The casualties of Omaha and The Somme scarcely withstand comparison.",9,1,3,27 May 2009
28 Days Later...," Highly Overrated.
","It began with a very interesting premise of a young man waking-up all by himself in a chaotic hospital. I dunno how long he'd been out, or how he alone got overlooked, and why he hadn't died of dehydration, the disease, or whatever, but it left a number of big question-marks to juggle with. This intro was pioneered by John Wyndam in his 'Day Of The Triffids', so it was nothing new.The scenes of a deserted capital were extremely dramatic and well done - better even than the 'Triffids' movie. But this dimwit aimlessly wandering about in his hospital pyjamas with a vacant stare, left me wondering who were the real zombies. Getting your kit on before going outdoors would surely have been foremost in his mind. Then again; he was a cycle courier so perhaps we shouldn't expect too much. Even so; his total lack of interaction quickly became a bore. And it was highly unlikely that he could have walked right across central London in his condition. He'd have been pooped within a few hundred yards.And I'm afraid it quickly went downhill after that. Movies about extremely ordinary people may be realistic but they can also be very, very dull. This item slouched about on the edge of a soap-opera canyon.From time to time things livened-up when the 'zombie-flesh-eater' type things kept pouncing, but really - how many living dead movies do we actually need? It's old hat, for Gawd's sake.And that was about it. The story dwindled away as each unprepossessing goody died-off. Even after I thought it had ended; the movie, like the dead, coughed back into life again. When, in truth, the last rites had been said within 30 minutes of the intro.Britain just doesn't do this kind of stuff very well any more. Even with the considerable budget that this work must have enjoyed, you can find far superior efforts funded by comparatively tiny budgets from years gone by. Just think of the 'Quatermass' movies of the 1950's or how about 'Village Of The Damned'? This came over too much like 'Flood': a well packaged empty container.The first half-hour is well worth a look, but don't get too comfortable.",5,1,3,24 February 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Beyond Superlatives
","If ever a movie earned the definition 'epic', then 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is it. In an age when sumptuous set-pieces can be effortlessly conjured-up by computer programmers, this truly authentic feast of cinematic vision still possesses the power to blow your mind. This is the real thing. The wide-sweeping vistas of desert wilderness are not special-effects; they are REAL. And they look real. Long views, sweeping pans and takes sustained over minutes are realised with a clarity, colour and vividness that absolutely melt your heart. That imagery is a more believable conduit to this complex man's evolving obsession with Arabia than the narrative itself.Every scene is a breathtaking study in light and colour, character and dialogue. Every second is worth seeing and every word worth hearing. And its theme music is as iconic as the man himself.The inimitable Peter O'Toole with his blonde hair, steely-blue eyes, haunting expressions and mood swings, commands your attention in every take. His Lawrence is a man swallowed up by a personal sense of destiny, striding between his cynical and prosaic taskmasters and a doomed belief in what might be achieved with superhuman effort. Omar Sharif never played a better role as foil to his capricious hero. Unusually, there are no leading ladies. And they're certainly not needed. A love interest would have cheapened the entire presentation. Here is a story about the romance of time and place. As that other great Arabian traveller and admirer of the ideal - Wilfred Thessiger - once remarked; 'women spoil everything'.This is a long movie. Those with short attention-spans raised upon sausage-machine editing are doomed to find it dull, tedious, boring, slow and all of the other criticisms that fall from the lips of a generation accustomed to x-box action sequencing. But if you are blessed with a longer vintage, then Lean's masterpiece will swallow you up as surely as the desert itself.",10,1,2,9 April 2012
Schindler's List," Jewish Propaganda.
","Oh-dear; I'm afraid I must inevitably ruffle some self-righteous feathers here.Before the Juggernaut rolls, let me just say that I am not a holocaust denialist. Quite the contrary; I have several books relating to the subject including Martin Gilbert's acclaimed, definitive and enormous work, which I have read right through, and thoroughly accept as fact.What is shown in this movie is almost certainly as meticulously researched, if for no other reason than that some - like me, perhaps - would shout out 'hey; that ain't true', and make a big fuss about zionist dishonesty etc, etc, if misrepresentations came to light. In any case, there are still enough survivors with suitably vivid memories and whose witness testimony is readily available. One suspects that they, of all people, would most object to any omissions or inaccuracies, depicted in this movie.So we can take as a kosher work.But somehow this just didn't cut it for me. I didn't find the principal characters believable. I didn't understand Schindler at all. His reformation from grasping capitalist to saintly cost-no-object saviour was never adequately explained. Perhaps the man himself was too much of an enigma to be understood by others. Whatever the case, I couldn't identify with him. There were times when his suave slightly-reckless, man-of-action persona bore an uncanny resemblance to Indiana Jones, and I began to wonder if Mr Spielberg was having slight de-ja-vue associations with his most famous creation.Neither could I begin to understand the motivation of Ranulph Feinnes' character. He was evidently a lunatic from my standpoint, but attempts to portray his personality left more questions than answers.The scenes of brutality were, if anything, rather less harrowing than some of the descriptions I have read. Though they were frightful to behold even so.And I thought the lighting itself - especially at night - was well worthy of the Oscar that it gained.It's not clear to me why a child was singled-out for colour treatment in what was a specifically black and white production. Did the director think his audience was too dumb to recognise her, despite the constant camera-tracking? This struck me as particularly crass.It was a long movie, and perhaps deservedly so. But the specialised nature of its subject makes it one for students of the holocaust rather than mainstream movie fans.I've described this movie as Jewish propaganda and that deserves explanation. Propaganda is not necessarily lies, but sometimes the truth can be told in different ways. Selective bias, if you like. In this case, we have a movie that was directed by a Jew, financed by Jews, using Jewish facilities (Hollywood), and starring Jews. And, moreover, it depicts Jews as victims and never victimisers - Which is probably how they envisage themselves as a people. And with the best will in the world, I cannot see how that can be anything BUT propaganda.When the day comes that I see Mr Spielberg make a movie about the sufferings of a people of that ghetto we may not mention - called the Gaza Strip - a people who are crowded together just as the Warsaw Jews were, who are brutalised by their Fascist task-masters in Tel-Aviv; who are starved, beaten, bulldozed, bombed, summarily arrested, tortured and murdered, denied electricity even for essential services, and whose land is stolen by a master-race that claims a higher title to it - well, then l'll begin to believe in the unbiased nature of Hollywood. And the devil will be wearing thermal underwear.By the way, there are no prizes for guessing why and how it won so many Oscars.",7,5,13,1 June 2008
The Mist," Top-Drawer Horror
","I first read Stephen King's 'The Mist' many years ago and found it absolutely riveting. It was one of those stories that - despite being preposterous - completely drew me in. For days, even weeks, afterwards I would chew-over the characters and their plight, and think what I might have done in the same place. That's a sure sign of a writer who knows his craft. Wyndam's little-known 'The Kraken Wakes' had a similar effect.Frank Darabont has worked with King before, bringing his 'Green Mile' and 'Shawshank Redemption' shorts to the screen. I have read neither of these stories, and though I found the former rather maudlin as a movie, 'Shawshank' was certainly a triumph. Neither did well at the box-office, but they were DVD smash-hits. Such is the power of spoken word.Darabont's 'The Mist' sticks very closely to King's story. There is very little preamble. In fact, it's just a little too sketchy for my tastes and would have benefited from a few more seconds' emphasis. We are 'in it' very quickly indeed. The body of the story is a very clever weave of the enemy within and without. Where, ultimately, are the real monsters? In the mist or in our minds? There are very definitely monsters in the mist. They're bizarre, original, and quite terrifying. Although no more substantial than CGI, each species is well-realised, you seldom see the joins, and the actors interface with them extremely convincingly. They're better than the demons of 'Pitch Black'; and those are pretty good. Inevitably, these monsters do unpleasant things to people. I won't dilate upon that.But the other monsters are human. And they always create the worst horror in truth. After all; how many 'Saws' would it take to equal Auschwitz? A disparate group of people are holed-up in a supermarket. And as the mist monsters prowl outside, the subconscious monsters begin to hatch in the store. People start cracking-up. Soon there are two tribes: religious zealots endorsing old-tyme religion, and a shrinking body of 'rationalists' trying to make sense of the incomprehensible. Anyone who thinks that such a scenario couldn't happen, and happen just as quickly, clearly doesn't watch the news. Darabont wisely omits a back-room seduction that King included in his original story. It was cheap and quite inappropriate. Although this movie inevitably entails a mixed-sex cast; it is, in truth, a survival story, and that is where the focus is maintained. As I say; the movie follows King's plot with unusual fidelity. A small group makes an escape, preferring at last to risk the terrors without than abide the company of those within. And here Darabont makes a second diversion. Whereas Stephen King leaves his characters in an uncertain limbo; Darbont gives us an unequivocal solution. And - being human - it is surely the most horrific end of all.   I am very much reminded of 'The Thing' by this movie, and not because the lead character has a publicity poster of Carpenter's masterpiece on his study wall (which I suspect to be a sneaky homage by Darabont). Both movies are about terror, paranoia, and claustrophobia, and how they work upon our subconscious even more than the monsters themselves. Ultimately we fight our fear, rather than its cause. This movie goes way beyond all of the slasher-crap I have seen and - mostly - snoozed through these last few years. Yes; there's blood and guts a-plenty for those who want them. And those who want monsters won't be short-changed either. But for the thinking viewer, there's also a great deal more. It isn't perfect, by any means. The characterisation is a little too sketchy. I wasn't induced to care for them as much as I should have. The actors are B/C-list but still capable for all that. It's not their fault that they sometimes don't convince. The script isn't particularly clever either, even allowing for the fact that the characters are mostly red-necks. And the editing lends a slightly fragmented appearance here and there. But it still has a great deal to commend it. The mist ambiance is wonderfully realised. And the brittleness of relationships and low limits to mortal courage and endeavour bring a jarring reality-check to the modern genre of mutli-skilled super-heroes. There isn't a particle of humour in this movie, cavalier, ironic or otherwise. Which is, in fact, a mistake, because we evolved humour to deal with stress, and some characters would certainly have employed it under the circumstances.This work is not as good as 'Aliens' or Carpenter's 'The Thing' but it's certainly up there in the same league. I believe it is the best horror movie I have seen since they two set the gold-standard some 30 years ago.",9,1,3,21 February 2009
I Am Legend," More Zombies Anyone?
","'I Am Legend' is 'The Omega Man' updated. And it's daft.The complete recreation of a deserted and dilapidated New York is very nicely realised. It's on an even grander scale than 'After Humans'. I enjoyed seeing the grasses and weeds shoving through the roads and pavements and putting up two herbaceous fingers at human arrogance. It's just as John Wyndam described London in 'The Triffids'.There's been a plague. Thanks to the efforts of a well-intentioned, but unfortunately-named Dr Krippen, a cure became the opposite. We are told that 90% of humanity died, 9% turned 'zombie flesh-eater' and 1% were immune. Most of the latter got eaten by the zombies. It's a hard life. Will Smith plays New York's sole survivor. And he's a doctor with special knowledge of disease and immunity - which is handy. He also seems to be an expert on electronics and explosives too. Hmm. His wife and child got killed in a helicopter accident during evac, leaving him with his Alsatian puppy which has since grown up. So here he is, working on his own, trying to find a cure, and gradually going screwy.Like all of our ancient terrors; the zombies only come out at night, so he's more or less free to roam in the daytime. He forages for food, traps the odd zombie for experiments, hunts wild game and collects CD's.The disease is apparently both an airborne and contact contagion. Legend himself has complete immunity. His dog, meanwhile, only has immunity from the airborne form. How there can be any difference between the two when the disease symptoms themselves are identical is unclear, and merely serves to demonstrate a lack of pathogenic research on the part of film-makers. Like so many of them nowadays; they assume audiences to be just uneducated clots who can be bought-off with wham-bam-also-ran special-effects. Not only that; if the disease can infect dogs, why hasn't it infected the herds of wild game? Or the lions, for that matter. Surely they must contain the vital element of immunity then (yet our hero concentrates upon rats and zombies). Moreover; why haven't the zombies tracked all the animals down at night and eaten them?Furthermore; the zombies are running a temperature, heart-rate etc on par with an athlete, and they're wearing almost no clothes (they wear enough to satisfy the censors!). To be in such work-out condition for an hour would be strenuous enough, but to sustain it 24/7 would require a huge calorific intake. 5,000+ per day. From where is this energy being drawn? They'd have to eat pure lard, or be burned-out within 48hrs.I don't mean to nit-pick, but if a movie is going to have quasi scientific/medical pretensions like this one, it's no good vacillating between plausibility and absurdity just to appease a plot that doesn't stand to reason. Either be a sci-fi movie or a horror fantasy; don't try to rationalise one into the other. That creates a fairy tale.Which brings me to the culminating question. Why is Legend trying to develop a vaccine at all? The few remaining normal people left alive like him already have natural immunity. The zombies are so violent that even if they can't infect you they'll rip you to shreds, so you'll likely get slaughtered trying to use it on any of them. The logical thing is to just clear out and let nature take its course.If you're someone who doesn't stop to think: If you just sit there and take the whole thing as it unfolds without evaluation or question - in other words, answer to the prescription of its makers - then there is some decent tension, excellent set-pieces and lots of second-rate CGI to enjoy, and Will Smith gives a very decent turn for his paycheque. But that's it. It's not a thinking person's experience. The ending is perhaps daftest of all. Partway through the movie, during a crisis, he is rescued by a pretty heroine who turns up with a young boy. Both have immunity too. So, at last he no longer has to talk to himself or tailors' dummies. And he's no longer alone (by now the dog's dead). This girl insists that there's an upstate enclave of survivors. Which is something Legend dismisses as complete twaddle. Yet in the last moments, when he has finally isolated a vaccine and the ZF-E's have invaded his stronghold, he gives the vaccine to her and the boy and ushers them into an escape tunnel. So where does he imagine they are going, if he doesn't believe the enclave exists? And what does he suppose she will do with his vaccine? Meanwhile, instead of going with her, he shuts off the 'escape route' and blows himself up with the zombies. He could just as easily have pulled the pin, chucked the grenade, and escaped with the girl as well. Daft.If you think this movie is in any way exceptional, then you should check-out Jodie Foster's 'Flightplan'.",5,1,1,29 December 2010
The Longest Day," Needs A Remake
","I saw this movie at the cinema when I was a kid, and on the big screen is seemed to just blow everyone away. We got to see the war from what at least looked like every angle, with a cast that included just about everybody who was anybody. It was long, sumptuous, involved and sometimes confusing. But it was also epic and definitive. Or so things seemed back then.But I got the DVD cheap last week, not having seen it for a while, and gave it a watch. Now; I have to admit that I've joined the nay-sayers. I've awarded it 7 stars because it does still provide a decent run for your money, and one should take the movie's vintage into account. However; it no longer appears to be the epic I once thought.Today, editing comes over as rather fragmented. A lot of little vignettes of ordinary servicemen don't really move the story along. I'm thinking of the guy who makes a fortune at dice and then believes his winnings might betoken bad luck. We know such things may happen, yet its detailed inclusion was irrelevant especially at the expense of true events. There's a guy telling a boring personal tale to someone he has never met, or there are the needlessly vociferous arguments with the Luftwaffe pilots, and so on. Pluskat's dog had the good sense to scram before the shooting started (in times of war follow your pet's instincts!). The big issues needed to be addressed before we spent time with all this minutiae. Yet the cut and cut again from one senior military figure to another presumed an almost encyclopedic knowledge on the part of the viewer. Often these people were seen just once or twice, and again it contributed to a fragmentary appearance.It's obvious that a lot of money, thought and effort went into this movie's making, but watching it today, some production values have an almost made-for-TV appearance. That may be a measure of how production values as a whole have risen over the years. The thunder-flash grenades and fire-cracker ordnance explosions especially on the beach just don't measure up nowadays. 'Saving Private Ryan' has raised the bar too high. We also saw no sign of the 'funnies' - ingeniously adapted tanks - that were such a boon to the British assault, but which were scorned by the American high-command with dreadful consequences. The amazing 'Mulberry Docks' also deserved at least a look-in, even though they didn't actually arrive in France on the first day. They were an essential part of the preparation. Some mention was also deserving of the elaborate effort to conceal the military build-up. All of this was part of the British effort, and shamefully omitted. I think a remake, employing far greater use of special effects with good-quality CGI, and a much more coherent (and honest) overview is called for. The first half at least should be dedicated to the tremendous preparations - rather like 'The Dam Busters'. Though whether or not such a stellar cast could ever again be assembled to play the leads seems highly unlikely. Worse still, an update will be made by a Hollywood that is even more Anglophobic than that of the 1960's and would probably be shown from an exclusively American stand-point. It could even include a scene in which Yanks present us with the 'Enigma' machine which they captured for us in 'U571'. Ahem.I still regard 'Dunkirk' as the superior movie. And not because that was an all-British (or perhaps Anglo-French) success/debacle.",7,0,2,20 June 2009
Meet Joe Black," Brad's Pits
","Now is the time to say goodbye - Goodbye. Now is the time to yeeeiild a sigh. Ah, Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore knew how to say 'goodbye'. Keep it short and sweet. I think it was the Bard who said that parting was such sweet sorrow. Unfortunately, he forgot to mention that it could be the longest, most tedious and lachrymose experience in the universe. Three hours. Three wretched hours. Here is a movie paradox. It tells you that life is precious. But it takes so long about it that there's a very real chance of viewers dying before the lead character. This is a movie that invites audience participation. Some directors are apt to over-indulge in human emotion and excessive sentimentality. Hollywood refers to this as 'schmaltz'. Here, it is as if human emotion had engorged to the size of a cosmic udder, and is being so vigorously milked that the bucket over-floweth and humanity risks drowning in sentiment. An old bloke who is a millionaire and who has had a good life is going to die. That's sad? lucky him. he should try being homeless or living in a sink estate on social security. Those people die too, and usually a lot younger. Death turns up in the form of a youthful naiveté with a peanut-butter fetish and a crush on the dying man's daughter. He doesn't understand life, but he apparently understands the tax system. He can hijack and re-animate a corpse, but he can't stop the main character dying. Did somebody actually write this script? Did somebody sit down and say 'I've got a good idea'? Or perhaps Hollywood has begun sub-contracting work to mental institutions. This is beautifully filmed, with pleasantly scored music, and contains two fine leading actors. I give it a star on each count. It is also 3 times as long as it should be and is so farcical and preposterous in concept; it ought to have been a comedy (which, in a way, it actually is). Wallace and Gromit could have done the whole damn thing in half an hour for a fraction of the budget and still found time to catch a penguin in a milk-bottle.   Death, where is thy sting? Meet Joe Black.",3,2,3,9 February 2008
Patton," It Deserved Every Oscar It Got
","Here is George C Scott in the role he was surely born to play. He fits the part as well as Paul Schofield fits Thomas Moore in 'A Man For All Seasons'.Scott's presentation of an ambitious, single-minded, overbearing man brimming with self-belief is wonderfully realised. You cannot imagine that he is anything but the general he pretends to be. At times likable and loathsome, we nevertheless care about him and his sometimes strange contradictions.. If not for his unpromising face and gravel-crusher voice GCS would surely have been one of the leading hero/ladies-men of his day. Yet despite the punished-looking expression, and the Dalek-with-a-sore-throat delivery, every feature and vocal tone manages to carry some subtle nuance of emotion and thought. Scott is a real actor, from a time when acting carried more weight than good looks. Ernest Borgnine cut a similar figure.This is a movie about a general. War takes second place. We get to know the kind of man responsible for the lives of thousands. We learn about his own personal and political wars, his likes and dislikes, and those who like and dislike him. There's a lot more of the latter. He shows us that heroes can sometimes be insufferable. They are often driven men who drive others just as hard and this excites resentment. Worse still it excites ingratitude. For however much we may despise them, they are needful to the hour. Without them we would be lost.There is war, and the action is perfectly adequate for the movie's vintage. But the real war is Patton's own. His victory is the victory of personal ambition.Other actors pale into insignificance. And maybe this was intended by the director. The only other instantly recognisable face is Karl Malden's, which is scarcely more ornamental. The budget is big and deservedly so. location-work is expansive, filming, lighting and editing all hit their targets.War-mongers like Patton may be discountenanced now in this politically-correct age of left-wing liberalism. But when the enemy begins banging at the gates - who ya gonna call? Very highly recommended.",9,16,19,7 February 2009
Kelly's Heroes," Heroic Movie
","A great cast of popular stars, are perfectly chosen for their ability to play it tongue-in-cheek. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland in particular have demonstrated their ability to pitch anything from straight, comic and crazy in other movies.It's a heist behind enemy lines. There's millions of dollars in gold just waiting for some military enterprise. Clint Eastwood plays a straightlaced GI who decides to turn soldier-of-fortune when he discovers this stash of bullion is inadequately guarded just 30 miles beyond their advance. The post D-day German defences are crumbling, and in the confusion he and his team might just pull-off the perfect crime.Right from the outset, this is a great action movie. Clint and Telly's outfit find themselves caught-up in fierce combat. There's tremendous pyrotechnics here and what look like real Tiger tanks, not disguised American hardware. It's tense, vigorous and exciting stuff, but with a thread of ironic comedy all the way. Each of the principal characters is simply, but clearly stamped. They're flawed, likable and we care about them - as we should. Using a couple of 'specimen' gold bars, Eastwood's character co-opts and bribes whatever and whoever he needs to succeed in the caper, inadvertently shortening WW2 in the process.Throughout the movie there is some of the most splendid wartime action drama in any work of its vintage. Yes; the Germans are slaughtered wholesale as usual - but who cares? There is also one of the most entertaining close-quarter tank encounters of just about any movie - including the epic 'Battle Of The Bulge'. Sutherland's solitary Sherman goes up against 3 Tigers in the confined streets of a French village, employing its manoeuvrability and surprise.That last conflict is extremely well realised. A surprisingly generous level of base rewards the use of subwoofers, as these roaring dragon-like machines compete in the rural ideal. At the same time, as the ambush is prepared, a simple rhythmical riff gathers instrumental complexity, ratcheting-up the tension in a way that is both simple and effective. The riff doesn't get faster; more instruments are gradually included into the given tempo. A similar trick was employed in 'Henry V' of 1935 vintage. I'm surprised it isn't used more often.The action is realistic, the humour never jars with the tragedies that befall our heroes, locations are wonderfully evocative - I was convinced that this was shot in France, filming, editing and other technical issues all hit the spot. As a piece of action entertainment - wartime or otherwise - its hard to fault.You couldn't improve upon this movie even today. For one thing, the players simply don't exist who could fill these collective characters. Neither could the combat scenes be more intense or realistic whilst retaining the comic thread.In terms of what it has to offer, this movie, then, is very much a one-off. Very highly recommended.",9,7,8,24 October 2010
Event Horizon," Vacuous But Scary
","It's a space rescue mission, with a mixed crew of cynical but competent astronauts led by the excellent Larry Fishburne. Sam Neill plays the covertly knowledgeable 'outsider' with a disproportionate say it what goes on. A signal has been received...So far the plot is a very close parallel to 'Aliens'.The signal has come from a space-probe that was officially 'lost' some years before. It's a frightening, garbled noise, once again like that of 'Alien'. Now the vessel has been relocated out amongst the gas giants planets on the edge of the solar system. Authorities need to find out what went wrong. It had several crew members.The effects and set-pieces are extremely well realised. It is very atmospheric. The 'Aliens' like paranoia is etched with a Gothic horror texture that has a hint of 'Hammer' and 'Quatermass' about it.This ship, it transpires, was more than just a probe. It was the first vessel to jump through hyperspace. Somehow, it's come back. And there's nobody home - or so it seems...What follows are a series of set-piece dream-shocks that ratchet-up the tension fairly well. Slowly, the cynical crew become less cynical as they realise that the vessel is possessed. And not only the vessel; so is Sam Neill's character. It's a fairly predictable slaughter-by-turn with nasty fates for those earmarked.The whole internal structure of the vessel has a menacing, Gothic completeness that is so unlike anything typical of human design as - once again - to resemble the spaceship in 'Alien'.It would seem that this vessel passed through some kind of hell out there in hyperspace and is somehow tainted by association. During this time the crew went insane. On board Video-monitors have recorded their behaviour and it ain't pretty. The surviving rescuers need to escape.There is a want of clear explanation between the evident 'evil' we are led to believe exists and its relationship with the 'scientific' universe. The two ideas merge well in effects but unravel at the rational level. I was left extremely disappointed by the denouement.Also, the interior of the vessel is smeared with large splashes of gore that we must assume are the organic remains of the dead crew, and yet nobody even mentions them, does blood or DNA tests or anything. It's as if the mess is either perfectly normal or that only we can see it. Further, in the time that they inhabit the ship, with air replenished and heating on, this stuff would begin to putrefy and quickly stink-out the confined living space. But again; no-one apparently can smell it either.Acting is fair to good, the script rather flaccid, but the effects and tension are first-rate. It just leaves the impression that they didn't quite know what to do with the idea. Perhaps Nigel Kneale should have been consulted.The movie also reminded me of a short story by Cordwainer Smith called 'The Game Of Rat And Dragon', which might well have been its inspiration.Good scares, inadequate resolution.",7,0,1,15 November 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Resident Boredom
","Well, here we have another vehicle to demonstrate that the typing error with a skirt, Milla Jovovich, really cannot act. Still; there's a lot to be said for being a casting-couch queen. Especially if your bit of giblet happens to be a director. No matter how wretched your ability, you get a starring role in whatever movie twaddle he happens to be knocking-up. 'Resident Evil' had all of the standard formulaic elements of a modern sci-fi horror work. But at least they were put together in a more-or-less orderly and well-paced narrative. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing.'Apocalypse' however, is a touch too much. It has all of the predictable elements of the earlier outing but with a far more confused narrative. Flesh-eating zombies are so passe as to be boring in themselves. And the various 'engineered' special creatures have little or nothing new to offer over the original. There's gore a-plenty. There's preposterous 'Matrix'-style action and effects, crassly engineered drama, wooden acting, a lacklustre script. The set-pieces are still solid, there's clever lighting and decent sound-engineering, but they alone can hardly rescue what is, after all, an overlong, cliché-ridden turkey starring a drab eastern-European hen. A sort of 'Cheeky Girl' with attitude.'Resident Evil' had just about enough surprises to justify a watch. But this - well, its back to the casting-couch Milla, and tell your man to stop wasting our time. He might at least listen to you.",4,1,5,18 September 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Amateurish Revisionist Garbage
","An earlier poster has described this as 'the holocaust for dummies', and it certainly is. I'm not going to step into the mire of factual accuracy, simply state that not one aspect of it presented the least appearance of realism.In a nutshell; I didn't believe what I was watching. Maybe I've read too many accounts about the holocaust, but I don't think so. The whole production had an amateurish appearance, as if based entirely upon 3rd-hand heresay rather than research. The SS officers looked and behaved like caricatures. Set construction seemed minimalist. The acting was stiff and formulaic, script was crass. Made on a limited budget ($12m) was practically advertised in every take. As to predictability - you could see what was coming as soon as both boys confronted each other at the wire. Camera-work was unimaginative, editing clumsy and lacking any dramatic effect. Here was a revisionist opportunity to give at least one Nazi a taste of his own Zyklon. See how he feels about having his kid gassed. Yeah - right on, man. Without doubt, the worst movie of the genre I have ever watched.",1,31,65,30 August 2011
Saw II," Unremitting Twaddle
","I didn't see the original of what has now become an apparently endless franchise. But I caught 'Saw 2' on the telly recently and was about as disenchanted with it as I more or less expected to be.A bunch of typical boring young farts who you couldn't give a rap about and who've been providing slasher-fodder ever since Freddie Kruger went into glove-making, find themselves collectively imprisoned in a sort of death-trap maze affair by a raving loony, believe it or not. Yes; that's how desperate entertainment has become these days.This loony - who is apparently dying from cancer (though, sadly, not quick enough) is in police custody and they are able to watch the desperate antics of those boring young farts on his video link. He won't tell them where they are. And what's more; one of the kids is one of the cops' son. Yep; I mean it.So, there are two stories in one. The loony and the cops engaged in a sort of hammy Lecter/Starling stand-off, whilst the brats get winnowed down by nasty traps. The movie cuts from one to the other with the most inept and untimely editing. It's very difficult to engage with the characters of either sequence because just as we begin to, we are unexpectedly jerked out of one scenario into the other, breaking the continuity and destroying the spell. Not that there is much in the way of engaging characterisation anyway.Acting is about as wooden and contrived as one has come to expect from this kind of twaddle. And the script is positively asinine.There isn't much left to hold the attention after that lot.Oh - and I forgot to mention; all the brats have been infected with some kind of deadly nerve agent for which they must find the antidote. As I said; it's unremitting.The traps are as predictable as page three. Some noddy puts his eye to an eye-hole. And as sure as sure you know he's going to get it poked. This time by a 45 calibre. Another dummy climbs into a small furnace to get some antidote. You can see it coming a mile away. The door bangs shut and he gets roasted alive. This despite the fact that a riddle specifically warned him he might finish-up in hell. Later, one of the bimbettes puts her hands through a trap that is so obviously intended to sever blood-vessels in the wrist that - by now - you begin to realise that the loony's IQ is scarcely higher than his subjects. He just has an amazing prowess in demented DIY. Not long after this there was an advertisement break, and it seemed as good a reason as any to call it quits.Did I miss out on a spectacular and rewarding denouement? I'm sure of it.The ongoing franchise and the encomiums of praise on this website testify to a growing section of our society for whom the best that can be said is that they are a sign of the times. One suspects them of being the sort of people who tyrannise their fellow siblings into suicide, or torture their pets out of academic interest. You sure wouldn't want 'em as baby-sitters.Unredeemed by any cinematic virtue.",3,2,4,27 October 2008
Blood Diamond," It Ain't 'Alf Noisy, Mum
","We're in Africa. And there's bloody turmoil. The Blacks are misunderstood, repressed and exploited. The whites are either sleazy, oppressive exploiters or moralistic, meddlesome do-gooders. Every black seems to own a Kalashnikov. And almost very black seems to be an utterly amoral, ruthless butcher. Except for the occasional saint, who even manages to shame the west by the whiteness of his conscience. How does such relentless savagery manage to give rise to such paradoxical paragons? This movie doesn't explain. And I, for one, wish it did.The violence is relentless. And the sound-score is excessively LOUD. The movie moves from one set-piece shoot-em-up to another, with intervals of discursive calm between. DiCaprio et al seem to spend much of the time miraculously fleeing from one 'Saving Private Ryan' style hail of light ordnance to another, in progressively shabby vehicles. During the calms, this hero keeps (or loses) our attention by constant flights into furious rhetoric, mostly directed at his black associate.The problem seems to be about diamonds. But it isn't really; it's about global Monopoly and how Africa was last in the game to throw a double-six, and been left with just the water-works. DiCaprio plays a man on a journey of discovery to a Damascus moment that seems to take forever arriving. Frankly, by the time it does, you will have experienced such a monotonous parade of brutality and slaughter that motives will have become lost in the fires, trampled underfoot, or washed away by blood. It's a moral movie - like so many others - that seeks to point a simplistic finger of blame at the west for much of the dark continent's woes. Presumably, the west were to blame for what happened in Rwanda as well. And like so many others it fails to make its point with anything like the requisite intelligence and subtlety, relying too much upon graphic slaughter, moral cliché, and the popularity of its post-Titanic star. I actually preferred 'Tears Of The Sun', though all of these movies seem to suffer from weak endings.Don't be fooled by the Oscar nominations, there are far more coherent movies in this genre that won't leave you suffering from tinnitus.",6,0,3,15 May 2011
Avatar," Aliens Never Poop
","Anyone else notice that? They can rip your head of, hatch out inside you, devour humanity alive, spray the ground with our blood, destroy our planet, serenade us on mountain-tops and even get drunk and phone-home - but they never take a dump. Not ever. America's diffidence to toiletary frankness is a comedy in itself. Hollywood's directors should watch more 'Carry On-' movies.Here we have director King Cameron once more. And if 'Avatar' leaves you with deja-vu moments, that's because it resembles just about every other sci-fi movie there's ever been. And Cameron should know. His 'Aliens' was such a blatant rip-off of the 1950's bug-fest 'Them' as to justify the accusation of plagiarism. Originality is definitely not his strong suit.There's trouble on another planet. Some ruthless corporation is mining its assets and the locals are getting a raw deal. An agent is sent to infiltrate them in disguise. If you've seen 'Total Recall'; you already know the plot.Cue the special effects. There's big, CGI flying creatures that smack of 'Dumbo', but lack his grace. There's a psychotic military-type intent on blowing the other-worldly ones to hell, just like (Cameron's) 'Abyss'. There are propeller-driven hovering/flying machines straight from (Cameron's) 'Terminator 2'. There's big walking robots with men inside straight from ('Cameron's) 'Aliens'. Crikey - even Ripley - er..I mean Sigourney Weaver pops up! There's mass battles in the woodland like the Empire versus the Ewoks. And there's more than a hint of 'The Emerald Forest' in which corporate greed has precedent over environmental degradation.But where's STORY? In other words: something happening to somebody I care about. Sadly; it's nowhere. Even the humans are as two-dimensional as the CGI creatures. This might have been filmed in 3-D, but the plot was as 2-D as ever.A lot of thought went into special-effects. And 'if you like that, your're gonna love this' (that's from 'Aliens'). But no thought whatsoever went into zoological or botanical rationale. And Darwin didn't get a look-in. Where was the the bio-diversity? I think I spotted 6 different species in the whole forest.The trouble with cinema is that in order to maximise bums on seats, movies need to appeal to kids as well as adults. The result is that they are often excessively violent for children, but too crass for adults. They're over-simplistic in their evaluation of life.I didn't watch this in much-vaunted 3-D, so maybe I missed something (like a headache). But what I saw was a very elaborate montage of just about every other sci-fi movie there's ever been and then some. And the earlier ones were better because they were original, even if their effects were not so grandiose. And they weren't always dumbed-down to satisfy juvenile appetites. If Cameron really wanted to be earth-shattering, all he had to do was break the ultimate Hollywood taboo and show us an alien taking a dump. I'd have applauded that even in black & white!",6,0,2,1 April 2012
Mission: Impossible," Mission Implausible
","This movie is an edge-of-the-seat roller-coaster ride. Cruise and Voight head a capable group of actors through a labyrinth of pyrotechnics and special effects and some needlessly graphic violence. The whole thing is so completely overblown and implausible that the acting is franked by the same stamp. There are situations that could scarcely be imagined outside of the movies, let alone anticipated, and so it would be impossible to imagine how one might react. As a result, human behaviour is of the the most banal, juvenile comic-book kind. It's how children would behave.The story is suitably complex. There is wheeler-dealing and betrayal. And of course suspicion and discovery. It is a cosmopolitan effort, too, with some nicely selected locations, after the fashion of that equally preposterous James Bond franchise. America's most secret facilities are juxtaposed against a very grubby old back-street near London Bridge, with which I am readily familiar. And later there's a pub in Rotherhithe from which I've had the pleasure to wobble home a couple of times.There is also a burglary so blatantly ripped-off from the older and more believable 'Topkapi' that I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned in the credits.I don't mean to criticise this movie out of hand. It's what it is: impossible - comic-book nonsense. Sit back and enjoy the ride. My only grumble is that this style is becoming increasingly perceived as 'normal' in a movie context. There is so much 'Matrix' style hokum finding its way into movies in general that reality itself seems to be in danger of ending-up on the cutting-room floor. Nothing more demonstrates this phenomenon than baddies with machine guns who seem quite incapable of hitting anything except windows which shatter spectacularly. Fast-moving heroes seem bullet-proof. Even a recent episode of CSI (a series with cerebral pretensions) saw Gary Sinise's character and a female side-kick, doing precisely this when their labs were invaded by armed villains. Then, within minutes they had set-up a bomb that was triggered by an invisible laser Field. Yep - I kid you not. Naturally, as a former lab technician, it's the first thing I thought of.Pretty soon the only believable broadcast will be the test-screen.",8,0,0,3 January 2008
Stalingrad," Harrowing And Graphic.
","I saw this movie upon its British release on a big cinema screen as its creators surely intended. It came with English subtitles and - although usually a hindrance - within 5 minutes I had forgotten. The dialogue was simple and terse. It was easy to keep reading apace with scene changes. That is something the French invariably forget. It opens in Italy in the peaceful, barmy sunshine and the drunkenness of soldiers on extended leave. They are bawdy and crude like the crew of 'Das Boot', and I sometimes get the impression from both that vulgarity is used as a cheap substitute for more intelligent script. The colours are beautiful. The clear blue sky finds even deeper shades of reflection in the sea. Italy is still untrammelled by allied assault and the towns are mellow and picturesque. But the movie is called 'Stalingrad', and you know this is the calm before the storm. Their leave ended, the troops are shoe-horned into cattle trucks and head east. Through the soldiers eyes, the camera shows the unfolding landscape of conquered territories - the new lebensraum. They sneer at local peasants and sit in awe of endless flat vistas of the steppes. It's their land now; or so they think. But the conquest has come to a grinding halt at the city of Stalingrad. And it's a battle that neither side can afford to lose. The movie changes here. The sun is gone. The sky turns permanently leaden. Life assumes the military colours of rancid filth. The scenes of combat are hideously graphic. In one exchange a soldier is blown in half by a tank shell. His torso pleads briefly for help. The situation deteriorates and winter finally crushes what little life and hope is left. The disintegrating order is extremely harrowing. The makers have recreated its chaos and despair with astonishing conviction. It is easy to moralise. The Germans got what they deserved. Or they were young men just obeying orders. And so on. The suffering was indescribable, but Stalingrad was a necessary evil. It was here, if anywhere, that the third Reich broke its heart. If there had been a German victory, the Russians would have been expunged en masse. Heaven knows, as things were, Nazi murder squads slaughtered more than could be counted. And sooner or later, Hitler would have returned to the matter of that inconvenient little island just north of France. By then he might have had the atom bomb.There has been a quiet attempt amongst some intelligentsia to rehabilitate the German people of this time. As if their suffering justified recognition, and from recognition - sympathy. We see a similar presentation in 'Das Boot', where submariners are ultimately depicted as victims - victims who sent thousands of ships and merchant sailors to the bottom of the sea, cheering as they did so and boasting about the 'happy times' before Britain developed effective counter-measures and paid them off in the same coin. However tragic the war for the German people and their armed forces in defeat, any prospect of their victory would have been a calamity too great to contemplate.Those who watch Stalingrad and feel an up-welling of compassion for its idealistic and doomed young Germans, should watch 'The Holocaust' afterwards. That wicked people feel pain doesn't make them any less wicked.",8,2,6,24 April 2008
Where Eagles Dare," Never Bettered.
","Arguably the most successful and memorable screening of Alistair McClean's rip-roaring novels; it is also the most preposterous by a long chalk. 'Where Eagles Dare' is a do-or-die mission with a plot so convoluted that it's almost incomprehensible. A special team are sent behind German lines during WW2 in order to rescue a captured American general and prevent him from divulging all the allied plans. I think that's it - so far. Led by charismatic Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, you know you're in for a rollicking ride.The general is being held in a castle/fortress deep in the Bavarian mountains. It's unapproachable, impregnable, and guarded by a top SS regiment - a piece of cake in other words. Maybe I should say 'a slice of gateau'. What's more - as in all good action-stories of this genre - there are spies and traitors in the team. This movie is an adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Our heroes face hazard upon hazard. But at each turn, they run rings around the Germans who are - as usual - depicted as dumb, pedantic twits. Access to the fortress is via cable-car, which provides all manner of seat-edge suspense and drama. The final denouement concerning the American 'general' and the ultimate reason for the mission is so bizarre and improbable that it's a wonder the actors could take it seriously. But they did, and we go along for the ride too. So much stuff happens in this movie - although the special-effects are gapingly obvious - it's a match for most of the slicker, CGI'd offerings available today. I'd back this hokum against the super-self-important 'Matrix' twaddle any time.Apart from the flawed special-effects during some of the cable-car sequences, the rest of the movie is tight, taut, and ready to rock. There's bags of pyrotechnics, shoot-em-ups that don't entail walking up the walls; there's believable locations and set-pieces. The castle 'feels' like a castle, the gunshots look realistic. Really; you can't quibble about the camera-work, lighting, editing etc. And there's instantly recognisable theme and incidental music. Top this off with a decent script, two box-office stars and a host of excellent character actors; and there's not much left wanting. Although 'The Guns Of Navarone' is more believable, this movie is the action-maestro of its period. If you haven't heard Broadsword calling Danny-Boy, then you must be Ellen Ripley. This is a vintage must-see. No question.",9,4,7,31 October 2010
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray...
","Bill Murray gives his usual turn of deadpan comedy in this time-trap feature.Sent once too often on an annual pilgrimage into unpronounceable small-town isolation, he finally begins cracking-up. The job is really beneath his dignity. He quite rightly hates the assignment, and makes no secret of the fact.However, next morning his problems really set in. Instead of being elsewhen, he wakes-up in the same bed, in the same guesthouse, to the same music playing on the radio. It's Sonny & Cher's 'I've got you, babe.' And every subsequent morning is the same. It's Groundhog Day - for ever. First, there's shock and disbelief, but later wretched resignation. His suicide attempts count for nothing; there really is no escape. He can do and say whatever he likes, everything's the same next morning. I've got you, babe.The tale is a 'journey of discovery'. Sadly, it is over-over simplified into a romantic theme. In effect, he's not a very nice person (who is?) and - rather like Scrooge (who he has also played) - must remedy his vices in order to move on.Basically, the acid-test of rehabilitation will be his ability to get his assistant - here played by Andie MacDowell - into bed. It will be an uphill struggle. In due course he begins putting his time to constructive use, learning the piano, ice-sculpture, and of course - decency.Much as I like many elements of this movie - Murray's poker-faced one-line gag delivery is perfectly timed - it contains a slightly insidious anti-male theme that invariably leaves a sour taste. Murray's character is a fairly ordinary guy with ordinary vices. He is certainly no worse than his assistant. When asked what kind of man would meet her preference, about the only virtue she omits to stipulate is the colour of her imaginary paragon's halo. Yet she herself hardly matches those aspirations, and we infer that being female she has no need to. It is this entrenched judgementalism of maleness - especially by a female who possesses no especial merits herself - that I find so inherently sexist. Why should he have to be a diplomat, doctor, professional pianist, ice-sculptor, etc just to win the preference of a comparatively ordinary woman? Why should the selection-procedure be so one-sided and severe?This misandric undertow is what ultimately mars my full enjoyment of the movie. It's sly, and its very funny; but it's too simplistic in its denouement, and I'm just a little tired of seeing men put on the rack for no other reason than being male.",6,13,29,8 March 2011
Total Recall," Muscles, Minds & Mars
","Big Arnie ramps slaughter and destruction into overdrive with this no-holds-barred science fantasy.The story is too complicated to explain here. Arnie has a series of overlapping identities each serving different environments and situations that have been 'artificially' created for him. And all the while, he is in ignorance. Until...Set somewhen in the future, space-travel is commonplace. Mars has a thriving colony. There's a great commercial enterprise running things, and - as usual - running things without the least regard for humans. Equally inevitable; there's a civil war in progress. Arnie's multiple identities are entailed in all of the conflicting interests.The movie got big bucks to spend. Sets are lavish and believable. Special effects are absolutely top-drawer, as good as any CGI. There are any number of the most bizarre mutants, each wearing complicated and believable prosthetics. Sound and music scores are right on the money, with a good, thumping base line. The script is intelligent and witty. As a piece of cinema it is hard to fault.It's also very brutal. Yet there's still a discreet thread of tongue-in-cheek humour running through it. And on top of all this, there's the often mesmerising mixture of Arnie's complex identities, giving the viewer a genuine pause for thought about who we actually are. In this regard it is an especially clever movie.But don't ever take it seriously. It's just wildly over-the-top fun. Much of what it poses is pure hokum; it's certainly NOT science fiction, but fantasy at its most brash, so nit-picking is pointless.",8,2,5,15 May 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Disappointing
","I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but certainly not a Nicole Kidman fan; so I came to this movie with very mixed expectations. Stanley Kubrick is a director who enjoyed such acclaim since his 2001-Space Odyssey as to assume a position that is almost beyond criticism. In short, if one finds fault in his work; oneself is assumed to be at fault.This movie certainly answers to his skill in terms of technical prowess. Yet the overall effect for me is disappointment. Cruise has invariably enjoyed a reputation as an action man - here he's anything but. Kidman's common femme-fatale persona is supplanted by a confusing amalgam of seductress and thinking-man's crumpet. For me, that doesn't quite wash either.It seems as if Cruise is constantly on the edge of something more visceral, but he is never allowed to break out; whilst Kidman appears permanently frustrated by lack of opportunity to flaunt her ample charms. One can't help feeling that the dislocation of their personal relationship is being acted out on the screen.This is a very dialogue-driven work, yet the script is never intelligent, witty or ironic enough to hold one's attention alone. So it drags from time to time. There are moments of incoherency. At one point, Cruise's character gate-crashes an intriguing little masked ball. There are hints of a demonic rite. But nothing comes of it. His cover is blown and he is warned to keep quiet or else. A piano-playing friend who tipped him off about the party disappears without trace under very suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile, a girl at the party who warns him he is under suspicion and that her life is at risk by just telling him, winds up dead also under suspicious circumstances. It looks like the plot is finally taking-off, yet nothing derives from these events. Why all the secrecy? It was only a glorified gang-bang after all. Another friend (who was there) warns him against any further inquiry in a crassly amateurish way, reasoning that his friend has probably just skipped town, and that the girl was just a drug-addicted prostitute anyway (she died from an overdose), so there was really nothing suspicious. But if they were in the habit of inviting itinerant druggie whores to their little get-togethers, how could they even hope for absolute secrecy? The story just didn't stack up.I personally like ambiguous denouements just as much as neat summations. But this movie just seems to limp along presenting one idea after another to little plausible effect, ultimately drawing to conclusion for no other apparent reason than that the celluloid seemed to run out.It is less than the sum of its parts, and they each seem to small enough purpose, Cruise, Kidman and Kubrick notwithstanding. A lavish presentation with nothing to say that is really worth hearing.",6,1,2,6 August 2011
The Descent," Cinema Goes Down The Hole Again
","I don't quite know where to start, here. I see all of these stellar postings and superlative encomiums and think 'have they watched the same movie?' Some people may call me a chauvinist before I'm through, but I prefer to consider myself a realist. A bunch of young women go caving. With tiresome predictability; each tries to out-macho the other like so many Ellen Ripleys. It just doesn't work. For one thing; she was on her own - even when in the company of others. Secondly; Sigourney Weaver at least learnt to act.Soon, they're arguing and falling-out. Their voices are shrill and brittle and painful to hear. The echoing almost makes them unintelligible. Lo and behold! they've remembered their cosmetics but forgotten the map. Well; we all know that females can't interpret maps anyway so no surprises there, then. The main thing is that they can still look good even if they're lost.Perhaps the director himself is the chauvinist, for perpetuating the appearance that women simply shouldn't go off to anywhere remotely dangerous without at least one nice sensible bloke to look after them. Because that's what this movie desperately cries out for: one or two male actors to bring a little objectivity to the affair.As it is, when things begin to go pear-shaped, we see exactly the sort of tantrums and hysterics that have long since disinclined me towards female companionship in a hazardous situation. I've seen it all before at first hand. A small number of females do excel (the Ellen Ripleys of this world); sadly, despite 30-years of feminism; most play the headless-chicken card. At least to this extent it is an accurate portrayal, but I always find tantrums and hysterics rather tiresome. They're especially cheap as a means of provoking drama.If the pettish bickering, the strident whining, and wrong-time-of-the-month histrionics aren't a big enough turn-off, then the lighting - or lack of it - is the clincher.I know that in caves there is usually no light other than what we take with us, and as a consequence, what we see here is a perfectly reasonable representation of the subjects' predicament; but when the lack of illumination results in a more complete confusion to the viewer than the character, it becomes almost impossible to follow the plot. This bunch of young women are of broadly the same age, height, weight, vocal pitch, etc; so that in the gloom it is extremely difficult to tell what was happening and to whom. Often it is just a shrieking, flickering chaos. I could endure this for a few minutes, but for a whole movie? forget it.After about two-thirds of the way through; I gave it up. I didn't care a rap about the characters, and had never been induced to do so. They're just a group of silly, shallow girls who should never have strayed beyond their campus. There is no particular build-up of tension, scarcely any backfill story, no cohesion in the plot whatsoever. In fact it would have made a better radio-programme because instead of trying to make sense of the abstract, twilit bedlam, a listener could simply have sat back and employed imagination.What this movie demonstrates is the imperative of good acting and believable characterisation with sufficient depth to enable us to care about them, to say nothing of the need for sufficient light to see what the hell is going on. Realism is no use if the result is indiscernible confusion. There should also be much greater disparity of ages and temperaments.If you like seeing young women doing what they do best, or perhaps NOT seeing them doing it, then you'll probably enjoy this. But if you prefer plausible acting, characters you can care about, events you can at least follow without the need for ESP, then give this a miss.I think that if these young women really had to do something exciting enough to dampen their knickers; they should have gone climbing instead. At least the viewer could have seen what was happening most of the time. And they should remember to take a couple of nice sensible blokes with them, that way if they forget their maps it won't matter. And if they get into any trouble, at least two of their number will know what to do.This crap should definitely be left where it went.",1,9,16,8 January 2009
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A Great Modern British Crime Comedy.
","I had just about given up on our own industry by the 1990's. Even when substantially British productions came on stream they were invariably funded by Hollywood and stuffed with their actors, accents and cultural mores.What a refreshing change, then, with 'Lock Stock etc'. Here is a cast of British actors, giving full-tilt to an obviously British script and the whole thing set in seedy London locations (not many, actually). And it's a cracker! There's the sort of who's-who latter-day hard case ensemble not seen for a generation. It's like 'Sweeney' meets 'The Lady Killers'. Comedy is everywhere, but in that subtle, understated, way so typical of our British style. I don't mean to knock American comedy, because when it's good it's top-drawer. But it does tend to be just a little too predictable for our own cultural tastes. Monty Python could never have happened in The States.It's a great case of crossed-up crime capers. A young gang of chancers find themselves owing money big-time to a ruthless old racketeer. From that point on its a hilarious battle of wits, with a massacre or two that probably owe homage to Tarantino, but not much.The dialogue is heavily laden with Cockney rhyming slang to an extent I have never heard even though I worked for years with full-blooded, Bow-belled, natives. There's also a good smattering of British 'street' jargon, which is subtly different from anything to come from the Bronx. Foreigners (Yanks) who experience lingual difficulties should use the subtitles.Production levels are extremely economical. Most of the 'location' work seems to have been taken in Park Street SE1, just where it branches from the Borough Market under the railway bridge. The place has always looked as decrepit as it appears in the movie - and still does. Though it's gradually getting 'yuppiefied' as I write. This absence of cityscape makes it a slightly claustrophobic experience, but the great script and excellent dialogue, plus the rabid bursts of action compensate for this. An American production would almost certainly feature a helicopter overflight with glittering office-blocks. This movie is so painstakingly minimalist that it's almost a poke in the eye at Hollywood excess.'Lock, Stock etc' is a first-rate comedy crime thriller, as counter-culturally suave as 'Ocean's Eleven', but funnier, grittier, and more ironic. And created for a fraction of the price. Go for the 'Director's Cut' version if you can find it. The 107 minute standard release is a little too chopped in its editing. The longer version provides just enough infil to make presentation seamless without interfering with the excellent camera and cutting work. My 9 stars are for the longer version. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,11 July 2009
The Da Vinci Code," The Best Advertisement For Atheism.
","I'm feeling generous - Christian, if you like - so I've given it 5 stars.Though quite where I'm awarding them is unclear even to me. This has to be one of the ditchiest-dull movies of all time. It's like a Tolkein epic but without the special effects, the battles and the monsters.Tom Hanks, his face stricken and artificially-aged by a permanent frown, escorts some sort of femme-fatale through all of the gloomiest set-pieces ever dreamt-up by Hollywood. A curious albino bloke with a penchant for self-flagellation - who might well have escaped from a Tolkein set - pops-up from time to time to commit sundry acts of murder. Various other characters come and go. Jurgen Prochnow trades his U-boat for a truck, Ian McKellern lends a bit more middle-earth de-ja-vu, and Jean Reno attempts to obscure the other actors with his nose.This is the ultimate religious conspiracy theorists movie. A deep, dark secret is being held by a furtive organisation. It's the biblical equivalent of 'Hanger 13'. What is this secret? Does anyone stay awake long enough to find out? Someone with more resilience than myself told me that - apparently - this femme-fatale is a direct descendant of Christ. Like; the crucified one had a bit on the side with Mary Magdalen. Is that it? Is that the great big bete-noir of history? Gosh; stop the press.After 2000 years of generations, lets say - about 100; how much of Christ's genetic constitution is she likely to speak for now? Somebody knows a lot more about 'mystery' than they do about genetics.This is slow, dark, and oh-so-talky. Despite the fact that the lead characters seem to run everywhere. It's a religious storm-in a tea-cup, much ado about nothing, clerical codswallop. Neither does it help that I'm no particular fan of Tom Hanks.Conspiracy theorists and religious freaks will no-doubt nod sagely at its gloomy foreboding passage. Whereas those of us who live in the rational world can see it for the pretentious tripe that it is.For some, it's as if The Enlightenment never happened.",5,2,5,10 May 2009
Titanic," Crass In The Extreme
","First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.But what about story? The Titanic contained over 1,500 human stories. Most of them were to end in terror on that fatal, freezing night.However, Mr Cameron decided that non of these were worth spit. They would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computer-generated themselves, so artificial, clichéd and crass were their presentation.Star-crossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records. Perhaps the most famous example is Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.What have we got here? Disaffected society girl meets, and finds redemption, in gallant working-class hero. Pass me the vomitarium, someone. She already has a beau; and he's as knavish as can be. In an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer, tying his victim to a railroad track. He's not going to be put down by a working-class oik. He'll resort to murder, if needs be. Cameron turns this Mack Sennett cliché on its head by casting the heroine as saviour. We see her wading waist-deep in the icy Atlantic waters without flinching from the cold (just you try it!), in earnest search for her manacled hero. Love isn't just blind - it's numb.But - hey; wait a minute! this is a romantic story from the old school. We can't let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie. The hero's got to do what a hero's got to do. Isn't that what males are bred for, after all? I mean; equality in pay is one thing, but equality in death? I don't think so. Oh-no; the male is always the more expendable. So, in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam. His duty done, his grip is relinquished, and he slips down to eternity. Whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck. You can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable 'Starship Troopers 2'. Yep; the hat's that old.And she might have to move pretty damn quick too. That passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven. It wouldn't do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912.Romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time, with other movies like 'Pearl Habour' playing much the same card. As I say; young romantic tragedy is a long-standing cultural staple in human story-telling. It just isn't usually so extremely crass and predictable as 'Titanic'.Tissues out or vomitarium at the ready, depending upon your gullibility quotient.",3,7,12,12 December 2008
The Untouchables," Slow, Predictable and Schmaltzy
","It's one of those movies in which the baddies are really bad and the goodies are so very, very good.Daffy Duck-voiced Kevin Costner plays an Elliot Ness who is such a self-righteous goody-two-shoes that it almost makes you cringe. He's a sort of Mary Poppins in drag. His wife is likewise such a doting, tractable paragon of womanly virtue that she must have been designed in the Ideal Wife Laboratory. Ness contracts the services of a dogged police officer, a slightly dilatory bean-counter, and a latter-day mixed-race gunfighter, to take on the whole crime syndicate. And in effect, impose upon the American people one of the greatest restrictions upon civil liberties before jack-boots became fashionable: that of banning booze.It is an example of how some people can be found to impose any law - even one entailing genocide - given sufficiently authoritative mandate.Robert DeNiro plays an Al Capone with the sort of uninhibited psychotic panache that has almost become his trade mark. He's good, so long as you're not at the wrong end of his baseball bat. Otherwise the confrontations are staged almost to the point of numbers. Whether it's the assassination of Ness's untouchables, or a lengthy slow-mo conflict in the station; you seem to have seen it happen almost before it's begun.The 'Roaring Twenties' are an extremely exciting and much under-utilised period of American history. Yet this recreation of one chapter is woefully lacking in any particular merit. I understand the recent Depp vehicle 'Public Enemies' has little more to offer.Frankly; I thought the TV series starring Robert Stack was more entertaining per unit time, and Rod Steiger's 'Al Capone' much more believable and periodically authentic.This is strictly for the fans. A one-watch wonder.",5,3,8,10 July 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Another Nerdgasm
","'Reloaded' takes up where its original precursor left off. This sequel is the equivalent of 'The Empire Srtikes Back', except that the characters are no longer engaging and the effects are just a little too mesmerising. The whole effort has a 'packed-out' appearance, as if the movie was designed to last a certain length and sequences were suitably bloated to fit. Particularly jarring is an interlude of 'celebration' featuring a lengthy and rather orgiastic drum cadenza that has absolutely no relevance whatsoever to the story. I reached for the 'mute' button at this point.The trite, enigmatic dialogue became even more clichéd in this dollop, along the lines of 'how can I trust you?' Answer; 'you can't.' And 'how will I know?' Answer; 'You will be ready.' Who do these people think we are? The fact that the original had an overall rating of 9 stars and this sequel only an overall rating of 7 stars, suggests that even the nerds have begun to desert it. I, for one, don't blame em.Not recommended.",6,1,3,22 August 2009
War of the Worlds," read the book instead
","The advance publicity for this movie puzzled me because of its almost complete absence. Usually there are dramatic tempters to whet the appetite and get you hurrying down to the cinema. I saw none of these. The advertising was extensive but vague. It seemed to focus upon Tom Cruise with a fraught expression, as though he were doubtful if Spielberg's cheque would cash. I heard a number of veiled criticisms and instead decided to stay put. Eventually, it appeared on DVD rental.Whatever the critics had to say of this movie, they could hardly exaggerate. It was wretched. I have given it 2 stars because of the special effects and nothing else. They were spooky and state-of-the-art; but in a world of computer-generated imagery, anything is possible so they were never amazing. Special effects, like pyrotechnics, have become a victim of their own success. Plot and story are now beginning to reassert themselves again.I once heard a publisher describe 'story' as something that happens to someone you have been moved to care about. Well, by that definition, there was no story in this movie at all. Before it was a quarter of the way through I would gladly have paid the aliens to do something unpleasant to Mr Cruise and his awful children. But then, maybe I'm unsympathetic in that way, because I was willing the dinosaurs to do as much to the brats in Jurassic Park as well. Mr Spielberg has a maudlin sentimentality about children that strikes me as unhealthy. I believe the condition is referred to in Hollywood as schmaltz.That's a pity; because when he does concentrate on story and uses limited special effects to advance it, he has few equals. 'Dual'; his debut movie will always be his best (there were no kids it).It is claimed that War of the Worlds was shot from the standpoint of Joe Public. In this way, events simply unfolded with a frightening, unexplained confusion. There was none of the political and military overview more typical of the genre. The idea followed in the footsteps of the original novel by H G Wells, who's narrator found himself in the same predicament. Actually; although I found Well's story riveting, I didn't much care for his character either.Even so, in the novel, and in the original movie, we are left in no doubt that these creatures originate from another planet. Wells made it clear that they came from Mars. But in this case, it's impossible to say where the little beggars come from. Adopting this no-explanation technique is fine in some degree, but the viewer is left to think for himself and in doing so discover all of the faults in plot, effects, and so on. For example: why did these invaders go to the trouble of excavating great big holes hundreds of years ago to bury their fighting machines, only to come back centuries later to activate them? Why not destroy us then? And how come the guys who put the fighting machines in the ground didn't get infected with terrestrial diseases? Or how could they be sure that the machines would work after being under the damp earth for so long, or that we wouldn't discover them ourselves? In any case, wouldn't their own technology have progressed in the meantime? This is one movie that sends the implausibility metre off-scale. Check out the rotating road junction that takes away half of a church. And notice in one cut - where Cruise has to sidestep the fault-line - its turning in the opposite direction. Hmm. And how come it takes just 5 minutes to walk round to an epicentre which we can see from his window is several blocks away? And why didn't his kids likewise see this towering monster rise up out of the ground, when they had an unobstructed view from that same window? And isn't it amazing that a commercial jet can crash right next to a wooden house and not set it on fire - even when the basement is engulfed in flame and one of its engines finishes-up in the lounge? More amazing still that said jet can do a belly-flop landing and somehow manage to lose its roof instead? I could go on. As to the fighting-machines themselves; Wells conceived these during the 19th century, in a world still largely moved by horse and cart. They were imaginative then, but this movie is a product of the third millennium. I mean; are we really to suppose that aliens who can flash across the sky in lightening bolts would go wobbling about our planet on giant zimmer-frames? When I saw the first of these whirring, clanking, contraptions rise-up out of the ground, I half expected to hear a Peter Sallis voice-over to the effect 'Come on Grommit, let's get a move on, lad'.Tom Cruise is a movie star and a very competent actor, as indeed is Tim Robbins. Both make the best of a script that might easily have been written on a beermat, and a director who seems to have a childhood and special-effects obsession. One supposes that if actors of lesser stature had been employed instead, this twaddle would scarcely have survived the cutting-room. If you want to watch a dysfunctional family squabble for 2 hours whilst humanity is put to the flame, this is the movie for you. But if you want to see top-drawer science-fiction - look elsewhere.",2,4,7,5 February 2006
Man on Fire," A Waste of Washington
","There have been so many action thrillers made in the last 20 years or so that it must be getting increasingly hard to come up with something original. 'Man On Fire' is a case in point.Basically, this movie is a montage of all the familiar elements meshed together, presumably in the hope that collectively they cannot fail. I have encountered this phenomenon in other movies, and they induce a strange sense of de-ja-vu whilst watching.So let's see; we have the burnt-out expert (Washington) who's taken to the bottle, but is coaxed out of retirement for that 'special' job. That's a Bruce Willis speciality. Then there's the 'wiseman' (Walken), the goodbuddy who understands all of his problems but sticks by him, and also supplies his professional needs (read weapons) whilst opening any official doors. Then there's the inevitable sleazeball, here played so oleaginously by Mickey Rourke, that I expect to see a slime trail when he walks. There's the innocents - this time a mummy (Rada) and oh-so-saccharine-sweet young daughter (Fanning). And of course; there's the expendables - about a dozen unpleasant dead-men-walking.Does it work? not a jot.Washington - of whom I'm a great fan - is positively wasted in this pedestrian predictable role. He's an ex-government assassin offered a supposedly sleeper job of bodyguarding a young girl from risk of ransom kidnap in Latin America. Inevitably, she is kidnapped, but he goes down fighting, only surviving multiple gunshots by a hair's breadth. There's a cock-up in the ransom pay-off whilst he is convalescing, and the bad guys murder the girl. Or so we believe.Time for some payback.The first half of the movie entails a rather Spielberg-sweet relationship evolving between the girl and her bodyguard during which he and she are frequently unchaperoned in each other's bedrooms, and also at the swimming-pool where she is in swimsuit. Some scenes almost seem to hint at paedoplilia. I can't imagine any responsible mother allowing such intimacy between her daughter and a complete stranger, the only thing known about his character being that he is a ruthlessly violent state murderer. He becomes her de-facto uncle and so her 'death' is personal (yawn).The second half of the movie entails Washington unravelling the conspiracy and bumping-off all concerned.You can see 'Rambo'; you can see 'Death Wish'; you can see 'Bodyguard' and probably several others. At one point, the mother - played by Rada Mitchell - throws a tantrum on hearing that her daughter is lost, and orders all the security bods out of her house. The line and its delivery is lifted neat and clean straight out of 'Pitch Black' in which she also co-starred, ordering the other survivors away when she realises her skipper is doomed. Check it out if you don't believe me.Looking at the cast list - Washington, Mitchell, Rourke, Walken, Fanning et al; you might be persuaded that this is really going to drive. Don't be fooled. It's tack. What's worse, the whole movie is riddled with silly little flashbacks and split-second asides, making all the more irritating than entertaining.Daftest of all; the kid isn't dead. Despite the fact that the villains have claimed she is. Despite the fact that they've stopped negotiating; she's still alive all along. Not only that, her own father is involved in the kidnapping plot!.I'll stop there. It's nowhere near as daft as 'Flightplan', but it's daft enough. Washington demonstrates that you can have a great deal of smoke without so much as a spark.Go for 'The Pelican Brief'.",6,0,2,22 April 2010
Hancock," Something For The Couch-Potato
","Will Smith stars as some kind of superhero called 'Hancock'. That's about it.I missed the opening few minutes, which may have provided some infil. However, the character explained later on about his waking-up in a hospital with amnesia and Superman-like invulnerability. Who and/or what he actually was or where he came from was eventually explained in a confused and convoluted way by pouting Charlize Thieron, who might have been his sister or his wife; I'm not quite certain which. Non of it seemed to make much sense.Other than that it was just a standard Hollywood CGI special-effects fest from the dumb box. There was a great deal of set-piece destruction. How it was that no bystanders were killed or injured with all of the flying glass, cars and even a whale, only the moguls of Hollwood know. Every emotional and angst issue was addressed with corresponding juvenile shallowness, and there was a twee little ending that might have been contrived by an 8-year-old. A red heart 'painted' on the full moon - I kid you not.There is now so much of this fast-action popcorn crap being churned-out these days that I almost regret the invention of computers. Increasingly, I'm turning away, and trawling the archives of 'Amazon' for movies that have believable plots, interesting stories and characters I can identify with and care about. However, if you were born after 1990, then you probably grew up with seemingly indestructible heroes who can walk up walls and fly through the air, so may well enjoy it.I've given 4 stars because the camera-work, sound-score and other technical features were up to snuff and deserve a nod. Otherwise it's so formulaic, it's depressing. It's certainly boring.",4,0,3,1 March 2011
Defiance," Jews Suffering Courageously (again).
","It's those Holocaust days of WW2 (again), so here comes yet another movie to remind modern Germans how beastly their grandparents were. And as the people they're being beastly to are Jews, then there's still no choice for the square-headed ones but to endure their flagellation with fortitude.Based on a true story, as they say (which is often a devious way of countering incipient criticism), Daniel Craig and Leiv Schreiber play Jewish brothers who lead a small group of survivors into the wild forests of eastern Europe when the great slaughter starts. By degrees, word gets around, and more fugitive Jews keep turning up. It's a sort of 'Schindler's List', but without the list. Lots of mouths to feed means lots of foraging, and inevitably attacks on (and from) Germans. After many hardships and privations, they triumph. That's about it really.Young Jamie Bell also features as a junior sibling, but he was such a huge hit as our ballet-dancing miner's son that I kept expecting him to turn up in tutu 'n' tights - which is probably asking too much of a refugee partisan.This is just a set-piece wartime drama. All of the usual elements are addressed. Script, acting, directing, editing & camera-work are all by-the-numbers. Dunno how closely it follows the truth as I've never heard this story before. Can't imagine it leaving any lasting impressions anywhere, not unless you're a descendant of those who took part in the original conflict anyway.",6,1,4,18 December 2011
Stalag 17," A Decent Watch
","William Holden won an Oscar as JJ Sefton, the amoral prison-camp spiv who hustles his fellow internees out of their food parcels and cigarettes in order to trade with the Germans for better privileges. His success at both makes him an unpopular character. So; when a traitor is suspected, he is number one on the list.Of course; we all know that's far too obvious. Sefton may be a heal but he's no rat.Wilder's work is one of a number of wartime comedies, but perhaps because of its vintage it hasn't aged quite so well. Some of the comedy comes too close to farce and seems at odds with the Germans' readiness to shoot escapees. Most of the gags are in the first half, after that it drifts towards a who-dunnit. Sefton sets out to discover the spy after he is beaten-up and his possessions indiscriminately plundered.There's no great shakes. Almost all of the characters are stereotypic. Some of the conflicts appear contrived. I really enjoyed it when I first saw it as a kid half a century ago, now I'm less inclined. And I'm no longer a fan of ongoing narrative in a movie. It's okay for an intro, but after that the characters and plot should speak for themselves. The viewer shouldn't need additional prompts.Still well worth a watch if you get the chance and haven't seen it before, but it's certainly no classic. Holden is very good, yet it's hard to believe that his performance was the best of the movies for 1953.",7,1,2,19 August 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply excellent
","There is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for the first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an extraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until we see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot with a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity. The view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The effect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod Stieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that it's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch something very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be the hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or not. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some hysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his first night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named 'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his other abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia that makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some little respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in common with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an innocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well matched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible - assisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the extremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that too.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very hour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be possible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both stretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes in search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped in the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of summer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and distant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The contrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things to savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly counterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address parallels of endurance and relationships from male or female perspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics and CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a decent telly with a quality independent sound-system.",9,0,0,14 April 2006
Carrie," A Strange movie
","I have found this to be a strange work. Although usually described as a 'horror' movie I think that, if anything, it questions the nature of horror.Carrie is a pubescent schoolgirl. She is gauche, freckled, withdrawn, but she is the ugly-duckling that is destined to be a swan. Every school has its schmuck, and Carrie fits the role here. During school hours she begins menstruating and is hysterical about the seemingly inexplicable mess. Her mother has never explained. Naturally; all her classmates have had a sex-education and regard her behaviour as hilarious. Young kids are depicted as nasty, insensitive, bullying bigots, which a lot of kids are - though not all. A sympathetic teacher takes her aside. To be alone, the butt of everyone's ill-humours in a closed institution like a school is itself some kind of horror story. But there's more.Carrie lives with her mother. The woman is, frankly, unhinged. She is stricken by some gross interpretations of old-testament guilt and damnation and has inculcated with only limited success, her poor daughter into her bizarre belief. She lives an isolated life, as does Carrie socially. But the daughter must attend school and discovers there that although people can be terribly cruel, they are not necessarily tainted with evil. It's a horror-story upbringing. Yet it doesn't end there.Carrie possesses a unique gift of telekinesis. She is at first slow to discover this, but soon realises that she can accomplish great things. The high-school proms are due, and another girl, a favoured beauty, takes pity on Carrie and persuades her hunky handsome boyfriend to invite this gauche misfit as his partner instead. Her mother scorns such debauchery, but Carrie means to go and makes her own dress. On the appointed evening, Sissy Spacek looks absolutely perfect as the ravishing naivete and innocent beauty. Even the hunk realises that he could have done a lot worse. But another girl, embittered, plans a monstrous booby-trap to ruin her evening and triumph. And it works.Everyone at the high-school roars with laughter and behaves exactly as her mother foretold. Carrie responds with such a telekinetic tantrum that results in the slaughter of pupils, teachers and parents alike.She walks home afterwards, only to be murdered by her mother, who has finally slipped over the edge.To me, the real horror of this movie is not slaughter, but cruelty, and meanness, and the wretchedly brief and unfulfilling life that is Carrie's. She is doomed at every turn and I am grief-stricken on her behalf. I actually cheered her on as she systematically electrocuted her tormentors and burned their edifice to the ground. How different it all could have been.I also thought the ending was unsatisfactory. The mean language on the tombstone and the hand reaching out from the ground still seemed to smack of an indictment of Carrie and her strangeness, when the real indictment was one of human intolerance.This is a very well-crafted work in all technical aspects. The players give believable turns with Sissy Spacek quite enthralling as a young girl doomed by a terribly troubled upbringing and a unique gift. It's a riveting watch, but saddening for all that.",8,1,1,30 October 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," Supreme Cinema.
","This is one of those very rare movies in which every detail meshes. It's a whole piece. A comparison that comes most readily to mind is 'The Usual Suspects'.From the beautifully evocative orchestral music onwards, you just know you're about to witness something special. The camera-craft and lighting are at times quite sublime, the acting entirely believable. For those with a decent sound-system, one can almost feel the changes of ambiance. Take, for example, Clarice Starling's first encounter with Hannibal. A slight echo typical of the prison facility above ground, is lost as she descends into the catacomb-like dungeon of the most dangerous inmates. Now there is no resonance at all. Instead we have a thick, claustrophobic silence that is frighteningly intimate. This is a nerve-racking aural prelude to their first meeting at the other end of the chamber. It is wonderfully crafted. And because it serves our expectations so well, we take it for granted. For this reason, good quality sound-engineering is often overlooked.And so the movie goes on. Dr Lecter is standing in the middle of his cell. It's a strange, unnatural posture, as if momentarily paused from some action. But he just remains, quiet, still, fixedly watching. The exchanges between nervous Clarice and himself are amongst the classics of cinema. Jodie Foster is ideal with her nervous palpitation, but still driven by pride and ambition to achieve something, whilst Anthony Hopkins, playfully enigmatic, intelligent, and with a barely-restrained madness, sets her a perfect foil.The plot twists are numerous and clever. The discovery slow, slick and often shocking. The script is arch, witty, but still entirely believable, and delivered by a cast of actors who never put a foot wrong.Small town America is depicted as a sad failure. Properties are neglected. The people appear defeated. The lighting is always dull, with the colours washed-out. It's grim. The sun never seems to shine. The music is pensive and thoughtful. A great deal of attention went into describing emotion by light and sound, and once again we can easily take it for granted. But someone thought it all out, piece by piece.Fast forward to Buffalo Bill's lair. We meet the man himself at last. He is naked, obsessing over his pathological delusion. In the mirror he conceals his genitalia between his legs as metamorphosis into femininity. A different music is playing - heavy metal.Clarice has found him out. But he has descended into a sub-basement hell and she must follow and find him. Groping in absolute darkness amongst unimaginable ghastly relics of wickedness we see her at last from Bill's perspective. He has an image intensifier and can observe her every move. She is desperately afraid but yet more courageous still. She will not be deterred. In the stifling confinement we hear her hyper-ventilating with terror and barely able to hold her gun steady. Then it's over. Bill is disclosed by his own sound and seen in a whirl of momentary gun-flashes. During the chaos a blind is disturbed and at last there is sweet daylight flooding in. A Chinese-lantern affair is twirling gracefully in its glare. The audience collectively begin breathing again.This movie is a master-class in cinema as an art-form. It is possible to exhaust one's fund of superlatives in praise. I cannot watch it very often because I am drained by the sheer emotional experience. When Hollywood does it right, they really cannot be bettered. Oscars for best film, best director, best screenplay, and best actors for both Hopkins and Foster, with two other nominations - never more deserved.As a footnote to an earlier commentator. Apart from the corpses, the only character in the movie to be seen naked is that of buffalo Bill himself. And even he spares our sensibilities. At no time does Jodie Foster expose herself, neither does Anthony Hopkins, nor indeed anyone else. I begin to wonder if that commentator was watching a different movie.",10,2,3,17 May 2008
Blade Runner," Elaborate but Inadequate
","Other commentators have already suggested that the events and ideas contained in the story were insufficient to fill the length of the movie, and I'm inclined to agree. There were times when in did appear to drag.The interpretation of the future was also a bit cackhanded. Right from the beginning we see those huge out-wellings of flame over the city. What are they supposed to be? Surely someone would have capitalised upon such wanton waste and stored the gas for heating. It is simply the director's triumph of imagery over logic. Already there is great concern about atmospheric pollution, global warming and so forth, yet our skies are nowhere near as gloomy as those depicted in the movie. Perhaps we lose the battle. But even that hardly explains why the interiors of buildings were so dimly lit. How could anyone see to work, let alone clean-up? Also, as these replicants were effectively regarded as machines, and highly dangerous ones at that, it is certain that they would have been fitted with some kind of tracking device like SatNav. Look how widespread that has become already. Furthermore, I rather think that a more effective method of dealing with them than just a modified handgun would have been devised. And why so little CCTV? Wouldn't there have been cameras in the lifts of the Tyrell Building? And what about security guards, intruder alarms etc. How could a replicant get to see the man himself simply by accompanying an employee? Try that in any major corporation today. Day or night, it just won't happen. This movie is a paradox. The very technology that creates these wonderful puppets would be spread throughout the world, checking-up on them and everyone else. '1984' was a much more accurate piece of science fiction. In Britain at least, it is almost fully realised. Actually what we have here is science fantasy, not fiction.As to sending one man with one side-arm to hunt for half a dozen dangerous opponents? No; that doesn't make any kind of sense at all. Especially when those opponents are strong enough to punch through walls and quick enough to dodge bullets.But if you can get your head around the one-sided and anomalous interpretation of technological development, and you can avoid chafing at the slow, slow pace of a fairly straightforward story, it's quite a mesmerising audio-visual experience that will linger in your memory. Commentators who see multiple layers of wisdom after viewing it dozens of times need to get a life; they remind me of those people who used to hear secret messages in old vinyl records when they were played backwards. If there's any subliminal instruction here it probably runs 'believe this movie is more than the sum of its parts'. What better testimony to the confusion of its message than that the director himself has so often re-written it?It is extremely elaborate in presentation, but a good artist uses your imagination rather than his own. He just scatters random and abstract clues and lets you deduce their meaning. Imagery so lends itself to interpretation in fertile (and gullible) minds. Just check-out the power of religion.Enjoy it, by all means. Just don't think too hard.",8,2,9,26 December 2007
Ben-Hur," A Flawed Epic
","Judging a movie from the 1950's by third millennium standards is always fraught with problems. Moral standards and censorship mores have changed so much, as indeed have viewer expectations. Half a century ago cinema was the primary source of entertainment; now it competes with many others. 'Ben Hur' has an in-built interpretational problem. Right from the outset we are warned that this is a story of Christ, when in fact; it isn't. It's a story of betrayal and revenge between two friends who become sworn enemies. Christ hardly gets a look-in. The essential conflict that develops between Ben Hur and Messala is one that it as old as humanity - far older than Christianity. It is my belief that the director should have stuck to the one and abandoned the other. But as I say, perhaps the morals of the day wouldn't readily have accepted it. Observed at the human level, and stripped of all the theological face-ache, this is still a very engaging movie which has many parallels today. The acting is a little florid and campy but you don't have to go back to biblical times to find people behaving with theatrical excess. The fact that today we tend to have abandoned 'ritual' in our behaviour in exchange for a rather contemptuous simplicity hasn't necessarily improved our society. It certainly isn't more polite or better-mannered. The pace of story-telling is set at a slower tempo, and you either get your head round that and enjoy it - or you don't. I'm old enough to have grown up with it, so I can. In fact I prefer it to the more frenetic cut, cut, and cut again style of modern movies. 'Ben Hur' is a sword 'n' sandals epic. One of the big five, which would include 'Spartacus', 'Fall of The Roman Empire', 'King of Kings' and 'The Ten Commandments'. The cast is top-drawer, they act well, there are some excellent lines and the costumes are lavish. There are also some spectacular set-pieces. The long shots of a naval battle have a slightly 'Airfix in the bath-tub' look about them which are sadly typical of the decade. Some CGI would certainly have helped them along. But the fights are well choreographed. There's a scene where some schmuck climbs out of the rowing gallery with a bloodied stump instead of a hand and that looks suitably gruesome. And then, of course, there's the chariot race. It only lasts for a few minutes and is the climax of the movie. But what a climax! As a piece of kick-in-the-pants action this has never been bettered. You are right there in the arena, and it's mayhem all the way. Quite frankly, I cannot think of any way it could be improved. Even today, CGI would add nothing to the in-your-face realism, because this race really is happening. Stunt doubles never earned their money half so well. Very authentic dummies get trampled to death. An innocent Roman guard and the ambulance crews are all implicated in slaughter. I only hope that no horses were harmed in the production because they're all right there in the thick of it, live and galloping. This is an object lesson in how to film a race and is itself worth the price of the DVD. Messala gets his desserts. The skin is practically trampled off him and his woulds look horrific and believable. The movie should have ended with the final confrontation between BenHur and a dying Messala. Unfortunately it didn't. The director appeared to belatedly remember that this was supposed to be a movie about Christ. As a result, a long, turgid, appendix was grafted on, in which Ben Hur drags his leprous relatives to see the crucifixion, and they are miraculously cured. Miklos Rosza - who seemed to have cornered the market in providing music for the genre - really lets rip big time, with enough heavenly bombast to beat your eardrums limp. I have no objection to theology in its place and several movies like 'King of Kings' and 'The Ten Commandments' leave you in no doubt what you are signing-up for. You can take it or leave it. But 'Ben Hur' is manifestly not a story about Christ and his inclusion simply muddies the water. Stripped of the bible-beating excess and with a little more attention paid to the nautical battle, this movie would knock 'Gladiator' into a cocked hat. Certainly, as a tortured soul with an axe to grind, Charlton Heston makes Russell Crowe seem like a ventriloquist's dummy. As it is, with 'musical Micky' out to deafen you, ships like painted shoe-boxes, and the stultifying theological bi-line, it is more of a flawed epic than a masterpiece.",8,1,3,29 March 2008
Signs," Spooky And Silly By Turns
","Starring Mel Gibson - not always a warranty of enjoyment.The aliens are coming to get us. And the kids can hear them talking in obscure ways in television static, phone-line crackle, and stuff like that. For the most part the audience is left frustrated and wondering, like long-suffering dad Mel Gibson.The 'Signs' progressively increase in intensity. There are massed UFO sightings. Something seems to be creeping about in the tall, rustling corn crops, which seems to draw upon a Stephen King short story for its particular inspiration.The crisis arrives, and the aliens lay siege to the Gibson family home, which is little more than a big clapboard shack.Unfortunately, these aliens who can travel across the galaxy in flying-saucers encounter something quite beyond their experience and - it seems - utterly defeating: the doors have locks! Yup; just shut 'em in the pantry and they're screwed. Or lock yourself in the cellar and there's nothing for it but to admit defeat and go back to your home-planet. Locks - who would've believed it? Those darned, crafty humans.Ah - but one get's left behind. And I'm not surprised; he looks like ET's great Uncle Fester. Wouldn't want to spend hypersleep lying next to him - or her, or whatever.When it's spooky, it does a really good job. But - gosh - when it comes to being silly, it has few equals.Be sure to lock your doors before you go to bed and you should be safe from any risk of abduction. Unless they manage to Shanghai a locksmith first, that is.",7,0,4,4 April 2010
Final Destination," Death Never Takes A Holiday
","Watched merely 'because it was there', I was unexpectedly surprised by the quality of this movie.With a youthful cast of - to me - largely unknowns, it didn't seem to offer more than the standard formulaic brat-slash twaddle. But I was wrong.From the beginning it was entirely believable. These youngsters seemed to know their stuff, and whilst I never really cared for them, they at least conveyed a genuine fidelity to their parts. The growing hysteria with the anticipated plane-crash and the special-effects with which it was realised were extremely harrowing. The CGI was good enough to convince at first show, which is more than can be said for many a movie of much greater budget and scale.How do you deal with someone who foresaw the crash in a world of air-terrorism? The authorities are phlegmatic and assume he must have had a hand in it somehow. Yet the inevitable and meticulous evaluation of the wreckage points to an accident. It's a dilemma. They just have to suspect him of something.Meanwhile death has come-up short on its body-count and means to make good the deficit. And it's here that I knock points off. It is never explained (because Death doesn't give interviews) why it goes about developing such complicated and involved scenarios in order to harvest its crop. Why not just give them all heart attacks? The contrived and sometimes sudden deaths are tense, entertaining and shocking by turns but - as I say - the underlying premise of death's deviousness is never explained and leaves - at least for me - a gaping hole in the satisfaction ship.Still; it's well-acted, well-directed, and well made. The effects are good and the surprises keep coming.And one other thing that keeps coming that's no surprise at all is that its unexpected success has spawned a franchise of sequel after sequel.Poor old Death, always playing catch-up to the accountants.",7,0,1,1 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Thank Heavens It's Over.
","After the first Ipcress-like mind-numbingly boring episode, aka 'The Fellowship', I swore I would never watch another. But them blighters on the telly tricked me. They caught me off-guard.So; to the exquisite delight of the late Mr Tolkien's rabid fan-club, I can confirm that the third instalment is just as good as the first. Which - to those of us who live in the real world instead of some hallucinogenic phantasmagoria of middle-earth - means it's as flatulent, turgid and boring as the master clearly intended it to be.Same Stuff, different movie. Endless partings, endless greetings, endless wars, long, lingering stares of defiance, dreading, dismay, what-the-hell. It uses-up celluloid; that's the main thing. And gives v-e-r-y shallow people with s-h-o-r-t attention spans, the impression that they are watching something truly e-p-i-c.Heavens-to-Betsy that final sequence must test the stamina of Gods. Will they get the ring up the hill to that erupting volcano? Will the goodies beat the baddies. Will rational viewers fall asleep before they find out? Now that's the real test and question. We hear a pre-battle speech so blatantly ripped-off from Shakespeare, that the Bard himself might rise-up and sue for plagiarism. We see those strange midgets endlessly climbing,climbing, climbing. How tired they are, how weary; I know just how they feel. The scene cuts and cuts again so much that I wonder if I'm not watching and mixing two separate movies. A big spider appears, but to no particular purpose than to fill-in yet another boring blank with bogus drama and hand-wringing anguish. But what's this? Halfway up the volcano there's a door! How very thoughtful of the special-effects department. Pity the budget didn't extend to an elevator. And curiously, despite the fact that lava is erupting several hundred feet above, when they walk inside, said lava is now sitting passively several hundred feet below. No explanation: non needed. The 'Tolkeens' will accept the anomaly without question.Surely the most preposterous anti-climax of all time is the scene in which the bald bug-eyed midget has jumped onto the invisible bug-eyed midget. We see this preposterous CGI performing a sort of airborne one-man-dance like Master Yoda orgasmically levitating in his underpants. May the farce be with you. It's the first truly entertaining scene I have witnessed in the whole cinematic tarpit, and it has me in stitches. What happens next? I lost track. The big eye-shaped thing at the top of the tower falls down because the tower collapses. Then the volcano erupts big-time.But, no worries. This is Tolkien. The good midgets are immortal. It simply offers prelude to yet another long, tearful anguish episode, followed by yet another long, tearful, and smiling re-union episode. The credits were still rolling even after I'd had my dinner.Joy to the many tragic, deluded fans. Thank heavens Sigourney Weaver isn't in it. It's over. We're done. It's safe to put the telly back on.",5,1,4,29 September 2008
The Matrix," Something For The Nerds
","'The Matrix' contains some of the most spectacular special effects and action sequences of any movie. Judged by those alone, it would definitely qualify 10 stars. There's an excellent cast who make a sterling effort on sets that must - for the most part be virtual. All of the other standards of sound, lighting, directing are right on the money.As to the script - well it's little more than an endless stream of flatulent gobbledegook. Applaud or yawn, as you will. And as to the science fiction element; well that's plain bonkers. Machines breeding humans to exploit their brain energy? Those machines must be daft as brushes. There are far more efficient ways to create power. We should know; we breed the other domesticated species for just that purpose.Marvel at the technical elements but don't be taken in by them. This is a very simple movie when the Gothic grandeur, computer junk, and action sequences are set aside.I suspect that the strength of its appeal derives from the fact that it is basically the time-honoured 'rite of passage story' which is probably older than our own species. Basically; a young man must advance and prove himself as leader, gain the respect of a loyal band, then confront and defeat a powerful enemy. 'Star Wars', Lord of the Rings', 'Harry Potter', 'Saving Private Ryan'; they're all retreads of this ancient tribal format that is very likely instinctive in all human males.",7,1,2,20 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The film that launched a thousand space-ships.
","Everyone who saw this film for the first time had barely taken their seats before witnessing the most jaw-dropping special-effect ever. To see that colossal Imperial star-ship growing out of the screen until the front is in middle distance whilst the complete fuselage is not yet made visible, was to see science fiction and fantasy changed for ever. Instead of being the poor nephew of production, overnight it became the new box-office spectacle.The first 2 minutes alone were worth the price of the whole movie. And indeed; 30 years on, they still are.CGI effects have taken over as the preferred medium of invention, and there is certainly a place for that technique too. But ineptly done they are no more plausible than stop-go latex. It is possible to create more features and movement with them, but whether or not they're necessary is debatable. Later offerings seem overblown. There's just a bit too much of everything. Well-made models and micro-cameras have a realism and substance that computer technology has yet to replicate.Consider the robots R2D2 and C3PO. The latter was a real person dressed up to look and act like a robot. Even R2D2 sometimes contained a small actor at times. Once again, they have a presence on the set that CGI robots lack. Compare them with those of 'I Robot' and you will see what I mean.I could go on, but there's no need. This movie has it all. A hero rescuing a heroine, good versus evil, one of the greatest baddies of all time with the most spectacular entrÃ©e imaginable, title music as rousing as any national anthem... Ah, but we all know it by now.I don't think George Lucas has done anything else BUT the StarWars series. And that's fine; it's as worthy a legacy as anyone could wish, something that will last as long as cinema - and beyond.It's no good; I'll have to watch it again.",10,0,1,16 April 2006
Cube," Not For The Squeamish
","I only intended to offer 6 or 7 stars, but its simple audacity moved me to give it more.This is very much a 'what would I do in the same place' movie. And it's shocking. I begin to wonder if some people do not spend their spare time imagining increasingly bizarre and monstrous ways in which to kill. That is certainly the case here.The set is fairly straightforward. It's a sort of prison-cell with trapdoor openings in all of the walls, ceiling and floor. Each gives access to a seemingly identical cell which may be illuminated in a different colour. That obviously keeps production costs to a minimum as one set fits all. In fact, the cells are not quite identical. Some contain the most diabolical booby-traps imaginable.A group of inmates, or guinea-pigs wake and find themselves inside this grotesque maze and it becomes evident that their combined skills and abilities are their potential salvation. They work from cube to cube attempting to discover how to escape. It should also be mentioned that each cube is part of a complex in which they frequently move like a colossal Rubic Cube.Naturally, tempers fray and conflicts develop. This is especially so when those who think they are inevitably suited to leadership and command, find that in truth they have little to offer, and instead the least likely members are the more needful. It's a clever little observation about human behaviour, but which is not very well evaluated or explored. The script and acting are all a tad stagy, but the oddness of the whole situation still carries the movie forward and the viewer watching.There is no explanation or overview to their plight or the nature of the hell in which they are plunged, and this may disappoint those who like things cleared-up at the end. You take it for what it is; a bizarre idea, ordinary people, life and death.Weird and Wonderful.",8,0,1,30 March 2008
Jackie Brown," A Drama from the Murdermeister
","I didn't know that this was a Tarantino movie when I watched it. One evening it was screened on television and I just went along for the ride. But pretty soon I found it was taking me to lots of interesting places, all of them with the same name - Character.Each of these characters have problems with which we can empathise. There's a crook with a Walter Mitty complex, and another crook who's burned-out and clearly losing it. There's a bored blonde moll with too much spare time who has taken to drugs as a fillip. There's a bail-bonds-man just getting along and getting older, doing his job without much thought to anything else. And then there's Jackie Brown: an air-hostess metaphorically on her last flight. She's 44, middle-aged, and putting on weight. She's also an unintentional mule for Walter Mitty and, consequently, a stooge for the police.This movie weaves an engaging little fabric of trust and deceit, hope and disappointment, success and failure. Even at their worst, there is something about each character that commends them to your affections. They're just getting by on the term that life has made for them.There is murder. And it's as sudden, needless and brutal enough to bear the Tarantino stamp. But in the end it doesn't detract from the character study that is the basic premise of this movie. Those who die were clearly doomed anyway. You knew that. Whilst those who survive are enriched by their passing, literally and metaphorically.I needn't name the players; they're all listed elsewhere. But each one does a thoroughly sterling job in their role. And if ever proof were wanting that we need more older women on screen - here it is.This movie is a worthy distraction from Tarentino's usual formula of graphic crudity and violence. It signal's an ability to do a great deal more with people than the things for which he is so rightly famous. The man possesses subtlety. And I, for one, would welcome more.",9,1,2,26 January 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Not Half So Funny As Some Appear To Think
","By the time of this movie's release, the Python team had already passed from being new and experimental, and into mainstream comedy. But in doing so, they re-defined humour for a whole generation.Therefore, one might have expected this production to have been a little more polished than it is, even allowing for the spontaneous anarchy that was part of their style. However, this is not the case. At times it seems quite sloppy, and indeed rather boring.I can recollect, in my youth, finding many things to laugh at when I first saw this production nearly 40 years ago. It had the great Python team going like stokers and lots of silly and surreal moments. Today, with my older, and perhaps drier, humour; things seem very different. I recently purchased (second-hand) the double-DVD special edition, and wanted desperately to rekindle that original spark, if only for 'old time's sake'. Sadly; it just wasn't there.Occasional smirk-worthy moments could still be found - like the time when Arthur inadvertently 'oppresses' an opinionated surf, or the knight who never accepts defeat even when his limbs have been hacked off - but for the most part it seems pretty lame. Such is the resonance of 'Python' humour, even worldwide, that I found myself making-up excuses for its lack of appeal. For many, Monty Python has itself become the Holy Grail of comedy. Well, it isn't. And this work has more the amateurish appearance of a hastily cobbled together piece of footlights hokum. Something to engage the smug self-righteousness of drunken under-graduates.Many things the Monty Python team created have indeed become standard-bearers of comedy greatness. But not everything was good. Objective and critical scrutiny must admit that some of their stuff could be pretty lousy. That's inevitable. The later, much more polished, 'Life Of Brian' was not only ground-breaking in its assault upon flatulent institutions, it's still downright funny, and remains an insightful analysis of human foibles.'Brian' has stood the test of time, but 'The Holy Grail' is no more than what it represents itself to be - a failed search.",6,4,9,8 July 2012
Gladiator," Pretentious and Mediocre
","Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.",6,32,69,6 January 2008
Contact," Involving But A Bit Daft
","Nice Mr Sagan's plodding science-faction novel gets the full treatment by Hollywood. Starring plainest of the Janes, Jodie Foster, as a scientific muse, and Tom Skerritt as her less-than-honourable boss (a hint of 'Silence of the Lambs'); her team discover an incoming signal from outer-space. It is clearly coherent.What follows is an interesting though rather predictable interplay between science, religion and the apparatus of security as to how the thing should be addressed. A maverick billionaire with terminal cancer issues, adds a little spice, as does some Loonytune terrorist who destroys the first machine. The trouble with the movie and indeed the book, is that nobody seems quite sure how to deal with the subject. To make 'Contact' a plausible concept is the need to think like an alien, whilst Hollywood barely knows how to think like an adult human. As a result; the ending is such a made-for-kids cheese-fest that all of the comparatively grown-up stuff which the movie moguls could actually understand from Sagan's original story is pretty-well set at nought.There's a decent cast, which includes John Hurt, who - being the first person to have an 'Alien' burst out of him - seems to have been perennially remembered and short-listed for SF roles ever since. There's plenty of good effects. Sound and vision are well addressed; but ain't it always the case? The moral, political and security issues presented by Sagan are dealt with adequately. Acting, directing and other technical issues are up to snuff. The first 90% is well worth a watch. It's the last 10% that vanish down a cheese-hole.It's a shame: a perfectly decent movie meal has been spoilt by a thick slice of Wensleydale.",7,0,2,29 May 2011
Back to the Future," An Old Favourite
","I love this movie. Although aimed primarily at a younger audience on account of its high-school-aged hero, there's really something for everyone.It's got adventure. It's got excitement. It's got danger. It's got great comedy. And it's got so much more.Released in 1985, its special-effects are minimal, and thankfully predate the now-obligatory CGI, requiring some practical imagination to make the thing seem plausible. Basically; everything's in the DeLorean sports car. After that, what is needed is an authentic representation of the 1950's. I'm no expert, but the period seems believable to me.Camera-work, lighting, and sound-effects are top-drawer. There are some wonderfully realised ambiences. Music - both incidental and theme are well chosen. Huey Lewis And The News supply the anthem 'Power Of Love' in fine, thumping riff, whilst additional pieces give a tremendous sense of urgency. It really is spot-on.This movie brought the unfortunate Micheal J Fox into deserved prominence. His acting skills and comic timing are excellent, here. It's so sad that incurable illness has blighted such a promising career. He and Christopher Lloyd make excellent foils. They are naturals as a comic duo.Young McFly goes back in time to find his young father as a bullied wimp, a failed writer, and a peeping-tom. He also accidentally upstages his father in his mother's eyes and risks a dose of temporal incest. Somehow he has to put things right before going back to the future. He does - but some details get overlooked, with funny and happy consequences. Relationships are handled with a light and deft touch. It never plods. It never becomes maudlin or lachrymose or excessively sentimental.There are several plot-holes in the story. And if you get hung-up on the stuff about time-travel and paradox crap, you're missing the point. You're not supposed to take it seriously. It's a fun movie! And it delivers in spades.Some have described this as the best time-travel movie and I'm inclined to agree. If you can't find something to laugh at then you're a lost cause.Being so successful, two sequels followed. But the surprise was gone and the humour grew progressively stale. they paled by comparison.Check-out the original. It's a collectors item and a truly great feel-good experience. I ought to give it 10 stars.",9,5,7,23 September 2008
The Birds," Still Scary After All These Years
","This movie is rather an odd-man-out amongst Hitchcock's genre. For the most part, his movies feature horrors of a human nature. The two that come first to my mind are 'Psycho' and 'Rebecca.' 'The Birds' has a more Steven King style of story-telling, in which something otherwise innocuous quite unexpectedly goes berserk. As he himself once explained; 'the familiar fabric of life can come unravelled with shocking suddenness'.During the first part of the movie, we are treated to a comedy of manners amongst sophisticated individuals. Tippi Hedren plays 'society girl' Melanie Daniels, out to score flirty points off an upstart lawyer, acted rather oleaginously by Robert Taylor.She pays a clandestine visit to his mother's country house out in the coastal boondocks called Bodega Bay. And it's here that Mr King appears to take over the script. Beginning with a few isolated attacks, 'The Birds' descends into a truly horrific idea. They have all become organised and cooperative. And they want us dead. The attack scenes quite beggar belief. These aren't special-effects or CGI; these are real birds. Big, dangerous ones like crows and gulls. And although they were trained to their task, it didn't stop one of the girls (I believe it was Ms Hedren) being pecked so badly that she was actually scarred.The caws and shrieks are loud and aggressively modulated to highlight their new-found ferocity. Even today some of the scenes of bloodied victims struggling under multiple attack are shocking. Hedren's character shelters in a telephone box whilst rabid birds hurl themselves at the windows, shattering them in death. A man staggers up, his face a ripped, red mask, unable to think under the onslaught let alone see.Then the raid abates, and the dazed community try to make sense of the impossible thing that just happened.All of the characters are extremely plausible and accurately represent the social and sexual politics of the day (1963). Modern feminists might find the strident hysteria and sal-volatile weepiness of their gender portrayal a little hard to stomach today; well - I'm sorry girls - but that's more or less what we blokes had to put up with back then. In a crisis, men not only did everything; they were bleeding expected to do everything. You don't know how grateful we are for Ellen Ripley.As other commentators have mentioned; if you like explanations and nice neat denouements, this movie isn't for you. The subjects just go quietly into the night, leaving the theatre to the birds. You don't even know if they make it or not. They disappear into the distance with the harsh braying of crows sounding almost like victory jeers.Modern horror movies like 'Aliens' and 'Species' have raised the shock threshold way beyond this now, but for those of us who saw this frightener during the 60's, our feathered friends have never seemed quite the same. And they are right here, with us. 'Aliens' are just a remote fantasy. Remember that, next time you're out in the countryside, away from any protection, and a big mob of crows begins quietly looking you over...",9,4,7,3 May 2008
Beetlejuice," Wonderfully Weird
","Bringing an usual concept to a movie, Tim Burton has his ideal romantic leads killed-off in the first 5 minutes. Both go to town alive, and arrive home as ghosts. They are slow to realise this. Worse still, their perfect country home is rapidly sold on to the couple from hell. These are a pair of freaky-fashionable stiff-necked city snobs. He is recovering from a nervous breakdown and would be happy to leave things as they are, but his neurotic wife has artistic delusions and means to gut the place. To the ghosts, that won't do.They mean to haunt 'em out. But, being novices, they're not sure how. Enter an unrecognisable Micheal Keaton as the titular 'Beetle Juice'. He is a free spirit with a wicked turn, and a freelance exorciser of humans. The couple are torn between his anarchic services and more conventional haunting; to this end, they seek counsel with the spirit world.The movie is showing its age in terms of special-effects (but at least they are not CGI); even so, a lot of ingenuity was employed in bringing this work to life, and for the most part they still work. There are some very imaginative and comic touches - especially in the after-life, where victims of a variety of grisly deaths await their turn with necromantic bureaucracy. Sight gags and comic lines abound.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis adequately play the short-lived couple and other players give a decent turn for their paycheques. But this is Keaton's movie. His performance is so over-the-top as to match Jack Nicholson's Joker in 'Batman'. He is hilarious and demonstrates great comic timing. The music and sound effects are in general well suited, but I thought numbers like the Banana Boat Song a little jarring.This is a ghost story movie like no other. Despite the slightly outdated effects, it is well worth a watch. In fact, I am beginning to find CGI a little passe these days, and prefer well-crafted 'old fashioned' effects. You at least know lots of people have really burnt the midnight oil to bring their ideas to fruition, instead of just a team of nerds churning them out on computers.",8,1,2,6 November 2010
From Here to Eternity," Not My Kind Of Movie
","I generally enjoy older movies (it's a generation thing) but this one touches upon subject matter that really doesn't interest me at all.It's a bit of a kitchen-sink drama really, given a military setting. There's a company commander who has lost interest in his wife and goes a-philandering at every opportunity. Meantime, his wife - surrounded by any amount of available masculinity - does likewise. She opts for his top sergeant on this occasion. There's a new transfer to his company who is a bugler and capable boxer, but who has forsworn boxing on account of blinding his friend in the past. He won't box for the company, so his CO decides to give him grief. Whilst on leave he gets the hots for a sort of club-hostess down town. Meantime his friend makes an enemy of the stockade sergeant, only to get thrown in the stockade. That's about it.I don't mean to trivialise it. Crikey; this movie won 8 Oscars including Best Picture for 1953. There's a top-drawer cast of the day including Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra and Deborah Kerr. They all play their parts to perfection. It's just that the minutiae of US military life has never interested me at all, and neither has (other people's) sexual infidelity. Every character takes themselves far too seriously for my tastes. I wouldn't have fitted in to their lifestyles at all. But Zinnemann gives us a very believable, claustrophobic presentation of the pettiness and triviality of human endeavour, and non of it is particularly flattering.It's Hawaii. And it's set as a prelude to the attack on Pearl harbour. The attack comes. We see about 4 planes fly over. That's about it. And that's what I mean about pettiness & trivia; the most outrageous sneak attack in modern history that led to thousands of American casualties and the loss of all the capital ships of USA's Pacific fleet (less aircraft carriers) is little more than a footnote in a movie that both agonises and luxuriates about desire & adultery for over an hour and a half. The priorities seem confused.Still; you pays yer money and takes yer choice. It's a magnificent movie about the littleness of human purpose. And it ain't my scene.",8,0,3,18 December 2011
V for Vendetta," Gunpowder Clot
","Sometimes; when reading the posts on IMDb, it becomes easier to see that common sense is possessed by a declining few.Even to describe the plot of this second Guy Fawkes as 'preposterous in the extreme' would be an understatement.One commentator has compared it to a production by Andrew Lloyd Webber. And given a few good songs, with the abandonment of all pretence at reality, it would have made a corking musical. A sort of 'Phantom Of The Revolution', with hints of Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi, Neo, Adam Adamant, Bat Man, and The Joker all rolled into Winston Smith. As a piece of overblown, theatrical pomposity I can think of very few equals.The problem is; it didn't stop there. It tried to be intelligent. And for under-fives may still seem so. It tried to be realistic; though the same class are unlikely to be fooled there. It also tried to convey a political message, with all the balance and intellectual depth of the Socialist Worker Party. Yep: that bad.And I am SO tired of super-heroes, who can do just about anything. Where do they learn their skills? Where do they get their training? Why can't the SAS - who spend their lives in the business of all things espionage - do the same? There is a single-line hint that he was infected by a disease which miraculously advanced his strength and reaction times (yawn). It similarly made him a knife-throwing genius, a pyrotechnics expert, and a ghost who can pretty-well go anywhere without detection.And of course; he's got to have 'issues' from the past, that require endless, tedious, soul-searching, chest-bearing denouements (double yawn). To begin with; he's tapped into a communications main-frame. He's managed to smuggle about a ton of explosives into the Old Bailey, along with about £100,000 worth of display fireworks for good measure. He's managed to distribute them, conceal them, and fit them with minutely co-ordinated time-fuses. And he's apparently done this when anything bigger than a handbag is searched, and also scanned for explosive traces. Yeah, sure; in wonderland. And all the dumb-asses who've given this 8 or more stars just gawped open-mouthed in unquestioning acceptance. No explanation; just swallow like a garbage bin.Reality ends there. It was not necessary to waste celluloid on any more hokey explanations. Just get on with the songs and the theatre.But no; it just shuffles along. Tediously, laboriously, often presented from the standpoint of a senior detective with an IQ equal to his body temperature. The general public are depicted as the sort of gormless, gullible trinkets who consider this a good movie. We learn of his imprisonment, his escape, and so on. We don't need any of it; let's just have the songs!We see the new big brother, played by an increasingly rabid John Hurt, which looks like a tongue-in-cheek homage to the 1984 movie. In a scene of unremitting confusion in a disused underground railway station, we find a train that's packed with yet more explosives. Our phantom hero has cleared the track and re-electrified it (that took him 10 years, you know). For some reason, once more unexplained, 'Big Brother' is dragged down there by his fellow authority-figures, to be murdered by the 'clot'. They then turn on him, and he proceeds to murder them all in a Tarantino-style blood bath. Though he is mortally wounded in the process.Oh-yes; and there's the inevitable pretty-sweet femme-fatale who wanders about with her mouth partly agape as if in continuous expectation of providing someone with a blow-job. She, and she alone, carries this tall, well-muscled crusader onto the train and lays him on his explosives. Providing him with a wreath of red-roses, plucked out of fresh-air (if you can find any in a disused underground station). The train is sent to Parliament, where the entire population of London, dressed in Guy Fawkes outfits - all supplied and shipped by courier at unlimited expense by our hero, have gathered to watch the big bang.And it's a good one - the best bit of the movie. And there's another £100,000 fireworks display to go with it. To a few last lines uttered by the heroine, so clichéd as to pucker any self-respecting human sphincter, the nonsense comes to a close. There's a lot more equally daft stuff but insufficient space to describe it. Choreography's nice. Production values high. Special-effects spectacular, costumes and set-pieces OK. The hero is verbose but hilarious. The heroine suitably sylph-like, dumb and pretty. If only they'd remembered to put the bloody songs in. What a show it would have been.",4,5,11,21 December 2008
