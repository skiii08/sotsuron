Hereditary," Worst movie ever
","This must be one the crappiest movie ever!!!
The high scores and +10 rewievs must be paid or by sponsored people from the company.The story is full och questions and the actor is acting so unnatural that It made me Wanna leave the cinema.One example, When she wants her daugter to follow the older brother to the party like Wtf???Go with your brother!! You follow your brother !! Listen to me follow your brother!!Like Wtf??? Why???And Why is she so mad about it? Yelling at her for No reason at all?And What was the (mystery)with all words written on the Walle here and There?I really tried give it a change but after 1hour still Nothing that kept me interested just Nothing.I forced myself throuh the movie and was hoping for it to get better but No just No.Again the actress is so irritating in all ways ot makes NO sense.One other example Why does she lie to her husband about she go to cinema?Like Wtf? What is is so strange about visit company that help you handle sorrow??And the ending?? Really??And Why did her husband start burn When she tossed it into the fire??The Book was connected to her??As i Said such a stupid crapmovie only leaves you irritaded.Dave your time and money DOMT watch!",1,0,7,29 July 2018
