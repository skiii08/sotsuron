Iron Man 3," biggest disappointment ever
",I made an IMDb account just to right this movie is the biggest disappointment ever. And the producers should be sued by all the angry fans for false advertisement. The trailer was literally the absolute form of false advertisement. The movie had nothing to do with the actual story line at all! The ending.... the middle. The beginning. Hell even the animated series of young tony is depicted more accurately than this bull s***. At least that series mandarin has the concept of the 10 rings and aspire to collect them. Hell its not even worth writing. Its an embarrassment that they even labeled it iron man 3. Shoulda been call iron s***.,1,3,7,6 August 2013
