The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Welcome to the Island of misfit toys
","I loved this movie. Throughout this movie I always felt happy-ish, but at the same time sorta sad. I think I felt connected to the main character Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Logan portrayed Charlie perfectly.All of the characters came with a background, making all of them interesting, and very different. Each character brings something new and fresh to the table, and all important to the story. The Perks of being a Wallflower takes you into the life of a freshman whose best friend had just killed himself. Already before that he had quite a nasty past. His past has affected him tremendously, and he really struggles in social situations. Needless to say, he is very nervous about his first day of high school. Eventually he makes friends with two seniors, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) who change his life.This movie would be classified as a Drama and Romance. What I like is that it isn't the type of drama that leaves you feeling depressed for the rest of the day, and the romance isn't the icky sort of romance where they are making out all the time. The romance is on a deeper level. You can see the connection between Charlie and Sam.I thought this was a really good movie, with a strong storyline and brilliant characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9,0,1,21 October 2015
Despicable Me," Dual viewing for children and adults
","This movie is enjoyable for all ages. Though a lot of the humour is aimed at children, there are many moments that you, as an adult, will find yourself laughing out loud. Despicable Me has managed to to get the balance of entertainment for children and entertainment for the parents just right!The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is incredibly funny with his dark sense of humour. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gru's character growths from a sadistic villain to a warm, loving dad. Its easy to understand why Gru is the way he is, when you see the neglect he received from from his mother as a child (one of the things that create this 3 dimensional character). His growth is the result of 3 sweet girls that he adopted ('that changed his heart'). Without these girls there would be no storyline. Gru's character shows us that no matter how bad a person is, they can always change. Despicable Me is light-hearted, enjoyable, funny, heartwarming, and even at times tear-jerking (only because I am a happy-cryer). It is possibly my favourite animation.With its range of characters -some lovable, others not-so-lovable - Despicable Me will leave you wanting more.",10,1,1,20 October 2015
