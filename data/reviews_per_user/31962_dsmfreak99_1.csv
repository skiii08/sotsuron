Mission: Impossible III," Worst of the trilogy
","If you edit out the sappy, feel good moments, you would have a movie that was a lot less annoying. Two scenes stood out the most for me: the corny wedding scene ripped off from Independence Day, and the ultra corny happy ending. I would say the story is close to the movie True Lies with some up-to-date CGI. The more I recap this movie in my mind, the more I want to take my vote down another point. =)The last action scene of the movie was the worst. Ethan's wife shocks him to death to save him from an implant in his brain, kills a couple of villains (her character works in the medical field, but for 60 seconds she takes out a couple of professional killers like she's Jason Bourne) then performs CPR on Ethan to the point of giving up, when he suddenly pops up off the floor. Didn't see that one coming. I have admit Phillip Seymore Hoffman's performance makes this movie watchable. I also enjoyed Simon Peggs small performance.",5,0,0,4 November 2006
