The Blair Witch Project," hated it
","The only thing I enjoyed about the making of this film was HOW the film was created...documentary style.The people filmed in the beginning were the only intriguing characters perhaps because they were 'real people' and their stories of the myth seemed more scary than the actual film. I absolutely detested the main character. She was annoying and unconvincing and than the crying fit did not add to her character in any way. The ending left a lot to be desired and I do not think I will see the sequel (if/when) it comes out. I would recommend this to a class that was studying the making of a documentary but it is not RL Stine, or Rob Zombie by any means.",Null,0,0,14 December 1999
