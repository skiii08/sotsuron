Ford v Ferrari," Men drive in circles
","So for all who love cars, this is your thing. When men drive in circles with fast machines. In times of climate changes it looks funny to see and hear all this loud motors. And maybe that's the best of the movie: the great sound design.Christian Bales acting is wonderful but really close to The fighter fro 2010 and director David O. Russell - which brought him an Oscar.",6,2,6,11 March 2020
The Avengers," Positively surprised
","Exciting how you can build a challenging story with many superheroes. In all of the superhero universes, I saw the Avengers last. I didn't expect much and I'm pleasantly surprised. The action sequence on the flying aircraft carrier is bombastic. Let's go to part 2.",7,0,0,21 March 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Too long, too boring
","It is difficult to continue a unique masterpiece. I think director Villeneuve did very well. He also added his own elements. However, the film fails in my eyes because of its extreme length and lack of tension.The first hour, like the original, is very slow and too boring for my taste. It starts in the second third of the film at the latest. Hardly any action, but a little more excitement and unique pictures from cameraman Deakins.All in all a much too long film. A weakness which, in combination with the calm pace of the film, has a negative effect on my taste.",6,4,8,12 March 2020
Deepwater Horizon," Thrilling movie, boring story
","I was watching the movie and was talking to my colleagues, that I'm now informed about what happened at Deepwater Horizon - a catastrophe that killed 11 people and its the biggest oil disaster in US history. So far from a point of view, based on facts :D The movie itself keeps you watching, and gives you good entertainment. at least the acting is phenomenal, for a blockbuster in this stage. The story itself is more ore less boring and cant get a clue to the audience beside: Here are the oil workers, there are the heroes. It makes me sad, because the story has so much more to offer, than just explosions. Honestly, I was not expecting such a movie. But finally Mark Wahlberg rescued everything.",7,0,1,27 December 2016
Rocketman," Slowly okay
","A movie, that cant make a push or satisfying step forward. It seems to me that there is no clue or red line in the story - after a few minuted thta movie comes out with musical scenes. Thats okay but doesnt fit into the rest for my opinion. Its not straight enough and feels like a TV movie for late night. Good but not very good.",7,1,2,29 February 2020
Knives Out," Straight old fashioned
","A little funny evening crime movie, settled in an old fashioned narration style. The interesting thing is, that Johnsons creates a mood around this simple plot, that makes this piece of movie remarkable. The cast of course makes it much more better, most of it all its Ana de Armas.",8,4,7,2 March 2020
The Irishman," Murder is not cool
","Maybe its one of those movies you must compare to others in the same genre - like Good Fellas or Casino. Because the speak so much with the same voice as The Irisman does it with the movies I habe mentioned. Scorsese did not made a masterpiece but an intense movie, which allows us to see all the fails and bad sides of the Mafia Glory we loved to see for so long. Murder is not cool - there is noting to love about. Thats what my personal message of the movie is all about - after all: no action needed",8,1,3,24 December 2019
Aquaman," Interesting hero in a stupid world
","What an interesting hero in a stupid world. In my eyes, Aquaman was a huge opportunity to create something really big - but the film was incredible and exaggerated by a thunderstorm of animations and colorful underwater world. The best thing about the whole film is the hero himself and the first 30 minutes of the film.",6,0,2,31 March 2020
Ready Player One," Not the best Spielberg, but entertaining
","You feel Steven Spielberg in this movie, but it doenst get the depth of his usual and well know movies. Visually excellent!The whole story is around gaming and an attempt to reach the younger ones. But gaming is gaming and movies are movies - to mix it it ends in Ready player one - not bad, not good. Something in between.",6,0,1,4 January 2020
"I, Tonya"," Extraordinary and heartbreaking
","I have no idea about ice skakting - but thats not important. Its about a realtionship between mother and daughter, a brutal husband and somehow injustice. Excellent actors and a great film that could have been more.",8,1,2,8 January 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Too little serious
","Nice story. But told too inconsistently and too little serious about the whole matter of racism. I can only take the story seriously because I know that it actually happened. But that alone is not a good story. The film lacks a really good moment when one understands the real seriousness of , America's racist problem at that time. It looks fake. Not to be compared with a Mississippi Burning with Willem Dafoe. But maybe you don't have to if you are looking for entertainment.",7,2,3,10 March 2020
Suicide Squad," Colorful empty
","The movie starts so interesting and colorful. Full of passion to become an amazing blockbuster. But its empty.Take tons of ideas, tons of different songs and put them together. It seems to see like a directors Childs dream came true, with unfinished endings. I miss the the intensity of Watchmen or Dark Knight. We jump from one story to another and mis the red line in too much information and less focus.About the rest: The cast is amazing, but the story doesnt take them.",6,0,0,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Love and hate it
","I love Star Wars. All my live it was inspiring me. But more of George Lucas and the lovely narration with its kind of old fashioned style that we all trust in, because we wanted it to trust in. The storytelling was marvelous.
I was happy for the last part - episode IX but I'm disappointed. Its narrated as it would be in George Lucas times, but we're not there anymore. Its weak acting, no coming of age. There are mistakes in the plot and storytelling and the ending is constructed like a baby.
But after all, as the most of us, I love to see more and more of Star Wars - maybe thats the reason why its a bit destroyed.",6,1,13,23 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An experiment that last forever
","Part four of this gigantic Avengers saga cannot really be evaluated alone. It is directly related to part three. You can put them together like two pieces of a puzzle. In my opinion, both together are much better than parts 1 and 2.I'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring. Despite the very long three-hour runtime. In addition to all the superhero films, some of which dissolve into insignificance, Avengers looks like a little masterpiece.",8,3,10,23 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," More action, more superheroes
","In terms of content, the third part feels rather void for strangers to the genre. Because all in all, compared to the first two parts, there is simply more action, more superheroes and even more aggravation towards the unforeseeable end. But it's great to see the Avengers getting more and more involved in the story from part to part. In this third part it gets serious. Because the villain is attacking the earth. Here too, new heroes are added, such as Spiderman and Doctor Strange. The technical effects in this part are extremely overwhelming and well done. Camera, sound and music result in a uniform dance. The film captivates you and sprints from one action sequence to the next. Only the final remains, and with it the last part of the Avengers.",7,0,2,22 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great Tarantino, slow story
","I like the movie. Its Tarrantino. No classic evening entertainment. But: as a fan I can say, the movie itself has some weakness in the story. There is no casual, clear story as usual. Its completely weird and just narrated as it would be realtim. There is no Boom, excapt for the end. But: loveley detailed, great characters and lovely acting.",7,0,0,23 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Its all about family
","Family and monster. You can't say so much about this movie, otherwise you kill the thrill. But what an unexpected good and quiet thriller. I love it because of its intensity right upright from the beginning. Its a sad and scary feeling that catches you. The idea of not talking and rare dialogue is marvelous.",8,2,5,6 January 2020
Ex Machina," Wonderful, movie Minimalism, Oscar Isaac a its best
","I love the movie from the beginning. The whole setting, far away in the wilderness is such an beautiful start to confront the audience with what the movie is focussing on: Artificial intelligence. You can say, that whole movie is actually divided p in just three actors. Isaac, Gleeson and Alicia Vikander (Oscar winning). The whole movie is deeply complex and cant be explained so quick but all in all: what makes us human? I rarley saw a movie which confrontate us with psychology, philosophy, language, sexuality, technology and religion in one thing.The main actor Nathan (Isaac) has created a female robot named Ava. His colleague Caleb (Gleeson) is tasked to give it a 'Turing Test' through a series of interviews to find out whether she, the robot, demonstrates true AI (artificial intelligence). What comes out in the end is just stunning and cruel at the same time.",7,4,6,7 January 2018
1917," Camera makes story
","The camera makes the story. technically brilliant. We're positioned like in a role playing game. Based on intense angels, slow moving pictures that forces the audience to watch and watch and watch, and be in the middle of the war.The story is slow narrated. You feel the war, but you never see the face of an enemy. Its lonely, quiet. The soldier with its mission. And just like this, the movie ends.",8,0,0,22 February 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A perfect opening scene
","The opening sequence alone is a highlight. How computer animation, film and action combine here is unique. Part 2 of the superhero saga continued super. Music, excitement, actors. Everything fits together perfectly. A must for the cinema.",7,0,2,21 March 2020
It Chapter Two," Okay and much too long
","The first part was mindblowing, scaring and with intense storytelling. The second prt is empty, with a lot of science fiction elements, that ruins the deep fear of pennywise. They made him stupid. There are some great moments, like the opening or the grandma scene, which we know from the trailer. All in all an okay horror movie",6,0,0,11 February 2020
Parasite," Special, but no masterpice
","So Parasite is good but certainly not a mega masterpiece. Something special, indeed, but don't expect too much. One can also interpret more than possible.In terms of cinematography its rather average. good storytelling. good acting.The movie has special moments, impacts that you dont expect. All in all, the socially critical background makes it special for me.",8,1,4,23 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Hitler as Hero
",Weird thought to place Hitler as a hero. But maybe thats make the movie interesting for the audience. No more comment.,7,1,4,1 March 2020
Sully," Interesting, flowing but a boring Eastwood
","Lets say: Both, Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood are amazing filmmakers and actors. I guess this makes the whole movie so interesting for the audience and critics. The movie itself became a simple, old fashioned and boring type of movie, that you would screen on TV later the evening. But so far, it entertains you. Not a bad word to Eastwoods old fashioned style and amazing style of filmmaking, as I love his movies, but in this just its 'just flowing' until you reach the end and ask yourself: And now?. At least for the complex background of the real events that happened around Sully. Could they return to LaGuardia or nearby Teterboro airport in New Jersey without breaking down? For those who love Tom Hanks and Eastwood I would say its a mirror with two sides: On the one hand you have great acting and directing, on the other hand you have expectations. For the last one, you will be disappointed.",6,0,1,28 December 2016
