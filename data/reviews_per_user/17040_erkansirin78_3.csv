Conquest 1453," Encouraging
","It is far beyond the current Turkish movie standards and encourages further productions. The staff seems do their best. I congratulate the director, players and all other teams.It is unfair to compare it with Hollywood history-war-action productions. Hollywood is a gigantic movie industry, dominant in the world and does not know any rival. But the topic, conquering the Istanbul, is one of the most important historical, cultural, religious and political event in the Turkish and world history. Consequently the expectations are very high and the movie is unable to meet those who anticipate to satisfy their national and religious feelings.The movie may arise ordinary Turks', still have average adherence towards their soil, roots and ancestors, national and religious emotions. They may even give a cry in some scenes. I myself observed it in theater.Certainly for the role of Sultan Mehmed Han, the director must have picked up someone else. Devrim Evin can't reflect the Great Conquerer's magnificence and his acting is poor. Ibrahim Celikkol is better than him both in shape and acting.I think they cannot give up using women the way modern west mentality use it. Their approach on this matter is a little trendy. But, I give them right because they have to consider current audience demand for sake of commercial profit. The movie which deprived of love, attractive women and love scene has no much chance in box-office, especially in Turkey. Even so, I cannot help myself wishing their attachment to historical realities as Cary Fukunaga did in his Jane Eyre.One of the absurd scene that draw my attention was Ulubatli Hasan's suppress rebellion attempt. He says to some of rebels: 'Dogs! You have been eating our Sultan's bread' and other was in the Ak Shemseddin's advise. He says to the Mehmed II: 'Strong winds blow in highs'. These two scene were very funny. There is so much to review but i don't have too much time to write.Finally, as a Turkish production, the movie is fine. I think it is one of the initials which hearten its predecessor. I believe Turkish movie industry will succeed more quality productions in a few decades. Turks have just begun which Hollywood and others did many years ago.",8,14,37,4 March 2012
Django Unchained," Bloody
","There are plenty of blood and killing. People are killed merely for nothing. Once a creature is hit, it flies in the air and all blood (maybe more than a normal human being and creature can have) blow out. Everywhere are full of purposeless people. For sake of catching an outlaw gang and saving a slave wife almost a hundred people have been killed. Killing people is like drinking water. Then we surprise hearing in press how possibly could a child obtain a gun, raid school and kill everyone and his brother. If you search for slightest humanity, you will return empty-handed. This Quentin Tarantino is crazy man. He always tries to surprise audience. He always suddenly kills my favorite character Vincent in Pulp Fiction and Dr. Schultz in here. I thought Dr. Schultz also was gonna meet happy ending but he got himself killed for nothing. A wise and smart man should not done such a stupid and silly move. He said: 'I am sorry! I couldn't resist'. Who knows maybe he is sick. Finally it is hard for me to understand which motives lie beneath to kill so much people. At the end of movie our charismatic negro saved his wife and they rode on towards mysterious future leaving back hundred dead. Maybe they even dare to hope to be happy. We'd better ask Tarantino :) how about...?",6,0,3,21 May 2013
The Proposal," Funny Romance
","I missed out Proposal in the theater. A friend made me realized and recommended it while having nice dinner. Movie starts at classical New York working office and continues Alaska's outstanding nature and ends with happy ending in New York. I re-discovered that some feelings need some adventures and time in different context to show up. Knowing somebody more closely requires spending some time together. If Andrew and Margaret they had not had Alaska trip, their hidden feeling each other would have never sprouted and come to light, especially someone like Margaret who suppresses her feelings. I appreciate Andrew's generosity for sake of his friendship, mixed with subordinate obedience, then love, towards Margaret. Fictitious marriage ignited real love. I wonder what this will spark. Thanks again :)",8,0,0,29 April 2017
