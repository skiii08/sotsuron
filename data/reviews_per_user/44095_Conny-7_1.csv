Requiem for a Dream," Bleak, disturbing but ultimately worth seeing!
","This is certainly the best film I have seen about drugs and one of the best films I have ever seen.Especially the last 15 minutes will stay with me for a long time...The film is beautifully made and although it left me emotionally drained I was glad I saw it.Ellen Burstyn is absolutely great as Sara Goldfarb and she should have got an Oscar for her great performance.Although it is bleak and disturbing, this film goes straight to the heart and I am glad that there are still directors like Darren Aronofksy who give us great films without tons of sugar and 'feel good factor'. Highly recommended - miss it at your own peril!",Null,0,0,6 April 2001
