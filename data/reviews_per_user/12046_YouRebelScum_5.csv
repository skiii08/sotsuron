Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A shallow exercise in sensationalism
","Well, I didn't much like the first one, finding it vulgar and tasteless, so one can't really be surprised that I didn't like the second one. To be fair, however,Tarantino has made a fair go at adding story and character to his revenge saga, but it's ultimately to little effect. He performs any number of post-modern stylistic pirouettes, sly cultural references, witty asides and cinematic homages, but the end result - for this reviewer at least - was to shrug and say: 'So what?'",Null,0,1,17 May 2004
LÃ©on: The Professional," Depraved, perverted, sick and manipulative
","I have to say I found this movie so offensive I stopped watching it after about half an hour. It's beyond just violent, it's pornographically, sickeningly, gloatingly violent, and the victims aren't bad guys but naked women and kids. The jarring discontinuity between the excrutiatingly graphic murder of her family andMathilda's lack of emotional response is especially disturbing.There is a line of good taste which even action movies shouldn't cross and, for me, this one - like Face/Off - crosses it. Women and children can be 'in peril' but shouldn't  be killed, especially not with the kind of gleeful sadistic intensity shown here. If you want to make a movie where women and children are goingto be the victims, then for me it's a different class of movie, not an action thriller. It goes without saying that the director's attribution of sexual characteristics to a 12-year old child - and the way he deliberately perverts the friendship between Leon and Mathilda in a sexual way - is deeply sick and utterly reprehensible. Disgusting.",1,32,132,28 May 2004
Spirited Away," One of the most extraordinary animated features ever made
","This is one movie that I really must insist that you go and see.
Beautifully animated, very funny and consistently surprising, it is -along with the brilliant Belleville Rendevous - the best animatedfeature of the year. I also really valued the fact that it comes from acompletely different cultural sensibility from the U.S, whichproduces the majority of animated films we see in the U.K.Everything - its plot arc, character development, visual style, pacingand the characters' value system - is different, sometimes a little,sometimes a lot. I loved the mutliplicity of weird and wonderful characters that theprotagonist Chihiro encounters and the alternative universe thatthey inhabit. Like Belleville Rendevous, there's some scenes inthis film that simply leave you aghast at their strangeness, beautyor inventiveness. Definitely see this film at the cinema as soon asyou can. P.S DON'T be put off by the fact that it's being distributed by the evilmega-corporation Disney. This film's a dragon, not a mouse.",10,2,3,22 September 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," Up there with The Godfather and The Conversation
","This is a superb piece of 70s cinema, and there's loads I couldwrite about it, from Pacino's firecracker intensity contrasting withCazale's tombstone aggression, or the brilliant combination of Dede Allen's editing and Victor Kemper's antsy, claustrophobiccamerawork. Or I could just say that, of all Sidney Lumet'sexceptional run of 70s films - Serpico, The Offence, Network, TheAnderson Tapes - this is the best. Or I could say you simply haveto see it, which is probably the best advice. So see it.NOW!",10,2,3,29 September 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Unusual, inventive and utterly captivating
","Caught this last night and was hugely impressed. French videodirector Gondry brings Kaufman's typically unusual and inventivescript to life using a dazzling array of visual techniques, clever setsand artfully employed special effects. At its heart it's a downbeatlove story between shy introvert Joel (Carrey) and lovely butshallow Clementine (Winslet). When Clemmie leaves him after anargument, Joel learns that she's had every memory of theirrelationship erased using a revolutionary new process. Deeplyhurt he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik(Tom Wilkinson) and demands to undergo the same procedure.However, as Mierzwaik and his oddball team, Stan (Ruffalo), Mary(Dunst) and Patrick (Wood) begin erasing all traces of Clemmiefrom his mind, Joel suddenly decides he doesn't want to forget herafter all...This is really an exceptional piece of work, intelligent, funny andconsistently surprising. While the screenplay centers on therelationship between Joel and Clemmie, Kaufman does anadmirable job of giving each of the secondary characters depthand balancing the action between Joel's desparate fight inside hisown head and the expanding drama taking place outside.
Mention must be made of the extraordinary and at times disturbingimagery employed during the latter half of the film, as Joel's fight tosave memories of Clemmie. This film is the best example I've everseen of how special effects can be used to enhance and deepenthe story rather than distract from it. Cornering his 'remembered'Clemmie in a bookshop Joel struggles to convince her to comewith him - symbolically rescuing his memory of her from theerasing process - and as they argue the covers of all the booksaround them become blank. Later, chasing her through a beachhouse they visited when they first met, walls and ceilings dissolvearound them and the sea rushes around their feet. Unforgettable.Performances are uniformly excellent. Again, although the dramacenters mainly on Winslet and Carrey's characters, it's a testamentto the integrity of the screenplay and the quality of the acting thatthe film feels more like an ensemble piece. I had the sense thateveryone working on this film knew it was special and loved doingit.Overall, this is the most exciting new film I've seen since 'FightClub'. Along with 'Zatoichi' it's my pick for film of the year. See it!",10,0,1,11 May 2004
