The Rock," Connery and Cage save the world
","I was a little surprised at how ridiculous 'The rock' is. It's about a group of rebellious marines, led by Ed Harris, who take Alcatraz by force and then threaten to fire a massively lethal gas upon the population unless they get one million dollar each as a compensation for the oblivion that they feel the American government has condemned all killed military to. Sean Connery is a member of the British Intelligence who is still held in prison, and was the only person to ever manage to escape from Alcatraz; and Nicolas Cage is a FBI chemical expert. They both end up being teamed up to save the world.The whole premise, at least the way it is purported here, is completely ridiculous, and things are made worse by Michael Bay's direction, because he films the whole thing in his usual video clip style. I also found Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage to be a very unlikely hero duo -Connery's role perhaps a little parody of his 007 impersonation? There also aren't real serious villains, those that you love to hate until the heroes of the show take care of them; or any mind-blowing action.All in all, 'The rock' is, at best, one more action flick that you can watch and immediately hopefully forget.",Null,1,3,8 April 2010
Monster," Definitely worth seeing
","'Monster' is, overall, one of the saddest films ever, and one which doesn't step back at the view of the darkest side of existence: the fact that there are people who will lead their entire life without one single break, without any long-lasting achievements, success, or happiness. The title suits the story very well -there are many possible interpretations, but I personally like to read it as the description of what Aileen Wuornos's life is: a monster. There's nothing remotely nice in this story about her, and when she seems to have accomplished something, there's this feeling of impending doom -we know that it isn't meant to last long. The story is told by Aileen herself, in a very sarcastic and cynical tone, and she proves how adagios like 'all you need is love and self-confidence' are just nice words, empty formulas with no real ground.The film offers a handful of good messages. For example, I find it very interesting that it doesn't chalk all that misery up to life's natural lack of any justice, so that Aileen doesn't appear as just a victim of circumstances, as she says in one moment of the film; instead, the film shows that Aileen often has the option to act one way or the other, and she makes a decision. It could have been different, she could have picked the other option, but she knows what she is doing and she gives many reasons why she's doing so. The film sympathizes with her, but doesn't pity her; it just shows her actions and the motives that she feels are valid. It doesn't justify her. The viewer is left to reach his/her own conclusions. I find this one great achievement of the film, and one that makes a big difference between this film and many dramas that wallow in pity and justification of the character's deeds.Like many have said, both Charlize Theron's and Christina Ricci's performance are flawless. I feel that Theron really deserved the Oscar. Ricci is great too, and this should be even more of note since she isn't given a lot of space to develop the character of Selby, Aileen's lover.The film has its flaws, but it still is a rather impressive document, and one that certainly gives some food for thought.",Null,5,5,20 July 2006
Blade II," Fun to see
","A -surprisingly, at least for me, given the fact that I'm not into fantasy or comic adaptations, and that I'm definitely prejudiced against sequels- enjoyable action and sci-fi movie that includes new generation vampires and vampires with mutations.I haven't seen the original film, nor the third part, so I can't assess this film as a part of a trilogy. It just works alone, and I think that's a good achievement. If you're immune to the ick factor, or plain enjoy it (there's plenty of that in 'Blade 2' -that autopsy sequence!) and to some actors' narrow range of facial and vocal expressions, and if you make a blind eye to painfully stereotyped characters and predictable turns of the plot (but aren't they supposed to exist in a film like this?), and you're a fan of action and fight scenes, you'll probably enjoy this. The video-clip looks get a bit old, but oh well. An entertaining film, all in all.",Null,0,1,22 July 2006
The Orphanage," Good haunted house story, narrated with great style
","A woman named Laura has returned, with her husband and child, Simon, to the house that was her home, an orphanage, when she was a little girl. She has restored it to be their home and a residence for disabled children. Her son, Simon, has an exuberant imagination and an unquenchable curiosity, and he has made his invisible friends a household presence for his parents. At their new, beautiful though isolated house, the kid seems to have found more invisible friends... or are they? Such is the starting point of 'El orfanato', the new gem produced by Spanish cinema and Guillermo del Toro. It is categorized under the horror label, but, although it is horror, it is also so much more -it allows the viewer to enjoy an almost perfect ghost story, with the added leitmotiv of a superimposed story of a mother who would do anything for her child, led by an unconditional love. The story has it all: good scares, a creepy atmosphere, and great acting by the leading actors, with Belen Rueda shining at her best here. As far as the scary parts go, I can say that this movie has some of the scariest scenes I've seen in a long time, and that it will please fans of psychological and atmospheric horror rather than gore-lovers.The ending is very satisfying -although I personally object to the kind of brief epilogue at the very end, which was, in my opinion, not only unnecessary but also demeaning of the value of the film- and many sides of the story will remain open to interpretation, although one reading is suggested by the movie, but if you are looking for a movie that will stick with you and make you look for answers, without necessarily being an impossible puzzle, this is a safe bet.All in all, 'El orfanato' doesn't tell anything very new or original, it doesn't really break any new grounds as far as the story goes, but its contribution is to tell it all with exquisite style and great manners, so that it tells you a good story in a superior way than other movies of the same subgenre.",Null,1,3,17 August 2008
American History X," Excellent despite the few flaws
","This is one of the best movies about hate that I've ever seen. It's about how hate can arise in any social and cultural background, but especially among frustrated people, and how it can condemn people to isolation, loneliness and self-destruction.The movie is excellent, and is enhanced by great acting; Norton and Furlong are simply extraordinary. The physical violence shown is not as important to the message as the violence which remains in pseudo-ideologies born from irrationality and aim for power and domination above the rest, all of which are portrayed as a result of the loss of hope and generosity.
But the best of all is, in my opinion, the final message, which is morally refreshing, even if I felt Derek's moral recovery  was a little too idillic and unbelievable; I mean, it comes on through his friendship with a black man at jail. I don't believe things happen that way actually when someone's so fanatic.  Anyway, the film is great.",Null,0,0,6 October 1999
Bridesmaids," A great choice for all girls who aren't necessarily into chick flicks
","Kristen Wiig is the kind of actor who doesn't let her ego get in between her and her character. Which means that, in 'Bridesmaids', she is so good because she isn't afraid of laughing at herself or, to better put it, at her character, Annie Walker, a 30-something who is currently failing at the most important sides of her life and who is asked by Lillian, her lifelong best friend, to be her bridesmaid. Annie is delighted, but will soon have to face hard competition from Lillian's new friend and contender to the best friend title, classy and beautiful Helen.The whole movie is a series of misadventures starring Annie, who manages to ruin every step of Lillian's wedding arrangements, as well as her own living arrangements and her barely extant love life. Of course, everything will end up nicely and happily for everyone involved.Though I'm not precisely a fan of the Apatow factory's kind of gross humor style -and this is also quite present in 'Bridesmaids'-, I enjoyed this movie, and I think it stands out, because it works well on many different levels. If, like me, you don't much appreciate gross, in-your-face jokes involving natural bodily functions, for example, you can still enjoy 'Bridesmaids' because, for instance, it makes fun of the many clich√©s that Hollywood rom-coms have been pushing down our throats (and into our brains) for decades; it also makes fun of the stereotypical chick-flick heroine (Annie is cute in a girl-next-door fashion, sweet, and has her own style, but she is approachable and she is definitely quite real; she is awkward and acts silly or downright stupid sometimes, which we all do) and of the real things that real men and women do in real life. It also has good comedy dialogue and a nice message at the end -it's not a mere sequence of funny sketches. The characters are real and there is a story behind the whole thing.Besides, the whole cast is great and you can tell everyone loved being in this movie. For me personally, it was especially delightful to see Rose Byrne in her role.My score: 8 stars out of 10.",Null,1,3,15 September 2012
The Number 23," 23: 'A story of Obsession'
","This movie got terrible, terrible reviews, at least where I live, and it all made me even more intrigued to watch it than I would be over any other thriller/mystery movie. After watching it, I am rating it 7/10, although I have to admit it is quite flawed, but in a very interesting, almost fascinating way.Walter Sparrow is a regular family man, until his wife presents him with a mysterious novel written by one Topsy Kretts, which is entitled 'The number 23: a story of obsession'. Sparrow becomes effectively obsessed with the story told in it: apparently an autobiography of some mystery person who narrates his childhood, how he became a detective, and the onset and further consequences of his obsession with number 23, which he claims is 'persecuting' him. Sparrow's life becomes dominated by his new obsession.The theme about the doom brought about by number 23 is not as well done as I'd hoped for, which makes it -to me- become an uninteresting anecdote or background motive. The protagonist actually suffers from this obsession and is afraid of the number, somehow, but the movie never succeeds at making us a participant of this feeling of impending doom. (In fact, the movie is quite funny at times.) For me, this is a major flaw in the movie.Then, it becomes something entirely different: a mysterious film, certainly, where we can follow the protagonist in his torment and his quest to get rid of it, in which he tries different possible solutions while he tries to figure out the identity of the mysterious writer. The movie can be watched as a kind of drama with supernatural or mysterious elements, and I believe that if you watch it from this perspective, you're more likely to enjoy it and find worthwhile qualities in it. Ultimately, I feel that number 23 and its mystical story are the proverbial McGuffin asking us to focus on the character of Walter Sparrow and his story, although this purpose is probably not made clear enough, and the movie seems so flawed because of that.There are more reasons that make this movie better than average, and they are, first, Jim Carrey's good performance; second, the Lynch-esque, dream-like parts; and, finally, how pretty the film is to look at, with an awesome use of color.",Null,0,1,19 August 2011
The Happening," This is a good movie, don't listen to the haters
","That M. Night Shyamalan is perhaps the most hated and slammed film-maker of the present day is a fact beyond any debate. I have to admit that I was very disappointed at the movies he made after 'The sixth sense', and that I didn't like any of them. However, I can't understand why so many critics and anonymous viewers of all kinds seem to have this negative prejudice against him. Perhaps it's because he doesn't send out an especially likable vibe, and because his former work sometimes came across as too pretentious. It's true that with every one of his movies, he always tries to deliver some deeper message and that he constructs his movies as parables, with the focus usually set on some universal situation or crisis rather than on the more particular conflicts that most dramas, thrillers or mysteries have us accustomed to. I can't say I think he's been very successful at delivering these messages in a viewer-friendly, non-pretentious way, but I respect the fact that he has never given up on his personal view of movie-making, and that he stays true to himself, much critic and -in my opinion, unjustified and too harsh- bashing this might have fostered. Having said this, like I stated at the beginning, I think his career has been objectively quite erratic.Well, having said that, I think that 'The happening' is, simply put, a good and entertaining movie. I have to admit I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, precisely because I regrettably chose to listen to all the many holier-than-thou critics who state their opinions as scientific fact, and also, dare I say it, to my own prejudice. I was proved wrong, and I am happy to say that I'm now looking forward to watching Shyamalan's next movies.The movie is not perfect by any means, but it is thoroughly enjoyable, and it's based on a basic idea and a script that are just as smart as anything reasonably smart that you get to see on the big screen any of these days. The acting is also good. I honestly believe that, had this movie been made by any other household name or 'promising' new director, it wouldn't have been slammed as relentlessly and sometimes scornfully as it did. This movie isn't at all the disaster that it has been described as by many critics. You might like it or not, but I would recommend watching it if you like dramas with a supernatural element, decent character development, and thrillers.Another thing that I enjoyed about 'The happening' is the modesty and, might I add, the lack of self-consciousness from which it was made. Especially at some sequences (and you will know which ones they are), you can tell that Shyamalan was probably not taking himself all that seriously, and that he was perhaps even making fun of the reputation that he's earned throughout most of his career, as a very intellectual, serious, and sometimes cold movie-maker. The movie has some tongue-in-cheek bits that I appreciated very much.",Null,2,5,16 April 2009
The Godfather: Part III," Not bad, but definitely not good either
","I have mixed feelings about 'The Godfather III'. While I reckon it's a well-done film, with forceful performances by almost all of the cast -Al Pacino is always a good actor, although he certainly overacts quite a few times here; for me, the supporting actors, with the exception of Sophia Coppola, were the best part- and a good directing job, if looked at as what it is, the finale of the Godfather trilogy, I have to say that it is a completely unnecessary film, and that the saga would have been much better off if it had ended with the second movie.My main problem with this movie is that it practically denies all that we had learned about the character of Michael Corleone, which this movie is entirely about. We find him aging and declining, together with his empire, and the turn that he takes at a point in the film, and from then onwards, is just out of character.However, the film is flawed even if we put aside the fact that it should be coherent with the previous two 'Godfather' installments. For example, I feel that Coppola was trying too hard to keep up with the previous two movies, and it shows -he tries to replace actual interesting content and a well devised plot with sequences that are perhaps spectacular and entertaining, but oftentimes too long and not always necessary -see, for example, the never-ending opera sequence toward the end. In other words, 'The Godfather III' is too packed with artifice and directorial tricks where there should have been more substance and a really interesting, well-woven story to tell.As to the story itself, while it does not lack interest, it is too full of subplots that are tackled on but left unfinished, and aren't always pertinent, or don't add any interest or meaning to the whole film. This makes the movie sometimes too messy and even boring.All in all, it is a movie that Godfather fans will probably enjoy for what it's worth, but definitely nothing too special.",Null,0,1,26 March 2009
The Departed," Nice film, with some inconsistencies
","'The departed', a Martin Scorsese movie that has been awarded with 4 Oscars, among others, is a highly entertaining movie with excellent acting, especially by Leonardo Di Caprio, in my opinion.Now, if it hadn't been Scorsese, would this movie have gotten all the praise and awards that it has? I doubt it.Let's go to the plot outline first. It focuses on two characters, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Both are new police officers. Sullivan has been patronized, since his childhood, by big mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and now that he's a cop, he still works for him undercover. Costigan is recruited by Capt. Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) to become his undercover man in Costello's gang. What ensues is the narration of how each of them gets around under their circumstances, and how both Costello and Queenan begin to suspect there's a spy on their side, but they don't know who it is.I found the central part of the movie the most enjoyable and coherent. The introduction was exhaustive, maybe too exhaustive. The ending was very good too. But, like I said, it's the story details and episodes that make the best part of the movie. I especially appreciated how Costigan's side of the story is told, and I found his character much better developed than that of Sullivan.I found nothing very wrong about 'The departed', but I was bothered by some inconsistencies along the way, especially one, which kind of downgraded the movie a little for me. Again, probably, if this hadn't been such a generally applauded film, it wouldn't have mattered... or maybe it would.Overall, a good thriller, but I didn't find any particularly deep content to it, nor anything that hasn't been said a million times before in this kind of movie. Enjoyable, but vastly overrated.",Null,1,2,30 August 2007
30 Days of Night," The best part of the movie is the ending credits
","I'm giving this movie two stars out of ten, for two reasons: one, the premise was good, and a good movie could have been made out of it -definitely, not the case here. And two, the ending credits, which were actually much creepier and more suggestive than all the movie in its entirety.It would be long and pointless to note all that is completely wrong in '30 days of night'. To name a few reasons not to watch this piece of nonsense, let's say it's boring, pretentious -especially in the depiction of the 'creatures', for they aren't really vampires, more on that later-, packed with bad, bad acting; completely devoid of any tension or atmosphere; absolutely not scary (it doesn't even have that couple of predictable yet satisfying scares that even the cheapest horror movies offer); and laughable in too many a scene.The story makes no sense at all. We are never told a story; rather, we are witnesses to a number of sequences that are closer to action than to what a vampire movie should be. Another big problem with this movie is its complete lack of pace or of build-up: we never feel that we are watching a group of humans trying to survive a vampire attack for 30 days of night, with all the psychological content and depth that that would imply; the passing of time is marked by such a simple device as telling the viewer that it is 'Day 1', 'Day 18' or whatever. The characters never look or really act any different on day 18 than they do at the beginning. We never get the feeling that more than one or two days have passed. All the characters are barely sketched, they are interchangeable and we never feel, nor care about their plight.If all of that weren't enough, this movie throws all of the cinematic and popular vampiric mythology out of the window. The creatures that raid the little Alaskan village are a mix of zombies and ghouls, and they are ugly rather than scary. In fact, it wouldn't be unreasonable to watch it as if the creatures were actually regular wrongdoers or human bad guys instead of monsters.Those are only a few of the many flaws about '30 days of night', but I believe they are enough to put anyone off watching it... indefinitely.",Null,1,3,21 March 2009
Sherlock Holmes," A+ action, F- mystery
","'Sherlock Holmes' is a nice entertainment movie, if the action+comedy+witty jokes sprinkled around+bits of romance mix is your choice. It is a funny little revision of the classic detective and the whole galaxy of characters around him: Watson, Lestrade, and so on. Holmes is shown here as an athletic and street-smart action hero, but also as a surprisingly erudite person who happens to have the exact piece of information, obscure as it may be, exactly when it's needed (but, on the other hand, that's what we expect from this character in a movie like this!).The movie is best in the numerous action sequences, in those where Holmes boasts his uncanny deductive gifts and in the dialogues between Holmes and Watson, where their homoerotic chemistry shines in all its glory (another very good point about the movie). Rachel McAdams is the weakest character in the whole movie as Holmes's old flame and female counterpart, although the movie would have been better off without the romantic interest between them, for the reasons mentioned above. Also, the main characters -except for Irene Adler (McAdams)- are quite strong, and well-written.Where the movie seriously lacks is the mystery part. I absolutely expected some of that, come on, it's Sherlock Holmes! But the suspense-mystery-guessing part is completely missing from this otherwise efficient combo. There is little for the public to guess, and the little bit that is present will only fool the viewers with sparse viewing experience in this genre. If you, like me, went to watch this hoping for some intelligent twist, and a solution that Conan Doyle himself would have envied, then you will be seriously disappointed.My score is 5/10.",Null,0,0,21 August 2011
