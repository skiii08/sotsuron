3:10 to Yuma," As the Crowe Flies
","I just saw the pre-screening of this movie and I could not wait to get out of the theater. I don't know where to start on how bad this film was. I can't imagine the other comments giving it such high stars unless they're as lamebrain as this movie was. I guess perhaps from a cinema field of work, this movie could be viewed as fine performances, but they certainly were wasted. I mused that even Crowe had a hard time packing away his paycheck with the delivery of some lame lines as well as receiving same. The storyline, as in the original, is sound, but what was done in this one, the industry should be ashamed. I lost count of how many people were killed and how many guns (endless supply of bullets) were around. In one scene, they're traversing through non-friendly Indian country to take a short cut, and maybe my brain drifted, but I didn't see any Indians ... just gunfire. At that point in the movie I was actually hoping to see the Indians and finish everyone off! I think what disturbed me the most about this movie was how evil Crowe's character was, but yet they added a twist to glamorize him and his horse instead of the hero. This movie was, also, very long. The killing scenes were even too much for my friend sitting next to me and both of us turned away ... which I would say here to turn away from this movie and keep your money in your wallet. Lionsgate, shame on you for this sicko, bad-taste movie and whip it out to the public as a Western. Ten thumbs down on this one.",1,21,46,5 September 2007
The Longest Yard," Punt Hut Hut Hut
","Just how many movies having prison guards and prisoners battle it out with some sport like football will Mollywood continue to generate? Sandler had a few good spots in this movie, but not enough for me to stop waiting for it to end. At least we were spared having the hackneyed scenes of the guards giving nonstop brutal beatings to Sandler, but is that the only highlight? Even though I'm not a big fan of Chris Rock, he did more for this movie than Sandler. I think Anthony Hopkins helped Rock with his acting since I have observed definite improvement and have begun to like him more as an actor. I suspect that this movie was used by Sandler to begin a bridge into more serious non-comedian roles, which may be his goal at the cost of viewers' expectations.I suspect this movie appealed more to the male population or sports fans (or kids with little on the ball). For me this was a punt into a dreary hut that I was praying would get torched. Once again, Sandler needs to come about with being more selective in his roles and move away from these associative sportsy types of flicks that had given him his initial big movie fame. Happy Gilmore was great and very funny, but football is a sport that I am hard pressed to locate a comedy mentality. Comedy attempts in this movie was rather forced.Summarily, if you like Sandler, Rock, prisons, prison posturing, a hackneyed script, and football you'll like this movie. If not, and you still watch this movie at least try not to have any general to medium expectations.",2,0,0,22 September 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not Another Gay Blade
","I didn't much care for the second Pirates movie and this third one cinched it further for me. I didn't really understand the second movie all that well and definitely was lost in this third one. The impression I was left with after viewing this movie aside from exhaustion of waiting for it to end was that this had to have been a spoof movie ... one example is a showdown on the beach minus Clint Eastwood and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly music. The other impression was fraught with most every pirate in the movie was gay, including Jack Sparrow. I got very weary of watching Johnny Depp prance around like a fruit, which am glad I was spared most of this gayness in the second movie, but it had enough to wear me down.To me, the 2nd and 3rd movies should have been put into one movie, but with all the visual padding they sold it down the pipe to the public. I really feel badly for parents taking their kids to see this since it won't make much sense to them, but kids like visuals so I suppose it will fly. However, due to how very, very, very long the movie is, I doubt young kids will sit comfortably in the theaters.At least George Hamilton did a great classic in The Gay Blade with a good script, but Pirates 3 definitely is an arduous one-time viewing, heavily touted movie and not another Gay Blade.",1,2,5,19 June 2007
Stardust," Very Imaginative Fantasy Film
","I went to the pre-screening of Stardust last night and am very glad I did. Aside from the movie, the offer of free Stone Cold ice cream and a free massage, plus raffle tickets for the book, and then free posters were over the top. Unfortunately, they didn't have many posters. Everyone got a card with a peel-off, silver stick-on star on it as an additional promotional for the movie.No need to really comment on the storyline since others here already have, but it was a wonderfully fun story to follow. It was incredibly detailed and imaginative ... so much so that there isn't another movie out there that can compare (as some already have done). This movie was so uniquely different it made it a pleasure to view. There is various tidbits of humor interlaced within this movie that are so well executed that they are an additional bonus detail. Someone I spoke to last night said the author of the book detests taking baths and hasn't bathed in years. He told me, too, that the author has other books with movie deals in the fire, so I am looking forward to more. There is a scene in the movie of one of the princes' in a bathtub (won't tell the details), but suspect this was the film-maker's symbolic tribute to the author done in a most clever way. There was a lot of attention to detail in this movie I was astounded.It was evident as I left the theater that there wasn't anyone who didn't like the movie.I am somewhat biased because I love fantasy films ... if they are well done, and this one was! If you like fantasy films with a good story and one that goes out of their way to attention to details, you'll fully enjoy this movie.",10,4,8,10 August 2007
Black Snake Moan," An Story with Depth
","Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image(s) it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me (or to my friends). But, I rented and watched it and was truly amazed.I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something I'd want young children to watch (and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway).I enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad. The acting done ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, I was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting. Same thing with the story ... may seem far-fetched somewhat, but it was done so very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well-defined.I found much depth in this movie with the character's involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be commended on a perfect fit/result. After viewing this movie, I had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like I did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched it. They, too, were quite surprised at how good it was. It is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off. I can see now how the art applies, but I'd not heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales/rentals.These characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the 'feel' for each. I felt I could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.",10,3,6,15 July 2007
