The Rock," Decent, but nothing special
","Since 'The Rock' is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, you pretty much know what to expect: lots of action, explosions, chases, one-liners, cheesy dialog, sentimental rubbish, and plot holes. The question is: do the good things (the action and the one-liners) outweigh the bad. In some movies like 'Crimson Tide' they certainly do. In others, like 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbor', they clearly don't. I'd say 'The Rock' falls somewhere in the middle. It does some things right, some things wrong, and ends up being watchable, although not really special.First, the good things. The acting is generally above par, even though Nicolas Cage isn't very convincing. Ed Harris and Sean Connery makes up for that though. Secondly, the plot is fairly believable (for a mindless action movie that is) and even though there is again a lot of scientific nonsense, the movie doesn't cross the line into ridiculousness too much. One of the really nice touches is that the 'bad guy' (Harris) is actually a fairly decent guy instead of the usual crazed maniac. The problem was that I cared more for the bad guy than for Cage's dull character or Sean Connery on autopilot. The one-liners could have used some serious work too. Oh well, at least the action is generally quite good. 
'The Rock' really screws up when it tries to add some depth, though. This movie would have worked as a mindless action movie, but instead (probably to please a larger audience) all kinds of romantic/family sub plots had to be added. These plots are all quite unbelievable and boring as hell. Also, the movie gets way too sentimental at times, for example in the totally unnecessary and very unbelievable scene in which an entire SWAT team gets slaughtered by the bad guys. If all the sentimental sub plots would have been dropped and the movie would have been shortened by thirty minutes, it would have been great. As it is now, it's a mildly entertaining movie with some good action and a couple of nice touches, but also with way too much sentimental scenes that don't go anywhere. ** out of **** stars",6,1,2,18 February 2004
The King's Speech," Mission accomplished: maximum number of Oscar acquired
","Two years after the decent but unremarkable 'Slumdog Millionaire' got an Oscar, and a year after the even more unremarkable 'The Hurt Locker' also undeservedly received the coveted statue, the Academy performs an even worse atrocity by denying The Social Network and Black Swan (among others) the best picture award, instead opting for 'The King's Speech', a movie so obviously engineered to win a lot of Oscars that it hurts.Of course, this is not a BAD movie. It is just that every aspect of it is directed at raking in as much Oscars as possible: an 'inspiring' story, based on 'a true story', about an underdog who overcomes his difficulties and comes out triumphantly, all set to appropriate and beautiful classical music.Granted, it's an expertly made movie. The acting by Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter is first-class and the cinematography is beautiful.Unfortunately, a story about a man overcoming his stuttering is about as boring as it sounds, and the totally risk-less direction doesn't help things either. Historical accuracy is thrown out of the window in favor of creating sympathy and the result is a movie that lacks any kind of real drama or conflict. Instead it just moves along a predictable course in which the 'protagonist' overcomes predicable problems (childhood trauma, anyone) and achieves a predictable triumph.Along the way, it IS good for an occasional smile, a cozy warm feeling, and a little bit of historical insight. But inspiring cinema, this is not. Rather, it's an over-engineered piece aimed at pleasing the crowd in general and the academy in particular. It's not surprising it works, but it doesn't make the movie by itself any good",6,19,32,22 April 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A two-hour plus episode of 'Kung Fu'
","Seriously, I don't get why the 'Kill Bill' movies are held in such high regard. I loved the first three Tarantino movies and thought 'Kill Bill Vol 1' was OK. 'Volume 2', however, is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen recently.'Kill Bill 2' continues the (paper-thin) plot of the first movie, but otherwise it's almost completely different. There is almost no action, much less eye candy (part 1 was 'style over substance', while this one has neither substance NOR style), and a lot more talking. Normally, you'd say that a Tarantino movie with tons of dialog would be a good thing, right? In this case, however, I found the dialogs to be fairly boring. There are still a couple of amusing parts, but for the most part it's random chit-chat between rather dull characters you don't care about and don't relate to.For all it's differences, there's also something that both Kill Bill movies have in common: they're both way too long. In part one, the violence got boring long before the end, and in this movie all the talking becomes boring even faster. Face it, a very simple and predictable revenge story just isn't enough to fill four hours of movie, but Tarantino over-indulges himself in way too many things that he thinks are cool or clever, whereas mostly they're just lame or silly. I have to admit that Kill Bill 2 does a couple of things right, though. The flashback about the martial arts training by an ancient Chinese master is entertaining, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver is marvelous. I also think that David Carradine does a wonderful job of playing Bill. But those are only a couple of bright spots in a sea of dull dialog and unnecessary scenes.In the end, 'Kill Bill Vol 2' is a two-hour plus episode of the old TV series 'Kung Fu': it's about martial arts, there are flashbacks, and there's a lot of talking and very little action. If you're into old Kung Fu movies, chances are that you'll still love this one. But for those who actually prefer an interesting story and characters over a lot of supposedly cool fluff, 'Kill Bill Vol 2' is best described as 'fairly boring'.**1/2 out of ***** stars",6,1,4,28 December 2004
The Incredible Hulk," The incredi-bore Hulk
","OK let me get this straight, I absolutely hate the 'Hulk' movie by Ang Lee. It was slow, melodramatic, poorly acted, and silly looking. It's no surprise that the studios decided to forget the first Hulk movie ever happened. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have learned from their errors, because after five years of waiting we get another Hulk movie that is almost as slow, melodramatic, poorly acted, and silly looking as the other one.The one thing that is fairly decent is the action itself. It's by no means great, there are a lot of anti-climaxes and it's not very suspenseful to see nearly-invincible heroes in action, but it does have its moments.Sadly, there isn't all that much action though, which would not be such a big problem if there was something else in lieu of the action. Whereas a similar movie like Iron Man had fun characters, a lot of humor, and a serviceable story, 'The Incredible Hulk' has, well, nothing.Seriously, this movie is virtually plot less. Hulk fights, hulk escapes, hulk gets found again, hulk fights. Rinse and repeat. The editing is all over the place, whole chunks of the movie seem to have gone missing, resulting in sloppiness like the Hulk being in Rio one moment, and thousands of miles away in Nicaragua the next. It's almost like they didn't have a script due to the screen writer's strike and just made something up on the spot, then added dramatic music to every scene to cover up the fact that nothing actually happens.The actors are doing their best I suppose, but even Edward Norton cannot save the horribly dry and clich√© dialog. The characters are all wooden, and miss any kind of motivation. Why on earth did the military guy, Blonksy, suddenly want to be the bad guy, it felt totally random just like about everything else in this movie, and I'm not even talking about the totally anticlimactic and nonsensical way the bad guy is defeated.Maybe I'm expecting a bit too much from a 'mindless' action movie, but 'Hulk' obviously tries to be a bit more than just mindless action, and fails spectacularly in that aspect. It's not as cringe-inducingly bad as the Ang Lee version, it's just profoundly dull.",4,1,4,23 November 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Style over substance
","Let me start by saying that I generally like 'feel-bad movies' and I liked 'Pi'. This movie, however, completely failed to work for me.I think the main problem is that this movie tries too hard. It tries too hard to carry a serious message across and it tries to hard to be really artistic. In my opinion, the director loses himself in one gimmick (splitscreen, fast forward, curious editing) after another, and that really hurts the story and character development. All the fancy editing was probably done to create a surreal atmosphere similar to a drug trip, and it partly works, but a bit more restraint would have been welcome. The first hour of this movie is a fairly boring. Sure, it looks great, but it's really going nowhere. We get to meet the characters, but we don't really get to know them. The things they do are fairly predictable and mundane, and the pace is rather slow. After the first hour, terrible things start happening to the main characters, but I had a hard time caring about any of them since they're so poorly fleshed out, and the things that happen to them are so extreme that it's hard to take them seriously. Ellen Burstyn does a wonderful job, but the other actors' performances are really not that special.I admire the people who made this movie for making such a direct and tragic movie about a heavy subject, but this eventually I think this movie goes way overboard. With more focus on substance (characters and story) instead of style (flashy visuals) and a more subtle approach this movie might have worked. As it is now, it's still an interesting movie to watch, but definitely not a good one.",6,0,1,9 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For your kids only...
","OK, I really liked episodes 4 - 6, inspite of the fact that they are  quite corny and have a lot of plot holes. This movie, although it  doesn't differ TOO much from the previous three in terms of story  (which is still full of holes) and it falls short of the other Star  Wars movies in every other aspect.  The casting is reasonable, I suppose, but the script really doesn't  allow for much character interaction. Dialogues in this movie are silly  or just downright inappropriate. For example, when the monster that  chases the submarine carrying our heroes gets eaten by another monster,  all Liam Neeson can say is 'there's always a bigger fish'. What  nonsense !  Also, the first three movies didn't take themselves too seriously. To  continue this tradition, George Lucas probably decided to include  Jar-Jar Binks, who is without a doubt the most annoying character ever  to appear in any movie. The result of this dubious choice is a movie  filled with jokes that are probably funny to five year old kids.   Most of the movie's action sequences also lack any kind of tension,  probably because the main characters are put to series after series of  highly dangerous events without one of them even getting scratched. The  only memorable series are the pod-race and the last fight between Darth  Maul and the Jedis.   The special effects in this movie are great, but everything else seems  to have been dumbed down in order to make the movie more accessible to  kids, thus ensuring the sale of more action figures and other rubbish.  It's not a total loss because there's still a bit of that 'Star Wars  Magic' in this movie, but overall 'the Phantom Menace' is more of a  two-hours commercial then a real movie  *1/2 out of ****",6,11,21,9 January 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Escapism at its best
","Even though it's way over twenty years old, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is still one of the best action adventures ever created. This movie has all the things that make an action movie great: - A wonderful story about lost cities, ancient artifacts, and great mysteries. Even though everybody knows that most of these stories are nonsense, it's great to fantasize about them. - Main characters that are actually still human, instead of the superheroes Hollywood throws at you these days (both in 'real' superhero movies like X-Men and Hulk, and in movies where the main characters are normal humans but somehow completely invulnerable ('Tomb Raider', 'Mission Impossible 2')). Of course everybody knows that the good guys are going to win, but in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', the heroes have weaknesses, are vulnerable, don't do completely idiotic things, and abide by the normal laws of physics.<ul><li>The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure, it mostly plays it straight, but it isn't afraid to be a bit tongue-in-cheek from time to time. I take this kind of approach over the super-serious approach any time.</li></ul>
All of the above things make 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' excellent. It's a fun mix of story, action, and humour, without any kind of pretenses, that does exactly what it's supposed to do: entertain you for a couple of hours. Escapism at its best. ***1/2 out of **** stars",9,0,0,16 July 2004
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Yaaaaawn
","OK let me get this straight I've never been a big fan of the Resident Evil movies. But the third installment was actually pretty decent so I decided to give this movie a try. Big mistake.Even when taken at face value, as mindless eye candy, this movie fails to deliver in nearly every way. I don't mind that there is next to no story or that the characters are flat as hell. I do mind that it's slow, ponderous, poorly made, and just plain dull.One half of the movie seems to consist of slow and long shots of well..absolutely nothing. Empty rooms, empty ships, empty meadows full of planes..then a zombie pops up, eats somebody, and the whole thing starts all over. Even the death scenes, normally the highlights of this kind of movie, are so short and unremarkable that if you blink at the wrong time, you miss them.In between there is some 'action' which doesn't really live up to the name because it's nearly all in slow motion and so over-stylized that is takes away any kind of thrill or suspense. It looks good in stills but it's just not very interesting to watch and the effects are mediocre. All of this set to a the most generic industrial techno soundtrack in living history and all of it trying desperately hard to be 'cool'..except that this kind of stuff stopped being cool even before the Matrix sequels.My advice: stick to the trailer. It contains all the cool shots and good lines, and you will save yourself 80 minutes of nonsensical and boring wanna-be coolness.",3,1,4,14 February 2011
Fight Club," Dark, atmospheric, funny and downright great
","'Fight Club ' is the current climax of the work of director David Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, The Game), who is one of the best (if not THE best) directors running around in Hollywood at the moments. Like all of his movies, Fight Club is a very dark and atmospheric movie, containing lots and lots of black humour and quite explicit violence. The plot, involving people setting up clubs were they can fight just to counter boredom is original enough by itself, but it also contains several really unexpected and shocking plot twists, much like in 'The Game', or 'the Sixth Sense'. What's even better, these twists are actually quite believable compared to many other thrillers (for example, 'Along came a spider' contains some of the poorest plot twists ever). Is there anything wrong with Fight Club ? Frankly, no.  This is one of the only two movies (Pulp Fiction is the other one) that I have given a perfect score of 10/10. Must see ! **** out of **** stars",10,0,1,16 January 2002
Iron Man 2," It's decent entertainment but also a bit of a lazy sequel
","I absolutely loved the first Iron Man. It looked silly in the previews, but it turned out to an almost perfect mix of comedy, action and story/character development. With great anticipation I awaited this second installment..only to be mildly disappointed.Iron Man 2 doesn't stray too far from the successful formula of its predecessor, but for some reason it doesn't really add up.At least I am sure that the action is not to blame; there is a lot more of it this time around, and for the most part it is spectacular.There is still plenty of humor around as well, but Iron Man 2's track record isn't flawless here. While most of the jokes are pretty good, a significant portion does fall flat. Robert Downey still does a brilliant job, but Sam Rockwell's character, while well-acted, is annoying in a very non-funny way.But the biggest problem this time around is that all the jokes and the action don't really add up til a memorable tale. You never really get the idea that there is much at stake or that the narrative is going anywhere. The plot jumps through all the familiar hoops but nothing is really fleshed out. As a case in point, Mickey Rourke is totally wasted as the bad guy.Also, I am getting really tired of the phenomenon that a movie seems to exist solely as a commercial for the next installment in the series....half of the running time of Iron Man seems to be a commercial for the upcoming Avengers movie.Iron Man 2 offers enough action and jokes to provide two hours of fairly solid entertainment..but unlike the first part, it's not more than the sum of its parts. Not all of the humor works, and in terms of characters and story it feels lazy.",7,0,2,31 May 2010
Public Enemies," Not even Depp and Bale can save an oddly disjointed and empty movie
","Oh boy was I looking forward to this! I love gangster movies, I think Christian Bale is one of the best actors around, I think Johnny Depp is always decent, and I think Michael Mann is a great director. It seems a sure bet, a thing that could not go wrong.Well. It did. Sort of. While 'Public Enemies' is not a total disaster, it's not the new 'Heat' that it should have been.It seems that Micheal Mann has finally succumbed to the style over substance virus, turning Public Enemies into a movie that is almost entirely about atmosphere and fancy visuals. It worked in Collateral and Miami Vice, but this time Mann goes overboard and fails to provide a compelling narrative or characters to care about.Instead, what we get is a fairly tiresome collection of one shoot-out and bank robbery after the other. A lot of people get shot, a lot of people die, but you very rarely have any idea who is being shot since none of the characters are introduced properly and they all look the same anyway. To make things worse, the editing is all over the place as well, with frequent jumps in time and space that are poorly explained, and whole sections of narrative apparently missing.Depp and Bale are probably doing the best they can with what they are given, but they manage to be almost totally forgettable, a first for Depp and the second time for Bale (Terminator Salvation being the first). And Depp and Bale are the lucky ones, since the excellent supporting cast really has nothing of any interest to do, and the love story, which is given a prominent place in the marketing campaign, taking up a very minor part and being unconvincing to boot.As much as I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. It's basically a collection of nicely choreographed and elaborate but very hard to follow gunfights after each other, with very little in terms of story or characters to tie them together. Worth seeing for the excellent production values, but not much more",6,10,15,2 October 2009
Spider-Man 2," An action movie like action movies should be
","In an era in which action movies more and more seem to consist of endless amounts of CGI and over-the-top action sequences without any kind of story, logic or character development, it's good to see that occasionally a movie comes along that recognizes what makes action movies great: not the action itself, but the combination of action with other elements like story, character development and humor.I'm not a big fan of the first Spiderman, finding it way too predictable, a bit shallow, and not very convincing. 'Spiderman 2', however, fixes most of these things. This time around, the story and the characters are fleshed out a lot more, and while the story is still a bit predictable and a tad sentimental at times, it's a vast improvement over the first movie, and the story is great compared to nearly every other action movie of the last decade. Also, in 'Spiderman 2', the heroes and bad guys are real persons that you can relate to, not one-dimensional (and thus dull) cardboard cut-outs.The action sequences in Spiderman are also a lot better than in most movies. While there are still a couple of obviously fake CGI shots, for the most part the action looks very convincing. A special mention goes to Dr Octopus' tentacles, which really seem to lead a life of their own. Very well done! The action is spectacular and exciting, and remains largely believable (within the context of people with superhero powers and guys with four huge mechanical arms welded to their back, of course).I also like the fact that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. There are plenty of in-jokes, self-deprecating humor, and of course there's the comic relief in the form of J. Jonah Jameson. 'Spiderman 2' offers just about everything you want from an action movie: decent story, characters you can identify with, good action that doesn't go over the top, and a tongue-in-cheek tone. It's not Oscar material of course, but it does what it is supposed to do (entertain) in a superb manner.*** out of **** stars",8,0,1,21 July 2004
The Fifth Element," Brilliantly over the top
","'The Fifth Element' is a brilliantly overdone SF action extravaganza. It rips off probably just about every other SF movie ever made, while at the same time throwing in a lot of nonsense of its own (the floating Japanese restaurant boat still has me laughing out loud) and somehow molding all of this into a two-hour rollercoaster ride that leaves you with the feeling 'wow, how on earth did they manage to put all of that into two hours'.
The strength of this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously for one moment. Sure, the story deals with the destruction of the earth and there's violence and death everywhere. But it's all cartoon violence: it's so overdone that you can't possibly take it all seriously. Add to this a host of completely over-the top characters, like a crazed game show host, a super-clumsy acolyte, a priest that looks a lot like Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a bad guy that takes sardonic laughter and over-the-top acting to a new level, and you know your in for a treat. And to top it all off, there's Bruce Willis who seems to be approaching this movie as 'Die Hard meets Star Wars'.
Like Star Wars, this movie is unbelievable and silly to the extreme, but also like Star Wars, that's its biggest strength. If you want a serious SF action movie, rent 'Alien' . If you want an SF movie with a good story, rent Total Recall. But if you want an SF movie that provides you with two hours of uncomplicated fun, try this one.***1/2 out of **** stars",9,0,1,21 April 2003
Black Book," Verhoeven is back
","After a very long absence, director and infant terrible Paul Verhoeven return to movie-making with 'Zwarboek', and what a return it is! One warning though: if you're expecting something over-the-top and/or satirical like in most of Verhoeven's more recent movies, look elsewhere. 'Zwarboek', while far from subtle, is remarkably subdued and realistic for a Verhoeven movie, and all the better for it.'Zwartboek' tells the story of Jewish Rachel Stein, who, after her family has been shot during an escape attempt, becomes involved with the Dutch resistance and infiltrates the German headquarters. This makes for a great story, with plenty of twists and turns and a lot of suspense, even though the end is a bit formulaic, and the pace is sometimes so high that it can be hard to keep track. The movie has quite a lot of memorable moments, which become all the more impressive once you know that a lot of them are actually based on real events, though the characters and story themselves are fictional.What's probably even more interesting is that the picture painted here isn't the stereotypical one of good guys (resistance and allies) versus bad guys (Germans). Verhoeven shows that in war, as in the rest of the world, very little is black and white. There are corrupt resistance fighters and sympathetic Germans, and while some people are motivated by ideals, many are just by self-preservation, greed, or revenge. While Verhoeven's treatment of all this is far from subtle, I found it refreshing to see a director that deviates from the usual good vs bad theme.For a Dutch movie, 'Zwartboek' also has remarkable production values. From start to finish, everything looks and sounds very authentic (up to the deliberately poor German spoken by the Dutch) and the acting varies from excellent to decent. Carice van Houten is fabulous as Rachel/Ellis. Fortunately, Verhoeven was also sensible enough to hire real Germans instead of having Dutch actors play Nazis.There is on big flaw here though, and that is the Theo character, played by Johhny de Mol. The character (though based on facts) is already over-the-top, but he's played so poorly by De Mol that it really makes you cringe. Some people simply shouldn't be allowed to act, and De Mol is one of them.But this aside, 'Zwartboek' is a fast-paced and suspenseful war thriller, with plenty of memorably moments, a strong story, and remarkable moral complexity.Oh, and don't worry, there is some typically raunchy Verhoeven stuff in there too....8 out of 10",8,3,6,15 April 2007
The Mummy," Mummify the man that turned this into a comedy !
","'The Mummy' had all the ingredients to be a great action/adventure movie like 'Indiana Jones' or 'Romancing the Stone'. Unfortunately, somewhere along the production line, somebody decided to turn this thing into a comedy, and a bad one at that. This decision has to be one of the ten worst decisions ever made...Truly, the potential for something great was there, but this movie is filled with so many dull jokes that it becomes really annoying. Also, the main characters seem very reluctant to die and survive the most implausible situations completely undamaged. At one point, we even see a character being dragged away by hordes of undead, only to have him resurface unharmed at the end of the movie ! The corny jokes combined with the invulnerability of the main characters take away any kind of suspense and make the movie quite dull.*1/2 out of **** stars (mainly for the special effects)",4,0,1,1 April 2002
The Others," Works in the theaters, not on TV
","Like 'What lies beneath', 'The Others' is a movie that probably work very well on the big screen, but on the TV (I rented it on video), it falls completely flat. I can easily understand that this movie is scary when you see it in a dark room on a big screen with stereo sound, but when you rent it at home and watch it...what a disappointment.The acting is great, the cinematography is great etc..but it's all so very boring. Hardly anything ever happens, and when something happens it usually doesn't make a lot of sense. You have no empathy at all for the characters: two whining little kids and an overly harsh mother. Plus, it's not even remotely scary (on TV). Granted, the ending is adequate and does clear things up, but it didn't shock me nearly as much as 'the Sixth Sense', a movie with a similar theme, did. I'd even go as far as to call this a rip-off of the Sixth Sense.Well made, but very boring and derivative.** out of **** stars",5,0,1,24 June 2002
Troy," Good epic action movie
","I've heard some quite mixed reviews about this movie, and while I can understand that some people don't like it, I think 'Troy' is a very solid and entertaining action epic that is a lot better than many make it out to be. If you expect a serious recreation of the Iliad though, you'll be disappointed. The story has been simplified and altered quite a bit (probably to make it fit into a three-hour movie), but it's still by no means a brain-dead action movie. Apart from a couple of unnecessary parts (the Achilles - Briseis relation, for one), 'Troy' still offers a strong and coherent story with characters that actually have some depth. Considering that they could have turned this movie into a sentimental piece of trash (e.g. something produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) it's good to see that 'Troy' at least manages to avoid some of the cliches and overly simplistic depictions that plague many Hollywood 'epics'.The acting is generally quite good, as well. I don't see what's the problem with Brad Pitt as Achilles, and the rest of the cast is good as well, with Eric Bana as the obvious highlight. Where this movie really shines is the action scenes though. Although there aren't as many of them as you might expect, the action that is there is beautifully shot, quite realistic (no bullet time here), and sufficiently visceral. And fortunately, the editing isn't all over the place like in 'Gladiator'. The fight between Achilles and Hector in particular stood out.
All in all, 'Troy' certainly isn't a masterpiece, but is certainly isn't a stupid action blockbuster either. It messes up some of the details, but overall it offers a good story, sufficient depth, fine acting and excellent action. Certainly worth your time.*** out of **** stars",8,2,4,3 June 2004
L.A. Confidential," Finally, a movie with a story
","Recently, I finally had a chance to view this movie, having missed it a couple of times before. Man, am I glad that I finally got to see it!With the current Hollywood climate, where special effects seem to be far more important than story line or dialogues, it's refreshing to finally see a movie that actually has a deep and sensible story, as well as believable characters and good acting.Sure, the three main characters (Spacey, Pierce and Crowe) are sort of stereotypical and don't really show that much character development, but they at least feel like real persons with real shortcomings. Acting is superb all over (with even Danny DeVito in a serious role), with the possible exception of Kim Basinger. Yes, I know she got an Oscar for it, but all she has to do is look pretty and that's about it. The real winner here is the story, though. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is pretty complex without ever becoming overwhelming. Most importantly, it all makes sense and doesn't contain any huge plot holes I could find. Add to this a number of gritty and realistic action sequences, and you have a real winner. If only they'd make more movies like this...***1/2 out of **** stars (but very close to ****)",9,3,5,5 January 2003
Zodiac," You might as well watch a documentary
","I'm a big David Fincher fan but I have to admit that he really messed up on this on. 'Zodiac', a story about the hunt for the eponymous murderer who terrorized California for years, has high production values but falls completely flat.The movie is basically a series of loosely connected scenes that tell (part of) the story of the famous murderer and some people that try to hunt him down. There's nothing wrong with having so many plot lines in a movie but in Zodiac it's poorly done. The movie jumps around between so many characters and makes so many leaps in time that it feels very disjointed and unfocused. It's almost like watching a Discovery Channel documentary where you get to see reenactments of the most important parts from the plot.While it's true that the acting and the production values are of much higher quality than in such a documentary, that's just about everything that can be said in 'Zodiac''s favour. The bottom line is: nothing what happens is really all that interesting. There are poorly worked out characters you don't care about, an investigation that goes nowhere, and a fairly unconvincing theory about who the Zodiac really was.While the movie does pack up a bit towards the end (once Graysmith becomes personally involved in tracking down Zodiac there is finally a bit of suspense), it's not nearly enough to make up for a seemingly endless series of scenes that ultimately go nowhere.In the end, I don't know what to do with 'Zodiac'. I can live with the fact that's it's not a standard thriller, but it doesn't do anything else very well. It's not a gripping tale with characters you care about, it's not a convincing investigation of who the Zodiac really was, and if you really want to know about the Zodiac you're much better off on Wikipedia or the Discovery Channel.**1/2 out of ***** (the acting is good and it looks very convincing; that should count for something)",5,2,6,22 November 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Mixed feelings
","OK, I admit, I never cared much for the first Hellboy much, but after the great job Del Toro did with Pan's Labyrinth, I was rather eager to see this movie. Now that I've seen it, I am left with mixed feelings.To start with the good things: this is a lot more like Pan's Labyrinth than it is like the first Hellboy movie. In fact, this is more a fantasy movie set in modern times than it is a superhero movie. It's full of wonderfully imaginative scenery, wonderfully creative creatures..it's just full of wonder.Unfortunately, the positive qualities of this movie stay almost entirely on the visual side.Whereas Pan's Laybrinth did have a compelling story and characters you cared about, these aspects are sadly underdeveloped in Hellboy 2...the narrative is the same bare-bones stuff as in the first movie, the characters are interesting by themselves but not much is done with them (there are some hints at Hellboy falling to the Dark Side, so to speak, but they remain just hints), and also like in the first movie there is an overall lack of suspense since, well, the heroes get through every fight way too easy and never feel in any kind of real danger.What I also found annoying was the overall tone of the movie...it goes from total silliness to deadly serious over and over again..one moment you're watching slapstick, the next moment you're stuck in an overly dramatic death or love scene. Of course there can be jokes in a seriously or epic movie too (see LOTR), but this much inconsistency hurts.That being said, I do have to give the movie some credit. The action sequences are mostly nicely done (don't expect any epic battles though, in spite of the fact that there is 'Army' in the title; the army doesn't get to do much), the Krauss character is a very nice addition, and most of the jokes are mildly amusing.In the end I did enjoy Hellboy 2. It's plagued by the flaws that the first movie also had, and it's got serious consistency and tone problems, but the stunning visuals and obvious creativity make up for a lot.",7,2,3,24 February 2009
Crash," Excellent ensemble movie that really hits a couple of nerves
","Once very while, a movie comes along that really makes you think about (Western) society, a society where things often look just fine on the surface but once you look deeper, the opposite is sometimes the case. One of these fairly rare movies is 'Crash', a movie that expertly shows that things like racism, discrimination and prejudice are still alive and kicking in a civilized society.The best part of 'Crash' is probably that it does all of this in a way that feels very realistic and believable. I felt that the majority of the situations that occur in the movie could (and do sometimes) happen in the real world.It's also noteworthy that 'Crash' doesn't threat its subject matter in a black-and-white matter. This isn't a movie where there are good guys and bad guys, instead there are many shades of gray: the initially idealistic cop turns eventually turns out to be biased after all, while the racist pig turns out not to be so evil after all, and so on.All in all, I think 'Crash' presents a number of very interesting moral dilemma's (would you jeopardize your career in order to stop discrimination?) and touches a couple of sensitive spots.What also helps a whole lot are the generally very strong performances by a very diverse cast of talented actors. Not all of them are known for serious roles (Sandra Bullock, Ludicrous) but even they do a convincing job here. Even though none of the characters get much screen time (this is a real ensemble movie) you do get to care about them, especially during some very intense and emotional scenes.'Crash' is a great ensemble movie, with strong performances, and a realistic and thought-provoking plot ****1/2 out of *****",9,3,8,21 May 2006
The Beach," This movie can't decide what it wants to be about
","'The beach' has really left me with mixed feelings. I wanted to hate the movie because Leonardo diCaprio plays in it, but in spite of his presence, The Beach is not as bad as I expected. One thing that's remarkable is that Leo's character is kind of a jerk, which is a welcome change from the one-dimensional idiot he played in 'Titanic'The first half hour of the movie is terrible, however. Corny dialogs, stereotype tourist character and an annoying voice-over. After that, the movie gets a little better, especially the scenery (the tropical island) is breathtaking, and the movie even manages to be funny sometimes. Plus, there is a certain charm in the idea of a hippy commune living on a beautiful, deserted island.Unfortunately, the movie can't decide what it wants to be: an action movie, a romantic drama, a satire on the consumer society, a 'Blue Lagoon'- clone etc. It contains parts of all these movies/genres, but it moves constantly from one genre to the other.All in all, I found the Beach to be moderately enjoyable, mostly because I just wanted to see what happened next, even though that what happened usually didn't make much sense. with a LOT more focus on psychology, the Beach would have been a good movie. As it is now, it's confusing and a little boring, but not total crap*1/2 out of **** stars",5,0,1,22 November 2001
Blade II," Yeah yeah we get it, Snipes is cool
","The first Blade was an entertaining movie, so the sequel should be fine, right. Guess again. While it's certainly along the same lines, this sequel seems so targeted at pleasing a (pre)pubescent crowd that only cares about gore and eye candy that it actually becomes painful to watch to anybody who doesn't fit that demographic.The main idea behind 'Blade II' seems to have been to make everything as 'cool' as possible. Apparently, this boils down to Wesley Snipes killing scores and scores of vampires without the slightest bit of trouble. Snipes is so completely invulnerable and the action is so completely over the top that the action alternates between mind-numbingly boring and unintentionally funny.But at least it looks good, right? Well, not really. The movie clearly suffers from an overuse of CGI, and most of it isn't terribly convincing. Some shots are so fake they even make you laugh out loud. Just about the only thing they did do right was the gore: the are massive amounts of it and it looks truly gross for the most part.Well, maybe the story can save it then? Wrong again. 'Blade 2' about the most by-the-numbers script you can get stuck with. There are a couple of twists, but you can see them coming from a mile away. The characters are as one-dimensional as they get, the plot is very basic yet makes little sense (Blade is such a super person that he can easily wipe out both old and new vampires, so why team up with the old ones?), and the dialog is full of tired and unfunny one-liners that leave no opportunity unused to show us once again how supposedly cool Blade is. Yawn.'Blade II' is an extremely poor action movie, with a dull, stupid and predictable plot and even more dull, stupid and predictable action sequences. Watch only as a cure for insomnia.* out of *****",2,8,16,17 March 2006
Full Metal Jacket," War is hell
","Long before the current wave of 'realistic' (i.e. gritty, gory and shocking) war movies, Stanley Kubrick delivered this gem of a war movie.
'Full Metal Jacket' tells two stories: the boot camp training of a group of marines for the Vietnam war, and the actual war where we meet up again with some of the soldiers from boot camp. In terms of war movies, it's a fairly modest undertaking...there are no large-scale battles(like the beach landing in 'Saving Private Ryan') and few action scenes. Instead, Kubrick uses a series of fairly small-scale incidents and events to portray a gruesome image of war. There's no annoying flag-waving here, like in so many American movies that glorify war. There's no clear bias towards the US or Vietnam either. This movie isn't about who was right in that specific war, it's about war in general. And the message it sends is clear: war is hell, it brings up the worst in people. All in all, I think that's a far more valid view than all the heroism war movies normally throw at you.
Generally, 'Full Metal Jacket' is excellent. The cast is relatively unknown, but they all deliver very good performances, especially R. Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant of course. The movie has a very gritty and realistic feel to it, and contains very sharp dialogs, a lot of truly shocking scenes, as well as some undeniably funny ones (although the humor is admittedly very black). Like in most of Kubrick's movies the pace is a little slower than desired, but in this case that's easily forgiveable.Movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', and 'Black Hawk Down' might initially appear to be much better and much more entertaining, but after repeated viewing, the small-scale and modest approach of 'Full Metal Jacket' works a lot better than its more spectacular but ultimately less satisfying competitors.***1/2 out of **** stars",9,0,0,20 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas strikes back
","Contains minor spoilersYes, Star Wars is back. After the cute but disappointing Episode One, George Lucas has delivered a much better, much more mature and much more serious installment to the Star Wars series. There are plenty of things to like about this new SW movie: much less Jar Jar Binks, no overly cute characters like the Ewoks, much more storyline (still flawed and with lots of holes, but who cares?), hilarious scene where C3PO's head is replaced, and some pretty spectacular action scenes. Seeing Samuel L. Jackson with a lightsaber is even better then Samuel L. Jackson with a gun like in Pulp Fiction, and the scene where 30 or so Jedi duke it out against thousands of battle droids is great. Yoda with a light sabre is a bit silly, though.Unfortunately, there are also a lot of bad things, primarily the totally unconvincing, stupid and cliche love story between Anakin and Padme, which is worse then those of Titanic and Pearl Harbour put together. Dialogue in the rest of the movie is better then in episode 1, but still often very silly. Action scenes are spectacular, but some of them are really not even remotely believable.However, I think the good points of this movie more than outweigh the flaws. Episode 2 may lack the charm of the first three Star Wars movies, but compared to Episode 1 it's a huge leap back into the right direction, and compared to most modern action films it's definetely above par.*** out of *** stars",8,1,2,23 May 2002
Forrest Gump," Very clever and funny movie that succumbs a bit to sentimentality
","CONTAINS SPOILERS'Forrest Gump' is a very creative and clever movie that tells roughly thirty years of recent American history through the eyes of a rather stupid person who somehow manages to be present at many important events of the last half century. Tom Hanks, as Forrest Gump, meets three american presidents, inspires Elvis and John Lennon, becomes a war hero in Vietnam, and much more. I must say that I had my doubts when I heard about this movie, but much to my surprise I found this movie to be often very funny. It's not a movie that constantly has you laughing out loud, but several jokes like Forrest teaching Elvis to dance are priceless, and there are a lot of quotable one-liners. Looking at other comments, I see that people have tried to see all kinds of political agendas behind this movie, but for the most part I think it should just be taken as harmless fun, although there are a couple of clear points of criticism (e.g. the movie claims that stupidity is the key to succeeding in the army, and that you can get a college degree by just being good at sports). Technically, this movie is great. The special effects people have done a great job of making it look like Forrest Gump really was a part of history, and the costumes and settings are all completely convincing. The acting is also superb. Tom Hanks makes Forrest totally convincing, and the rest of the cast is great as well. Gary Sinise is probably the most underrated actor ever, this man deserves to get leading roles, not just supporting ones.
I do have a couple of gripes with this movie. For one, at over two-and-a-half hours, it's a bit on the long side. After about one-and-a-half hours, the novelty wears off a bit and while there are still some good scenes in the second part of the movie, the first half is definitely better. Also, towards the end the movie succumbs a bit too much into sentimentality. I mean, was it really necessary to overdo the tragic romance (including very tragic ending) between Jenny and Forrest in this way? In a movie that's mostly fairly lighthearted, putting so much emphasis on the rather melodramatic romance just seems a bit misplaced.All in all though, 'Forrest Gump' is a very amusing movie and often hilarious movie with a clever plot and superb acting, that unfortunately drags on for a bit too long and succumbs a bit to sentimentality in the end.

Watchmen," It really grows on you
","I have to admit...it took me a while to grow to appreciate this movie. I knew next to nothing about it before I went to see it, except that it was 'a superhero movie'. I was very tired when I saw it in the cinema, semi-slept through a part of it, and the projector broke down to even further disturb my viewing. As such, I really didn't know what to think about it, except that I liked the general idea well enough to try reading the graphic novel (which is an absolute masterpiece) that it is based on.Some months later I saw the director's cut, and now I can say with certainty that this is an excellent movie, both as an adaptation and on its own right.The Watchmen graphic novel is extremely complex, and of course some things had to be altered and left out to even turn it into a very long movie. The good news is that, for once, that very little essential things are left out, and the alterations (i.e. the ending) are mostly for the better. It still does justice to the source material, and it works as a movie. A rare combination.On its own right, Watchmen is a very dark, very dreary, but also occasionally very funny movie. Make no mistake, this is nothing like standard superhero movies, in fact it aims to deconstruct the super hero myth, by showing them as very flawed and/or outright evil, and poses interesting questions about how far people are allowed to go when taking matters into their own hand and how far one is allowed to go for 'the greater good'. Like 'The Dark Knight', this is actually a superhero movie with depth and significance.Also, this is a very violent and depressing movie, and this is one of my minor gripes. While the novel is also pretty violent, a lot of things that are implied in the novel are shown much more explicitly in the movie, which only detracts from the deeper themes and feels very gratuitous. It's not '300 Part 2', thank god, but it's still a bit too much.Secondly, not all of the characters are that well played. While most of the actors do an OK job and while the Rorschachs character is an instant classic, there are some dud performances, most notably the Silk Spectre II (utterly clueless) and the Comedian (far too much over the top for his own good).'Watchmen' will not be for everybody. It's one of the most mature mainstream movies in years, and it goes utterly against the stereotypes we expect of action movies. It's also sports some less than stellar performances and a bit too much gratuitous violence. But it's also a beautifully shot movie full of interesting ideas and characters, and a successful adaptation of an 'unfilmable' classic",9,1,4,2 October 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," (visually) impressive
","OK, this comment is not going to add anything dramatically new, but I recently had a discussion with somebody about why 'A Beautiful Mind' won all major Oscars instead of this movie. I still think that is unfair.OK, in term of story this movie is very shallow: It's basically a very long chase. But that's mainly because it's so true to the book, and the book is many times more boring then the movie. Some people claim also that this movie has a lot of cliches, but don't forget that those things weren't cliches when the book was written and might have never become cliches without the book. In terms of character development, I've seen much better movies but also a lot poorer movies. Some characters are underdeveloped, but in order to develop them properly the movie would have had to last 10 hours...What is left is a visual and technical masterpiece. Everything, from the costumes to the make-up, from the landscapes to the CGI and the cinematography, looked simply perfect. Yet even in some of these categories Lord of the Rings didn't win the oscars. And, contrary to my expectations, the movie was also really exciting and suspenseful. True, there are some parts were everything succumbs under too many effects (the Mines of Moria), but it's not nearly as problematic as in Episode I for instance.
When you look at the sheer size and scope of this production, you have to be deeply impressed. Even though it's lacking in story and character development, it should have easily won the 'Best Picture' award, let alone the 'Best Male Actor in Supporting Role' for Ian McKellen as Gandalf.

The Matrix Revolutions," And now for something completely different
","CONTAINS SPOILERSWhile it's without a doubt that 'Matrix Revolutions' is far inferior to the original 'Matrix', I'd say it's about on par with 'Reloaded', although, most importantly, 'Revolutions' is simply a completely different kind of movie.What made the first, and to a lesser extent, the second Matrix movie so much fun were the spectacular action scenes in the 'real world': people being able to do things they're normally incapable of in a seemingly 'normal' world.This third movie instead takes place largely outside of virtual reality (except for a brief part in the beginning and the end battle), and as a result the action is not nearly as interesting. The mass battle scenes involving the defense of Zion and a minute-long tunnel chase look spectacular, but ultimately they're not very plausible since the humans just get away with everything way too easily, overcoming seemingly overwhelming odds with ease, and way too many of the main characters (including that incredibly annoying kid) surviving. When the fighting does get taken into the Matrix, the results are mixed. The initial fighting scene in the night club is OK, but nothing new. The final battle is certainly spectacular, but also goes so far over the top that it's hard to take it seriously. It's not terrible, but not the climax I'd hoped for either.In terms of story, we get a much less convoluted plot (compared to the second part) and a lot less quasi-philosophical ramblings, although what is there is admittedly still quite vague and pretentious. I also couldn't find any really plausible explanations for some of the quite large questions (like: why can Neo use his powers when not plugged in, and why/how does Smith die at the end). I also think there are too many gooey love and death scenes in the movie, but this is a minor complaint. In the end, it's hard what to make of the movie. It's much more like a generic sci-fi movie than the previous two Matrix films, and it doesn't contain enough action sequences of the kind that made the other movies great. Then again, in spite of some reasonably large plot holes, I didn't find the story as annoying as in 'Reloaded, and it certainly wasn't as slow. 'Like I said, compared to the first Matrix this third installment falls short on all fronts, compared to the second one it has some pluses and some minuses, and on its own right its a watchable although not very plausible sci-fi movie that probably has more in common with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (the mass battles) than with the other Matrix movies.

28 Weeks Later," A dreadful and utterly stupid bore fest
","I liked '28 Days Later'. It has nice cinematography, a cool premise, some nice twists, and chilling action. The 'sequel', '28 Weeks Later', more or less has the same nice cinematography. And. that. is. about. it.Yes, there are some very nice shots of abandoned London in this movie. Actually, there are a lot of very nice shots. Actually, there are so many shots and they take so long that is gets awfully boring very fast. And to make up for those nice long shots, the other half of the movie (the 'action') is shot so fast and so messily that it's impossible to make out what is happening. The footage here is so frantic and so low-quality that it's an assault on the senses.The movie doesn't have an awful lot of other redeeming features either. First, there's the very weak plot. Just about everything that happens in this movie has 'plot device' written all over it. The movie obviously aims for realism but the decisions that characters make and the way the plot turns out is utterly stupid. Kids easily sneaking out of a military zone? Check! Military wanting to kill their possibly only hope of a cure? Check! Military then leaving that cure undefended? Check! Zombies instantaneously overrunning super-prepared compound? check! Military immediately gunning down people they went to great lengths of trouble to protect? The list goes on and on, and none of it makes any kind of sense, it's all just an excuse to go on to the next scene in which some zombies supposedly infect or kill some more people; what they do exactly is impossible to make out due to the aforementioned horrible editing.Also, this movie left me utterly cold. They few characters there are in the movie are not developed at all, they hardly say a thing. They all act horribly stupid and mostly bring about their own doom, so it's pretty hard to really feel for them.If you're prepared to waste 90 minutes, one half on pointless shots of an empty England, and the other half on non-existing characters, an utterly stupid plot, and action that is impossible to make out, you have just found yourself a great movie.

Cast Away," A two hour FedEx trailer
","Contains spoilersWith this movie, Robert Zemeckis continues his tradition of making very very longwinded movies, like his previous successes 'Forrest Gump' and 'What Lies Beneath'. Those films were enjoyable, even though they lasted WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to long. In this case, however, there is very little to enjoy and a lot of time to be bored. I think the premise of this movie certainly left room for a very interesting movie, but hardly anything ever happens. We see Chuck do some very basic things when he first arrives on the island. Then we make a four year jump and find out that Chuck has hardly done anything in the mean time, and then again he does nothing for a very long time. It's not funny, it's not a good psychological study into loneliness, it's not exciting, it's just plain dull.  Also, after Chuck finally gets rescued, we get a totally pointless half hour episode in which Chuck re-discovers the inhabited world, filled with very hollow symbolism (the unopened package). Also, the movie looks like it was paid completely by FedEx : the name of this company appears so many times during the course of this movie, that it gets really irritating?

Armageddon," Not terrible, but quite close
","Having seen 'Armageddon' and a lot of other crappy action movies, I have to say that this one is not as poor with the absolute disasters like 'Speed 2', 'Battlefield Earth' or 'Godzilla', but it comes pretty close.'Armageddon' has a little more dialgue and story then most other brainless action movies (some of the dialogue is even funny !) but it all feels very predictable. The 'love story' is way to drawn out and the plot is little more then a series of things that go wrong ('Ok...the drill just broke down. Let's see..what can we do next...right...make the nuclear missile go off prematurely...what's next...an intergalactic storm...OK'), and kill almost the entire supporting cast. Not very much new or exciting here.It's also inexcusable that the movie is so sentimental and/or patriotic. OK, I'm used to Americans saving the world by now, but do they have to make it THIS obvious? Also, why are we supposed to care about a small group of paper-thin characters, while at the same time large cities filled with millions of people get wiped of the earth without anybody in the movie seeming to care?'Armageddon' is not completely stupid and it's even a little funny sometimes, but it's also sentimental, predictable and boring.* out of **** stars",5,1,4,3 April 2002
Pitch Black," Pitch Black = Dead Average
","I must say that I had reasonable high hopes for this movie, but when watching it, it soon became clear to me that it's seriously lacking in the originality department.What we have here is the tried-and-true formula of a group of wildly different and colorful characters getting stuck in a dangerous situation and then getting killed off one by one..it's been done countless times before (the Alien movies, Event Horizon, Deep Blue Sea, Sphere, Resident Evil, The Haunting and dozens and dozens of slasher movies) and most of the times a lot better. The story consists of the normal array of arguments, revelations, fights, people freaking out, comedy one-liners etc, and in this case the revelations just aren't that shocking, the one-liners aren't very funny, the enemy isn't especially memorable, and the various deaths are predictable and rather stupid (could somebody please explain to me why some characters get slaughtered, while many of the others survive in spite of the fact that they're really aren't illuminated any better than the ones that get killed?). Granted, 'Pitch Black' is acted pretty well, and the camera work is also well-done, but for the most part it's a thorougly average, unoriginal and generally quite dull by-the-numbers movie** out of **** stars",5,0,1,26 October 2003
North by Northwest," The master of suspense forgot to put the suspense in
","The 'old' movies in the Top-250 seem to me to fall squarely into two categories: true classics (Vertigo, Casablanca), and movies that are probably mostly included for nostalgic reasons and have aged quite noticeably. 'North by Northwest' falls clearly into the second category. While it's by no means a bad movie, it's also by no means a real classic.'North by Northwest' can best be described as a very early attempt at an action comedy. It's a fast-paced, fairly light story that clearly goes for style over substance. As such, it succeeds gloriously. There's no denying that it's a very charming movie. The lead characters are excellent, the dialog is sharp, witty, and full of memorably quotes, and some scenes like the auction are truly classic. Kudos also to the excellent musical score.Yet, I was expecting a bit more from Hitchcock. For one, 'North by Northwest' is sorely lacking in suspense. Although the main characters are constantly chased and put into supposedly hazardous situations, but they always get away easily and never seem to be in any real danger, thus killing most of the suspense.The plot also doesn't really help. It's got its fair share of twists and turns, but most of them are so predictable that you can spot them from a mile away, and curiously enough most of the mystery is revealed early on, further killing any suspense that might have been there. Also, expect a fair amount of plot holes, contrivances, and a very clear deus ex machina ending. The relatively complexity of the plot might have wowed audiences one day, but not any more.'North by Northwest' is perfect as a light-hearted diversion, but I have trouble seeing this as the classic it is often proclaimed to be.***1/2 out of *****",7,1,6,28 November 2006

","'American Beauty' is a great movie about a bored suburbian nobody (Kevin Spacey) who on on day decides that he doesn't give a damn about anything anymore and starts doing the things he really wants. This leads to some very funny situations, but the movie also contains enough of a message and really shows the futility and emptiness of middle-age family life (wow, how did I come up with that one). Of course, every now and then things become a little too dramatic or symbolic (I remember watching a scene with a plastic bag being moved by the wind for about 5 minutes), but the phenomenal part of Kevin Spacey more then makes up for this.

Wanted," Utterly obnoxious from start to end
","Let me get this straight I really don't mind dumb action movies. I've enjoyed nearly every super hero movie ever made, I liked Die Hard, Pirates of the Carribbean, Shoot Em Up and a whole lot more. But there is dumb and there is really dumb, and 'Wanted' falls it the latter category. Basically, it's the Matrix on speed, but without anything that made the Matrix such a great movie, i.e. cool characters, a really cool premise, and exciting action sequences. While 'Wanted' sure does have its share of action sequences, I would not describe them as exciting. They are very stylized and there are a couple of nice parts, but for the most part you are shaking your head in disbelief at the over-the-top nonsense the creators want you to swallow. And that's just the action. The story, if you can call it that, is even worse. Basically, the main character is recruited by a super-secret society of assassins, who get their targets by a magical loom that spits out binary code, to kill one of their rogue members. Somehow, he becomes the world's best assassin in a couple of weeks by being beaten up for weeks, an even obtains supernatural time-slowing and levitation powers, after which he proceeds to take out a veritable army of highly trained fellow assassins with no effort whatsoever. There are twists and turns everywhere, but none of it makes any sense. Then, there's the very obnoxious message. Basically, this movie claims, all normal people are 'losers' because they are not fulfilling their potential, which apparently adds up to killing your own father and assassinating random people because a magical machine tells you to. In fact, not just the message is obnoxious. Everything else is too. There is not a likable character or good joke to be found anywhere in the movie. I like James McAvoy but here's he just annoying, and Angelina Jolie (as usual) is there for the looks only. And why Morgan Freeman resorts to crap like this we will probably never know. I really don't mind nonsense as long as it's presented as nonsense. But a movie that goes this far over the top and then still tries to be a 'serious' and 'cool' movie, that's just too much. Watch the action sequences, and fast forward through the rest.4/10",4,6,11,26 October 2008

There should also be a good and believable story.This is where the patriot fails: it portrays the Americans as universally noble, fair, kind people who are even nice to their slaves and the English as utter nazis who shoot little children and burn innocent people alive. It's sentimental to the point where it makes me vomit (all of Mel Gibson's children get slaughtered one by one) and it contains the very questionable morale that there's nothing better then living in and dying for the United States.Maybe Americans like this over-the-top, history-distorting tear-jerker but I found it to be utterly unrealistic and offensive",3,3,6,21 November 2001
Being John Malkovich," Sick and NOT funny
","I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it, but it was a huge disappointment.First of all, it's supposed to be a comedy but I don't think I've laughed once, maybe I smiled a couple of times. In this movie, it's supposed to be funny that an office building has a seven-and-a-halfed floor, that an apartment is filled with animals (hello, Ace Ventura anyone?) and that nobody seems to know what parts John Malkovich played.As for the acting, John Cusack is terrible, John Malkovich hardly gets a chance to act and for some obscure reason Cameron Diaz is made almost unrecognizable with a very ugly hairdress and a very boring part.The story is original, yes, but it's also completely sick and confusing, involving a woman having a 'lesbian' relationship with another woman who is inside John Malkovich's head, John Cusack locking up his girlfriend, a sick guy that survives by getting inside other people's heads etc.

The acting is good, the special effects are mostly excellent except for the extremely fake Green Goblin suit, and the whole thing stays very faithful to the comic (as far as I know, I haven't read too many of them). But it's also a very predictable movie. In fact, it's one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen: everything happens exactly the way I expected it would , including the compulsory romance story, which, although not as bad as the one found in 'Star Wars: Episode 2', is still not very interesting.
On the plus side, the fight scenes are often spectacular (owing a lot to 'the Matrix', but hey, which other contemporary action film doesn't ?), and there are plenty of good jokes to laugh about. But overall, I really don't understand what's so special about this movie, why it broke all the records and why it's still in the IMDB 250. My guess is that it will probably drop out of it as soon as this flick gets released on DVD/Video. Entertaining and good looking movie with good action, but way too predictable.**1/2 out of **** stars",7,0,0,4 June 2002
American History X," Impressive
","This is a very impressive movie. I think it gives a fairly realistic view into the world and ideas of 'white power' and neo-nazism, although it's true that you could also get that view from watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel. However, this movie also succeeds very well at showing how nonsensical and futile those ideas are, and makes a very strong statement against racism. Furthermore, the acting in this movie is really top-class, and the movie is shot in a way that makes everything look very realistic, right down to the blood and gore. Also, this movie has a remarkable ending compared to most Hollywood movies that always have an extremely happy end.
The only complaint I have about this movie is that Edward Norton's character's move away from neo-nazism while he was in prison happened a bit too sudden: no real insight into his motives way given. This is a minor complaint however, which doesn't stop me from giving this movie ***1/2 out of **** stars",10,0,1,16 January 2002
The Usual Suspects," Magnificent thriller
","This movie is a great thriller that has something that very little movies have: an intelligent plot full of twists, that holds up even after several viewings and becomes more fascinating every time you watch it. No really ! Every single detail of this movie simply matches up. And the ending is the best I've ever seen, barring maybe only Fight Club. Of course, the cast, lead by Kevin Spacey and including Gabriel Byrne and Pete Postlewaith, is excellent as well with the exception of Benicio del Toro, who seems to do his best to come across as creepy as possible but fails miserably. All in all, one of the best thrillers ever made. If you haven't seen it, go watch it NOW, or Kaiser Soze is coming to get you...**** out of **** stars",9,1,2,2 July 2002
Resident Evil," Not a total waste of time, but nothing special either
","For a video game conversion, 'Resident Evil' is quite good. It even stays relatively close to the game for once. Unfortunately, judged as a high-budget movie, it falls short of my expectations, although it's not a total waste either.To it's credit, the movie has some nice-looking special effects and action sequences, and there's even a somewhat successful attempt at creating a storyline with a bit of intrigue (I said 'somewhat', so don't expect another 'Usual Suspects' or anything).Unfortunately, this movie once again makes the common mistake of not letting us care about the characters. They're all fairly generic, none of them is introduced properly, and they all look the same. On top of this, most of the action sequences are so incredibly frantic and haphazardly edited that it's really impossible to determine what the *** is going on. As a result, I really lost track of what happened to the character and I didn't really care either. I just a little bored. If you like this kind of movie ('group-of-people-gets-trapped-in-facility-and-must-get-out'), I suggest you go watch the much better Aliens movies (especially Aliens), or even 'Deep Blue Sea'. Those movies have better characterization, more likeable characters, more suspense, and better jokes.

Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace - Or How To Make A Complete Mess Out of Something Basically Very Simple
","After the Bond franchise was successfully reinvented with the very watchable Casino Royale, it immediately kills itself off again in with the eminently UNwatchable Quantum of Solace, aka how to make a complete mess out of something basically very simple Let me be clear: I like most of the old Bond Stuff...sure it was cheesy and goofy, but it was good fun. Over time though, it got progressively worse with the also unwatchable Die Another Day as the low point. Then Casino Royale came along and although it was a lot more serious than previous outings, it still had style and class, and even had character development and a story.Now, Quantum of Solace comes along, and not only does it throw out everything that made the old Bond movies fun (style, humor) it also throws out everything that made CR fun. What we are left with is a third rate Jason Bourne that seems to be played on double speed.At the basis, the ingredients for a good Bond movie are here; the story is serviceable, the exotic locations and girls are there, and there are some essentially excellent action sequences.Whatever potential there is, however, is totally spoiled by the fact that the entire movie from start to finish is incredibly rushed. The action sequences are edited in such a haphazard and frantic way that it's impossible to determine what on earth is going on.The plot is rushed in a similar way; we jump from one location to the next with no explanation whatsoever, characters pop out of nowhere and are killed off before we even learn their names, and in general everything feels very random. If you try a bit you can still distill a decent story out of this mess, but frankly half of it seems to have gone missing on the editing room floor, along with basically all of the character development.In the end this is simple a horrible movie to watch. It could have been decent but the horrible editing and incredibly poor storytelling drag it down to the 'unwatchable mess' level.Final note: I am undecided about whether this is the worse Bond yet, I think Die Another Day was a little bit worse. But at least this one takes over from that movie for having the worst title song..something I found almost impossible",3,5,6,5 April 2009
Independence Day," Enough plot holes to fit a 550 mile spaceship in
","I actually liked the first part of this movie ! The scenes in which large parts of US cities are destroyed are great to watch. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing about this movie. The rest is VERY bad.Let's make a list: first of all, it's got Will Smith in it, which is by itself almost enough reason to give it a rating of 1/10. Secondly, this movie has every tired cliche ever found in any action movie: little cute kids, guy that sacrifices himself, best friend that dies, romances that rekindle, creepy CIA agent. I mean, come on, can't they think of anything more original.Also, this movie has more plot holes then a piece of swiss cheese. For example: since when can you knock out a huge spacecraft with a computer virus written on a totally different computer. 90% of Earth's computers aren't even compatible, the probability of an Earth program running on an alien computer is ZERO. Secondly, all the alien spacecraft are apparently destroyed because someone flies into their main weapon beam at EXACTLY the right time. I could go on like this, but the basic idea is that it's TOTALLY LUDICROUS that a bunch of nit-wits use a couple of fighter jets and one UFO to take out a vast army of highly superior aliens. Finally, to top it all off, it's again the Americans and only the Americans that save the entire earth. Yet another movie filled with over-the-top patriotism and false emotions.* out of **** stars",5,1,2,16 January 2002
District 9," Don't believe the hype - starts nice but get consistently worse
","Apparently audiences around the world are so starved for a movie that lives up or exceeds expectations that they are willing to take anything that is mildly interesting and proclaim it's an awesome movie. That's really the only explanation I have for the incredible overrating of 'District 9'.This sci-fi movie starts out with a very interesting premise, of aliens being stranded on earth, forced to live in a slum, and constantly abuses and scammed by the humans. The first thirty minutes of the movie, shot in mock documentary style, are actually very refreshing, interesting, and poignant. There is even some social commentary, which, although very obvious (I don't even know if this still qualifies as an allegory for Apartheid, it's extremely thinly veiled) is very welcome in a blockbuster.But the 'secrets' hinted at in the (admittedly excellent) marketing campaign are never revealed. Instead, the movie soon evolves into a fairly standard action romp/buddy movie..and carries with it just about every clich√© in the genre.Granted, the action is decent and it seeing alien weaponry disintegrate stuff never really gets old. But when there is no disintegration going on, you can't help but cringe at the unbelievable sentimental moments, the incredibly predictability of the second half of the movie, and the vast amount of plot holes.I kept hoping there would be some great twist that explained why the vastly superior aliens allowed themselves to be trapped on earth and treated like dirt, or why exactly one of them bothered to try to return home, or why on earth somebody would but surface-to-air missiles in a slum, or a dozen other things. The twist never comes though, and what we are left with is a very silly and very predictable second half of a movie.Don't believe the hype. 'District 9' has an excellent marketing campaign and an interesting premise, but it's little more than a below average action movie in the end",6,1,2,19 September 2009
Tigerland," Dull and derivative
","'Tigerland' is a drama/war movie in the vein of the first half of 'Full Metal Jacket', but unfortunately without any of the wit, cynicism and shock value that made that movie so great, and this one ultimately rather mediocre. Still, there is a lot to like. The movie is shot in almost documentary-style, making it look very authentic and gritty, and Colin Farrell does a great job as the lead.But unfortunately, the story and characters just don't hold up. Basically, there is nothing here that isn't done much and much better in 'Full Metal Jacket'. 'Tigerland' isn't really a strong anti-war movie, and it's not a good war movie either (surprisingly little action). Basically it's just a drama that happens to be about soldiers, and it uses and/or abuses nearly every clich√© that you'd expect from a movie like this: aggressive drill sergeant, rebellious recruit, pathetic loser etc. All in all it was way too slow and predictable to keep my attention. 'Tigerland' is interestingly shot, but ultimately the story and characters are too dull or derivative to make the movie really worthwhile.**1/2 out of **** stars",5,0,1,18 June 2004
Bridesmaids," It finally happened - a movie without any redeeming features whatsoever
","I had not expected this movie to be one of the worst I saw this year. After all, it has a decent rating on IMDb, it's produced by Judd Apatow, and it was lauded as the 'female hangover'. What could go wrong here? As it turns out, pretty much everything. This movie managed to literally hit all, and I really mean all, the wrong buttons for me.I guess that at least something could be said for the premise, which basically is combining a fart comedy with a romantic drama. Somehow, though, it manages to take the very worst aspects of a drama and the very worst part of a fart comedy.First of all, save for one or two instances, the humor totally misses the mark. I think I smiled maybe twice during the entire two hour running time, which must be a new low on the jokes per minute scale. The jokes just don't work..the physical humor is just plain vulgar in a bad way, and the verbal humor, while probably supposed to be sharp, just comes across as pointless angry ranting. Also, just about every scene goes on for way too long, ruining any potential there might have been.For a drama, it also fails badly. First of all, just about every character with the possible exception of the police officer love interest, is self-obsessed, unsympathetic, shallow and just plain boring. It's impossible to care about these characters as they go through the horribly overlong (the movie is slow to a fault, as well) motions and end up at the horribly predictable conclusion.I suppose some will pass of this movie as 'clever' or 'original' but in the end it's just the same old romcom template which has been done hundreds of time before..only this time with no humor, no chemistry and a lot of poorly executed 'serious' take on the subject.",2,23,47,17 October 2011
The Transporter," Very feeble attempt at cool action movie
","'The Transporter' was recommended to be my a colleague as one of the worst movies he had seen in recent years. While I usually take claims like this with a grain of salt, in this I think there was a lot of truth in it. 'The Transporter' is an extremely lackluster, uninspired attempt at making a cool action movie, which manages to screw up in almost every aspect.First, there's the story. It makes very little sense, and is so predictable and full of clich√©s that you can guess where it's going to go almost immediately. None of the characters, including the hero, are even remotely interesting, and everything is so rushed that there is no room for character development at all. You might as well watch some cardboard cut-outs.Billed as an action comedy, 'The Transporter' does indeed offer a lot of action, but only very little comedy. There are some things that are supposed to be funny, but, with two or three exceptions, they really aren't. Unless completely inept and cartoony bad guys are still supposed to be funny...That leaves only the action. And while there certainly is a lot of it, and in spite of some impressive pyrotechnics, it's for the most part really dull. Apparently, the makers of this cinematic dud have gone to great length to make sure that the main characters comes across as really cool. The problem is that the things he does aren't even remotely possible in the real world, and are for the most part so exaggerated that they become unintentionally funny rather than cool. On top of that, the hero is so completely invulnerable that any tension there might have been is completely ruined.And finally, there's the music, which is in one world awful. For some reason, just about every action sequence in the movie is accompanied by either some annoying hip hop song or some totally nondescript and monotonous rock number.I wish I could find something positive to say, but there really isn't anything I can think of. 'The Transporter' is an utterly hollow movie, with virtually no story and no characters to care about, full of action that is so exaggerated that it becomes simultaneously dull and unintentionally funny.* out of ******",2,2,5,17 September 2005
28 Days Later...," Dark, atmospheric, and fairly good
","I didn't know what to expect of this movie, but '28 Days Later' turned out to be a fairly good horror/thriller.The thing I liked best about this movie was the terrific atmoshpere. From the shots of totally deserted cities to the desolate manor later in the movie, '28 Days Later' really succeeds in creating a dark and creepy atmosphere. In addition, there are some good scary moments and some gore in the movie, but it never goes over the top and degenerates into a hack-fest.
The plot is above average as well. Although it borrows from other sources and has isn't always entirely convincing, it's good enough to carry the movie and has a couple of unexpected twists. It's also a lot darker than that of most (especially American) movies. I also like the fact that the movie gives you just enough information to figure out what is going on, instead of boring you with long explanations that ultimately only undermine the credibility. Ultimately, while this movie can be a bit slow at times and certain parts seem a bit far-fetched, this movie is certainly worth watching if you're looking for an atmospheric and creepy thriller. **1/2 out of **** stars",8,1,2,1 August 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Great effect fail to make up for total lack of story
","Steven Spielberg seems to have forgotten everything about making movies when he directed this one.Ok, the dino's are great, they move realisticly and there are a lot more of them around this time, but someone forgot to put an actual story in the movie. The first Jurassic Park movie took its time to build tension and explain a lot about dinosaurs. This time, the explanation is minimal and the movie jumps almost right into the action. After that, it's just a series of action scenes in which a lot of people get eaten.The point is, you can tell from beforehand which people will survive, and you don't care about the characters that do get killed because they have no depth at all, you usually don't even know their name. On top of that, a lot scenes seem to have been omitted from the movie, as their is often no cohesion between the scenes, and the 'story' jumps in all directions, including a totally unnecessary trip to L.A.To sum it up: this movie is incredibly shallow and lacks any kind of involvement. It's a disgrace to Steven Spielberg.",5,14,29,12 October 2001
City of God," Good, although slightly overrated
","'City of God'/'Cidade de Deus' tells the true (?) story of youth gangs in the titular city, a favela (slum) outside of Rio de Janeiro, in the sixties and seventies.The one thing that becomes immediately apparent is that 'City' is an amazingly well made movie. Even though many of the actors are inexperienced, the acting is generally excellent, and the movie is beautifully shot and very stylish, told in a semi-chronological way, with some flashbacks and some foreshadowing.Yet no matter how stylish and flashy it is, make no mistake that this is a serious and realistic movie. The grim life in the favela and the often hopeless situations of its inhabitants become very clear, and it's not surprising that many of them, including very young children, resorted to crime.The movie is brutally honest and uncompromising in its portrayal of the life of the youth gangs: violence is everywhere, and it's shown in fairly graphic ways. Crazy and impulsive gang leaders shoot innocent bystanders and even their friends without even a glimpse of remorse, and little boys act like fully-fledged gangsters and unscrupulously kill each other. It certainly isn't easy to watch, but it is both very impressive and very unsettling, especially since its based on actual events and actual people.In spite of all this praise, there are a couple of things that could have been done better. First of all, the story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a boy who manages to stay out of (most) of the gang violence and manages to become a photographer. Unfortunately Rocket is a fairly boring character, and his story, while remarkable, isn't told very interestingly. In contrast, the main gang leader, Zhe, while obviously completely crazy, is a lot more fascinating.Also, this is an ensemble movie with a very large cast, and not all characters are fleshed out very well. With so many characters, many of whom look and sound a lot like each other (also due to the fact that most scenes are fairly poorly lit, and many of the action is very frantic), it's often quite hard to figure out what exactly is happening and to whom, let alone really care about it. It's not a huge problem since in part the movie is supposed to be a bit disorienting, but one might wonder whether it wouldn't have been better to focus on a smaller number of characters.That being said, I found 'Cidade de Deus' to be a very good movie, although the 18th position it holds on the IMDb top list might be a bit overrated. Still, it's a very well-made movie, that tackles a serious subject in a very uncompromising and honest way, and several small shortcomings don't really distract from that.**** out of *****",8,1,4,4 October 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Exciting and silly at the same time
","The first part of this movie has some of the most incredible fighting scenes ever seen in any movie. They are even better then those in 'the Matrix'. That being said, the Matrix did offer a plausible explanation about why people are able to float in mid-air and walk up a wall. This movie offers no such explanation (at least, I can't remember it), which is OK during the fights because they are so exciting. However, this movie also features several very silly chase scenes in which the characters pursue each other by literally 'floating' over roof tops, and one very silly scene about a fight in the top of large pine trees. These scenes really stretch the bounds of credibility..The rest of the movie is pretty average: nice costumes, nice acting, but nothing special. The story is pretty hard to grasp and turns into a really tiring love story in the second half. All of the good fights are in the first half of the movie too, and the end of the movie is an anti-climax.All in all I really don't understand what's so great about this movie. It's well made, it has some exciting fights, but it's also plain silly, boring and cliche at too many times. I'd give it ** out of **** stars",7,1,2,11 January 2002
2012," Bit more script would be nice
","I am gonna admit it..I actually saw Transformers 2 AND this movie in one week. I probably never saw so much CGI in one week. And if these two movies prove one thing it's that pretty much anything can be done, and can be done believably, with CGI and enough money.These movies also prove that no matter how much money you spend on CGI, the movie is still not gonna amount to much if the money to pay for the CGI comes out of the script budget. While the effects are spectacular, once again the script is anything but.I do have to give the writers some credits though, since unlike the abysmal Transformers, at least this movie has some amusing characters (mostly Woody Harrelson) and some OK jokes.Sadly, everything else comes directly from the Big Book of Disaster Movie clich√©s. Relations get repaired, annoying characters get killed off in amusing ways, cute animals are spared since killing them would be too much for the audience, whereas millions of people die horribly for the sake of entertainment. And of course there are plenty of emotional scenes with bombastic music in the background that are so overdone, so badly written and so pointless that they become unintentionally funny.Yes, it's all very spectacular, it truly is. Never before have I seen destruction on this scale. It's a shame that the movie tries so hard to be spectacular that all plausibility is thrown out of the window. The amount of close calls, near escapes and utterly silly situations is so high that it becomes very hard to suspend disbelief. I can buy tidal waves that flood the entire world..I don't buy a group of misfits taking off in an airplane just in time no less than three times.'2012' does have its moments, but it has a script that is so plagued with clich√©s, fake sentiments and overall goofiness that it becomes a bit of a chore to sit through, especially given the very long running time and the endless repetitions.",5,0,0,11 December 2009
Hellboy," Somewhat of a mixed bag
","What do you get if you mix a 7-foot red demon with a temper, a fish-person, a girl who can set herself on fire, a reincarnated Rasputin, a knife-wielding gas-mask-wearing Nazi and a lot of other nonsense together? The answer is 'Hellboy', a super-hero movie that tries to set itself apart from the crowd by taking a far more over-the-top approach than most contemporary super hero movies. In spite of the rather silly premise, it actually works. Well, almost.'Hellboy' starts out very strong, with some great action sequences, an interesting background story, and a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to keep up this level of quality towards the end.After the novelty wears off, I quickly found myself becoming a bit bored, due to a number of reasons. First of all, the story really isn't up to much: it's the usually tale of the bad guys trying to bring about the end of the world, and it isn't worked out very well.The characters, with the exception of Hellboy himself, aren't that interesting either. The bad guys are fairly generic and not really frightening, and, despite some efforts to flesh them out, I didn't really care about the good guys either (contrary to, e.g. 'X-Men', or 'Spiderman'). The fact that Hellboy is just about completely invulnerable no matter what happens also doesn't help, as it kills much of the suspense.The action sequences in the start of the movie are very over-the-top, which makes them very enjoyable. Gradually, though, the movie takes on a somewhat more serious tone, which IMHO didn't work out very well. And although there are some genuinely funny parts in the movie, I found most of the one-liners and jokes not nearly as funny as they were probably intended.The special effects were a mixed bag as well: the CGI looks fairly good, but the movie also seems to use a lot of conventional effects (make-up and costumes) and they often look fairly fake.In the end, I have to say that 'Hellboy' is somewhat of a mixed bag. It starts out great, but the thin story and the poorly worked out characters, it failed to keep me really interested.*** out of *****",6,0,1,23 July 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The adaption is considerably better than the book...
","contains spoilersOnce again, Peter Jackson & crew have  made a very enjoyable and suspenseful movie out of a very dry and uneventful book. Yes indeed, I've read the books and although they certainly were epic and imaginative, I also found them to be dry, filled with unnecessary descriptions, and boring.
The movie manages to take exactly those parts of the book that are the most interesting, while adding some action and humor here and there to make the movie more appealing to large audiences. While Tolkien purists will likely be upset about (among others) the fact that Gimli has been turned into a comedian, I really liked it. Things like that are simply necessary to keep the casual movie-goer interested. On top of that, Gollem is absolutely brilliant. The scene in which he (it?) talks to himself is amazing, and the whole Frodo/Gollem relation is done very well, even if Frodo remains a whining little brat. I'm not sure about the whole Aragorn/Arwen 'romance', the movie could have done without that, and should instead have focused more on characters like Gandalf and Legolas, who get very little screen time. In terms of plot, there are a couple of points where the movie screws up a little. For example, TWICE we have somebody who was presumably dead return to the land of the living, and there are a bit too much coincidences and lucky escapes in the plot. I'm not exactly sure to which extent this is due to the source material and which part was the 'fault' of the script writers, though. While this movie is by no means perfect (especially not in terms of story), it's still a very suspenseful, epic and spectacular film. Definitely worth watching.*** out of **** stars",8,0,0,5 January 2003
The Incredibles," Charming and fun
","Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired 'Shark Tale', Pixar contains its remarkably success story with 'The Incredibles'. And while I have to say that I liked 'Finding Nemo' a bit better, 'The Incredibles' is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a 'hip' soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. 'The Incredibles' basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that 'everybody is special' (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.'The Incredibles', while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars",9,269,320,24 December 2004
I Am Legend," Not your average zombie movie
","Those that are going to see 'I Am Legend' expecting it to be yet another big blockbuster about zombies will be in for a surprise. Yes, there are typical blockbuster elements. However, they are actually pretty few and far between.Rest assured that the action, although not that plentiful, is fairly good. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it's competently done. Some have complained about crappy CGI but I had no problem with that. What is a bit bothersome was the fact that the sound effects were awfully loud, but this is probably more to blame on the poor cinema were I watched this movie.For the most part however, 'I Am Legend' is a fairly serious character study into loneliness and loss. A significant part of the movie is just Will Smith doing his daily chores and trying to survive in a deserted New York and for the most part this is done pretty well. Smith gets plenty of time to develop his character and there are some truly touching scenes. Moreover, the depiction of his post-apocalyptic life is for the most part rather convincing (he doesn't become raving mad, but's he's not 100% sane either any more).On the other hand, the flashbacks that depict what happened before New York became deserted are the standard Hollywood happy family routine, and are definitely a bit too sappy, let alone predictable. Also, Smith is not a real character actor and that shows at times.The biggest problem comes at the end however. For the first hour or so, 'I Am Legend' is a fairly suspenseful and touching tale, but then the movie suddenly goes into overdrive and before you know it, it's finished. Not only that, but the ending once again feels like a cop-out to keep the audience happy and will likely upset those that have read the book.In the end though, 'I Am Legend' is a fairly successful mix between 'Cast Away' and '28 Days Later' that combines character study and Hollywood blockbuster reasonably well, at least until it all falls together a bit in the end",7,0,1,4 January 2008
School of Rock," So-so
","'School of Rock' is one of those cases were the concept is a lot more interesting than the implementation. I really like the idea behind this movie, and I like what's it trying to do: bring rock music under the attention of the modern public who likely don't know much about it and likely have been overexposed to/poisoned by contemporary pop and R & B 'music' (I use the term music very loosely with regard to R & B).  The movie was obviously made with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of love for the subject matter, and I have to say that the music is great.That's were the good things end though. I take it that this is supposed to be a comedy, but there are little really funny parts, and most of them are in the first 30 minutes. The story is predictable and corny to the bone and the movie is far to 'cute', heading straight into the unavoidable and cliche happy ending. It's still a watchable movie, mostly because of the music and some of the one-liners, but it's not really funny and the plot is far too weak to keep you interested past the first hour or so.

Transformers," Just because it's about toys doesn't mean it has to be this kiddy
","Good action movies in my opinion have three things: good action (duh), great characters, and great humor. 'Transformers', Michael Bay's latest lackluster effort, does a decent job in the action department but fails miserably at the other two aspects.I say 'decent' job for in all honesty the action here is competent, but nothing you haven't seen before. The transformers themselves look nice, and the explosions even look very nice (explosions are probably the one thing Michael Bay is really good at), but the action sequences are all by the numbers.Also, the characters are so poorly worked out that it's hard to care about them at all, and it's painfully obvious any way that this movie is gonna play it perfectly safe and not kill of any main characters. These factors combined kill any suspense there might have been, reducing most of the action to just pretty pictures that leave you totally cold.Everything else about this movie is pretty much bogus too. First, there are the constant attempts at humor. Humor is an essential element of an action movie, but the jokes here are so lame that they probably won't even make a ten year old smile.Secondly, there's the horrible dialog. Just about every line that is not a failed attempt at humor is some kind of overblown hollow heroic phrase or something that's perfectly obvious ('Look, here comes the tank decepticon again').Oh, and since this is a Michael Bay movie, it's also full or false sentiment and bombast. Whenever something remotely dramatic or meaningful happens, everything goes to slow motion and the music swells to sickening levels. Meanwhile, the audience does not care one way or another.If you're looking for a movie with plenty of explosions that lacks any kind of heart, humor, or wit. Look no further. If you actually want something you can enjoy for 2 hours and 15 minutes, stay way clear.** out of *****",4,7,14,8 January 2008
Garden State," Charming little movie
","I didn't quite know what to expect of this movie..a comedy, written and directed by Zach Braff, who I previously only knew from the atrocious 'Scrubs' sitcom, shouldn't really amount to much, right. Fortunately, I was presently surprised.'Garden State' is at is heart a very simple boy-meets-girl story, and there really isn't much to the plot, but it's delivered in a very refreshing way.First of all, the actors all do a wonderful job. They all put in wonderfully subtle and believable performances and really make you care about them, even though some of them really have a quite limited part. It's somewhat of a shame, since most of these characters are interesting enough to want to get to know them better. Fortunately, Natalie Portman more than makes up for this in a very charming performance.Next, it's one of the most uniquely funny movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that has you constantly rolling over the floor in laughter, but it will constantly catch you by surprise with some really unexpected and surreal jokes. It might not be humour for everybody, but I definitely liked it.Finally, it's a wonderfully atmospheric movie. The excellent soundtrack and the beautiful cinematography both come together well to create a movie that's very pleasing to the eye and the ear, and basically just puts you in happy mood.'Garden State' might not be a movie that will be remembered in half a century...it's too quirky and unassuming for that. But taken at face value, it's an extremely well-made, wonderfully creative feelgood movie **** out of *****",8,1,2,25 October 2006
Shrek 2," Less of the same, but still solid entertainment
","Three years after the successful first 'Shrek' movie, we're finally treated to the inevitable sequel. And while 'Shrek 2' is still an enjoyable movie, it very clearly more of the same, or actually a bit less of the same.'Shrek 2' continues along the lines of the first movie, but all in all it seems a lot milder and a little less funny than the first movie, which made a lot of fun of fairy tales in general and Disney in particular. While this movie still does that from time to time, on the whole the jokes are more aimed at other movies and pop-culture and seem to be a lot less sharp...there's nothing here that is remotely as funny as the exploding bird from the first movie (although the dog that gets crushed comes close).On the whole, I'd even say that the movie is sometimes a bit dull. There's more story and less jokes this time around, and since the story is really predictable, I often found myself thinking 'just get on with it so we can get to the jokes again'.That being said, 'Shrek 2' does still have a lot to offer. The new character Puss in Boots is absolutely brilliant, as is John Cleese as the king of Far Far Away. There are also much more references to movies and TV series this time around, and trying to spot them all is a lot of fun. Also, the animation looks absolutely superb, and there are some very fluid and memorable action sequences.So, all in all, 'Shrek 2' still delivers. On the one hand, it's more of the same, only a bit milder and more boring. On the other hand though, there are still enough entertaining characters, jokes, and spoofs to make for an entertaining movie.***1/2 out of *****",7,1,2,9 February 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Overkill Bill
","'Kill Bill', as we now all know 'The Fourth Movie by Quentin Tarantino' is an over-the-top action spectacle that unfortunately doesn't really hit the mark. It's a decent attempt, but by no means a classic like 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. 'Kill Bill' is undeniably still a Tarantino movie: the absurd characters, the absurd situations they get into, the pointless but very cool dialogs, the deliberately corny music (once again, chosen brilliantly) and all the things that made his other movies so great are still there, but they are used a lot more sparingly than they used to be.  Instead, everything takes a back seat to the action. Normally, I wouldn't mind this, since the action is usually also quite good in QT movies, but in this case it's just overkill..the first couple of blood fountains, decapitations and dismemberments are fun, but after that it just gets old very fast...many of the gore simply isn't shocking or entertaining enough to keep my attention. The fact that you don't really care about any of the characters dying doesn't really help either. That being said, there are some truly great action scenes, like the fight between the Bride and Gogo the sadistic school girl, and some parts of the showdown with the dozens of masked yakuzas, but for every great scene, there's at least one that just drags on way too long or is just pointless. 
'Kill Bill' is far from a terrible movie, since there are still enough flares of brilliance to make it quite entertaining, but there are too many times at which the action becomes boring/overkill/pointless, or the narrative become simply a bit boring. In the end, they should have probably just cut a lot of scenes from this movie and its follow-up and just combine them into a 2 hour movie. **1/2 out of **** stars",7,0,1,15 December 2003
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo's genius is destroyed by Tom Cruise's ego
","Contrary to the first Mission Impossible movie, this time there is a plot that can actually be understood and the pacing is much better then in the first M:IUnfortunately, this is where the good points stop. The story suffers severely from ridiculous plot-twists (all those scenes in which somebody removes one of those masks are totally unbelievable), the action scenes are sometimes flashy but they are usually so over-the-top that is becomes utterly nonsensical (I mean, is it possible to ride a motor bike at over 100 mph and then making a car explode by hitting it only once in the fuel tank, while aiming by only looking in the rear view mirror of the motor cycle ?). Another fine example is the scene where Tom Cruise jumps over a 100 metre cliff for no apparent reason, reaches the top of the mountain and is shot at by helicopter with a missile that contains his orders in the form of an exploding pair of sunglasses. Why ?The movie is full of this kind of exaggerated action scenes, which are obviously only meant to show how 'cool' Tom Cruise is: he shoots like the Terminator, fights like Bruce Lee, drives like Michael Schumacher, gets women like James Bond etc. He is so invincible that it takes all the suspense out of the movie.It's really a shame that a great director like John Woo has wasted his talents on showing off Mr. Cruises ego, because there are some points in the movie where Woo's genius actually showes up, but they are few and far between.

2001: A Space Odyssey," The movie equivalent of an empty canvas
","While I'm generally a fan of Kubrick's movies ('A Clockwork Orange' and 'Full Metal Jacket' are masterpieces), I think this one of the most overrated movies ever. The basic problem to me is that 'Space Odyssey' isn't really a movie but more a series of moving images with some music. Granted, the images are very beautiful, the effects are spectacular for the time, and the excellent music fits the visuals very well. But no amount of audiovisual flair is enough to save over 2 hours of movie if there's just nothing else going on. And to me, that's the case here. There's virtually no plot, no character development, or anything else to really keep you interested. Sure, there are some hints at a deeper meaning, but they are so vague and ambiguous that they can be pretty much explained however the viewer wants. I'm not saying that there might not be some amazing message in there, but so far I've yet to find somebody who can come up with a really convincing explanation. Most of the time, people I talk to who like this movie completely fail to explain why they like it or what's it about. Should it be about something? To me, yes. To me, movies should either entertain, tell a good story, or have a good message. This movie seems to do neither. It's too slow to entertain, it certainly doesn't have much of a story, and it also doesn't appear to have much of a message either. Still, I can understand that people like it just for its visuals, but then again I suspect that there are also many people that claim to like it because they don't want to appear stupid. In the end, I'd say this is the movie equivalent of an empty piece of canvas that is turned into a piece of art called 'the vast emptiness'. It's a clever trick, but it's ultimately rather pointless, and many people only see a meaning behind it because they want to see it, not because it's necessarily actually there.** out of ***** (because of the amazing visuals and sound)",4,12,24,20 February 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Just when you thought movie makers were running out of ideas
","Just when you think that movie makers have finally run out of ideas, between all lame thrillers, ridiculous action movies and vomit-inducing romantic comedies, something as fresh, original, and pure as 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' comes across. Thank you!I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Charlie Kaufman's other work ('Being John Malkovich' was not interesting or funny, just weird) but here he has really outdone himself, as has the rest of the people involved in the movie. Jim Carrey once again shows that he can really act (as he did before in 'The Truman Show'), Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst prove that they can do more than be the 'damsel in distress' and even Elijah Wood seem to be able to distance himself from Frodo. The real winner here is the script though. It succesfully avoids all the cliches and false sentiments that often plague modern movies and manages to deliver a truly touching story about real people and real emotions, while also being surprisingly funny at times. Also, in spite of the rather bizarre premise, the movie never comes across as too far-fetched or unbelievable. 
What else is there to like? Well, a lot. The cinematography is beautiful (the scenes in which Joel's memories are erased are very creative), the movie plays around with illusion and reality in a really interesting way (it's left to the viewer to figure out what exactly is going on. This never gets as complicated as in, say, 'Mulholland Drive', but I like movies that don't spell everything out for you). The only complaint I have about 'Sunshine' is that is seems to slightly run out of steam near the end. It's like the writers couldn't choose between a happy or a sad ending and delayed the choice as long as possible. Ultimately, I can more than live with the ending they choose, but they could have chosen it a bit sooner.But that's a really minor complaint. Apart from that, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is an incredibly well-made, very creative, and genuinely touching movie. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,3 August 2004
From Hell," Atmospheric but confusing
","'From Hell' is a movie that's obviously done very competently: the acting is great, the costumes and sets look very convincing, the camera work is good, in short everything shows signs of quality.It's a shame that this quality doesn't extend into the story. While it certainly is creative and sheds an interesting light on the 'Jack the Ripper' case, it's not very coherent or believable. In fact, it's a complete mess. After watching about half the movie, I simply forgot about the plot and just enjoyed the dark, moody atmosphere and the strangely enjoyable gory moments. If you want to see an interesting mood piece with some suspenseful moments, check out this movie. If you want to see a movie that actually offers a sensible story in addition to everything this movie has to offer, check out the far superior 'Sleepy Hollow'. ** out of **** stars",6,1,2,21 April 2003

","what do you get when you combine a story of one of the finest SF writers there is, with one of the best action directors there is, with one of the biggest action heroes there is? The answer: Total RecallThis is a great movie that has it all: good, very exciting and hard action, a great story without huge holes, and with some plot twists that really leave you thinking, and of course Paul Verhoeven's perfect use of sarcasm and (not so subtle) humour.Of course, the acting is not top-notch (Arnie just isn't a very good actor), the bad guy (Michael Ironside) is a cliche, but Sharon Stone as the bitchy wife makes up for a lot.

The Da Vinci Code," A flawed but still entertaining adaptation
","Let me start by saying that I'm quite a fan of Dan Brown. His books, while often over the top and not very believable, do have a lot going for them: lots of suspense, high pace, interesting facts and theories, and fun characters.Ron Howard's movie adaptation stays remarkably true to the book, so many of the things that apply to the novel apply to the film as well. That means that if you're looking for something really deep or thought-provoking, you should look elsewhere. But if you want to be entertained, you could do a whole lot worse than watching the 'Da Vinci Code'.For the most part, I've found DVC a reasonably fast-paced and fun action thriller. After a somewhat slow start, it actually becomes fairly suspenseful roller-coaster ride full of twists and turns. The fast pacing and constant stream of information that is poured over the viewer almost hide the fact that the actual plot as such is even less believable than that of the book, though. The ease with which the main characters elude the police at every turn and solve the most complex riddles in mere seconds is really a bit hard to grasp.That being said, having a 125 million dollar budget certainly helps the movie. For one, the budget really shines through in the production values: DVC is beautifully shot and very atmospheric.Secondly, it allowed the makers to hire a very talented cast of actors who mostly do a good job. Ian McKellen is obviously having the time of his life and steals every scene he's in. Jean Reno does yet another clich√© French cop part, but he's very good at that part so I don't mind. And Audrey Tautou is just as lovely as ever. Oddly enough, Tom Hanks is surprisingly disappointing. His Robert Langdon goes through the movie almost as a zombie, devoid of any kind of emotion. Paul Bettany as Silas didn't really work either...he wasn't nearly as frightening as he was supposed to be.In the end, DVC is a reasonable adaptation of a good book. It's for the most part an beautiful, well-made and entertaining action thriller that contains some amusing theories. It might have been better with a director and script-writer who were willing to take a bit more risk and/or add a bit more of themselves into the movie instead of sticking so closely to the book, but it's still solid entertainment *** out of *****",6,1,3,20 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Faithful to the book, but missing something
","For a book adaptation, 'Harry Potter and the Socerer's/Philosopher's  stone' is a fairly good effort. It remains as faithful to the book as possible, and leaves out very little in term of story. Unfortunately, it DOES leave out most of the humour of the book (which was to be expected, you simply can't put all those funny descriptions in the movie), but it sadly doesn't replace them with much else.I agree with many people that the main problem with this movie is the direction. We all know and love the story, the acting is generally good, the special effects are adequate (some shots are really fake!) etc , but it all feels so very dry, the director didn't really add his own touch to the movie, like really good directors like Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg would do. Most of the famous actors are severely underused, too.
Most of this of course doesn't really matter as kids will still love this movie, but as it is, 'Harry Potter' is more like a 'painting by numbers'- exercise, while in the right hands it could have been a Picasso.",6,0,1,30 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A fun yet somewhat lacking roller-coaster ride
","When I heard about this movie I my first reaction was: 'how in the world are they going to fit this book into a movie'. The fourth installment in the Harry Potter series (the book that is) is probably the most complex and dense of the series, so distilling it into a movie certainly wouldn't be easy without losing a lot in translation.Much more than the other Potter movies, 'The Goblet of Fire' is an action blockbuster. The emphasis in the movie is clearly on the spectacular trials that make of the Tri-Wizard tournament, and, granted, these have been translated to the screen in an astonishing way. The special effects are among the best, the action is riveting, and there's plenty of suspense.Also, I have to say that this movie was the first genuinely funny Potter movie. While the other movies have sometimes been good for a couple of chuckles, the middle part of 'Goblet of Fire' is a complete hoot, and finally does the humor of the books justice.All this comes at a price though. In order to fit everything into a movie of manageable length, a lot of comprises have been made. The story has been simplified quite a bit, and a lot of the details that make the books so great have unfortunately been omitted. Having read the book, I could follow the plot just fine, but I suspect that without prior knowledge, it would be quite easy to get completely lost.Also, everything moves at such a breakneck pace that it's really hard to keep up: one dangerous situation isn't over yet, or another one has already presented itself. Sure, it makes for a great roller-coaster ride, but ultimately also for a rather shallow one, since character development is not one of the movie's strong points, and ultimately it's hard to really care about characters don't really know.In this of artistic quality, this movie probably falls somewhere in the middle. It's not nearly as good as the hugely atmospheric and superbly made third part, but it's still a huge improvement over the rather pedestrian first two parts. Also, the acting could still use a little work. Ralph Fiennes is great, but a lot of the other admittedly great actors are underused, and the rest of the acting is passable but nothing great.All in all, this is a good, but not a great, movie in its own right. It's a tremendously fun, if shallow, thrill ride. Compared to the book though, there's definitely something missing.***1/2 out of *****",8,0,1,24 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Good action hidden in incomprehensible mess of a story
","OK, first of all I'd like to say that I really liked the first Matrix movie. It had a nonsensical story, but the good action sequences more than made up for this, and the story had some really clever parts like 'deja vus' being glitches in the Matrix. Now, four years later the sequel has arrived and it certainly delivers what most people wanted it to deliver: extremely stylish and spectacular action sequences. Though not all of them are equally interesting, some of them like the highway chase and the fight with 30+ 'Mr Smiths' are technical masterpieces, and very exciting. Occasionally, things get a bit ridiculous, like when Neo is suddenly able to fly (who is he, Superman?), but this is forgivable given the fact that it could have probably be a whole lot worse.In term of story though, 'the Matrix Reloaded' screws up big time. I don't know how they did it, but somehow the writers came up with something that's ten times more far-fetched, confusing, and unlikely than the first movie, which was already stretching the bounds of credibility. The story is certainly creative, but it's covered in such a load of heavy quasi-philosophical dialogue and computer-related mumbo-jumbo that it's way too heavy for an action movie (or practically any other movie, for that matter). Also, why on earth does this movie contain a pointless five-minute party scene which could double for the world's largest R & B clip? It was so utterly out of place and boring that I have no idea what the creators were thinking. Did they have some extra budget left or something? In that case, they should have probably spent it to improve the story instead of wasting it on pointless interludes.Anyway, this movie would have probably been a lot better off if it had just tried to be an action movie with a simple (but credible) plot and breathtaking action sequences. Instead, we get a movie that tries to pass itself off as a deep work of philosophy, but fails for the most part.All in all, not a terrible movie (the action makes it worthwile) but ultimately too vague and confusing to be really good.",6,0,0,18 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," A good but not great movie about a seldom seen side of WWII
","Well, what can I say. Not often before have I been both so impressed and so disappointed by a movie at the same time. What 'Enemy at the Gates' does well, it does extremely well. But I can't help but feel that it could have been a whole lot better.First, the good things: first of all, there's the excellent opening sequence which shows thousands of Soviet soldiers being ferried across the river towards the battle of Stalingrad. They're being shelled by artillery, shot at by Stuka dive bombers, and executed by their own officers if they try to flee. The utter chaos and desperateness of these early scenes rivals those of 'Saving Private Ryan's' Normandy beach landing. Very well done indeed.The rest of the movie also features some enormously impressive and very tense sniper duels between the Russian hero and his German antagonist. These scenes are easily among the most nail-bitingly suspenseful I've ever seen.For the most part, 'Enemy at the Gates' is also a very well-made movie. The acting is great (especially by Ed Harris), everything looks very authentic, and the ruins of Stalingrad look very impressive. There are some fairly fake CGI airplanes in a couple of scenes, but that's about the only technical flaw I can think of.What could have been a lot better though is the story. I understand the need to take some liberties with reality in order to make for a more interesting narrative, but the story here feels rather contrived, relying of a lot of coincidences. The ending in particular is a let-down. After so many good scenes, it feels like a huge anti-climax.Also of note is the awkward love story between the hero and a female Russian soldier. It feels out of place, it's very clich√©d, and it actually takes up way too much time that could have been better spent on either real character development or more sniper duels.All in all, it's still a very suspenseful and impressive movie, but I can't help but feel that with a bit more work on the story it could have been so much more.**** out of *****",8,1,3,7 February 2005
A Beautiful Mind," And once again, Hollywood screws up
","From what I've seen and heard, John Forbes Nash has achieved and been through enough in his live to fill an interesting movie with. Unfortunately, 'A Beautiful Mind' is not that movie. Instead, it appears to be a standard case of Hollywood taking a potentially interesting story and dumbing it down to please a large audience. It's hard to describe where exactly this movie goes wrong. On the surface level, everything is OK. The acting is fine (Ed Harris once again steals the show), the atmosphere is authentic, and the movie is beautifully shot.This makes it a real shame that they didn't do anything more with the story. Instead of a complex story about real people, we get a simplified tale full of one-dimensional over-glorified characters (Jennifer Connelly is too nice to believe), a simplistic message ('love conquers all') and corny dialog. And to make matters even worse, all of this is drowned under an incredible load of (false) sentiment and bombastic music. This movie doesn't just want to tell a story, it also tells you how you should feel about that story.This could have been an interesting movie, if it had just stuck to the facts and let people judge for themselves what they think about Mr Nash and his story. Instead, it is turned into a overly romanticized formula piece devoid of any real complexity. **1/2 out of ***** stars (because of the technical quality)",5,3,6,2 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An improvement over the first part
","After the somewhat underwhelming 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' I wasn't in a hurry to watch this second Harry Potter movie, but I finally got around to it and I'd have to say that it's a definite improvement over the first one, although there's still a lot that could be done better.
The best thing about this movie is that it's a lot darker and more mature than the first one. Most of the childish humor is gone, the characters are far more convincing this time around (the children have obviously grown in their roles), and the tone of this movie is definitely more serious than that of the first one. The plot yet again sticks very closely to the book, although it's a shame that in spite of a 2+ hour running time, almost all things that were not essential to the main plot have been left out or marginalized (e.g. Lockheart barely plays a role of importance, and none of the sharp humor from the book makes it into the movie).  I also think that too much time is spent on the action sequences (e.g. car ride, quidditch match) and the climax. They look a lot better than in the first movie, but they're all stretched way too long and take up time that could have been better used to flesh out the world of Harry Potter a bit more. With a bit more focus on characters and details instead of endless action sequences, this movie could have been great. As it is, it's certainly watchable, but it still feels like the director took the easy way out.

War of the Worlds," Atmospheric but hole-ridden tale of the apocalypse
","Whether you like 'War of the Worlds' (WotW), the latest Spielberg/Cruise collaboration, probably depends on your expectations. If you're looking for another one of Spielberg's more 'serious' movies like 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan', you're in for a disappointment. However, judged as a summer blockbuster, WotW more than delivers, although it clearly suffers from some severe flaws.The most important of them is that the script simply doesn't make much sense. It's just full of amazing coincidences, lucky escapes, and lots of things that are simply very hard to grasp. Just to name a few: are we really supposed to believe that out of thousands of cars, Cruise's is the only one that keeps running? Are we really supposed to believe that Cruises's son makes it to Boston alive all by himself? Why is somebody still filming the aliens after an EMP burst has supposedly knocked out all electronic equipment? It's a shame that not more attention was paid to ironing out all these implausibilities, because for the most part 'WotW' is still a very good movie. For one, it's an amazingly suspenseful movie that really kept me on the edge of my seat. The action sequences are frantic and brutal (as they should be), and the scene in which Cruise tries to evade an electronic eye in a basement is simply amazing (even if it's copied from the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park).In general the movie succeeds in creating a wonderfully apocalyptic atmosphere. The alien tripods are really ominous and threatening, and there are a lot of unpleasant images that really help to create an atmosphere in which it actually feels like the survival of the human race is at stake. If only more action movies managed to create this level of immersion and suspense...Of course, Steven Spielberg wouldn't be Steven Spielberg if he didn't try to bring out the positive amidst all this despair. In this case, it comes in the form of divorced father Cruise growing closer to his alienated children again. Given Spielberg's knack for sentimentalism, I feared the worst here, but stays within acceptable boundaries. Cruise and Fanning do a convincing job, and the scenes between them never become too sentimental. There are still a couple of moments that made me cringe, but I've seen far worse.That being said, the movie does get out of hand towards the end. I'm told that the demise of the aliens actually stays true to the book, but it feels very much like a 'deus ex machina', and is hugely anticlimactic. Also, in the last scene in which Cruise finds his wife's family back, everything that is wrong with the movie comes together (with a vengeance). The ending both makes no sense whatsoever, and enormously sentimental.In spite of its flaws, I still immensely enjoyed this movie. It's without a doubt one of the most atmospheric and suspenseful movie I've seen in a long while, and in this case that more than outweighs the poorly thought-out plot and the horrible ending.***1/2 out of *****",7,0,1,4 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," There will be boredom, mostly
","For a while this movie did really great on the IMDb list, which urged me to go and see it. Right now, it seems to be in something of a free fall, and I have to say that I can understand why. 'There will be blood' gained a lot of hype because of the supposedly phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and that probably hid the fact that this movie is not that special.Well, to get the obvious points of out the way first: yes, the performance by DDL is indeed very very good. It's powerful, it's menacing, it's occasionally very funny and it procudes 2 or 3 really memorable scenes.Such a shame that there really is not much of a movie to back up the acting. 'There will be blood' is a movie that goes more for atmosphere and pretty pictures than for actual content, and that hurts.The previews present this as an epic struggle between Plainview (Day-lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). This is not true. Instead it's 2.5 hours of watching to an extremely unpleasant, extremely unconscientious, extremely calculating and extremely violent person making short work of everybody that opposes him. There is no struggle here, or real plot. Plainview just disposes (either verbally or physically) of whomever he does not like.Which could theoretically still have made for an interesting movie, but that's also not the case here. The characters are not developed well (we never find out why Plainview is so nasty or why he dislikes everything but the kitchen sink), the plot moves at a snail's pace and does not really go anywhere, the pictures are admittedly pretty but every shot lasts too long, and the music is pretty bad.Yes, there is a mostly justified jab at religion/Christianity here: (Christian) religion was and is often abused to gain power and manipulate people. Then again his messenger is a character that abhors religion yet manipulates and schemes even more than the priests. what exactly is Andersen trying to say here? In the end 'There will be Blood' is mostly art-house fluff I'm afraid: an interesting but poorly delivered message packed in two and a half hours of pretty pictures and annoying music. Day-Lewis's performance, no matter how great, is no way near enough to make up for that.",5,1,3,1 August 2008
Ice Age," Hit and miss animation
","Back in 2002, animation movies were really becoming hugely popular, so it's no surprise that Fox decided to jump on the bandwagon with their first real effort at a CGI movie. The result, 'Ice Age', is watchable but certainly no match for the Pixar and Dreamworks competition.To start with the good things, all the scenes involving the frantic squirrel/rat ('Skrat') character trying to hide his nuts everywhere are simply great. The same is true for the part involving the hilariously stupid and suicidal dodos.As for real laughs, that's about it though. There are some occasionally funny bits, but for the most part 'Ice Age' is too predictable and repetitive to be really funny. The constant bickering between the main characters gets old really fast, and the Sloth character in particular often crosses the line between funny and just downright annoying.Don't expect anything from the story or the characterization either. I don't mind that the plot is predictable (let's face it, most animation movies have similar plots) but it's so sickeningly cute and delivered in such a pedestrian, play-it-safe manner that it should really appeal to kids only. The characters also left me completely cold, other than that I felt sorry for Skrat.As for the animation itself, I have to say in general that it's below par, even by 2002 standards. This might have been intentional and for the most part the overly cartoony style works reasonably well, but don't expect to marvel at the visuals.In the end, I'd have to say Ice Age is still watchable. I didn't care much for the fairly dull characters and the overly cute and basic plot but there are enough funny bits to mostly make up for that.**1/2 out of ****",5,1,2,28 March 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Good, but hasn't aged all that well
","There's no doubt that in the time this movie was released, it made quite an impact, an in many aspects it's still a good movie. The anti-racist message this movie carries might not be as bold as when the movie was released, but since racism is still happening around the world, it never hurts to warn against it. No problems here.Overall, the movie also makes a well-made impression. The acting is good (I'm surprised that a movie this old sports such good performances by children), telling everything from the perspective of the little girl work surprisingly well, too, and the movie is very honest and direct, without the sentimentality or audience manipulation you'd probably see in (most) modern movies about such serious themes. However, I think this movie hasn't aged particularly well. By now, we've just come to expect a bit more of movies in terms of plot and cinematography. In 'To Kill a Mockingbird' the plot is rather simple, the pacing very slow (with way too much time spent on the children and their games), and the cinematography very static. Ultimately, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is still a well-made, genuinely honest and touching movie with a message that manages to still be quite good in spite of its (when compared to modern movies) cozy pacing, static cinematography, and somewhat simple plot*** out of **** stars",7,2,8,30 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not everything I hoped for, but a decent conclusion of the prequel trilogy nonetheless
","After almost thirty years, George Lucas has finally finished (at least, for now), the Star Wars saga. And while the first trilogy will likely go down in history like a timeless classic, the second trilogy, concluded by 'Revenge of the Sith' quite probably won't. The good news, however, is that it does at least end in a fairly worthwhile way.'Revenge of the Sith' picks up as the Clone Wars are nearing their conclusion. Obi-Wan an Anakin are lauded heroes of the republic, but Anakin is still frustrated because he isn't given everything he thinks he is due. Senator Palpatine uses this frustration and Anakin's fear of losing his beloved Padme to turn him to the dark side, and finally overthrow the republic and destroy the Jedi.Of course, the story of Episode III was pretty much known before the movie was even made. Surprisingly, it does include a couple of surprises, and as a whole the story is certainly serviceable, as long as you don't think too deeply about it. At the very least, it did manage to make Anakin's fall to the dark side plausible. Also, this movie actually manages to evoke some emotion, something the very flat episodes I and II never did. This is perhaps the darkest part of all Star Wars movies yet, and that goes a long way towards making it a lot more interesting.The one aspect where 'Revenge' really shines is in the action sequences, though. Although they're clearly very much dominated by CGI, the effects look a lot less fake than those in 'Attack of the Clones', and are usually quite believable. There are some really spectacular lightsaber battles in the movie, with the final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin really standing out. It's a shame that relatively little is done with the big spaceship battle in the beginning and the invasion of Kashyyk though. It's also a shame that when the Clone Troopers turn on the Jedi, practically all the Jedi are eliminated almost in the blink of an eye. Isn't a jedi supposed to be able to single-handedly take out a small army? Also, it's a bit of a shame that George Lucas didn't hire somebody else to direct this movie or write the dialogs. Lucas is a fine action director and has a lot of imagination, but he really doesn't know how to write an interesting conversation. For the most part, the acting in 'Revenge' is as wooden as ever, and the dialogs are still quite jarring at times. The romance between Padme and Anakin will probably go down in history as one as the most unconvincing in movie history. Also, most of the attempts at humor really don't work this time around.That being said, I still enjoyed this movie. While it's not everything I hoped for, it does provide lots of excellent action sequences and a tragic storyline that makes for far more interesting material than the childishness of Episode I or the somewhat hollow Episode II. It's a shame though that the wooden acting and the sometimes atrocious dialog somewhat bring down what would have otherwise been a really great movie.***1/2 out of *****",7,0,0,12 November 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Good, but not THAT good
","Contains minor spoilers'The Shawshank Redemption' has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are absolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are very likeable and the 'bad guys' (warden + guards) are really evil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It has some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist at the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the persistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets him down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in himself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies cliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird, and the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace is a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it left me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At least not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well, it's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars",8,0,1,28 November 2002
Shrek," Funny, but not satirical enough
","This movie was recommended to me by a number of people, who all told me how great it was at making fun of Disney movies and other cartoon cliches. Well, although 'Shrek' certainly makes some fun at Disney, that alone doesn't make it such a great movie. In fact, I was a bit disappointed at how little satire there actually was in this movie. Also, by the end of the movie it succumbs to the very same romantic cliches found in every Disney movie, which I hoped Shrek would avoid.But as a whole, I think there are still enough jokes left in this movie to make it great! Especially the donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, provides great comic relief and proves that Murphy can actually be funny, after the 'Nutty Professor' and 'Dr. Dolittle' debacles. Cameron Diaz is charming as ever, but I never liked Mike Myers and this movie didn't change that.
Finally, this movie has absolutley beautiful special effects. All in all it's a solid comedy with great voice acting, but it's not the definite 'Disney-killer' or something, because it fails in the satire department.*** out of ****",8,0,0,14 January 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," A pleasant surprise
","OK, I would not normally have watched this movie, but I won it in some stupid contest, and decided to give it a try. Boy, was I suprised.
In doing away with the 'cuteness' and message so often found in Disney movies, the creators of 'The Emperor's New Groove' have made a truly funny and fast-paced little flick, which is fondly reminiscent of the Looney Tunes cartoons of days long past. I'd say it's not so good as Shrek (which of course has superior technology), but it comes pretty close, and that's without having to resort to spoofing others.A pleasant and very likeable movie. *** out of **** stars",8,1,2,29 April 2002
Signs," Suspense over Substance
","'Signs' is a movie that's mainly interesting because it's genuinely scary (at least in the cinema). The director M. Night Shyamalan proves beyond a doubt that he's very adept at creating suspenseful moments out of basically nothing and uses suggestion and vagueness to build the tension. It works really well. The rest of the movie is so-so. The acting by the adults (Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix) is quite strong but the little kids are once again nearly unbearable to watch, mainly because they say things no kid of their age would normally say. The story is kept intentionally vague since it serves only as a framework for the suspenseful scenes, which I think is excusable. It's not like we needed a new 'Indepedence Day' anyway. 
Where the movie does go wrong, however, is in the message, 'Everything happens for a reason', it's trying to get across. There's way too much quasi-religious talk in this movie for my taste. I don't believe in predestination and this movie certainly didn't make me change my mind about that. The whole alien invasion (including all the lives that it claims) seems to happen simply to give Mel Gibson his faith back, and Mel's son has asthma solely because he wouldn't die of the alien nerve gas that way? Come on... Without the message and the religious angle, I would have loved this movie. As it is, the movie is still pretty good (since it's really scary) but not a classic like 'Sixth Sense' was. **1/2 out of **** stars",7,1,4,20 November 2002
The Deer Hunter," Lots of atmosphere, little story
","I generally like movies dealing with the Vietnam war. Several of them, like 'Full Metal Jacket', 'Platoon', and 'Apocalypse Now' I consider to be true classics. I had heard many good things about 'The Deer Hunter', and thus I had quite high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.'The Deer Hunter' focuses on how the Vietnam war changes the lives of three all-American friends, Niko (Christopher Walken), Michael (Robert DeNiro) and Steven (John Savage). They live relatively happy, normal lives in a small American town, then get sent to Vietnam, where they become heavily traumatized (to say the least) and upon returning to the USA, realize that nothing will ever be the same again.That's certainly a relevant and interesting story for a movie, and when 'The Deer Hunter' first came out I can understand that it must have hit like a bomb since it dealt with a theme that most people weren't prepared to face just yet, and it does so in a pretty outspoken manner. More than twenty-five years later, though, I can't help but feel that it's not really such a good movie.The first problem is the pacing. The movie weighs in at about three hours, but there's just not enough happening to justify that running time. The director spends an inordinate amount of time on scenes that are merely meant to establish the atmosphere instead of developing story or characters. During many of the sequences, either nothing or something very mundane happens. Yes, I understand that the main characters are supposed to be normal American boys so many of the things they do are mundane, but Cimino is way overdoing it here.The slow pacing is even more jarring given the fact that the movie's story isn't told very well. It's not very coherent, there are some rather large leaps in time during which it's left totally unclear what happens to the characters, and some of the things make very little sense (e.g. Walken's character surviving dozens of games of Russian roulette...while that's not impossible, it's very very implausible). Some of the time spent on fleshing out the atmosphere could and should have been used to improve the flow of the story.That being said, the movie definitely isn't without its moments. The Russian roulette scenes are spine-chilling and really deserve the legendary status they have achieved. The acting by DeNiro and Walken is great as well, and the music is beautiful and fitting. Unfortunately, Meryl Streep and John Savage are a lot less convincing. Streep is melodrama at its worst here, and Savage overacts heavily, if you ask me.Finally, it's a bit of a shame that the movie takes such a one-sided look at the Vietnam war. It only looks at the effects of the atrocities committed by the VC on the Americans, not at the validity of the war as a whole or the role of the USA. You'd think that after being heavily traumatized, the three boys might at least become a bit angry with the USA for sending them into such a senseless war, but instead the United States are glorified in the cringe-inducing final scene. I understand that the time wasn't right for a real analysis of the Vietnam war, but the approach taken here (evil VCs traumatize innocent American boys) seems to be a bit too simplistic.So, in the end that leaves me very disappointed with this movie. While it's certainly a relevant movie about a relevant subject, I don't think that subject was handled all that well. A couple of brilliant scenes and some good acting IMHO fail to make up for a really slow pace, a so-so story, and a very one-sided look at the Vietnam war..**1/2 out of *****",5,10,19,4 October 2005
Final Destination," Disappointing
","CONTAINS SPOILERSI had heard some rather good things about this movie, and was kind of looking forward to finally seeing it, but unfortunately it turned out to be a rather big disappointment. I was looking for a clever thriller, but instead I got a slightly above average slasher movie (group of teens gets killed by maniac, you know the drill). OK, the 'maniac' in this case is intangible (it's none other than 'Death' in person) but it's still a movie about a group of kids getting slaughtered in strange ways.In fact, the entire movie amounts to little more than a series of freak accidents that are so unlikely and exaggerated that I couldn't help but laugh during a large number of them. The line 'don't move' the main character says to his teacher while she's bleeding to death, pinned to the ground by a very large stake knife was absolutely hilarious! It's not like she CAN actually go anywhere, is it? I also found the plot behind the accidents (some people have cheated Death and now Death wants his revenge) to be more absurd than interesting or mystical. If Death really wanted them dead so eagerly, I'm sure he could come up with something a little less absurd than this.
Also, the lead actor is pretty unconvincing. He reminds be of the runner-up in the Dutch version of 'American Idol' and is equally untalented. The rest of the acting is passable but that's about it. All in all, I found this to be a rather hollow movie. It's reasonably original, but it's definitely more a slasher movie than a really good thriller like 'Sixth Sense'. *1/2 out of **** stars",4,2,3,27 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," More of the same (which means it's very very good)
","CONTAINS SPOILERSPeter Jackson finally concludes his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy with 'The Return of the King'. As could be expected, the movie is about the same as the first two installments in the series, which in this case is of course of good thing. Like the other movies, 'RotK' looks absolutely marvellous. The landscapes are beautiful, as are the special effects and architecture. There are still a couple of 'fake' moments, but over 95% of the time it's completely convincing. The mass battle scenes, already the highlight in 'Two Towers', are even more spectacular this time around.In addition to great action scenes, the movie offers a lot of suspense and a feeling of impending doom, and even though many of the characters are quite flat the movie does manage to really make you care about them. The relationship between Frodo, Sam and Gollem is particularly well done.Still, there are some small downsides to this movie. For one, I still think there are too much coincidences and very lucky last-minute escapes/rescues in the movie. The way the battle for Minas Tirith is finally won is an anticlimax (it just feels cheap), as is the ease with which Sam and Frodo simply march into Mordor and destroy the One Ring right under Sauron's nose. I also think the ending gets drawn out way too much...the movie should have ended after the coronation of Aragorn, instead of boring us to death with 20 pointless minutes of tying up loose ends. In the end though, 'Return of the King' is a worthy conclusion of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story has a bit too many flaws, but its execution is (except for the very end) nearly perfect and results in a spectacular, beautiful, suspenseful and very touching movie.***1/2 out of **** stars",9,0,1,1 January 2004
The Truman Show," Proofs that Jim Carrey can actually ACT
","This movie is probably most memorable for showing that Jim Carrey can actually ACT. I basically hated him in every other movie, mostly in DUMB AND DUMBER, the MASK and THE CABLE GUY. In this movie, however, he plays remarkably restrained and he actually shows emotions. WAY TO GO, Jim.
The rest of the movie is basically very entertaining. There are a lot of interesting touches, such as Truman's wife constantly doing advertisements for all kinds of rubbish at the worst possible times, and the reactions of the people viewing the show. The idea behind the movie raises some interesting issues on privacy and on exactly what the media should be allowed to, although these issues could have been investigated a little further. When you really start to think about it, however, the movie just doesn't add up. The idea of a TV studio the size of a small island and a man not knowing that he's in it are just a little too much to swallow, especially when you realize that nobody on the island can do ANYTHING at all. I mean, is it that hard to actually hire a bus driver or a ferry captian instead of an actor ? It's really a shame that this movie isn't as convincing as it could have been, but other then that it's very entertaining.*** out of ****",8,0,1,6 January 2002
The Matrix," Style makes up for story
","'The Matrix' is a very interesting action/sci-fi movie, that's definetely more memorable for the cinematography and action sequences then it is for the story.I won't go into details here, but the story, although certainly original, is really too far-fetched and sometimes downright nonsensical. The story does, however, offer a plausible explanation as to why all the exorbitant action sequences (people stalling in mid-air, running against walls, dodging bullets etc) are possible, and in the end it's those action sequences that make it all worthwile: they are simply very cool.It doesn't happen often, but in this case I'd say that the 'coolness' of the action sequences more then makes up for any plot holes. All in all 'The Matrix' is excellent.*** out of **** stars",9,0,0,21 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Everybody's favourite space fairytale
","With Episode 2 currently in the theaters, and many people complaining about how shallow that movie is, and how unbelievable the story and how much better the original trilogy was etc, I think it's time to make a comment.
First of all, Star Wars movies have NEVER,EVER,EVER had a good story. They're basically about the age-old tale of good vs. evil, set in various locations in a galaxy far far away. The plot is usually full of holes, the whole thing often depends on extreme coincidences and every Imperial superweapon has a verious obvious flaw that any apprentice engineer could have found in five minutes. This movie, Episode 4, is probably the most basic of them all. The main point is, Star Wars was never SUPPOSED to be about the story. It's basically a lot of (brilliant) nonsense put together, and it works just fine because the makers know that it's nonsense and make the best of it. That being said, the level of creativity in making up all those aliens, vehicles, space ships etc. is unmatched.When we look at Episode 4 specifically, we see a corny story full of lucky escapes and loose ends about a farmboy saving a princess, and the Universe too, while he is at it. The acting is nothing special, the dialogue can be god-awful at times (OK, not a bad as Episode 1), and the first hour of the movie is quite slow. But it's still a lot of fun ! Star Wars is entertainment and escapism in it's purest form. It was 25 years ago and it still is. *** out of **** stars",8,1,4,24 June 2002
300," A striking example of everything that is wrong with action movies these days
","'300' sounded like a great movie. I like spectacle movies, I loved Sin City, so what could go possible wrong with this one. Well, just about everything. The only thing '300' has going for it, is that it looks nice and that some of the action is not a total loss. Other than that, it's a colossally hollow and obnoxious movie.'300' is a movie that takes itself fairly seriously (it's about big themes like courage and freedom, you know) and is mainly concerned with making everything looks as 'cool' as possible, but it's so silly and overdone that it become a cross between an enormous bore and something unintentionally funny.I know that action movies do not emphasize story or plot development, but '300' pushes the neglect for these elements to a new low. There is no character development, and what passes for a story makes no sense whatsoever (even though it's based on real events. Emphasis here on 'based on'. This has nothing to do with history or reality).Well, is at least the action decent then? Not really. While it looks very nice at times and it sure is pretty bloody, it's not really all that exciting. Fights lack any kind of logic and the Spartans are so invincible that there isn't any suspense either.And then, there's the yelling. When people in this movie are not fighting, they try to best each other at shouting about how courageous and manly they are. Which is all good and well, if it weren't for the fact that what they are shouting is so corny and overdone that you can't help but laugh out loud, which is quite probably not the intended effect.Also, what troubles me is that much of this movie is presented as 'historically accurate' even though it has next to nothing to do with real events. It has all been simplified and twisted to get a point across (how the good, freedom-loving west overcomes the evil, tyrannic east). Of course there is artistic freedom, but portraying the Spartans (who by and large were the fascists of ancient Greece) as proponents of democracy and freedom is both laughable and sad.To summarize, this movie is a joke. It looks nice and that's about it. It has no characters, no logic or coherence, and awful lot of cringe-inducing pomp and machismo, and a complete disregard of history.",3,2,5,2 March 2008
Gladiator," Finally, a movie that takes its time to tell a story
","After seeing wave after wave of mindless action movies, I was actually quite surprised to for once see a movie that took its time (almost three hours) to tell an epic tale of courage, love, etc.That story is far from perfect: the movie can be horribly slow, there are plot holes, and the entire thing borders on the sentimental, but as a whole the story is quite impressive.The action scenes in this movie, which are not as frequent as you might expect, are quite well-done for the most part, although they are edited in a very haphazard way, making the battles very hard to follow.
Gladiator is by no means a classic, but it's a welcome change from the explosion-per-minute, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronald Emmerich (to name a few) crap, and it's a movie that has a really epic feeling to it. It make me feel great for at least a week after first seeing it.
