Blade Runner 2049," An absolute masterpiece
","Surpasses the original in just about every way; some of the best cinematography and framing in any film and career- defining performances from every main actor..Give into the peer pressure and watch this film, give it as much love as you can, because it will lose to the standard Hollywood trash otherwise, and that'd be the worst crime of the millennium.Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins have made the step from great storytellers to master storytellers with this single film.",10,3,10,24 November 2017
Get Out," Good for a horror movie post 2000's
","Get Out is a decent horror movie, better than average, but not without its set backs.
It absolutely didn't deserve an oscar, let alone for screenplay, but it's not the worst choice in the world at the end of the day.
For a debut film this is pretty admirable and could mean a lot for horror movies, black people and the general film industry, but aside from the politics of the film, it really is just an ok horror.The VVitch and It Follows are much, much better horror films; deserving of much more praise, but because THIS horror film has a discussion about race it gets millions of dollars and awards and praise. Is this a bad thing?Not really. It's better than giving an award to something like another shat out Blumhouse/James Wan sequel with no talent or effort put into it.Basically, the best thing about the film is the actors and their performances, especially Daniel Kaluuya, who is as excellent as always.The worst thing about the film would probably have to be the 'horror' elements since it's incredibly one- note and unoriginal in this department. Not saying it's bad, but it doesn't do anything the horror genre hasn't seen a bunch of times already.It's good, not great. (But still kinda cool a horror film won an oscar since the last was in 2000 with The Sixth Sense.)",10,16,30,24 March 2018
Coco," Average Pixar movie.
","Nothing new, nothing special. The animation's very polished but even that is average at this point in hollywood. Music is a very standard Disney composition copy and pasted throughout the movie. Not a bad movie; just nothing you haven't seen a billion times before.",5,11,32,24 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Pretty much what I expected, and that's fine.
","So this one was dumb, silly, goofy, contrived and in some cases pretty flawed... and yet that's what a Star Wars movie is.Star Wars is not a perfect franchise by any means at all; I haven' given any of the movies above a 7 so far. They're dumb, silly fun in space.
This one's better than the last two (Rogue One and The Force Awakens), but it's not quite as good as Empire Strikes Back.
So what?It was fun, shot very well, had tonnes of character, lovely callbacks and memorable moments. That's all I want from a Star Wars movie, and also what I was expecting.Pretty much all of the backlash is made up of nostalgia- blinded 20 year old fans who hold the original trilogy up on the highest pedestal they can erect. 
Sure, the original three were groundbreaking at the time and shaped Hollywood for the better and worst, but none of them are masterpieces, or even come close; they're just dumb fun with an added dash or mysticism and classic Hollywood romanticism.
Nothing more, nothing less.TLJ was just as fun, but also as dumb, AND THATS OK.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Perfection as image and sound.
","A dark comedy, a tale of love not to be, an exploration of cinema and theatre, a deconstruction of superheroes and their films and a modern masterpiece of technological filmmaking.Birdman has been my favourite film ever since I first watched it in 2014, and it hasn't faltered in any way since then.This is a film that so elegantly dissects theme and intent from the superhero genre, theatre productions, Raymond Carver and his work, modern art and the reason why we struggle and how we strive past it. This is a film that breaks the confines of the screen and shows you what you've been thinking about for a long time.This is a film that confronts the nature of us and reflects something unsettling and ugly, but still believes in hope, love and colour in life. There is a potency to the thematics at play in the film, a true journey of exploration across so much more than criticising superheroes. The film uses this lens to draw you in, a promise of deconstruction, a promise of catharsis, and what is then given to you is something else, something much more profound and meaningful.In terms of ecological storytelling, the film utilises its runtime down to a mathematic precision, sifting through ever scene to get the most out of the characters, actors, metaphors and aesthetic. A blindingly triumphant function is at the heart of the film, where so many other films miss their target with connection and intent through poor overall function, Birdman soars above, revealing a collection of images and sounds that stick with you for years, and of which have stayed culturally, subtextually, filmicly and politically relevant. This is a film that understands that it needs to exist, it needs to be talked about, it needs to be addressed.There is a simple joy to decoding the subtext and metaphor of the film; finding what it means to you and then finding what it means for others. Although surface level, that simple joy is encouraged by the film, by essentially packing every frame with as much relevant meaning and philosophy as it can. This might seem heavy handed to some, but to me, and I think to art, it is working at a level far beyond what you could refer to as 'pretentious,' or 'basic.' To me, this film transcends this kind of bad faith idealism, instead opting to help you experience the rawness of film, the elevated nature of theme and how it can be applied to any time.Birdman is a film that haunts me, I see it everywhere, it manifests in people, places, art and nature. There is something so very finite about the film, something so very true and real to us. I see it as an absolute achievement of art and the work of human nature, and the best thing about that is that the film already comments on that and suggests how and where we should evolve with next.",10,0,1,10 November 2019
