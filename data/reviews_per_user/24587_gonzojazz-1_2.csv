Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie is horrible!
","First of all i gotta say I think that Kill Bill vol. 1 was fabulous. And that being said - this movie is its exact opposite.At this point I've watched it twice, and I usually get a lot out of watching a relatively bad movie a second time, since I don't have any expectations it has to fulfill. Plus I get the possibility of getting an alternative perspective on it. But in this case even that did'nt help. Well, first of all the casting is horrible. If you gotta star Michael Madsen, star him at something he is good at. Hence being macho! In this movie he's a drunken excuse for an ex-pro-assassin, being dragged around the nose by his strip-club owner-boss, for whom he works as doorman or should I say doormat. Not cool, since Michael Madsen is a type-actor and nothing else! Secondly Darryl Hannahs performance as a mean, one-eye-patch assassin with a grudge is totally of the scale. And not in a good way! Most critics probably look right through this fact, because they think its intended on Tarantinos behalf, but if you ask me, you cant disguise poor acting, as a filmic visual intend, in relation to 70's blacksploitation movies, when its really nothing but poor acting. And thirdly David Carradine. He couldn't act in North and South and he sure can't act now. For what intend Tarantino drew him out of the closet, other than as a promotional stunt, I really cant see! There you have it. And thats just the cast. Will be back with more on the movie later. Sleep tight.",7,2,8,10 February 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Trailer was better (and that says a lot)
","I really had high hopes for this but was sorely disappointed. The characters were flat, the plot predictable and the jokes were trite. And what the heck happened in the costume department? It was like watching the 90s Australian kids TV show 'Tribes'! Oh, and lest we forget: everything was obviously shot on blue screen and the scenery was over- the-top CGI. No more Marvel for this (ex) fan!!",5,46,170,19 October 2017
