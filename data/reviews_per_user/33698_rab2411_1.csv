Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Movie That Might Have Been
","This was one of the most anticipated movies of the century. Unfortunately, George Lucas blew it.  It was primarily a vehicle for his special effects and, indeed, they were spectacular.  I just wish he had put the same effort into the story and characters.  The story itself is very predictable with virtually no plot twists to keep us guessing.  I found myself able to predict the next event all throughout the movie.  The story line also seemed very contrived and uninspiring(an interstellar trade conflict).The characters were very two-dimensional; I felt that I never really new who they were.  They seemed to be in the story just to move it along and be introduced for the next sequel.  After viewing this movie I realized that a critical element was missing, namely an anti-hero to add suspense.  Every major character did exactly what he or she was supposed to do.You might think that I am just a cranky curmudgeon who hates Star Wars. Wrong!  I loved the original three.  In fact I saw this latest installment twice just to find out if I was missing something upon seeing it the first time.  But, alas, it was just as bad upon viewing it a second time. I am at a loss to explain how so many people could give it such high marks.  My only explanation is that they are fanatics who live and breathe Star Wars and have no other life to speak of.  Although I thought it was an artistic failure, the special effects and fast pace kept it reasonably entertaining so I give it a 6.",6,0,1,17 June 2000
