The Lobster," Not at all funny and worse than cruel and sadistic
","Senseless, not funny and worse than mean and sadistic. It was frightening listening to the audience laughing at scenes from a realistically depicted suicide's bloody body after it fell to an equally realistic dead and beaten up bloody dog. As a critique of current romance one wonders what kind of personal hells the people who wrote this monstrous movie have gone through. They would have been far better going through psychotherapy than writing this adolescent crap.Even more frightening than the bloodied dead dog and suicide's bloody body were the high ratings this movie received. What are critics and people thinking? The movie and the audiences reaction to it were so upsetting we walked out.Good lord, where have we come?",Null,26,43,1 July 2016
