Scarface," The greatest gangster movie ever made!!!!
","Scarface is the best gangster movie ever made period. If you haven't seen it you haven't lived life. Al Pacino gives best performance ever, forget Micheal Corleone Tony Montana is the truth, reason and the answer. Possibly the best movie ever made. I can't give this movie enough praise with words. Unforgettable scenes, this movie is classic scene after classic scene. This movie only rivals Martin Scorceses 'Goodfellas'. But interms of gritty, disturbing violence, and cursing there is no competition.
Definite 10++/10 go buy it you wont be let down. and anybody that knocks this movies needs to get there f***** head checked.",Null,0,1,22 February 2003
