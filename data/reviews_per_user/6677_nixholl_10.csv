The Longest Yard," One of the first movies I have seen in a while that makes you care
","I very rarely as a girl and therefore not a sports fan go and see movies based around a sport but this was really worth it. I went initially as I am a an Adam sandler fan and thought it would be a laugh. I was really impressed however as the movie went on to actually find some depth to this movie and not solely a surface comedy. After Adam sandlers character Paul is sent to a prison in Texas after being caught drink driving he is asked by the warden of the prison to aid the football team of the prison which consists of the sadistic guards. He refuses but suggests that as a warm up game they play the prisoners. This the warden takes on board and so Paul goes out looking for a football team amongst the inmates of the prison, and soon discovers that they can not only warm up the guards team but beat them. I found myself throughout the course of the movie feeling more and more part of this team and when the end game was played felt the urge to cheer and shout every time they scored a touch down. The longest yard did not only deal with the sport but actually had a backing story that struck a chord with a majority of the audience and when one of the characters suffered a terrible death many of the viewers in the cinema were welling up with tears. Overall this movie was well cast with sandler and even d12 and Nelly making an appearance, the story was quite lighthearted and fun yet did have a realism to it that was good to watch. I would give this movie a 10 as I could watch it again and again.",10,1,3,12 September 2005
Troy," Muscles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Sun, sand and sexy men what more could a girl want from a movie. Eric Bana to me and my friend was the main attraction in this movie as he stole the screen in every scene he was in. His character was believable and the portrayal of his turmoil was well acted. Brad Pitt shined in more ways than one as the best warrior in history 'Achilles'. Not only did he have a body not easily forgotten but the love story added depth to his character and made him seem the ideal man on and off screen. Orlando bloom who in the past has also shined in movies like 'Lord of the Rings' was slightly disappointing in this role. He played a coward well yet this made his character less appealing than the others and his acting was let down by the lack of depth in the character he played. Paris' character ended up seeming selfish and a stupid romantic. Overall the movie was fantastic and well worth two and three quarter hours of your life.",Null,1,2,21 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Mixed feelings about this
","I sat and watched this movie a while ago with my sister and have to say we were both disappointed with it. We had read that it was going to be sweet and tender and a depiction of forbidden love. To begin with I was dazzled by the beauty of the countryside that Ang Lee had chosen to set the movie in, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal looked very promising in their roles. They began their relationship it seemed to me as two friends who just got on well. But before you knew what had hit you they had had their 'meeting' in the tent and were thrown in to this forbidden love that just seemed uncomfortable. It did pick up however when they both went their separate ways and began to get married and have kids etc. After that it began to be a relationship and not a fling, a part of themselves that they had to hide to prevent horrific things happening to them. The acting in this movie does have to be praised as the two protagonists broke barriers even of what two men acting in a movie can do, and it was convincing enough that by the end of the movie I found myself crying when Heath Ledger found the shirt that he had lost twenty years earlier kept by Jake Gyllenhaals character. Overall this film was impressive in set and acting but the way that love was handled to begin with ruined what I felt could have been a really tender relationship build up.",7,3,14,16 April 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Harmless Fun
","I had read reviews of the day after tomorrow some to its praise and others not, so when I spotted the video of it when out shopping decided to give it a look. My overall impression of the movie was that it was harmless fun to watch. I did not finish the movie feeling that 2 hours of my life had been stolen from me yet I felt I wanted to see more. The special affects were no less than astonishing in my view yet this is not the movie to watch if you want a deep and meaningful storyline and characters interesting to watch. As well as the story lacking in detail in lacked in my view any sense. It was hard to believe and follow that at the start of the movie the main character [Jack Hall the climatologist] was predicting the affects of global warming to be seen in hundreds of years and therefore urging the US Government to act, yet by the end of the movie had reduced his prediction to a matter of hours. However one small redeeming factor of this was the fact of seeing a trade mark disaster movie dog. The one dog that survives when millions of civilians die. The slight attempt at romance fell a little short but any movie containing Jake Gyllenhaal cant be too much of a disaster. Overall I would give this film an 8 out of 10. Another good watchable disaster movie.",Null,0,1,25 November 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Brilliant
","This film is no less than a 10 out of 10 for me. The acting was incredible, story was appealing, characters was lovable and even though the plot was slightly unusual the film never left its roots and it all felt so familiar. See this film!!!!!!! Although Steve Carrell is usually a funny man he was totally believable in this role and the other members of the cast were perfect. I really felt for Dwayne in this movie although the actor is not one I know he was brilliant, and Alan Arkin, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette were up to their usual fab standard. This film made me laugh, cry, laugh some more and then fall in love with the Hoover family. Watch this film. You will too!!!",10,0,1,31 January 2008
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A fantastic adaptation of the book. (Tim Burtonified)
","When i came out of the cinema after having watched Charlie and the chocolate factory for the first time i was really not sure what to make of the movie i had just used the last two and a half hours of my life for. Firstly it is a very Tim Burton perspective of the book and even the trees in the chocolate room are reminiscent of his previous work but in this particular case i think it took a visionary like Tim Burton to bring the children's fantasy world of chocolate to life. Secondly i thought that the oompa loompas were fantastic. The songs they sing were not quite how i had imagined but were entertaining none the less, and thirdly and finally on the plus side the casting of a majority of the characters was fantastic, however unsurprising it is to see Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp on the list. On the negative side of the movie and only a few points here, i felt that the issues Tim Burton tried to bring in with Willy wonka and his father did not appear to fit in with the rest of the fantastical world of Willy wonkas factory, it was a tad too much realism amongst such vision. I felt also that Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka was flawed. I was impressed with his ability to appeal to children but his accent at times was poor and he seemed somewhat sadistic in his wish to get rid of the children one by one the way a madman would. Overall I would give this movie a 9 and three quarters As it was thoroughly enjoyable enough o sit through twice in as many days but with minor annoyances, but then who and what is perfect.",10,1,3,4 August 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Dogs overrated
",Was I the only one who saw this movie and thought it was actually just an excuse for excessive violence with hardly any story or any relevance to anything? I watched this movie as I had been told by so many people it was a classic film that could never die and I have to say i was seriously unimpressed. I am a movie viewer who on principal will watch all of a movie and then judge it because I think its unjustified to comment if you haven't got the whole picture but it basically ended up a pointless bloodbath.I can see why this movie got its violent reputation as with all tarantinos movies yet the others such as kill bill and pulp fiction do not seem quite as pointless as this. The acting however was of a good standard but with lines like this and a story this bad you have to be fantastic to even seem OK as an actor. Tarantino himself who appeared in the movie seems to much of a wet blanket to be connected in any way to this Mafia like gang and to be honest it was obvious to me who the policeman was before you found out. I only give this movie a two as it wasn't soo bad i HAD to turn it off but it was pretty close.xxxxxxxxxx,2,6,16,23 March 2005
Some Like It Hot," This is hot!!!!!!!
","Some Like it Hot is an all time classic movie that will go down in history and deservedly so as one of the funniest comedies of all time. It begins a little slow with us being introduced to the characters Joe and Jerry working in a mortuary and witnessing the St Valentines day Massacre whilst trying to pick up a car. Despite its slow beginning it picks up from the point where the two agree to disguise themselves as women to join an all female band on their way to Florida. From then on in it is one of the best movies I have seen to date. However with one element of confusion Jerry played by Jack Lemmon appears to be the one interested in Marilyn Monroes ditzy sugar Cane with Joe telling him to keep clear, however as soon as they arrive at the holidaying destination Jerry appears to have lost his infatuation passing it to Joe who then carries on to seduce her. Despite this I find this fil very enjoyable and watch it on a regular basis. Osgood Fielding the third is the show stealer of this movie as you have to laugh at his absolute stupidity at falling for a man with the high light being the last line. I hope it goes down in history as being the last line ever. The reviewer gives this movie ten out of ten as it is harmless fun I could watch again and again.",Null,0,1,22 April 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Weird but wonderful
","Now i have sat and read all the comments for this version of Dracula and I have to say I totally understand how a movie created from a novel can shatter your images of that novel and cause anger at the way the film was made (for me an example of this would have to be lord of the rings), yet as a person who has never read the book I found this movie fascinating. As a rule I do not normally view movies of this kind yet after hearing a song from it by annie lennox decided to give it a go. I watched it and have since found it incredible. There are a few moments I will admit worthy of a cringe or two for example the scene where lucy goes out ito the garden etc ( those who have seen the movie can fill in the details) however despite these minor scenes it really shown through as a truly intelligent and individual take on Dracula. The soundtrack is excellent and I have since become a great Fan of Gary Oldman whose acting in this I find both menacing and romantic. The only thing I will fault the film on was the absolutely appalling attempts at a British accent by Keanu Reeves and winona Ryder. why not cast a British person to play those roles, we do have actors and actresses over here. Overall a strong 9 and 3 quarters out of ten. The last quarter is for the accents. xxxxxxxxxxxx",Null,0,1,9 November 2004
Jaws," Fantastic Thriller
","OK, so 30 years after the film was made and released and 18 years into my life I have finally sat and watched the film Jaws. Usually a coward when it comes to thriller movies i was persuaded as a film fanatic to see the classic by my cinema showing the film on the big screen in its original glory to celebrate 30 years of it terrorising children out of the water, and after all the build up to the film i am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. I think this film really is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing talent and a true suspense thriller. The acting in this is superb and although some scenes were rather predictable it did not spoil the suspense and thrill you feel when you hear that famous music. Richard Dreyfuss is well cast as the young scientist who along with Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider save Amity Island from the killer great white shark. And although the mechanical shark may look ever so slightly dated it is also a triumph technically. I am very pleased that finally I have sat and watched Jaws and even though I know now who dies and who survives i could watch it again and again.",10,1,3,5 October 2005
