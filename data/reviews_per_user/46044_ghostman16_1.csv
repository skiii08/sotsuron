Lucky Number Slevin," more than I expected
",Just finished watching Lucky number Slevin what can i say except wow this film is more than good this film is excellent.a man named Slevin is mistaken by 2 feuding gangsters (played by Morgan freeman and Ben Kingsley)for nick fisher now they want him dead. the story has a lot more than that but i don't want to say anymore because i would ruin it for everyone.lucky number Slevin is good on more than one level it has some neat action brilliant plot good acting and some funny parts.it is sort of like a very black comedy it has serious moments though. lucky number is also very violent and not one for the kids.9 out of 10 very enjoyable.,9,0,1,19 July 2007
