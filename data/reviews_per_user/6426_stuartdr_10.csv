"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Runs Into Only Few Walls
","After seeing the trailer a few times, a worrisome feeling could not be ignored. Not only is this a romance comedy, it also seems to be incorporating 'American humor' (Body jokes and people acting stupidly). However, this film also have witty dialogues, quirky British humor and a meaningful story.The story isn't anything new. Dennis, played Simon Pegg, abandons his pregnant fiancée right before their wedding. Few years later, he is working as a security guard and he visits his son. His fiancée is now engaged with another man and are planning on getting married soon. In an attempt to win her back, he decides to participate in the London Marathon humorously sporting a Erectile Dysfunction Awareness shirt.The film is actually very funny. Although some of the jokes weren't that funny, there are plenty that will make you laugh. Also, I am not a fan of the Will Ferrell type humor and although some comedic scenes are influenced by such type of humor, there are plenty of British humor that kept the humor diverse.Despite this film being a romance comedy, I think that many guys can enjoy this film. The character Gordon, played by Dylan Moran who played a minor role in Shaun of the Dead, Dennis, and Dennis's landlord keeps the laugh going. He was the best character in the film. With all of its laughs, the film has its heartfelt moments too. The lesson of not running away from problems is discussed throughout the film. The ending is perfect for a romance comedy and it can be seen from way from the beginning. Despite its predictability, it is a very nice one. Overall Run Fat Boy Run is a thoughtful movie that is perfect for dates and will have plenty of laughs.",8,2,6,1 April 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Another solid comedy
","The popularity of Judd Apatow and his raunchy but hilarious comedies are on the rise! This is another funny one that is also pretty cute. Forgetting Sarah Marshall ends up a funny movie that is a worthy follow up to Superbad.The films is about the life of Peter Bretter, played by Jeff Segel, is a struggling musician who writes the music for his girlfriend's TV show (played by Kristen Bell). One day, his girlfriend announces that she is breaking up with him for a British band vocalist. In attempt to get away from things around the house and himself that reminds him of her, he takes a vacation to Hawaii. Not only does he find Sarah and her boyfriend there, but he began his recovery by forming a relationship with Rachael (Mila Kunis).The movie is very very funny. The comedy is a little toned down and not as vulgar and explicit as some of his other films but it definitely is not for people who don't like sex orientated comedy. The best aspect about the humor in this movie is that it does not come from only a handful of characters. All of the cast cracks very funny jokes. Like I said before, don't bother with this movie if you're not a fan of these kind of humor.The plot is very similar to a rom com type film. The best comparison would be The 40 Year Old Virgin. So this movie can appeal to the ladies as well. With that being said, there is one warning. If you wondered why the rating box contain 'Graphic Nudity' that is from the flashes of male nudity present in this film.The ending is cute and perfect for the film. It is a nice happy ending for the film. Overall, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another worthy comedy from Judd Apatow. Full of raunchy humor and creative characters/cast (mainly), it is a very solid laugh.",10,3,11,6 May 2008
Burn After Reading," Smaller The Better
","Many people absolutely adored last year's Coen brothers effort No Country For Old Men. It was praised both by the critics and the general public and won Best Picture. Facing a great expectation, No Country is no followed by the new spy thriller comedy 'Burn After Reading'. Despite the exciting premise and the excellent acting, the film suffers from fractioned storyline and some very annoying characters.The story is definitely not something that can be explained briefly. It is very convoluted, layered and with many intertwining plots. The general plot of the film follows a disc that contains sensitive materials of an ex-CIA analyst. After a botched blackmail attempt, the events that follow creates a dark and humorous result.The film's strongest point is the acting. The film is full of A list actors: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich and JK Simmons just to mention a few. Even when you cannot like the characters they are playing at all, you are still awed by their acting capabilities. Brat Pitt and JK Simmons are the best out of all in this movie.Similarly, the film makes a good use of black comedy. Despite the fact you usually don't laugh out loud to horrific deaths in films, the excellently written, twisted dialogues cannot help but to bring a smile to your face. This film is a very good example of dry humor. The use of black comedy is a trademark in many Coen films. There are many parts in the film where you burst out laughing for long periods of time. The issue in connection with the overall picture of the film is that the humor is rather spread apart with frequent dry bits.Similarly, despite the excellent cast and the inclusion of praised Coen film elements, the film's story stands on the weak end. There is a lot of things going in the film and it is not told in a very effective way. There are plot holes and many events in the film are left unexplained. Not only that, the film has a very slow beginning where the central 'plot device' is not even shown until about 20 minutes in.Finally, some of the characters are so irritating and bothering that they take some of the enjoyment out of the film. It is a bit of a shame to have talented actors and actresses playing such forgettable characters. The amusing aspect that you tend to notice and enjoy the performance of smaller characters. Brad Pitt and JK Simmons, again, are prime examples. The ending, despite its abruptness, is a very funny one. It does not explain everything but the humor is top notch and very well done. Overall, the advice when seeing Burn After Reading is not to think of it as a pure comedy. As I have mentioned before, you will not be laughing for the whole duration of the film and there are some serious parts as well. I suggest going to a matinée showing for this film due to the fact that I've noticed that many people found certain aspects of the film unappealing.7/10 Matinée",7,1,5,14 September 2008
21," Not quite a winner
","I personally think that Jim Sturgess is a very promising actor. His stage presence was believable and he has a lot in store for him. Being a film with Sturgess, Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishbourne, I was pretty stoked for this film. However, 21 turns out to be quite drawn out and the trailer for the film seemed more exciting.The story is inspired by a very popular book called 'Bringing Down the House'. The main character, Ben Campbell, goes to MIT and need 300,000 dollars to go to med school. To suffice this requirement, he is invited by a group of students to a Blackjack group. He learns the technique of counting cards and goes to Las Vegas every weekend to make money and enjoy the high roller life at the same time.The premise of the story sounds very interesting. However the story seems to stray to many Hollywood clichés. Despite interesting characters, it can be pretty obvious how the characters affect the plot. The film also incorporate multiple strands of storyline together into one film. The film is built of Ben's experiences in Las Vegas, his relationship with his older friends/his mom, and the security professional who is trying to put an end to the Blackjack Team. Although the transitions between storyline are effective, the side stories aren't very exciting to watch and again it is pretty predictable.The dialogue is very slick and fluid although I was not completely assured by Sturgess's ability to act and speak in American English. Also, the film doesn't throughly explain the concept of counting cards. I was confused to what he was doing at many points during the film. Also I think it was possible to cut out some of the scenes in the film. It got a little drawn out and wasn't adding much to the overall story plot.When the ending was nearing, I felt like this was going to end very poorly. It had caused me to temporarily not like any of the characters. However, the film went a little further in the ending than I thought it was going to be and it turned to be a fulfilling ending. Overall, 21 was a bit of a disappointment. Despite the slick dialogue and promising story, it became too predictable and drawn out.",5,13,22,1 April 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Heartwarming, awkward and oh so enjoyable
","I have heard a lot about this film prior to watching it. I heard about how funny it is and how much recognition it got from critics and the community alike. I finally was able to watch Little Miss Sunshine and I was surely not disappointed.The plot of the story involves a rather dysfunctional family. The father, Robert Hoover, is attempting to jump start his career through a motivational program. The mother, Sheryl, is a overworked mother that is trying to create a comfortable life for her kids. The grandpa, who got kicked out of his retirement home for snorting heroine. The uncle who recently attempted to commit suicide. Dwayne is the quiet teen son that has taken a vow of silence until he becomes a test pilot. Finally Olive, who is a little girl that got accepted to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California. The film is the family's journey to the pageant.One of the strongest points of the film is the casting. I loved Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steven Carrell in this film. Their acting is top notch and makes for some memorable and touching scenes which often come with a hint of dark comedy.The aspect that keeps this film fresh and not a cliché meddled mess is the assiduous sense of innocence and awkwardness that is present on the screen. There is always a nice mix of both in the movie that it makes for some good laughs even when the topic being discussed is not something to be laughed about. This mixtures explodes in the pageant scenes at the end of the film. The pageant also provides a not-so-subtle comment about children in pageants as well The only thing that bothered me in this film is how insensitive and annoying some of the characters were. Despite the family going through many hardships during the trek from New Mexico to California, these mainly minor characters managed to irritate me to a annoying extent. I did not see a great point in adding these characters into the film.The ending was very well done and finished off in the right place. The main thing I was happy to see about the ending was that it avoided clichés and ended on a very humorous and appropriate way.Overall, this film will not disappoint you. If you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses, you will enjoy it. If you're a fan of dark comedy, yo will enjoy it. If you're into indie films, you will enjoy it. So sit back and let this crazy little family take you on a very quirky trip.",10,0,1,30 June 2008
Wanted," Goofy or Serious?
","Lets think about this, James McAvoy has done many different genres of films and this is his first steps into action films. Looking from the trailer, he also does a good job of acting a believable American character. However, despite this and the intense action sequences of the film, Wanted ended up being a muddled mediocre film that had a lot of potential.The plot runs around a guy named Wesley Gibson. He has a pathetic life: working under a boss that abuses him, girlfriend that is cheating on him with his best friend and so on. One day, Fox, invites him to The Fraternity which is a group of super assassins. He goes through rigorous training to attain skills which his father once had prior to being killed.The one obvious positive point about this movie are the action sequences. It is slick, stylized and bloody. Similar to Shoot em Up, The film crams one crazy stunt after another pumping the adrenaline to the viewer. It is very fun to watch and very well choreographed.Similarly, the film puts a big emphasis on slow motion. However this tends to be a hit or miss making the film look cool or downright silly. Scenes where the viewer see a bullet fly through space a la Matrix are very well done. However, there are also scenes where you hear characters speaking in slow motion that adds nothing but silliness.The biggest problem with the movie is its pacing. It spends the first hour or so showing the introduction of the characters and Gibson's training in the Fraternity. The next hour presents a plot twist and the development to the final showdown. You will notice that this movie tends to focus on the story more than the action. Similarly, after the twist, it explain other aspects of the story even though you spent another chunk of time listening to the development of the characters earlier on. WIth a film that has a two hour runtime, it is rather disappointing.Another mixed aspect of this film is the humor. With over the top action and stunt sequences, the film is riddled with silly dialogues and events. When the film wants you to take the film's story seriously, you can't help but to wonder if the dialogue is intentionally trying to be funny or not.Overall, Wanted can be described as a action flick that contain slick and violent action but suffers from poor pacing and structure. Despite its big potential it felt like it fell down a little bit.",6,10,24,27 June 2008
Children of Men," Whitewashed Hope
","This film has gotten very praising response from the critics and the community alike and I had to check it out. I did see Prisoner of Azkaban but didn't think it was anything mind blowing but I notice now how great Alfonso is as a director and he certainly have a very bright future.The plot follows Theo, a depressing drunk who only see the decay in the world. His bitter and pessimistic outlook on life is caused by his child's death and the breakup with his wife. Similarly the world is in chaos. Most organized government has fallen and Britain has one of the last standing government which leads to high amounts of refugees seeking asylum. Finally the world has not had a childbirth in 18 years. Theo, contacted by his former wife, is asked to lead a pregnant refugee out of the country to ensure the baby's safety.The acting is very well done. Especially with Julianne Moore, Clive Owen and Michael Caine. Despite the continuously bleak setup of the film, they show a healthy sense of humor. At the same time, when the situation turns for the worse, they can show true raw emotions.The beauty of this film comes from its breathtaking cinematography. The highlights are the extendedly long single shots that occur many times during the film. The action scenes usually incorporate this and it is extremely well done. The cinematography leads to the gripping sense of realism in this film. Parts of the film is shot in a documentary sort of way and adds a sense of believability to the film. The film presents allusions to past events and other social issues as well. At the same time the film is very emotional and leads to very heartbreaking scenes.The minor issue with this film is the action scenes. If you're prone to motion sickness, it can get you a little bit dizzy which are even further pushed by the cacophony of gunfire and explosions. Also the film is rather slow for the first half and the plot can get a little confusing.The film has a rather ambiguous hopeful ending that is very well shot. Overall, the reason behind why this film didn't receive any Oscars is a mystery. However this is a very smart film that also points out many social and political issues that are going on today. Highly recommended.",9,1,6,1 July 2008
Hancock," Sub-Par Superhero
","I must admit, when I first saw the trailer I did not have much of an expectation for this film. My view did not change when I walked in to see this film. However since the film was dubbed as a 'comedy superhero film' I thought I was at least going to be entertained. Despite the good strong start on this year's summer blockbuster films, Hancock is one of the most mediocre and least entertaining of all.The plot follows an unconventional superhero by the name of Hancock. Despite his heroics, he often lays a wave of property destruction during his act. One day, he rescues a doomed PR from being hit by a train. This begin a change to Hancock's life as Ray (The PR) attempts to change the public's view on Hancock.The film's structure is somewhat similar to the Adam Sandler's film Clicks. The first half is mainly comedy and the second part is mainly drama. I personally enjoyed this system because it prevented the film from being dragging on and kept things pretty interesting.One of the key highlights of this film is Jason Bateman. He is one of the few actor in this film that provides a good and solid performances. Similarly, he is also one of the few likable characters in the film. This leads to the negatives of Hancock...One of the obvious problems with this film is the special effects. Not one of the scenes where special effects are used look convincing in anyway. After Iron Man and other films that were able to present excellent and believable special effects, it is very disappointing. Secondly, the humor isn't so great. A lot of the jokes are present in the trailer and the running gags throughout the film isn't all that funny. Considering that I didn't find this movie that funny made the much more serious second part to be a lot more enjoyable.Finally, the plot is full of plot holes and paper thin. Many things are left unexplained and the film's attempts to create multiple story lines does not work in the slightest.Overall Hancock is definitely not worth the 10 dollars price of admission. It is very forgettable and doesn't impress much. Save your money for The Dark Knight.",5,3,8,5 July 2008
Iron Man," Iron Man IS the movie to kick off the summer movies!
","TO begin with, I am not entirely a fan of comic book movies and I have only seen a handful in my life (X-Men, 300, Sin City and Superman Returns). So when I first saw the trailer I wasn't particularly hyped. However, that was stupid of me because Iron Man is great film that even people who don't regularly read comic books can throughly enjoy.The story is about a millionaire named Tony Stark. His company, Tony Industries create weapons and he is extremely well off. One day, when he is in the middle east showing off one of his newer weapons, he is attacked and kidnapped by terrorist. After being demanded to create a missile for them, Stark create a crude powersuit and escapes their clutch. When he returns, he began to work on a much more fine tuned suit.To begin with, all of the acting is superb! Especially Robert Downey Jr. He really brings out the character. None of the character is shallow or overacted. The humor has a good mix of seriousness, humor and action.Many superhero movies tend to have too long of an introduction. Iron Man's intro is absolute perfect. It gives you enough information to make you excited for the rest of the movie without being too long.The special effects look stunning. This is one movie you will want to see in theaters for the experience. Everything looks very believable. I even go to a point where I think the special effects look superior to Transformers.So are there problems? The biggest problem I had with Iron Man is how the final 'giant skirmish' was rather underwhelming. It doesn't last very long and the way it ends is kind of lame. The general plot structure also doesn't stray too far away from the superhero movie mold. But that is not really a bad thing.The ending, although abrupt and unexpected, is very original and satisfying. Overall, Iron Man lives up to the hype that was projected by its fans. A great, fun popcorn movie that sure make you hope that future superhero movies will as good as this one (Lets see what happens with The Incredible Hulk). Don't miss out!",9,1,3,5 May 2008
Atonement," 'I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.'
","Atonement is an original drama that is both tragic and beautiful. This being my 3rd Best Picture nominee to watch, my thoughts were 'Can it beat Juno?' Amazingly, it did (Although barely). The storyline is superb and strays away from many clichés in the dramas. The movie is another one of those 'star crossed lover' type stories. The man is accused of a crime that he did not commit and is sent off to fight in the war. The main actors, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, drive the film in a very effective way. These two actors create a story that is truly believable and proves to be very immersive. You will notice the unique cinematography almost as soon as the film starts. Every source of light is blurry and has a sort of bloom effect. This makes the film look whited out. Also it makes the film looks dreamy as if it is a part of a memory. Character progression is on the slow side but you get to know many of the character very well. The score, which the film won the Oscar for, is interesting and enjoyable. The film incorporates the tapping of the typewriter with the orchestral background music.The one problem is quite obvious: the plot progression is rather confusing. It jumps from one point to another and goes back and forth. This is most annoying especially when it goes '2 weeks prior' in a scene where you're already confused as to where in the time of the film the current scene is taking place in. Although it wasn't that big of a problem for me, it might be a little aggravating for some viewers. Also some of the wounded soldier shots are quite gruesome and gritty. They are very graphic although majority of these shots are concentrated into clump of scenes and it is not something that comes back often.The ending concludes all of the main three characters' stories up very well. It is a very emotional ending and is very well done. It is probably something you're not expecting and I thought it was a solid ending. Atonement is ultimately an extremely personal film. Each character has a unique quality to them and story that drives the film become very personal. As long as you can put up with the jumping plot and long-ish run time, you should find this film a treat. It uses emotions effectively, characters are developed well and you will care for them (Well maybe not that little girl. Personally I hated her guts). I thought this film was one of the best I saw this year and it is definitely a one you don't want to miss out on.",10,4,6,2 March 2008
