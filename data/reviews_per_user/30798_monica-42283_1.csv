Requiem for a Dream," One of the best movies ever made
","To begin with I thought this is the kind of movie to show teenagers for them to understand the danger of drugs. I loved how this movie delivers the emotions these charactheres are going through by using this wonderful editing. 
Wonderful movie and defenetly worth watching more than once.",10,1,1,14 August 2018
