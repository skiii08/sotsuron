Angels & Demons," A Powerfully Magnificent Film
","This is certainly the best work of director Ron Howard and actor Tom Hanks so far. Both the acting and direction are nothing less than superb and the script blows the lid metaphorically off Vatican political intrigue. The suspense is absolutely unrelenting and the backdrop of Rome is used in the same way Hitchcock utilized locations. The film is intelligent as well, with brilliant dialog and incredibly insightful plotting. For all viewers this will be a motion picture they will never forget and the fact it was snubbed at the Academy Awards is additional proof of their irrelevancy. This is a simply magnificent motion picture that deserved more acclaim and awards than it received as Hanks and Howard demonstrated what genius truly is and the cinema art form has never been more clearly shown.",10,1,3,17 January 2015
The Book Thief," Another Stunning Performance by Emily Watson
","A very moving interpretation of the famed novel is anchored solidly by a mesmerizing, dynamically stunning performance by Emily Watson. While she is aided by a wonderful turn by Mr. Rush, it is Watson who is the pillar of acting power that supports the entire film and is the center of suppressed emotion that bubbles beneath a seemingly self-protective surface. She is stellar in this role and as usual her artistic gifts give the film gravitas and direction. There are scenes between she and the child and with her husband that will sear your soul and touch your heart more deeply than anything ever put on screen. This is a performance that deserves an outrageously delayed Academy Award for Ms. Watson, even if it is a misplaced supporting actress one. It would be ironic if she receives her first Oscar for supporting because she is actually the unforgettable centerpiece of every piece she appears in and defines the word 'star.' This film is worth seeing if only to witness another incredibly beautiful performance by Emily Watson and to watch the most truly gifted actor of our time add another triumph to her majestic career.5/24/14: Having just watched this wonderful film with family at home, I am driven to return again to my keyboard and restate my initial reaction to the absolutely wondrous performance of Emily Watson as Rosa. On second viewing, I found myself even more profoundly touched by the humanity in her portrayal of Rosa and the subtlety that Watson uses so skillfully to bring her character to life. Rush is superb as well and their relationship is beautifully realized on film. It is Emily Watson, however, who reaches so deeply into the life of Rosa and makes her character's heart beat while at the same time touching our own. This is another star in the crown of unforgettable performances by a uniquely gifted and magnificent actress.",10,32,72,6 October 2013
Corpse Bride," Stunning Performance by Emily Watson
","This film features one of the truly magnificent and moving voice performances ever recorded by the incredible Emily Watson and must not be missed. While the motion picture is interesting itself, it is hardly anything special. Yet, Watson uses her voice to bring depth and life to the character of Victoria and brings fresh definition to the term 'animation.' While Ms. Watson has long been recognized as one of the most gifted, talented, and majestic actors working in any medium today, she proves here that there is literally no limits to what greatness she can attain. No one who hears this performance will ever forget it and it is a tribute to Tim Burton that he had the wisdom to cast her in this modest film. Simply put, this is another screen triumph by Emily Watson and something new that her millions of fans will appreciate more than words can say.",10,0,0,17 September 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Intellectually Stimulating Zweig Cinema Magic
","A visionary director of obvious intelligence has taken a screenplay of gold in hand and created a stunning, literate, lovely motion picture for those of us who seek the intellectually stimulating in cinema choices. When it was announced that the wonderful author Stefan Zweig was the inspiration for this film, we were incredulous but tantalized. Upon experiencing this beautiful motion picture, we were speechless. It was thrilling to see Zweig's spirit embraced, alive on the screen and permeating celluloid. Superbly directed by Anderson with characters brought to life by a cast of great actors, especially Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham ( a delight to see Abraham indeed!), the proceedings are amazingly Stefan Zweig cinematically realized at times. The wit, the quirkiness, the satire is all there, yet the dark cloud of future totalitarianism casts a shadow across laughing faces as a portent of things to come. The tragic cataclysm of fascism in 1930's Europe is seldom far from our thoughts as we watch the incredibly photographed, fairytale landscapes before us. This is simply a wondrously made movie, set in a mythical country that is virtually Oz-like in appearance. The humor is broad and almost slapstick in sequences but there is something much darker beneath all of it and a certain overall uneasiness experienced by audiences. Without doubt one of the very, very few films of the last decade that truly deserves our unreserved acclaim. It is certainly director Anderson's most accomplished and meaningful work and our admiration for him is now quite intense, to be sure. He has honored Stefan Zweig most appropriately and deliciously, surely inspiring a renewed appreciation and even rediscovery of Zweig and that is the real triumph of this quite intellectual piece of cinema magic.",10,2,4,4 August 2014
Lincoln," Now This Film Belongs To The Ages
","A film of such greatness rarely reaches a mass audience and touches the soul so deeply. There are those reviewing the film here who are ignorant enough of history to say this motion picture is inaccurate. There are those here who found it boring and to explain that, one must consider the source. Those who do not appreciate this motion picture do not deserve our contempt but only our pity. They are empty shells who are sadly blind to beauty and truth and love. Is the Pieta, Mona Lisa, or Parthenon falsely conceived or boring? For this is a film of such power that only the thoughtful among us, those of us self-reflective and open enough to appreciate the truly artful attempt by this director and screen writer to make a historical icon flesh and blood to the extent we can feel his very breath upon our upturned faces. Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing less than brilliant and in a matter of seconds becomes the Lincoln he portrays. He is stunning in a performance unequaled in the history of cinema. The supporting cast is magnificent as well, especially Tommy Lee Jones in a performance that sets the screen afire, rips one's heart from their chests, and returns it to them renewed. What a triumph for these two screen giants! Although Sally Fields is indeed excellent as Mary Todd Lincoln, one can only wish that another true artist of Emily Watson's caliber would have had the opportunity to give the character a bit more depth and life. Ms. Watson was incredibly unforgettable in The Boxer, a film in which she shared the screen with Day-Lewis and together they created a chemistry that was almost nuclear in its explosiveness. Perhaps that would have been more than an audience could bear, her eyes too soulful that they might overwhelm us, rendering us senseless. For there is only so much artistic greatness that can be absorbed from a single cinematic experience of this kind. Lincoln is a film that will enhance the world's view of an American president who is too often thought of in ways that great statues are appreciated and honored. Lincoln brings the man to life and in so doing, it reaches for the heavens and hands us a handful of stardust. There are truly no words to describe a film that touches our very hearts and souls and leaves us changed forever. It is an experience that one must gift themselves with, as those who have given so much of their being to create a cinematic gift, a creative labor of such exquisiteness that it will forever shine throughout time. Not only has motion picture greatness been given eternal definition through this film, it is the cinematic equivalent of an epic poem that echoes through the ages of humanity.",10,1,2,1 April 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Tom Hanks Is Nothing Less Than Brilliant
","Giving what is arguably the most outstanding performance of his very distinguished career, Tom Hanks proves once again what a gifted actor of stunning proportions he truly is. He succeeds in bring depth and passion to the one dimensional Langdon character in the book and sets the screen afire with a searing performance that will be studied in acting classes and amaze audience for generations to come. There is no doubt that what he achieves in this film is Oscar worthy and among one of the most memorable acting accomplishments in cinema history. The rest of the cast is certainly adequate in support of Hanks but Tattou is sadly miscast egregiously in what should have been a pivotal role. Emily Watson would have been a superior choice in every way as she could easily communicate the saintliness of the character as well as the burning humanity. It was an opportunity dramatically missed by Ron Howard and one can only wonder what he was thinking when he did not demand Watson for what could have been his masterpiece.",10,1,2,17 September 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Simply A Beautiful Film
","At times this film will overwhelm you with its simple power and leave you sobbing uncontrollably as you grieve for a lost childhood and magical memories of an early film viewing experience. This is cinema for the soul of our past and it touches us deeply with its truth. Hanks and Thompson are nothing less than superb in their respective roles and undeniably do some of their finest work in this film. In every scene they play together, we are reminded of just what great actors they truly are. As we watch them bring the profound depth of their characters to life, we experience a journey into the past and a hope filled time that promised such a beautiful future. Marry Poppins was imperfect masterpiece and this film is as well. But the way both films touch our souls and as adults rekindle that faint glow of hope, well, it is quite sublime indeed. The question is asked somewhere on the IMDb, 'Is it necessary to view Marry Poppins prior to seeing this film?' The answer is that no life is complete if the magic of Marry Poppins hasn't been part of it. If one's heart is touched by that film, then Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely treasure. If Marry Poppins is nothing more than a cinematic requirement that offers little more than catchy tunes, then simply don't bother. Unless you can open your heart and break through the calcified cynicism that prevents you from seeing the profound beauty in these two films, both can be easily dismissed as sentimental fluff. I feel blessed to have seen Mary Poppins as a young lad and realized what a gift it was at the time and what a golden memory it would be for the rest of my life.",9,3,6,27 April 2014
Sin City," Deeply Disturbing, Horrific, and Disgusting Beyond Comprehension
","Horror filled, oddly photographed travesty that is one of the most disturbing 'films' ever made. Unrelentingly disgusting and violent beyond all comprehension, this is a movie to be avoided by anyone with a modicum of human decency. A good cast is defiled by their work in this project and their motivation for appearing in such an amateurish abomination are certainly perplexing. These are actors of some stature and this is something that is not only beneath them, with the exception of Rourke, but sewer level. The depiction of what can only be described as shocking drug and alcohol consumption, perverted sex, ultra diabolical violence, and smoking should have been stomped into oblivion by the studio behind this. A horrific example for youngsters, with its comic book look, that is exactly the audience such a movie will attract. There is talk of a sequel and the thought of such a thing chills one's very soul. This film is supposedly based on something known as a 'graphic novel' but there is nothing novel about this exceptthe overwhelming amount of human suffering shown and that is what is so graphic about it as well. Public outrage regarding such unlimited and ugly mayhem must be expressed by an intense letter writing campaign in utmost protest accompanied by a massive theater boycott. No human eyes should be subjected to the abuse a catastrophe like this inflicts! Those responsible for its production should be barred from the entertainment industry for all time and the results of their work shredded. I am certainly posting sharply worded letters to the studio, theater management, the agent of Bruce Willis, and the Times at once. I sincerely hope it is not too late to forestall further damage to our young. In the name of humanity and civilized society, we must not remain silent!",1,2,7,2 August 2014
