Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very flawed movie
","No movie could truly live up to the hype that has been put around this movie, and certainly Phantom falls far short. A lot of basic cinematic flaws, it shows that Lucas has not directed for such a long time. I wish his vision would have allowed someone with more experience to direct. Certainly the script could have been worked much better to remove the numerous plot holes. In all I found the movie to be hokey; the Pod races, the immaculate conception of Ani, etc.. Only true saving grace was the extremely well choreographed and exciting saber duel, but I felt that I was watching Jedi all over again at the end. It is a shame also, to have so many talented actors and almost all of their time on screen is a waste. I truly hope Mr.Lucas will be able to produce the next 2 despite of this movie and that they will be much better. I feel this movie ripped away the magic and wonder that the first series gave to us.",5,0,1,22 May 1999
