Minority Report," Spielberg is at home in this neo-noir
","Minority Report is a stylish neo- noir science fiction from Steven Spielberg destined to become a classic of the future. Taking place in 2054 it concerns a group of police force which are equipped with the capability to foresee a crime about to happen with the help of three mutated humans called 'precogs'. Unfortunately for John Anderton (Tom Cruise) as he sets up to work on the next crime about to happen he is horrified to see that the offender is he himself. What follows is a cat and mouse hunt which involves his entire corporation and then some. The visual effects are amazing, and the tone of the film is finely balanced between dreary, rainy grey and futuristic blue. Cruise and Colin Farrell star. Great movie.",Null,0,0,24 July 2018
Star Trek," Fantastic pacing and a great script makes this reboot a winner
","This is the reboot that needs to be applauded-JJ Abrabs has made a film that will entice new fans and at the same time not offend Trekkies. All the new actors adapt themselves to iconic roles and the special effects are low key but fantastic. Of course, the main question is- will new fans like it, or even understand the lore? Yes, they will.",Null,2,9,8 October 2018
Dawn of the Dead," Snyder's Dawn of the dead manages to improve on the original
","Dawn of the Dead is a remake of an older zombie film by the same name but in my opinion, it is a superior effort- which is strange as most remakes are inferior in quality. The major change here is that Snyder has decided to make the zombies have the capacity to run, which is a scary thought indeed. As creepy as the slow undead were there was always the chance to outmaneuver them, but things are not so simple this time around. The usual zombie trope of a bunch of characters clustered together and hiding away is how the film goes about it but it manages to characterize the survivors instead of just using them as zombie fodder. Some scenes are terrifying and there is a palpable sense of tension. This is a great horror movie and a great zombie one also. Go watch it.",Null,0,2,8 August 2018
The Machinist," Harrowing and deeply unsettling feature film
","What a great film. Even for those who are able to piece together exactly what is happening before the movie explicitly reveals everything, The Machinist is still capable of capturing the attention. The film is dark, but rewarding, and it never cheats the viewer. There are no sudden twists designed to blindside an audience. The reveals occur gradually, with Anderson allowing us the pleasure of putting the pieces together. The Machinist requires a certain kind of viewer - one who is comfortable with grimness and a certain amount of gore. Members of that group will appreciate what this picture has to offer. Christian Bale's transformation needs to be seen to be believed.",Null,2,3,9 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Masterpiece is the apt word to associate with 2001 A Space Odyssey
","In my opinion the greatest film of all time even surpassing the likes of Citizen Kane and Vertigo. 2001 is filled with visuals that will awe and frighten simultaneously and its thematic depth is of such immensity that even today 50 years later pages upon pages can be written on it. The film is based on Author C Clarke's novel but Kubrick makes the material his own. Divided into three distinct segment which encompass time since the dawn of man to the far future 2001 is a meditative experience which squashes all the expectations and clichÃ©s one sees in a narrative film. Kubrick's legendary status was already confirmed before he even thought of making a sci-fi movie but such is the reputation of this film that it towers over every film of even his oeuvre. Unmissable science fiction film, easily in the top 3 greatest films that have ever been made.",Null,3,5,24 October 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," A masterpiece by a legend
","Kubrick's final film is also his most underrated- Eyes Wide Shut was the last film directed by the legend Stanley Kubrick and because it starred the then A list couple Cruise and Kidman, along with many sex scenes the film was way overhyped. And probably didn't live upto this expectation either critically or commercially. But now Eyes Wide Shut is being rediscovered as a cult and already there are a host of blogs and articles online talking about how great the film is. I love it- I think this is one of the finest psychological films ever made. It reeks of atmosphere and the story- based on an Austrain novel is very good. Go see this soon to be declared masterpiece.",Null,0,0,26 September 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Despite a strange ending this is a good film
","This film is strange. It has great set pieces and the pacing is good but it just ends abruptly. Its jarring how the film just ends- you'll see and understand. Non-demanding fans of the original The Matrix will likely be enthralled by the second installment in the series. More demanding aficionados will likely have a few reservations, some of which will not be addressed until the release of the third feature, Matrix Revolutions. I fall into the latter category. Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like, the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that it's virtually impossible to view this as a finished project.",Null,1,1,8 January 2019
Iron Man," Great Superhero film featuring a career altering performance by Robert Downey Jr.
","Iron Man works because of two reasons- The storyline flows smoothly, and the powerhouse performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the titular Iron Man/ Tony Stark. The charisma of Downey Jr. coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes Iron Man one of the best Superhero avatars of all time. The non-suited human element of a superhero film should be interesting in someway be it his sorrow or travails or in his embodiment of a larger than life, cool figure, and this is a fact many films do not foresee, or even realize. Jon Favreau has crafted a great movie and Robert Downey Jr. is so good you cannot picture anyone else play him. The film is fun in a charming way and the action pieces are embedded to flow the story, and not as a stopover for special effect show-off. The side parts are played well by everyone involved from Gwyneth Paltrow to Terrence Howard. Its been ten years since Iron Man was released and so much has happened both in his journey and the ascent of superhero movies but the first film remains a pinnacle.",Null,0,0,16 August 2018
