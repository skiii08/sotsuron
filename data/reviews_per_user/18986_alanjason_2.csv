Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," OK movie, but a few holes
","This is a movie you can't take too seriously. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. It's still more entertaining than the Twilight movies. The only thing I didn't understand was the use of silver to kill vampires. It was mentioned that Judas was paid with silver when he betrayed Jesus, so that's why silver can be used to kill vampires. Well, then, what was used to kill vampires BEFORE this happened. I mean, the vampire Adam mentioned that he's 5000 years old, which is 3000 years before Judas. So, silver was just fine before, but as soon as Judas was paid with silver, then voila, silver is all of a sudden deadly to vampires.",7,0,0,4 March 2013
A Quiet Place," I liked it, but didn't love it
","I liked the movie for being entertaining and original, but there were a few things that made little sense.First of all, if your survival depends on silence, why the hell would the parents decide that having another kid is a great idea? Newsflash, babies are noisy, and a crying baby would pretty much guarantee a death sentence for the entire family. You see, the mother was pregnant well before the dad realized that the cubby he built was soundproofed enough to make noises. So when the mother was knocked up, there was no plan in place for the baby. I know that this was probably added to the movie for drama, but it made little sense, especially since the drug store in town seemed to be well stocked, so I'm sure there was probably a good supply of birth control pills and condoms readily available.Second thing that bothered me, is that the backup plan to draw the attention away from the house was to send the youngest son to set off fireworks, potentially endangering his life.Um, they had electricity and speakers. How about setting up the speakers somewhere outside and connect it to an iPod or something and blast some heavy metal music. That would have worked better instead of sending your kid to his possible death. A third thing that bothered me was the large protruding nail, that just happened to appear on the heavily used stairs all of a sudden. How the hell does a nail face upwards from the bottom of the stairs? Does anyone know of any stairs built this way? I didn't think so. And lastly, apparently the safest place that was almost free of the aliens was the waterfall due to the noise it created. How come they didn't even attempt to try to built some kind of sanctuary or home near the waterfall? I know that some people will argue that it would have been impossible to move their lives from the farm to the waterfall, but wouldn't you at least try? Yes, I understand that they wouldn't have electricity or the farm for food, but couldn't they at least live there half the year while the weather is nice? I mean, if you're almost guaranteed to be safe at the waterfall, you'd think they would at least try something to make it work.Now, aside from the gripes I listed above, I still enjoyed the movie and do recommend it to everyone to go see. It's still better than most horror movies that are usually the run of the mill sequels, ghost movies, or torture porn.",7,0,1,10 April 2018
