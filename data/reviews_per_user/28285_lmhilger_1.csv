United 93," Inappropriate
","United 93 was directed, written, and performed well but the concept was completely inappropriate.I am ashamed of myself for going to see this movie. Like in any other movie theater, there are candy wrappers crinkling, drinks being slurped, and popcorn being snacked on. How can we view a movie that has such a true story and is so devastating with Ice Age 2 playing across the hall? I don't need a movie to tell me how I feel about 9/11 and to have this catastrophe being put on a screen is just not necessary.However, the actual physical film was well-done and I appreciate that the director used real people and no big-name actors.",Null,3,22,28 April 2006
