Ali," Not that bad at all
","First of all, this movie is not as bad as others have said.  The boxing scenes were fantastic and more realistic then any of the Rocky's were.  You can't say the story writing is bad when it is an autobiographical picture either.  There was only so much they could put into it.  Considering I was like 11 years old when Ali won his 3rd belt, I remember him being a great fighter that bounced around a lot.  He was ugly to watch for the most part but effective.  And the movie caught that.  Will Smith did a great job too getting buff and mimicking his moves in the ring.    But the movie was uneven and a little long so my suggestion is to have fun with the actor's portrayals in this movie.",7,0,0,29 December 2001
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Might restore my interest in super her genre
","Although I am generally sick of comic book movies, I gave this a chance because my son wanted to watch it.It has a good villain in Michael Keaton, whose Hollywood comeback keeps gaining momentum. Despite his intensity, you could see he was also a victim of circumstance. The new Spiderman was good. Tom Holland is much older than the teenager he is playing, as is the rest of cast. His portrayal is down to earth which seems to be a trend in the superhero movie universe. What was nice to see were the action scenes without the suit. He seemed more like a regular guy who inherited super powers.I don't think this was groundbreaking in any way, just a good action movie and a more interesting Spider Man than the last two. I was impressed by the nerdy classmate portrayal by music star Zendaya, too.",7,3,7,10 July 2017
Save the Last Dance," Better than I expected
",I was disappointed at first seeing MTV credited for the film and was thinking it would be as cheesy as their programs are but it wasn't.  Good dancing and story.  Kind of like a Mr. Holland's Opus meets Boys in the Hood scenario.,7,0,1,1 February 2001
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," This Transformers has less jabs, more hooks and uppercuts
","The third Transformers movie has some of the best action visuals ever filmed and were plenty exciting in 2D.During the 'Invasion of Chicago', there are many CGI ships flying around downtown. The alien crafts resemble those in earlier movies this year like Skyline and Battle Los Angeles. There are spectacular aerial views of the combat and mayhem. The sweeping panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago Skyline with soldiers jumping out of helicopters and buildings set to a drum pounding score were comparable to some of the action scenes in the Dark Knight. The story begins with a new interpretation of the first man on the moon mission and makes an immediate impression. The scope of this film is immense as there is action on the moon, White House, Lincoln Memorial, Downtown Chicago and what appears to be a replica of Chernobyl. THE HUMANS (AMERICANS):Sam (Shia LaBeouf) wants to be taken seriously and succeeds by shouting in our ears most of the time. Maybe he was trying to be heard over the non-stop music and action. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) shouts a lot as well. Sam's new love interest Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is there to be the damsel in distress. Although her accent is out of place, Director Michael Bay does a fine job showcasing her beauty utilizing a variety of wardrobes and backdrops. Tyrese Gibson is featured prominently in the action scenes along with Lester Speight (of Office Linebacker Terry Tate fame). The soldiers seemed to have a greater role in the outcome of this film rather than the previous two.There are frequent attempts at comic relief from both the robots and the humans, most of which are not funny but at least are entertaining. For the characters that we already know from the first two films, we get more of the same. Sam's parents are less obnoxious this time (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) as is Seymour Simmons (John Turturro). But many of the new characters (played by some veteran actors) were there to ham things up. I don't think any of these guys were necessarily bad, as they succeeded in keeping us occupied until the battles took place. THE ROBOTS:In one corner we have The Decepticons who are tough foes once again, this time their heavy hitter is a gigantic snake-like robot that rips through buildings and streets. 'Spock' does the voice of the powerful turncoat robot Sentinel Prime whose arm is like a sword and the beat-up looking Megatron is back to manipulate and scheme.And for the reigning heavyweight champ Autobots, Optimus Prime reprises his role as the robot Rambo who comes in only for the final stages of the battles after his mates take their abuse.Overall, this one was a little more entertaining then Revenge of the Fallen.",7,0,2,28 July 2011
