Marie Antoinette," Bringing on some rock'n roll into Versailles
","In addition to Kirsten Dunst you get an awesome spectacle of 18th century luxury. Coppola really tries everything to kill boredom that is often found laying for ambush in movies with full of pomp. Thanks a lot to Kirsten Dunst the film also manages to avoid that most usual boredom sins this type of movies tend to be all too prone of.Adding modern songs to a film that is entirely about history might give a wrong impression for some unprepared viewers, but at least it helps you to remember that this is not going to be an ordinary experience. The modern rock music might be in this context even rebellious choice even if it seems that rock has only found an extant convention it has not rebelled against yet. Coppola has found also for Kirsten some historical curiosities that the Austrian Princess is allowed to joke a bit about. It is possible that Coppola embellishes Marie Antoinette too much, but a good decision anyway is the choice to debunk the famous 'cake' myth.Coppola has directed a piece that will keep young people at theaters, thanks to Kirsten's beauty and his seductive smile that suits perfectly for an controversial character like Marie Antoinette. Knowing about history makes the film somewhat easier to watch as it helps you to figure out the necessary event frame. Some French is also added into dialogue but you anyway can't escape the fact that in Hollywood spectacles the only allowed language will always be English.",8,0,2,16 November 2006
Home Alone," And this was for kids?
","I never saw this film as a child but now when I finally came to see this from television I couldn't have been more shocked of what I saw. It was only good that nobody got me to watch this for this is a sick movie! You would never guess how much violence this film contains in innocent frames.Perhaps times have changed in the almost past twenty years but if burglars who shout out lines like 'I gonna kill you' and 'maybe he committed suicide' don't sound pretty disgusting for a children's movie then something has gone totally wrong. The burglars also threaten to burn the boys head and bite his fingers off one by one - Is it normal in some places of the Earth to threaten kids with bad things like that? I really hope that people aren't that mean.Furthermore the injuries made to the burglars are quite lethal too. That they are evil doesn't justify to show stunts where man lands on his head with surely breaking his neck - not even Jackass the series or the movie featured anything that dumb. In one scene the other burglar makes such a scream that it makes many horror films pale.And no, I am not some superior moral guardian who hates comical violence - I would just rather recommend Jackass the movie for children rather than this. The only audience I truly recommend this are college students who really need to turn their brains off after some really hard work.",2,4,14,17 November 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Love Humbug
","Moulin Rouge! offers beautiful and red haired Nicole Kidman, who makes men crazy, me included. It also offers Ewan McGregor, who according to some female spectators, is so cute that it makes you yell IEEK! It also offers bits from good rock music, which forms part of the dialogue as well. Moulin Rouge! appears to be stunning musical and visual experience - a quantitative spectacle in every aspect. It's a movie for people who like it as big.In artistic sense this movie is nothing less than a headache. You'll recognize favourite songs from past decades in a new context, but the overall effect resembles too much a TV-Shop commercial of some Greatest Hits of the 70's compilation. You hear only tiny bits from famous songs and just few complete numbers. That is not to say that Moulin Rouge! is bad viewing, on the contrary! It is an orgy of colours, sounds and contrasts - a vehicle of complete entertainment that will satiate you whether you like it or not. There is, and hopefully never will be, another musical like this. Moulin Rouge is so unique that if Baz Luhrmann ever attempts to create anything like this again, he should be put into jail. Go and get it, but be prepared to run away if you don't want to get over-satiated.",8,1,2,23 June 2005
8 Mile," Good introduction to Rap
","I knew nothing about this so called rap-music but after watching this film I knew at least something and, to some extent, even became interested in it. What hit me first was Eminem himself, for I completely forgot that he was not an actor of any kind. His 'acting' was brilliant because he knew what he was doing and what he presented was just himself. It became also evident that the story of the film was similar to that of Rocky movies. The world is an odd place, but a human can become a master his destiny with hard work and will.The fact that Eminem succeeds in playing his role is also due to good supporting acting. Other actors and actresses are great in their roles, especially Brittany Murphy who seems to have established herself in playing crazy girlfriends roles. Overall work of actors helps to make the whole movie a very enjoyable viewing and it shifts the attention out of the everyday banality this movie actually represents. '8 Mile' will give you a good feeling and it helps you to forget desperation that some modern films with similar social subject rather induce than remove.",8,1,1,27 October 2005
"Girl, Interrupted"," A brief lesson on how to steal a show as a supporting actress
","'Girl, Interrupted' approaches the social revolution of the sixties from a very special viewpoint: a mental institute into which a young girl is sent because of a rather light excuse. The viewer is likely to find himself or herself from the girl and not from the medical staff or from other 'normal' people. The girl doesn't seem to be mentally unstable at all if you compare her to the other patients at the institute.The storyline of 'Girl, Interrupted' is excellent but that will soon become of only secondary importance because the moment you see Angelina Jolie as Lisa for the first time you'll realize who will steal the show. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Jolie you have to admit that the role was made for her. The sociopath Lisa always keeps something going on and the story will move forward as much as it is possible inside those walls.Surely you could look for social commentaries from this film but I think that analysis would only say that this is a boring movie, which it is not. You can just relax and forget the social issues, there will be a lot of life going on, and ironically the second best and the worst thing about the film is the very same thing this time: seeing Jolie, Ryder and Murphy as the patients kinda make you want to be in there too, but remember, it's only a movie.",9,2,2,8 June 2007
Love Actually," Another guarantee Love Comedy from Britain
","A reprise of the song 'Love is All Around' in a British movie with Hugh Grant? If that wasn't a bad joke then it should start to get better and soon! Once you have survived the staccato of the mostly used swear words you can safely return from your bunker. The film does get better after all that. Or, if that was a joke too I may have not been aware of it until now? At best the movie gives you a choice of several stories from which you may find another more interesting than some other, or you may just enjoy all of them because each one of them is so different and none of them is too ordinary. Because each one of the stories is about love you can find yourself actually from some one of them, which is a nice feature indeed! After you have finished watching the film you may say that I don't even like this type of movies but anyway you watched it and enjoyed it too.",8,0,2,16 November 2006
A Hard Day's Night," An Elvis movie that was better than any of them
","We should be thankful to Richard Lester that he created this fine film about the thing that once was called 'Beatlemania'. Although the movie itself is a not a documentary in true sense it catches the essence of the Beatles just as if it was all very real. Everything in 'A Hard Day's Night' is so well balanced - there's nothing too much, nothing too less and the songs play in perfect order at the very best spot.Everything that Elvis Presley failed to do in his movies worked well with the Beatles. There are no endless amount of romances with women who look like our mothers but just hysterical girls and cool looking young lads who play music from probably their nicest sounding album A Hard Days Night, plus a couple of their older tunes.It is really cool to see a rock'n roll or pop movie where everything works so well. You will even remember those supporting actors which in other rock films become just victims of mega-rock stars hubris, but in 'A Hard Days Night' even an Irish grandfather gets a couple of memorable one-liners that does not question the Beatles' stardom. Not many other bands could ever afford that.",10,4,6,29 July 2006
Downfall," Huge effort from the German people
","'Der Untergang' is not a movie like any another. It is a great film, but it however is even more than just carefully crafted historical epic. It is also Germany's brave step to face her past that has for so long been referred to with phrases like 'Nazism' and 'the Holocaust'. Nobody but Germans could have done 'Der Untergang' and it makes the outcome quite an extraordinary experience to watch. It's not just a war film, it's a milestone in the mind of the German people.'Der Untergang' is nothing like an easy movie to watch and it does not even tell you a new story. It only let's you to see the faces of those people who the world has condemned to hold the spectre of absolute, or at least partially absolute evil. You may think that as a rather inconvenient thing as well: you have to watch psychotic Nazis for quite a long time. You'll see detailed scenes how they will all meet their destiny and how far the reality is from these people's minds. You will realise how the evil leaders mislead their weak subjects and even if the situation is hopeless they will die because the thing they believed in is gone. It is all about commitment for things later generations have doomed, but the movie will ask 'what you would have done if you had lived in Berlin during year 1945?'.You might not necessarily like what you see, you'll realise that almost anyone of us could have been there and you can almost see yourself in the film. That is why 'Der Untergang' makes you to watch it to the very end while you think the question about yourself and history.",10,1,2,28 May 2006
Bring It On," Warning - fully loaded with teen energy
","There is hardly any other movie with such an opening scene like that what this baby has. Perhaps it would have been appropriate if the people who produced this had given a warning beforehand that there has never been anywhere such a start off like that. If people survive the opening without shocking too much from an outburst of that amount of energy they probably watch the film too.It's a sports movie about cheerleaders with Kirsten Dunst leading the charge. The other characters will not get that much spotlight as her but there will be other cool persons around too. The story will also get more serious as the movies goes on. 'Bring It On' is not actually a comedy, although it is a very funny piece anyway. It doesn't make you think about deep philosophic questions but does every movie have to? This is only about cheer leading and it's a good one about it.",10,3,3,29 July 2006
The Cannonball Run," Documentary based on true events
","I started to watch this movie as a joke. I don't remember whom I specially wanted to annoy with that, but after watching the film several times I began to like it. I expected nothing from it but it gave me pleasure in sarcastic way  I've seen many better films than this, but this one is also better than many 'quality' films.The film is all about some stars gathering together and having a good time. Everyone adds into the film his/her own ideas with nothing really to be taken seriously. Most people will watch this film because of Burt Reynolds, who is probably the best actor for this kind of films. He and Dom DeLuise are not really Laurel & Hardy, but are still funny. This may probably not be the best Burt Reynolds film, but will be one of his most popular works anyway.Many viewers will also like the bad guy of the movie, Mr. Foyt, who hates cars and is totally against the whole Cannonball Run. My favourite is however Farrah Fawcett who manages to produce some good one liners like 'Are you one of those volley-ballers?' but will be corrected 'Cannonballers?'.I still keep watching this movie even if it remains for me as a joke. It's really not a good movie but isn't bad either. It's strength and cohesion lies in its harmless having-fun attitude without any special references. Some of the jokes are bit stupid but as nothing here is meant to be taken seriously, this film remains for me a portrayal of some easy-going early 1980's.",6,3,6,25 May 2005
Before Sunrise," Frame of Casablanca (1942)'s Love Story
","There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. We are too afraid to check that out.The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.",10,25,34,1 August 2005
