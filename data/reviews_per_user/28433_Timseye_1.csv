Moneyball," Not a sports guy
","O.K. so admittedly I throw the sports page away roughly 5 seconds after removing the rubber band. Knowing this, the appeal of this movie at face value did not interest me. The first scene didn't pull me in, the poor job of editing the scenes together didn't impress me either. (Dont you hate when the close up shows an actors ability then they back up and you can tell it was shot 15 minutes earlier?!) But pay all this no mind. This is a great movie. Yes, yes, I learned a bit about how the business of baseball works. I learned that the 'romance' of the game has led to many experts and faux experts. I learned its tough to be a player and its tougher to be a coach. But this movie is not about just that, its about solving problems. Its about knowing that you have to play the hand you are dealt in life and is a tough lesson. A lesson that the little boy inside you with a dream will some day have learn and tears will be in his eyes. This movie left me knowing that its not about winning. Its about how to get to a win... and what a win really is.",Null,0,0,31 October 2011
