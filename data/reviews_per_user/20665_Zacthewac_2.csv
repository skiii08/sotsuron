Deepwater Horizon," Interesting and educational but you walk out longing for the campy disaster movies of the seventies!
","Yes, I walked out of this film knowing something I didn't know before. However, I didn't care very much about it, when I really should have. And I certainly didn't care about too many of the characters.We have Mark Wahlberg and we like him because he loves his wife and daughter. And we have Gina Rodriugez who we are introduced to when she has a twenty second argument with her old, run down car and another twenty second exchange with her boyfriend. Besides that, we know nothing about her.And we know nothing about the lives or personalities of virtually anyone else on the oil rig, so we have no reason to care if they live or die. We want Wahlberg to go home to the wife and seven year old daughter who love him. We care little about Gina and nothing about anyone else. Yes, there is also the character of the corporate cold codfish who puts profits above people. We've seen him hundreds of times and this guy is no different, in spite of John Malkovich's history of creating unique, interesting characters. And we have Kurt Russell as the hardworking, dedicated, gruff, manly team leader who we've also seen two thousand times.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, the arguably campy disaster flick from the seventies was the first film that came to my mind. Thirty five years after the last time I saw the movie, I can still remember specific details about a dozen of the characters. Hundreds of people were on the boat, at least twelve of them were carefully defined with life histories and unique personalities and because they advertised that there would only be six survivors, you sat at your seat's edge pulling for the people you liked. When the faces of the actual real life casualties are shown at the end of DEEPWATER HORIZON, you have no idea which characters, if any, were based on which people.Have audiences become so dumbed down and is HBO our only salvation? There were at least twenty active, carefully defined, unique characters in any given season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE, there were just as many on THE SOPRANOS and there were at least thirty or forty on OZ. Do contemporary directors actually believe that 21st century film audiences can only follow one character at a time? Again, you cared if Mark Wahlberg lived or died. You didn't know much or care much about anyone else in DEEPWATER HORIZON. And you barely thought or cared about the actual issue. I walked out of STAR TREK IV wanting to save the whales and I left PROMISED LAND wishing I could do something about fracking. Do I care about the greed of major oil companies? I did before I saw this movie. I don't care much more or less now.",4,6,14,20 September 2016
Black Panther," Gives new definitions to words like Ludicrous!
","If you want to see a good film with an African based protagonist, watch any variation of Tarzan or King Kong. Even Magilla Gorilla cartoons had richer dialogue, more finely developed characters and a lot more credibility. Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, which is widely considered to be the worst film ever, was far more believable than this high budget, super hyped trash.Stories with boundaries of imagination, as Rod Serling put it, still have rules within the fantasy worlds they create. If the premise of the story is a man who can read minds or a woman who is compelled to tell the truth, the reality of the created world stays within the walls of that premise. The mind reader can't just instantaneously develop super powers and use them to knock out his charging enemies. Superman can fly, toss buildings around, bend bridges and even turn back time but he can't just build a flying space ship around his body and have it shoot missiles at armies. This film makes it up as it goes. Fights are decided based on how much strength and how many weapons instantly become accessible to a given warrior, at a given moment. If the filmmakers want someone to be losing a battle, his or her enemy will have the strength, weapons and indestructibility to win. If they want the fight to turn around, anything and everything the person needs to reverse it and emerge victorious will miraculously appear. There are no rules or boundaries within the reality they attempt to create, so in turn, there is zero credibility. People believe the impossible but not the improbable. This is an impossible story that throws in new improbables with virtually every frame.IMDB users seem mostly unified in feeling that this film is beyond awful. For whatever reason, it still has a 98% score from Rotten Tomatoes. And for whatever reason, after I rented the film from my cable provider, I wasn't given the option of rating it. I guess, if millions of dollars are spent to promote a Hollywood blockbuster, sites like Rotten Tomatoes only allow those who support their agendas to vote. Read the other IMDB reviews before you squander your time and money on this one. There are a limited number of hours in all of our lives and watching this film is a total waste of two of those hours.",1,3,5,26 May 2018
