The Ring," Weak unbelievable plot no better than buffy
","THere are few genres where in my opinion a film scores points by being believable as much so as the horror film genre. The very foundations of a film which sets out its stall to ' scare' as in the case of 'The Ring' are jeopardised when totally unfathomable things begin to occur. This film contains many of these moments but the main irksome point in the plot would have to be a girl who never dies who makes a video tape that kills people after seven days when she crawls out of the TV. Maybe America has indeed watched too much TV and is ready to quickly digest this sort of nonsense, or maybe this film with its pg-13 rating was aimed at an audience easily ready to suggestion IE .. kids drunk people or suggestion-able adults. This film is an utterly pointless waste of celluloid , i just feel sorry for the actors involved who after this sort of tripe are no doubt facing a very unrewarding career. Avoid this film at all costs.",4,0,1,5 April 2005
