The Monuments Men," A Monumental Failure
","I left the movie theatre in total disbelief, as I could not believe that anyone would have the courage to release this stinker of a movie.The list of problems are endless. The scenes are completely disjointed and seemed to be hacked together. Character development is non-existent. The comical tone of the movie is completely inappropriate for a movie taking place in the middle of WW2. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. The character's actions make no sense. The historical accuracy is suspect. I read somewhere that this movie is about 80% accurate. Without even knowing the real story, I would estimate that it is 10% accurate.This movie is an insult to humanity.+1 because the set was at least decently done.",2,3,6,11 March 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," Roland Emmerich: A Genius?
","I'm starting to think Roland Emmerich is a genius.First of all, this movie is probably one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. On the surface, this movie is a ridiculous, shallow, predictable, intelligence-insulting, time-wasting pile of crap. However, I believe there is a deeper meaning in his series of stinkers. Roland Emmerich is warning of the degeneration of our societies by the success of his movies. His movies symbolize the politicians we have chosen. While the citizens of our great democracies lie complacent, the politicians are looting the wealth from underneath us (like his movies have looted us of our valuable time and money).Roland Emmerich is telling us to wake up and destroy the status quo! I only hope that he continues his campaign of enlightenment, so we can enjoy a better future.",4,1,3,11 March 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Entertaining if you ignore the title.
","This movie is an action movie with the name 'Sherlock Holmes' slapped onto it. Imagine if you walked into a movie called 'James Bond' and you ended watching a movie like 'Sex and the City'. This is exactly what this felt like watching this movie.Nonetheless, this movie was entertaining. Just disassociate the name Sherlock Holmes with the character in the novels by Doyle.If the movie was called something else, I would have given it 7/10. However, I feel that this movie misled a lot of people into thinking they were watching a movie about Sherlock Holmes the detective, not Sherlock Holmes the action hero.",6,3,4,19 December 2010
The Ringer," If you have low expectations for this movie, prepare to be disappointed.
","First off, this movie is horrible. If you're looking for some laughs in this movie, you'll probably have to smoke a lot of dope.I watched this movie because it had a funny premise: 'A young guy's only option to erase a really bad debt is to rig the Special Olympics by posing as a contestant.' There's a lot of potential right? Wrong.After the first 20 minutes of the movie, the ending of the movie was blatantly obvious. The rest of the movie was just a painful crawl to the finish line. Throughout the movie, I was wondering how this movie could have gotten any funding at all with such a horrible script.This movie is classified as a comedy. Don't let that deceive you. This movie is not funny. I thought this movie would have some low-brow humour, which I enjoy once in a while, but it lacked any humour whatsoever.The 'special' characters in the movies were crappy B actors poorly portraying retarded people. I felt that they should have hired real mentally challenged people to play these roles. I'm sure they would have done a better job.The worst part is that this movie probably made money, which will encourage the studios to produce more of this kind of crap. Sometimes capitalism fails...",3,1,3,23 August 2006
