First Man," #Venezia75
","I saw this movie at the opening night of the Venice Film Festival & I loved it. it's fantastic, amazing cinematography, amazing cast, sound & amazing director. I literally cried with the person I was with and I will watch it over and over again. And let's give this Oscar to Ryan Gosling.",10,28,69,10 October 2018
