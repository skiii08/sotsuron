The Avengers," How to scam millions from the public.
","Groan. I find this movie dull, tedious and boring. It just doesn't work on any level Let's start with the Hero's. For a start there's too many. Their characters only get enough screen time to be show in one shade. All exempt iron man who is show to be like a god or something, and that is daft.The story itself makes no sense and gives the feeling that they were making it up as they went. The visuals are OK but nothing to shout about. The comedy kinda works but after you seen it once it tends to drag. It feels like they were trying to be funny instead of it being naturally funny.The avengers is the perfect example of directors thinking about money by pandering to those who have an IQ in single figures and an explosion fetish, instead of thinking about the art of creating a good movie. I would have given this film a one star but it does have one saving grace or rather three. The strong acting from hulk, Loki and captain America drag this movie though by the scruff of its neck. Overall Poor film",4,4,10,26 October 2014
Iron Man 3," Great film. Don't let reviews fool you
","This movie got a lot of stick. Why? Thats the question I ask. I am not a superhero movie fan. And that is why I love iron man three. It isn't a mind numbing mash of explosions and pointless action like most superhero movie tend to become. The movie focus on tony stark battling his own demons and struggling to do so rather than iron man just showing off and shooting things. (Iron man 2 coming to mind) Robert downing JR shows the world just how good he really is as an actor and dominates the screen with subtlety and diversity ANY actor would be proud of. Guy Peirce is as brilliant as ever, and the plot is gripping and tight.OK so it drifted from the comic books somewhat. But let's be honest, who really cares? How many of us know a great deal of info about the comic books? The Nolan batman trilogy did the same and became the best comic book movies of all time! There a lot of bad reviews on this movie, and I can see how it can split audiences. DO NOT JUDGE. Watch it first.",8,1,5,23 September 2014
Tangled," Unexpectedly liked it.
","I found myself flicking through the TV channels with nothing else on, and up pops tangled. I begin to watch not expecting much and thinking I'd go upstairs after dinner anyway. It just so happened that I began at the mother knows best reprise, and this one musical number was enough to convince me that I needed to watch it from the top.Let's start with the characters. For a start the low number of main characters means that each gets the maximum amount of screen time and therefore it's very easy to fall in love with the innocence and divided mind of Rapunzel and the charm of Flynn. In perfect contrast to a very heart lighted movie is the chilling presence of mother gothel. And she is the star of the show. Her overly sweetened nature and brilliant animation make her one of my personal favourite villeins. However as is the case in many Disney films... It has problems. With the exception of mother knows best and mother knows best reprise (both of which are brilliant and are as good as any villein song out there) the other songs are Weak at best. The movie also tends to drag a little in places as it focuses more on the romance and less on actual conflict. That being said this is a fine film. It doesn't quite stack up against some of the classics like lion king or Aladdin but a great watch.",7,1,4,23 September 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Very hit and miss
","I wasn't particularly excited when I heard about wreck it Ralph. Now I've seen it I feel the same.It seems throughout this film that Disney has lost confidence in itself. The film has a panicked thoroughness together feel about it. Rather than focus on plot and animation, it seems to try and be funny and fail. Now there are funny parts in it, and their are some truly hilarious bits, but for every joke they got right, there is a joke that falls flat. And unfortunately they stand out and have nowhere to hide.The animation is OK, but not as good as either tangled and frozen (Disney's other 3d animated films). This wouldn't be so bad but it is a long way off either of them and thus falls flat. But the biggest problem by a mile is the plot. Without giving away any spoilers I will just say it has a similar feel to despicable me or mega mind. Being the most recent of the three it feels a little recycled, and while the other two are strong compliments of each other, this is left in their dust.Having said all that their are points to compliment this film on. In places it is truly hilarious, he idea of the characters being from various computer games is clever, and surprisingly this film does play a little on the emotions. There are moments of genuine heartbreak, something Disney has been afraid to try in recent years.The saving grace of this film is glitch. ( she does have a really long real name but for he sake of the review I'll call her glitch.) for one she has a real expressive voice, also something Disney have failed in recent years. It's through her we get the real laughs so she does stand out. But it's her innocence, and her quite real struggles that is a stroke of genius. Seeing her befriend Ralph through a child's eyes and seeing him slowly being one over by her makes this film watchable. To sum up. It's not a complete waste of time but a long way of classic",Null,0,0,15 November 2014
Frozen," I wanted to put it higher. I really did.
","I'm gonna start by saying I like this film. I really do. And if you have a few hours to waste pop this on and it will wittle the time away. But...but... It isn't as good as tangled, (which I will review later.) Let's start with the problems. Number one, there are too many main characters. I'm not saying that the characters are bad but with the exception of Anna and Olaf none of them get the screen time needed. (Bear in mind Olaf is a comedy sidekick and therefore does t need as much screen time.) number two. The characters seem to tread on each other's toes. Two princes, two princesses, two comedy sidekicks? It's a bit much. And finally and this is something that drives me mad, the fixer upper scene. I don't know where to begin. The last song is just painful!! That being said this movie has its pluses. The plot twists are brave (not quite done perfectly but not bad) the comedy is fine for a chuckle (thank you Olaf, comedy genius) and the songs, with the exception of fixer upper are very good, ( a special mention has to go to let it go and for the first time in forever reprise which is my personal favourite.)All in all a GOOD film but is it a great? I'm not sure that it is",6,3,10,23 September 2014
Thor," Was never going to be an epic... Has its moments none the less
","I'm no fan of superhero movies. I find them a mind numbing mash of explosions and idiotic dialogue. When watching Thor I thought I was in for the same. The answer... Yes and no. Let's start with the negative because let be honest their more fun. The plot towards the end is daft. Like most superhero/action/sci-fi movies it starts well then blows everything up with a dull predictable supposed climax. The over theatrical dialogue for asguard can be a little much, almost like its ripping itself off. Laufey is a pretty forgettable villein and some other charatures are under developed. The biggest problem of this film is having a brilliant classical actor, Antony Hopkins, reduced to a grumpy old man.OK negatives out the way let's move on to the pluses. This has to be the most beautiful superhero movie ever made and I'm not talking about Natalie Portman, (ok maybe a little). Chris Hemsworth gives a fantastically underrated performance as he portrays the change from arrogant hothead to respectable and likable hero. The saving grace of this movie though is the comedy. This film is fantastically funny. Using juxtaposition to perfection, and brilliant banter.All in all, not as good as say the dark knight trilogy but an enjoyable film well worth a watch.",6,0,1,20 October 2014
WALLÂ·E," Classic
","Before I write this review I think its only fair that I explain a little about myself. I was born in 94, right in Disney's hay day. I grew up with things like Aladdin, lion king, beauty and the beast etc. because of this I've always had a resistance toward 3d animation. I felt it was lazy and commercialised and, in part, I still do. I also saw Wall.e when I was in my early teens. As a teen I was trying to be cool and was actively avoiding animated films as I felt they were for kids. Based on those facts I should hate Wall.e What does it say about the movie that I instantly fell in love with it. Let's talk about why? For a start its clever. The first half and hour is done with very little dialogue and yet you are instantly smitten with our hero. The expression Wall.e is able to show is unbelievable. Although Wall.e is cute and goes into the ' a-dork-able' role, I think its really brave when the animators show other emotions with him. Sorrow, despair, love, pain it's all in there. I also love the fact that they pull of the 'a-dork-able' roll. It's always a fine line to tread because it either works or the hero comes across as really annoying. The last 10mins and the emotion surprise that this story gives is beautiful and if you don't like it your more of a robot then wall.e I love eve as a character. It could have been so easy for Pixar to fall into the trap of making Wall.e the dashing hero but it's eve who does all the action stuff. Brilliant switch and it works. As I said I've always had a resistance toward 3d animation. This is one of three films where I think it really works. Especially the space shots. Theses are gorgeous and well thought out and just sublime. Do I have any issues with it? Yes but that's because there's no such thing as a perfect film. Most of the minor characters with the exemption of MO are dull really dull. I suppose I was hoping for a jungle book or a Nero where the hero meets really quirky characters and it just doesn't happen. I also get annoyed with the choice of music although hello dolly does win when it comes to originality I kept wondering what they could have done with an orchestra. But I'm nitpicking if you haven't seen wall.e you should. This is going to be a classic. A staple film for future generation. If you 5. If your 15. If your 50. Wall.e will melt your heart.",9,0,1,7 January 2015
X-Men: First Class," Not an xmen fan.... This didn't help
","OK so after a little nagging from friend I sat through x men first class... It left me a little cold.For a start their is no texture to the movie. It's all the same pace, many of the characters show no diversity in their performance and with so many characters and so many powers to keep track of, my head was left spinning. Some of the superpowers are either over the top (ok this may not be the movies fault but it could be filmed better) or we've seen them already. And the biggest sin of all... Where is Hugh jackman???????? Their is one saving grace. Fassbender is superb in every way. One of the strongest performances I've seen in a Marvel film. Whether he is showing sorrow, rage, wit or arrogance he shows every one of his co stars just how it's donePoor film... Fassbender just makes it watchable",4,1,6,23 September 2014
