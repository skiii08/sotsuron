Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Exciting, funny, and entertaining
","If you liked the first 3 films, you'll probably like this one. I liked it. If I had to put the films in order from best to worst it would be: Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End (Tied for 2nd place in my opinion), then On Stranger Tides. Just because this one wasn't as good as the others, doesn't mean it wasn't good at all. I'm glad they're making a 5th one in 2015. It might not be that good but I already watched the previous 4, and now I want to see more. I hope Hans Zimmer does the soundtrack to the next one, like he did for the first 4. The Score for this one was great, just like the others, Johnny Depp was great again as 'Captain' Jack Sparrow. Black Beard was a decent villain, Barbossa is awesome, Mr. Gibbs is in it, Penelope Cruz is pretty hot, so was the mermaid. The film was exciting, funny, and entertaining.",9,0,1,16 October 2013
