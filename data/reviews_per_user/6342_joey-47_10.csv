The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest films I've ever seen
","What constitutes horror?  Many people say it's blood and guts (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and so on).  Others say it's movies that mess with your mind (The Shining,), and others will say it's how much a movie startles you and makes you jump to the ceiling (can't think of one off hand).But real horror, is the type we cannot see.  It's the type that we leave to our imagination because we know that there could be any number of possibilites, and some of those can be so horrific, it gives you chills just thinking about it.  As is the case with The Blair Witch Project.  I saw the film in a packed movie theater and I've never seen a film captivate a group of people this big the way it did.  I'm talking about that everyone in the place was dead freakin' silent.  My heart was up into my throat by the time the movie ended.  I didn't jump, I didn't get grossed out, I just thought about the movie for hours after seeing it, and didn't sleep well at all that night.  Any horror movie that scares the living daylights out of me the way The Blair Witch Project did, is an absolute 10 in my book.  It's like not wanting to ride the rollercoaster, and then riding it and then saying you want to go on again.Take dramamime before seeing it, or if not, just look away from the screen every so often because the herky-jerky home video style filming will make you a bit queasy.  This movie deserves several mentions at the Academy Awards.  If not, then chalk up another injustice in the film industry.  If you happen to wait for home video to watch this, turn the lights off, and watch it by yourself.  The full effect of this masterpiece will be felt all the more.",10,3,6,27 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stop the bickering and just let TPM entertain you!
","George Lucas is an evil genius.  For 16 years, my vision of Star Wars has been Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and all the rest.  I will admit that when I saw The Phantom Menace, I was a little confused by it, but I nonetheless, enjoyed the movie.  I saw it once more and came out with the following feeling: THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!  But I had to see it twice in order to understand the fact that this is our new Star Wars trilogy.  Lucas is laughing at this fact all the way to the bank.  My advice, is that if you're a big SW fan, go see the movie once more.  I promise, most of you will see the movie in an entirely different perspective.  You've seen it once and you now know what to expect.  I found that the unfolding of the story was rather intriguing and I'm dying to know how things unfold in the next 2 episodes.The movie itself is an enjoybale 2 hours at the theater, highly worthy of being called a Star Wars flick.  And who are these people getting all over Jar Jar Binks?  He wasn't my favorite character in the movie but he certainly (if you can call a computer image a 'he')pulls his weight more than admirably.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do wonderful jobs as the cool handed jedis.  If Darth Maul was in one or two more scenes, the full effect of his presence definitely would have been felt, but it was felt, that much is certain.  And Natalie Portman, oh Natalie Portman.  She was born to play a queen.  It will be a shame when she drops from the storyline.With this in mind, stop the bickering and just enjoy the movie. If you look for the bad, you will become angry and as Master Yoda says 'Anger leads to hate, and hate.....leads to suffering!'",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
Fight Club," Mischief, Mayhem and Soap, but did it really need to be 2 and a half hours?
","Going into Fight Club, I knew it was going to be long, and I knew it would be a sensory overload type of experience.  But you cannot tell me that David Fincher was looking to give the audience a messed up and chaotic experience simply because he thought it would be cool or different.  Sadly, this IS what Fincher is thinking and to tell you the truth, it severely cripples the movie.This movie is interesting but not in a good way.  It goes a little too deep for a movie that's about guys looking to change their life by kicking each other's ass on a weekly basis.  And what did SOAP and liposuction have to do with the real plot of this movie?  If the narrator is fighting himself and talking to himself, why do we see him getting dragged across a floor by an invisible force?  How does he shoot himself in the mouth and not die?  All the crazies that cry symbolism, just hold on.  By the end of the movie which was so unecessarily long, I don't even care about symbolism.  All I care about is that I've wasted 140 minutes of my time with an incredibly depressing and dark piece of trash movie that I get nothing out of.You can bet that I will follow the rules of Fight Club.....never talk about Fight Club....because it's not worth my time.End of Story...I'm gone.",Null,0,1,19 October 1999
American Pie," They don't make them like this anymore. The most well-done comedy of the year!
","'Porky's' or 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'  are two of the greatest movies of this caliber.  American Pie, which does a great job in following suit, is one of the most refreshingly entertaining movies I've seen in the last several years.  It contains many pranks as well as many schemes that backfire, and plenty of humor to get the politicians in an uproar.   But I was very surprised at the fact that the movie carried many redeeming messages with it.  IE, sex, although enjoyable and sometimes being the only goal of horny youngans, is not the most important thing in life, they only think it is. I know I'm not alone in my theory.  Many of us were once horny teens who at the very least, THOUGHT about doing unspeakable things to simulate the act of sex.  And if you laugh while watching this movie's depiction of this very point, put yourself into that category.Movies about high school have been on the lame side for the last 5 or 6 years.  American Pie will hopefully start a rebellion against the 'She's All Thats' of the world.  I say this because I get offended when directors portray high school as this adult world where everyone knows the score and seems to be so organized and on top of things (ie Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills 90210).  Myself, along with most of the other 440 people in my graduating class (as well as the rest of the country's high shcool population) didn't know anything, now looking back on it.American Pie is a movie for anyone who was once a confused and curious teenager in high school, guys and girls alike. The bluntness of the humor may suggest it's only for men.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.  Under all the bits and pranks, you will find an actual movie with loads of charm that is well worth your time.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
American Psycho," A great psychological thriller which doesn't lose the audience!
","This movie is what's known as an 'Intelligent' horror film.SPOILER DISCLAIMER!Anyone expecting a Friday the 13th, or a Scream If You Know What I Taught Mrs. Tingle Last Summer, I'm sorry but you may be disappointed.This is no doubt a horror movie, but it is more a period piece about 80's pretentiousness more than anything. IE, not being hungry at all but needing to have a reservation somewhere, or striving to have the slickest looking business card.On another front, this movie is what the utterly dreadful FIGHT CLUB tried to be.  And that is, the story of a society drone who, despite his good living, is so damn fed up with the everyday routine, that his compulsive behavior and his decreasing patience level lead him to the point of insanity, which then leads to homicidal activity.  All of the events which make up this scenario in American Psycho, unfold in an intriguing way which makes those who are enjoying the film, want more.Now, this movie is also one of those very weird ones.  But weird in a good way, unlike Fight Club which lost me about half way through.  But AP succeeds because the story sticks to the title of the movie, and unlike many psychological thrillers, it never loses the audience.",Null,0,1,11 July 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A very pleasant surprise!
","I went into this film, knowing it was 67 hours long (just under 3 hours in non-exaggerated terms) and hoping that it wasn't going to be another 'critics only like it because it's Kubrick' type of movie, with lot's of symbolic weirdo bizzaro material that only Stanley Kubrick can deliver.  I thought I would be shifting in my seat a billion times and getting restless halfway through the film.  I think Kubrick is sporadic at best, with his films.  I loved The Shining, and the first half of Full Metal Jacket, but I thought Dr. Strangelove was only OK, and 2001 was absolutely dreadful, with the exception of Hal9000.But, I must say, that with Eyes Wide Shut, I was never restless, nor was I ever bored for one second, I was actually interested in all of the symbolism, and I only shifted in my seat a few times due to the fact the movie was rather long, but it didn't even seem like it.  I give the utmost kudos for Mr. Kubrick for going out in style.  It had all the elements that movies today do not such as good acting, great cinematography, a good story, good direction and oh yeah.....It's original.If you are usually intrigued by Kubrick but don't love him, go see this one, because you will like it.  If you are unintelligent and only like watching movies instead of getting into them, then don't waste your time.  This movie is for people who will give movies a chance and not base their decision on whether it lives up to the hype.  C'mon people.  I mean, when has a movie ever lived up to the hype?  I thank Mr. Kubrick for giving us a film worth the price of admission.",Null,0,0,9 September 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Star Wars on LSD
","The first Matrix was full of lively characters, action, and enough plot to keep it moving.  That's what The Matrix is all about.Reloaded goes all Star Wars on us.  Commanders and space cruisers and rebel forces, and oh yeah, dance parties.  It completely lacks what made the first movie so great.  It was a lot less fun, the whole first half was like watching C-SPAN, and the endless jargon inflated dialogue about choices and dreams and fate....oh my does it ever end?I don't mind a further explanation into the life that surrounds the Matrix but don't make the whole movie about that. There's nothing wrong with paying a little attention to explanation.  But Build on what gave The Matrix its good name.  Reloaded goes completely away from that.  I only hope that Revolutions doesn't take itself so seriously.Everyone is crucifying the 'cliffhanger' ending.  I say the ending doesn't make a bit of difference if the movie that precedes it is good.  2.5 out of 4.",Null,0,0,30 May 2003
Jaws," Kept me from the water for many years!
","Jaws, like The Godfather, spawned many copycat movies after it.  It is unfortunate that The 'Jaws' series only contains one good film, the original.  I think that they should sell the original by itself and sell the rest of the half-assed Jaws films by themselves.  Jaws is certainly one of the most incredible films of all time.There are few movies that have chemistry of this magnitude.  I can't imagine anyone else in the roles played by Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss.  I think my favorite aspect of the movie was how it resembled Moby Dick in the modern era.  You have your politicians worried about the town's economy, the young zealot from the oceanographic institute with all of his high tech gear, and mixed in with the new, you've got Captain Quint:  an good old-fashioned fisherman whose got more trophies on his wall than Teddy Roosevelt.This film has never gotten boring.",Null,0,1,14 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," A brilliantly done journey into the supernatural.
","A word for all who haven't seen The 6th Sense:  You will not know anything about it unless you see it.  The trailers really don't reveal anything.Another word for all who haven't seen The 6th Sense:  SEE IT, it is one of the best movies of the year to this point.I really do hope that the Academy Awards give proper credit to Haley Osement by nominating him for best actor or best supporting actor (whatever category they think just as a long as they give it to him).  This role was difficult and also, he's a kid.  Kids aren't supposed to deliver this kind of an electrifying performance.  And even if you don't want your spine to tingle with chills, and even if you don't want to see Bruce Willis in one of his best roles ever, and even if you don't want to see it because this kind of movie doesn't turn your button, I highly recommend just going to see it for Haley Osement.  I promise you'll be glad you did.The movie itself is a wonderful journey into the supernatural, brilliantly acted, with a great story and plot twists that will make you think about it for a long time after.  James Newton Howard's musical score should also be up for a nomination.  His music delivers exactly the tone that the movie needs in order to get it's point across and OH how it succeeds.I give the movie ***1/2 stars.  The price of admission well spent.",10,0,0,17 August 1999
Gladiator," Gladiator is a 'true' blockbuster!
","Get ready for a visually stunning movie that will touch your soul, make you cheer, and make you cringe all in one shot.  When the royal highness isn't getting his hand kissed by the people, and when the camera doesn't pan above the Roman Coliseum, and when you aren't truly feeling involved in this simple but wonderful story of a brave general turned slave turned Gladiator, you are cringing every time a sword cuts into a man's flesh.  Even the violence was visually stunning.  This movie (and I won't give away too much), has a battle scene comparable to that of Saving Private Ryan's opening battle.  Although not as long and drawn out, it brilliantly sets the tone for a movie 2 hours and 34 minutes in length which seems like and hour and a half when it's all done.  Kudos on the casting job.  Crowe delivers with a bang and he is proving once again that he belongs here.  Give him a part and he will play it, much like the rest of the LA Confidential alumni. Gladiator is a film of potential epic proportion.  But it won't become an epic unless people make it that way.  It's a wonderful cinematic experience not to be missed by anyone who would appreciate a movie of this caliber.",Null,0,0,22 May 2000
