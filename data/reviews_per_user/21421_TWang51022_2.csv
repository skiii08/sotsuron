Casablanca," Best Movie Ever!
","I'm sure it has been repeated over many, many times that this is the best movie ever made, or at least is really close to being the best movie ever made.  Now why is that?  That is because it is the best movie ever made. Anybody that doesn't like this movie seriously has problems.  I mean, how can't you not like this movie?  The acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and story is just perfect.  Well, that's about all I have to say since everything else that needs to be said has all been pretty much said.",10,1,1,3 January 2003
Doctor Zhivago," This movie made me happy that I lived in America!
","Wow, this was a great movie.  There were definitely faults, I will admit, but I believe the overall packages go beyond those faults.  I will make this very brief and short.  I was deeply moved by Zhivago and its great performances, especially that of Omar Sharif.  I felt his struggle of trying to make the best of his situation living in a Communist government.  This movie made me happy that I lived in America.  Brilliant acting, directing, photography, and music.  The whole package.",10,2,5,22 July 2003
