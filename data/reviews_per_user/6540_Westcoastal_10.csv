The Hangover," Ridiculously Overrated
","I found reading the reviews of this movie more entertaining than the movie itself. Yeah, there are some funny moments, but for the most part it just over-promises and under-delivers. There are so many elements to the story that go too far over the top, but don't have enough absurdity or humour to make it work. There are plenty of comedies that are more outrageous than this one, but they pull it off because they have the comic delivery to make us laugh enough that we just don't care. In the case of The Hangover, the delivery is just not funny, witty or foolish enough to make any of the major comic devices work. As a result, most of the content just seems gratuitous and annoying, and falls really flat.The Hangover is watchable enough, and you will laugh a couple of times, but don't let the over-the-top reviews fool you. It's just not that great. Unoriginal, and stupid in a bad way.One last thing. PLEASE, people, stop comparing this to Wedding Crashers. It's not anywhere near as funny or as well executed. You're just embarrassing yourselves.",5,4,11,30 December 2009
United 93," Unbelievably bad
","I have avoided this movie for years because I knew it was bound to be bad, but I had no idea just how bad. A truly offensive piece of film-making. The acting/direction was atrocious and almost unwatchable, the writing was so bad that, if the subject matter hadn't been so serious, it would have been totally laughable. The film was, predictably, emotionally manipulative and melodramatic, but what amazes me - when looking at the absurdly inflated score here - is that the manipulation seems to have worked despite the heavy-handed approach. Perhaps that's why it worked. Certain audiences seem to really lap up this kind of dreck... the more dumbed down, the better. If you've got an IQ over 80, this film is not for you.",1,2,11,1 July 2014
Hereditary," Excellent, worth seeing, disappointing ending
","I enjoyed this film tremendously. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I was totally blown away by it until the last 20 minutes or so. It is an exceptional psychological thriller that has the right mix of tension, suspense and disorientation, and the long silences helped to intensify those elements. The soundtrack/score for this film is outstanding. One of the best I've heard in any genre, definitely the best I've heard in this genre. The acting is also excellent. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the direction they decided to take it in at the end. It was a letdown. I had hoped for something a bit less silly. Despite that, the film is still very much worth seeing.",7,2,5,24 August 2018
Cloverfield," Almost unparalleled in the genre
","I first reviewed this film back in 2008 and decided to update my review nearly a decade later because I STILL watch this film regularly. It is without a doubt my favourite monster movie of all time.I am a bit of a monster movie fanatic and will watch just about anything in the genre. I'm an especially huge fan of Godzilla (with the exception of the awful 1998 version) and I wince a bit to say I enjoy Cloverfield more than Godzilla, but I have no choice but to acknowledge that it is superior in its ability to completely suck you in and keep you invested in what's happening on screen.The storyline the film is built around is a bit clich√© but it works well as a backdrop to the disaster that is unfolding. It creates some decently believable motivations for the characters and while I wouldn't be very moved by it as a romantic story in any other context, I think it serves its purpose well here.I think the reason this film works so well is that it focuses on the experience of being inside a monster attack, rather than focusing on all the logistics and militaristic drama of battling one from the outside. This makes the film much more gripping and psychologically tense than other films of the genre.I tend toward motion sickness and the shaky camera thing bothered me a bit when I first watched it in the theatre but viewing it at home I've not had any ill effects.I have seen this film a minimum of 25 times, and I know I'll watch it many times more. If you haven't seen it before I recommend checking it out.",10,1,2,10 April 2008
Elf," Very cute - and I HATE Christmas
","I just hate Christmas - I really do. I hate everything about it. But I really enjoyed this movie. It was by no means brilliant - no comedy of this kind could ever be called such - but it was incredibly sweet and adorable. If you are someone who doesn't like cute or silly humor, you will hate this movie. It's the sort of thing that might give you a toothache. But if you like cuteness and silliness - innocent, simple humor - you will love this movie as I did. Yeah, it's full of all the typical lame Christmas schmaltz and the santa stuff and all that groan-worthy 'christmas spirit' pap, but I was able to enjoy it anyway, for the same reasons I enjoyed the old puppet rudolph and frosty shows. It's done in a very cute way that makes it palatable. It really made me laugh (in fact, at one point I had an uncontrollable giggle fit over how cute it was) and days later I still think about it every now and then and smile.Again, not a smart or brilliant movie, but very sweet.Also, I totally agree with others on this board - that Infinifilm thing is just terrible. I really liked the movie, but if I were going to watch it again I'd want to just watch it - not have these interruptions, and if I were going to watch the special features (which I would have loved to) I'd want to just access them without having to go through the whole film again. JUST TERRIBLE! I was disappointed I didn't get to see the special features but, forget about it!",7,4,8,1 December 2004
Interstellar," Shallow and Hugely Disappointing
","I love sci fi, and I'm a pretty easy target because I am really able to get into a story without ripping it to shreds every step of the way. I should LOVE this movie, but I found it profoundly disappointing. For one thing, the story was SO overly melodramatic that at times I was wondering if they were being sarcastic. I am a sucker for emotional depth, but this story was incredibly shallow and superficial. The tech was interesting, but again, really not very believable on so many levels. The plot was so full of holes that I stopped bothering after awhile. In terms of performances, nothing to get excited about. Really, the actors did their best with an embarrassingly poor script.I'm going to give these guys the benefit of the doubt and assume that a huge chunk of what this film was about ended up on the cutting room floor. There was a lot of potential that was squandered here, and I hate to think this is the movie they intended to make.",6,4,8,4 April 2015
Hugo," Massively Overrated - Big Disappointment
","Another great example of why I trust reviews, award shows and hype less and less every year. Here's a film that's been hyped and hyped and won tons of awards; a movie everyone is talking about, but which has almost no redeeming value.Sure, it's visually stunning and beautifully made, but the story and characters are dimensionless and empty. It was almost unwatchable. I kept holding out hope that something compelling or meaningful or interesting would happen, but it never did. The fact that the movie was so long only made matters worse.The mechanics and clockworks they plastered all over the ads created a sense of excitement, mystery and adventure that is never realized in the film. What seems really exciting and inviting in the posters and ads is cold and dull in the actual film. It felt monochromatic and alienating when I was actually watching it.One last nitpick - a pet peeve of mine is movies where the character's accents don't match the location. In this case, a movie set in France, where all the characters have English accents. A bit annoying.",4,3,8,5 March 2012
Gone Girl," An insult to human intelligence
","This movie was honestly among the worst and most over-hyped pieces of garbage I've ever seen. Politically/morally repugnant in its irresponsible, misogynistic stereotypes, yeah, but almost as repugnant is the unendurably bad delivery of an abysmally written story. The sound was good, I will give it that, but everything else about it was terrible. Just terrible.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that it's so well rated. Given the audience for this type of drivel, I suppose there are plenty enough people to enjoy it and rate it highly. That fills me with existential dread. Beam me up, Scotty! ASAP.",3,12,20,23 December 2014
The Incredibles," ads waaaay better than the film
","this movie is perhaps one of the best marketing/advertising feats of recent years. a movie that is totally without redeeming qualities - a movie that in fact is politically insulting and totally formulaic becomes a hit that makes the IMDb top 100. either the population at large is sadly lacking in intelligence and standards, or they are sheep. or both. this movie was so terrible there aren't words enough to describe it.for those of you considering renting/buying it - please, I BEG you - DON'T DO IT! these are a couple hours you will never get back!!! for those of you considering this film for your kids I'd say great idea, if you want them to grow up with the same values and personality (or lack thereof) as june cleaver and betty flintstone.",1,30,84,20 March 2005
The Adjustment Bureau," Religious GARBAGE
","If you are any kind of free-thinker, don't waste your time with this. The movie is TERRIBLE. Practically unwatchable. It's religion disguised as sci-fi. Unforgivably bad.I gave it 2 stars because of the first couple scenes. It could have gone interesting places from there, but it really didn't. And that was only 10 or 15 minutes into the film.Don't waste your time. It truly is among the worst I've seen in ages. I fervently wish I'd turned it off when it started to get lame. It's just a manifestation of ideas I find thoroughly repulsive, and I can't get that 2 hours back.",2,4,7,29 August 2011
