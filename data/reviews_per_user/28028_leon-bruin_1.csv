The Monuments Men," Great homage to an intrepid few
","I watched this great 'kind of slow' movie with intensifying interest and can only say that all European culture aficionados owe these Monuments Men more than they can be acknowledged for. The attitude towards smoking may have changed as one state: 'This movie is one unappreciated prolonged cigarette commercial'. But for me and probably most this movie is all about our perpetual admiration for art in general and for the recovered artifacts in particular. I have seen some of them and just took it for granted that they were there on display but I did not know this moving story behind it. Reading some of the negative reviews I am just stupefied by lack of appreciation for this great homage to an intrepid few and probably these critics never visit a museum either. We, the art aficionados, can only be immensely grateful for the Monuments Men efforts which are so well depicted in this movie. Indeed: 'What is a civilization without art?'",9,1,2,4 May 2014
