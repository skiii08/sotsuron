It," Great horror film
","I wasn't ready for It. Its a horror movie that uses kids as its main focus, and it does it very well, in fact extremely amazingly good. I love these child actors they probably provide the best acting in their age I have ever seen in horror film like ever. It got these child characters that you care about to the end, and when the horror actually happens its so much more impactful when the blood flows. As for the killer clown I have to say that he is great and scary but he hasn't have enough screen time to make an impact on me as a viewer who just wants to be terrified of him and that rarely happens cause he is hardly in the movie like at all, a damn shame. So overall the movie is a bit scary, but what really sells it is the kid actors that just knows how to act perfectly, its just outstanding performances.",8,0,0,13 September 2019
John Wick," A new way to make action films
","I cant praise this movie enough, its absolutely brilliant. John Wick can do action like no other action hero in Hollywood ever dreamed off. You gets these quick and brutal action scenes that's just sucks you in to this hitman kind of universe were a tough guy just kills everyone. If you like action movie then don't skip this one, its f...... amazing.",8,0,2,25 March 2019
Se7en," A dark and disturbing masterpiece
","Seven takes you on a horrifying journey with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two policemen on the hunt after a psychotic killer that change both their lives but mostly for the worst. Seven is a very depressing movie, from the first screenshot shows how dark and cold the unknown setting off the film truly is. It's not a movie for little kids, its like an evil film with violence and gruesome that honestly are more brutal then the psychological thrillers and horror movies being made in Hollywood today. It is just pure perfect film that just keeps getting better every time I watch it. Why the hell movie today has no soul anymore is a mystery to me. They just seems to me that the film being made today are just copying each other badly, but Seven deliverd something hole new and sinister to the cop genre and that's why to me its a clear 10 out off 10 points, just freakin amazing.",10,0,0,11 February 2019
Captain Marvel," I have seen it all before
","All right another superhero movie were I predicted almost everything off plot twist that was surely gonna happen. But the few surprises the Captain Marvel film had of it sleeve just didn't blew me away, it was like ok that happened but I don't really care anymore. What's more yes comedy where I didn't laugh at all, just so many embarrassing moments that was very dull and stupid that they literally ruined most off the f...... movie for me . I have seen it all before. It's the same good damn movie over and over again. Please take something new to the superhero genre instead off making it a film were the bad guy gets beat up and the hero wins. Avengers Infinity Ward was actually a film were something finally is at stake, and makes the main villain actually a real thread. But no we cant do that just don't do anything new cause people just don't care about a movie with quality just the same old garbage and they pay for it, so yes I didn't like this piece off trash film one bit.",2,3,5,9 March 2019
Us," Its al most a scary masterpiece
","Us is the way to go if you want to make a horror film that just take you on a journey were you sometimes have no friking idea what's going on and that is the reason that this movie keeps surprising you in a completely predictable way. The acting is outstanding so much that the actors carry the entire movie without adding any flaw in their performances. This is a creepy movie full off atmosphere, surprises and dark moments that you wont forget anytime soon and that will stay with you in some time. Us gets a bit repetitive sometimes but if you are a horror fan like me then it's definitely worth a watch.",9,0,3,16 August 2019
Oldboy," Brutal film
","Oldboy takes you on a dark journey with a man that looses everything and the only thing he has left is pure bloodthirst after his nemesis that has completely destroyed his life, its time for revenge. Oldboy is made by the Japanese people that knows how to make brutal movie that is more dark and violent then any movie I have seen from America in a decade. Watch it but beware is not for the faint hearted.",9,0,2,18 June 2019
The Irishman," Snork boring
","Sometimes its best to retire if you are getting to old to do something, and this disappointing mess off a film the Irishman proves it. You three main actors De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are so out off their game, playing characters that most off the film is to young for their acting talents to shine through, and makes this hole trash film very hard to keep invested its entire run. Its very sad to watch a film where they keep getting this I am to old but f... it let's do this anyway theme. If you like to watch sad old men trying to be something that's fake then here you go, but for me nahh its just very bad.",2,5,10,3 January 2020
The Irishman," This is a big mess
","The Irishman is an unbelievable boring film. This is embarrassing how much praise this movie have gotten by critics and people that don't have any idea what the hell they are talking about. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino struggles with their roles because ass almost everyone knows, THEY ARE F...... OLD AND CANT ACT AS CHARACTERS THAT ARE WAY YOUNGER THEN THEMSELVES, but I have to say that Joe Pesci can do something that both De Niro and Pacino cant, he delivers a performance that is so intense that you just quickly just forgives his age and just moves on from there. But even if Joe is great the movie just feels most like a fetch quest from a video game where De Niro Character Frank talks to some gangsters and gets a job and then do the task and do the same thing again and again and again, and that's pretty much the entire friking film, Jesus Christ. Listen I know that the three main lead loves to make great films, but this awful way off doing what you love when you are to old to do it, its just killing your entire career man, just leave it be.",2,2,5,16 December 2019
Creed," Real drama
","Oh my God I love this movie. Creed is exactly what the Rocky movies should have been. It's probably the best boxing movie I have ever seen in a decade. Creed got the most and realistic amazing boxing scenes ever filmed, where you actually feel that you are watching it live, it's amazing guys. Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone have great chemistry and you really are on their side when the boxing brutality goes down in the ring. If you love Rocky then Creed is a film you most not avoid its that good.",9,0,2,24 May 2019
Deadpool 2," Its fun but also stupid
","Enough is enough. Deadpool 2 is so full off slapstick comedy to the point that it just gets very old and annoying. This isn't a bad movie by any means but sometimes you just need to stop and issue before it's gets too overwhelming. The action scenes safe Deadpool 2 from being a crappy film so that's always great I think. I also have to say that the post credit scene is so hilariously goofy that I just couldn't stop laughing so that's always a plus. Warning, this movie is entertaining and fun to watch, but beware off the going to far comedy. You have been warned.",4,0,3,20 July 2019
The Prestige," Great film
","The prestige is just so unpredictable that you wort see the final scene in the film coming. Great acting script and setting. It takes you to an otter World, its movie making ad its Best. Its sure Worth a watch.",8,2,2,16 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," It's a family film
","Spider-Man homecoming its a movie for kids. The only times this movie actually was a film for grownups was when the main villain the vulture was on the screen. When Michael Keaton is getting full on psycho on Tom Hollands Spidey the film worked for me. But when he is not available in the picture the movie as I said is like watching a cheesy cartoon movie for children, and that really bored me a lot. The movie is by all means a bit entertaining so it gets 4 four stars from me, but could've have been so much better, really disappointing.",4,1,2,28 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Its so cringe worthy
","This Star Wars film is a crime. This is a train wreck, and total disaster off the possible best film trilogy ever made, and you know what ? Rise of Skywalker plot just killed Star Wars. I won't spoil anything but when you see its conclusion you know exactly what I'm talking about. So warning this movie is not really a Star Wars film, its a rip-off.",1,11,18,3 February 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Realistic but boring
","This movie has a lot going for it. The problem is that is just to realistic, so much that the entire film just becomes so boring that I just thought oh boy this is just to much realism for me. The acting setting and music is perfect but it just gets extremely boring very fast cause the film does everything a 100 pro cent correct. Maybe it's just me maybe I am completely wrong in my opinion but when a movie bore me to sleep I cant just lie and say that the film was great even if it does everything absolutely right. So maybe other people will like the film and I can completely understand that but for me it was a big mess sorry.",2,2,13,25 January 2019
Baby Driver," Pure film art
","I have to say that Baby Driver is the best movie I have seen in years. When a main character is called Baby you just know that you are in for quite a ride. And this movie delivers everything with masterful acting, spectacularly action scenes and bits off comedy, that just is all around amazingly done. The movie gets almost a full rating from me cause it can drag a bit through the film, but that doesn't stop it from getting a 9 star. Well done.",9,0,1,8 June 2019
Dunkirk," Boring war movie
","I am falling a sleep. This movie is so boring. I cant belive that a movie with this High budget Can be so bad. So just skip is not worth any off your time, its just trash not Worth watching at all.",2,4,7,14 January 2019
American History X," Racism ain't cool bro
","American History X stars off very brutal and meaningless. But slowly as the film proceeds you scene after scene you feel that the main character played wonderfully by Edward Norton is another person then the terrifying psychopath you see from the first insane violent scene that is just good damn pointless. And when Nortons character changes for the better, is it his little brother played by Edward Furlong that is the new racist black sheep in the family that the big brother have to set on the path of good before its to late. This is the best film about racism ever made. It just sucks you in to this unfair world where nothing makes sense at all. I just love that a bad guy becomes good and finds his humanity its makes you feel good cause there is always a light in the end of the tunnel when evil appears. As I said before, the acting by the two Edwards is amazing and the movie just show how bad racism really is and why you should defently avoid at all cost.",9,1,1,26 February 2019
Resident Evil," Its just a big mess
","My God this film has a lot off problems. I cant stand the horrible writing, acting and action scenes that goes so fast that you don't know what the hell is going on most of the time. I love the Resident Evil games, but this film almost seems like a big mistake, a little bad thing that shouldn't have been made in the first place. The only reason mess doesn't get zero stars is that it still a bit entertaining so that's always good, but still a big disappointment.",3,1,4,13 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Disappointing movie
","I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit.",6,7,10,4 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Best Marvel movie ever made
","This movie kicks so much ash that i cant think of another superhero movie that have maked me so exited and impressed after leaving the cinema. There is nothing wrong with this film, acting amazing, characters you just care about and a story that tales you on a journey you wont forget any time soon. One word masterpiece.",10,0,5,12 January 2019
Get Out," Best horror movie in years
","Great film i was entertainer and spoked the Whole movie. Insane plot twist and great cast, one word amazing",8,0,3,19 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's not really a Star Wars movie
","The last Jedi is a very offending movie. If you love the Star Wars franchise, then for gods sake don't watch this movie in the cinema, you will be deeply disappointing. I hates this movie it is just so bad that I wish that they had called it something else then Star Wars like Earth Warfare or something I may had given it a higher score. But this is Star Wars guys is not a little movie is maybe the biggest franchise ever made in film history and The Last Jedi just pisses all over its legacy. Need I to say more. Just skip it.",1,11,14,12 May 2019
Saw II," Is meant to be scary
","Saw 2 isn't perfect but it still got great moments to back it up with its fine cast and structure. I just don't think that is really scary, just very over the top with its gore and violence that's just so damn entertaining to watch. It just didn't have that brutal feeling I got from the first Saw movie had and that's kind off ruins a lot off the movie. Don't think that this film is gonna make you feel really on comfortable like the first one did. Its just damn good television.",5,0,0,24 October 2019
Sinister," Real horror
","You may think that Sinister is just another serial killer movie? Well it's not. I thought that it was just the same old catch the killer horror film that already we have seen a thousand times before but Sinister turns the table around in a way that I have never seen in a horror movie before. I won't spoil anything but the ending is very disturbing that I almost turned off my TV I have never done that before while watching a horror movie. Sinister is not a film for kids, it's a sick film but as a creepy movie it's just great.",9,2,3,29 May 2019
The Departed," Stunning gangster film
","I think that the gangster movie genre is something that just is the same good damn movie over and over again, but The Departed shows that the good old stuff still has the fire going for it. It has the same plot like other gangster movies but were it truly works is the amazing funny dialogue and great performances. DiCaprio, Damon and Jack Nicholson is at their best with insane amount off attention that just flows through the entire movie. There is a lot off brutal violence that is not for people that like that kind of stuff, if you don't like blood and gore I wouldn't recommend the film. It's just a gangster flick I could watch over and over again, is that good, the best in its genre.",9,2,4,13 April 2019
Joker," Best movie off the decade
","I was getting sick off going to the cinema these days with crappy sequels, soulless action flick and just the same old films that keeps ruining Hollywood, but then I watched Joker and I have to say that the if people keeps making movies like this I have no doubt that the film industry is saved. This is an absolute masterpiece that just sucks you ind and never lets go. Its brutal, its terrifying, its so tragic that you really feel for Arthur Flex and his alter ego the Joker to the point that you almost forgets that he actually is a psychopathic killer. Jacqueline Phoenix gives the performance of his life, the laughter, the smile and his creepy and sympathetic voice sells the character completely 100 pro cent. I love this movie, is the best movie I have seen in a decade, and I don't think that will change any time soon.",10,3,6,8 October 2019
Whiplash," When a man it's pushed to his limits
","I love this movie. It's really rare that you watch a film were passion and commitment is at the forefront its hole play trough. I have never in my entire damn life met a more evil person on screen the J. K. Simmons performance as the musician Terrence Fletcher , he is so evil and psychopatic that you hate him more and more when it becomes very clearly that this man is the devil in human form. Miles Teller plays the young drummer Andrew Neiman that tries to become a professional musician and get Fletchers respect with his drum skills but it all goes crazy in and extremely sinister way with Fletcher psycho manipulation off the young drummer that is in a nightmare where he either have to fight back or be totally destroyed. It's a film that does everything right, pacing, plot twist, acting it got it all. And the ending is the best ending in any movie in 20 years. I just loves this movie. Breathtaking.",10,0,0,8 April 2019
Scream 2," Very disappointing
","If you have seen the first Scream movie you know sort off what to expect, a murder, a psychopathic one or two killers and a tough damsel in distress that are tough as nails. Its really just the same movie again except the identity off the killers that just came out off the blue, and its probably the best part off the entire movie. Listen when making a sequel try to bring something new to the genre instead off copy paste the first scream film that just what original, tense and scary, but now the second films seems more like a teenage comedy with stupid lines and over the top acting that just kills the entire movie. Its just a ripoff.",3,1,3,7 December 2019
The Green Mile," Prison is Gods love
","The green mile is probably the best Stephen king movie ever made after the The Shining. It's really a film about believing in God, even if you know that you are going to die for your sins. It's just a really sad movie and I found it really hard not to get emotional when people realize that they don't have much time left and that God maybe wants to know what their last word is before the leave this world for good. Tom Hanks and the cast is amazing and the film never gets tiresome or boring its over 2 hours run. It's almost the perfect King movie because the pacing might can feel really slows sometimes but The Green Mile is just a Godly good experience.",9,0,0,23 February 2019
The Lion King," The Best movie in the World
","I was only one years old when The Lion King came out, and it actually scared me. When you are a little kid you just get more scared off the smallest things and when I saw the hyenas chasing Simba in the elephant graveyard I had nightmares for weeks. Granted the Lion king is a pretty violent film for its time and I wouldn't actually recommend you kids watching it at least not without and adult. Now just hear me out, this movie is the reason that I have assembled my love for movies in the first place. It changed everything and guided me into a world off good versus evil and how you always can move away from tragedy in your life and take the path that fate have chosen for you. The Lion King is a movie that will be watched for generations to come and the new remake off the film here in 2019 is not gonna bring the magic back all, I know that because you can't do a movie twice that already have been made so perfectly by Walt Disney himself, its just not gonna happen. I give The Lion king the highest score possible, it truly deserved it.",10,2,3,3 August 2019
The Lion King," A big part off my childhood
","There is no Disney movie that can compare to The Lion King, Is the perfect animated film that just never gets old every time I watch it. It's characters are all animals but they are covered with so much depth that you care about each one off them, except off course Scar he is a prick but great villain anyways. If you want your childhood back then please watch this movie, cause its a brilliant masterpiece.",10,0,0,24 April 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," The movie that made history
","Silence of the lambs is the best serial killer movie ever made. Its a film that keeps getting better every time I wach it. The pacing is beyond perfect, it starts slow but as the plot thickens more and more at risk for Clarice Starling and FBI agent played by the amazing Jodie Foster, so much that she have no choice but to the psychotic cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter played by the brilliant Anthony Hopkins for advice to catch a the monster known as Bofalo Bill before many more lives are on her plane. Jodie and Hopkins are incredible as a good FBI agent and a absolutely awful man that kills to eat human flesh, just pure evil. This movie never gets boring and I just got this creepy atmosphere of hopelessnes that just take it to and hole others level. Not a movie for people who don't like darkness, but for the people who likes the black hole off meaningless this movie is the best one on the market. 10 out of 10 stars",10,1,1,17 February 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," The end off Batman
","Nr 3 Batman movie in Cristopher Nolan's trilogy delivers so much in quality and depth that it's really hard for other superhero movies to keep up with this masterpiece. It's just how all of it seems to fit in with this Batman movie that makes every scene so damn realistic it's like you really feel that if Batman was real this is exactly how things will go down. Acting superb, and the design of the film is dark and unsettling, cause only Batman can save us from the dark. The Dark Knight Rises gets full score, what a movie.",10,0,0,14 March 2019
Creed II," Movie from the heart
","I loved the first Creed film it had a lot off heart and passion behind and its maybe the best boxing movie I have ever seen in a decade. I have no problems with the Rocky films but Creed 1 just left me very emotional and happy that the Rocky film finally moved on. Now that I have watched Creed 2 I have to say that its not better than the original but the movie still did hold my interest and I was satisfied when it was over. The problem with Creed 2 is that is just the same movie all over again with the same dialogue, boxing scenes and lore it was just like watching a clone off the first film that it just made it very pred",7,1,2,24 May 2019
