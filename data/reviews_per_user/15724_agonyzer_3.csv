The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!!!
","OK, so I thought the Hulk (2003) was pretty good. It used comic panels for scene cuts and montages. It co-starred Jennifer Connelly, my all-time favorite actress ever since Labyrinth. It was cheesy, sure, but so are the comics, at least in the main. The rewrite of the Hulk's origin was pretty flimsy, what with the atomic dad and all. The special effects were great, in spite of a few minor flubs. The design philosophy of the Hulk himself was just bad, though. He was too slow, which was obviously a failed effort to portray his enormity. Overall, the whole thing came across like an old-school comic film: poorly. Mind you, I do own the DVD.The remake was justified. Miss Connelly was sadly replaced by the over-rated Liv Tyler, which is just a damn shame. Betsy was given a much better role this time around, and deserved more art than little Liv has to offer. Good Dr. Banner, played in the last film by Eric Bana, was this time portrayed with some actual character by dear old Ed Norton. He looks much more the scrawny scientist part and brought some direly needed pathos to the role, as is his wont. I've heard some people declare with ill-deserved authority that the Hulk shouldn't have pathos, to which I can only reply, 'Read more comics.'The visual effects are stunning, the character design of both the Hulk and arch-foe Abomination actually worked, and the combats were orchestrated with expert technique. Ang Lee totally flubbed that on the previous incarnation, which was rather a surprise. This Hulk is smaller, more like the raging greenskin of the seventies and eighties, which I frankly prefer. One of the great points about the Hulk was always his ability to conquer larger, seemingly stronger enemies with brutal will alone. Sure, he's big and strong, but biggest and strongest is frankly Superman territory.While the plot and character development are much as one would expect, it really shouldn't be any other way. Hulk, after all, smash. I'm not one to throw a spoiler, but there's a bit at the end that's exciting to those of us who watch Marvel Studios with ever-growing anticipation, and this time it slipped in before the credits. There's also a lovely little scene in the wrap-up that should really thrill old-school Hulk readers who understand the unending search for mastery.And I should also point out that Lou Ferrigno is looking good!All in all, I would certainly recommend this one be seen in the theater. After all, it's no good to shrink the Incredible Hulk down to your little TV, even if it is a 70' Bravia.For the points breakdown, I have to admit one star was lost with Jennifer Connelly. Yes, I like her that much. The other point was dropped for ambiguity. While it didn't bother me much, it seemed like more distinction was needed in the origin. Many viewers will wonder whether this is a remake or a sequel. Call it a remake. Please. The 2003 version was passable, but it has no place on the same continent as this one. Just dump it in the bin with X3 and Daredevil.'Nuff said.",8,2,5,6 July 2008
Taken," Film Review: Taken
","Director Pierre Morel has given us a solid winter movie experience with Taken (2009), an action/thriller with plenty of character. I went into this film expecting lots of action. I got that action, and more.The opening frames of this film are, unquestionably, canned sentiment. This theme continues throughout the beginning of the movie, but it isn't the generic stuff. It's the satisfying, nostalgic kind, a sort of cinematic Chef Boyardee, if you will, and not the cold, straight-out-of-the-can collegiate sustenance, but the lovingly warmed kind your mother always made you. Our hero, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is the kind of guy a lot of us thirty-somethings can really identify with. He ekes out a retiree's life in a cheap apartment, to be close to his teenage daughter, a lovely young thing who lives with the ex-wife and her new, rich, husband. The relationship is strained, since the ex, Lenore (Famke Janssen) hardly approves of Bryan's way of life, even though he's given up the spy game.So here's a man who gets emasculated at every turn, but willingly suffers it to build a relationship with daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Her businessman stepfather, more present in his white collar than Bryan could ever be in his CIA issue, offers up an Arabian horse to compete with Bryan's karaoke machine.But when young Kim is abducted by slave traders in Paris, Bryan earns his keep. As the tension builds, we see an agent-turned-father in his real element. It isn't long before his buddies in the trade get him enough info to start the hunt, and it's here that the pace really starts moving.Before long, Bryan's in France, dealing out one erg after another of brutal justice as he tracks down his daughter. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not all chases and fights. Well, no, that's a lie. It is all chases and fights, but not only are they perfectly filmed, timed, and acted, but they do a terrific job of portraying the character. Now, Bryan Mills isn't your usual good guy. He's not your usual antihero either. Hell, he's not even your usual Jason Bourne. He's a father with years of combat and espionage experience, and he holds nothing back in retrieving his daughter. Every scumbag who gets in his way pays an unmerciful, but suitable, price. Beautiful, vicious martial arts, not entirely unrealistic gunfights, and a breakneck pace reveal a man willing to do anything for his daughter.Any father should be able to enjoy the seeing the beastly side of parental urges played out so artfully. But there's more to it than that. This is a movie that's also topical in a few ways. The slave trade is very much alive in the modern world, and could use some attention. In Taken, it gets that exposure. Furthermore, there are themes revolving around the broken family, the general disdain of Americans abroad and government corruption.The acting in this film was, on all counts, even with the writing. That is to say, it was incredible. Only a single grammatical error and a fairly dull musical score detracted from my enjoyment. I am pleased to give Taken 8 of 10 points.",8,5,8,31 January 2009
WALLÂ·E," A Not Entirely Meaningless Romp!
","What an awesome little movie! I was much pleased by both its graphic quality and philosophical content. Granted, it is a kid's movie, so don't run in expecting to see Aristotle's physics or Freudian breakdowns, but do expect to be pleasantly surprised by the story and it's implication for eight year old minds.The visuals were truly astonishing, as one has come to expect with Pixar. The designs are terrific and well utilized for comedy. The story itself is touching in a pre-adolescent way, and the limited dialogue is a welcome escape form the Pokemonery I had expected. In short, I recommend it to anyone, including adults.I just wonder about the sequel. Will it work out? After all, he's a p.c., she's a mac; what do they really have in common?",7,2,6,6 July 2008
