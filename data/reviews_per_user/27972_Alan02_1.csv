Requiem for a Dream," AMAZING
",This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen. Ellen Burstyn's performance was absolutely wonderful (she defenently deserved the Oscar over Julia Roberts). Jennifer Connely's performance was also great. This movie is a must see (if you are in the right mood) Aronofsky did a great job of directing this movie.,10,0,1,27 January 2002
