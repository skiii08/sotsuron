The Blair Witch Project," O.K., this was different
",If I had seen this film on PBS I would have thought it was really cool. It is a very good student film. I'm sure when the directors make a real movie it will be even better...,Null,0,0,7 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," A satisfying trip to the movies...
","After seeing some less than stellar movies this summer--i.e., 'The Haunting' and 'The Blair Witch Project', it was a real treat to see 'The Sixth Sense'.  It is an intelligent, sensitive film that leaves you feeling better having seen it. The acting is superb, the script is balanced and thoughtful. Who knew Bruce Willis could act?! Keep an eye out for the young actor who owns this film, he may be the best actor of this and even the next millennia.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
