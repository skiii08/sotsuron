Walk the Line," Great Biopic of Start of Majestic Career
","James Mangold has displayed a great range of movies: from the indie Heavy (with Liv Tyler's best performance), the top heavy Cop Land (where Sly Stallone shines), the powerful drama Girl, Interrupted (with a magnificent Winona Ryder), the light but still very enjoyable rom-com Kate & Leopold, the multi-layered whodunnit Identity (with the always quality John Cusack and Jim's signature actor Pruitt Taylor Vince (one of the best actors of his generation!) now there is the long awaited cinematic biography of Johnny Cash.Mangold could have gone the easy way and portray the settled-down and familial and grand person Cash became in the 90s and 00s (after struggling through his addictions and troubles). But instead he chose to show the hardships Johnny Cash had to endure as a child and how he became a recording and performing artist, while trying to grow up and keep in touch with reality.Some will say that Cash now comes off as a cheating and pill-popping maniac who has little empathy for his wife and that may all be true, but fighting his inner demons with June Carter at his side is exactly how he in the end became the icon that is JR Cash.Joaquin Phoenix is the embodiment of Cash, even though he doesn't look or sound like him, but that only shows his acting performance.Reese Witherspoon does an outstanding performance as well, maybe it gets enhanced if you offset this against her Legally Blonde-type characters.Kudos to both of them for performing (singing and playing), because this could have gone horribly wrong if Mangold decided to go with Joaquin and Reese lipsynching to Johnny and June's voices.The supporting cast is great as well as is the selection of songs.The story and tension arc is solid as a house and the 2 hours and 16 minutes fly by. All in all this is one of the best, most honest biopics I have ever seen.Go see this, even if you don't like country ... and I don't even think Cash is country, he is real rock 'n roll.",8,0,0,26 February 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Wonderfully Slow
","First off, the cinematography and sceneries are beautiful and the acting is very controlled and introverted. This last part enables the movie to stay far away from being a run-of-the-mill tearjerker, also aided by the absence of a dramatic, violin-fueled score.Secondly, the story line subtly has multiple layers, because this movie is not just about homosexual sheep herders, in fact I believe it is hardly about that; it's more about oppression, racism, religion, the fast changing times of the 60s and 70s and how different people i different stages of society deal with those.There's very little dialogue, but the body language tells the viewer so much, that words are really unnecessary and that is something that Ang Lee really did well. One point of criticism is that the movie runs too long. At the point where Ennis leaves Jack's parents is where it should have ended, because then the opening and ending scenes would have been identical. And the part after this shot really didn't add to the story or character development.All in all I give it 8 out of 10, because this movie shows how delicate relationships, any relationship, can be. And it does so in a non-judgmental manner.",8,4,10,19 March 2006
The Hateful Eight," 70mm Roadshow Is Amazing Experience
","When I first learned that Quentin Tarantino's eighth movie was shot on 70mm Ultra Panavision I got quite excited. The last movie to be shot and projected in this ultra-wide format was Khartoum in 1966 so when I found out that the movie was going to go on a limited release roadshow I got quite a bit more excited. The road show is projected with analog equipment and includes 13 minutes of additional material that will not be in the digital release. At the time of typing this it might already be too late, but if you have the opportunity, go see the roadshow version.I bought two tickets for the 10.55pm Boxing Day showing in the only theater in the Atlanta metro area to show the movie 8 days prior; to my surprise tickets were not sold out. My wife and I drove to the theater in Atlantic Station and we had our tickets scanned a little after 10pm. Upon entry we were given a program, beautifully made on lush paper containing beautiful photos and a little background information on the movie. Seeing the program made me realize that we were actually experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime event. After getting drinks from the concessions stand we took our place in line, since the showing that started before ours was still running. There were two snake lines, roped off in velvet. The wait was about 20 minutes and when the door opened the lines quickly moved and in less than a few minutes we sat down on the recliner seats in the upper half of the auditorium.Right on time the movie started. Well, not really, the movie opened with an Overture. The overture starts the original score by Ennio Morricone, which was his first original score in 40 years! Naturally, after the overture the movie starts, a glorious 3-hour long ride. Because we went to see the roadshow version, it was analog and watching it play is like listening to music by playing a record on a turntable: it's perfectly imperfect! The movie shakes, light flickers and it shows with a little grain. This is a far cry from the current, 'perfect' HD digital quality of most movies and TV shows. But if you love cinema, and if you are as 'old' as I am it will transport you back in time where movies were still a wondrous and wonderful thing, it is thrilling and exciting, it is a rare treat.The movie follows the quintessential Tarantino-format with the story broken down into 6 chapters (with an intermission after chapter 3!). Each chapter is announced with a title card and chapter 5 includes narration. As per usual, the chapters are not in chronological order but this time only one chapter is not in sequence, but the order makes perfect sense. As with all Tarantino's movies the language is foul and the violence is graphical and perhaps a little gratuitous, which of course, makes sense with the involvement of longtime Tarantino collaborator and The Walking Dead special effects supervisor Greg Nicotero. The wide angle, but still very close-up, camera work also pushes the viewer right into the middle of all the violence.The cinematography by DP Robert Richardson is spectacular to say the least and the use of almost antiquated Ultra Panavision lenses and widescreen format are both a tribute to old Spaghetti Westerns as well as a unique approach and use of said technology. One expects many lush outdoor shots, but the overwhelming majority of the movie takes place in just two indoor locations: a stage coach and a haberdashery. This ultimately aids to focus the viewer's attention to the storyline and acting. To be fair, the story and its arc seem a little contrived but, again, this is all standard Tarantino. As is the magnificent acting. The actors portraying the eight protagonists ... or really the eight antagonists, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern, all blend into their roles, become their characters, pretty much turning the movie into a fly-on-the-wall documentary instead. (Personally I thought it was amusing to see Tim Roth play a delightfully flamboyant English character and part of me wonders how many armchair critics will complain about Roth's fake English accent not realizing he is, in fact, a Brit.) Clearly, the roles were written with these specific actors in mind and they do not disappoint, there are several Oscar-worthy performances, with Walton Goggins' being the most noteworthy as the opportunistic would-be sheriff of Red Rock!As noted above the movie is a Western, but it is not a classic one; John Wayne would be rolling over in his grave if you'd call this a classic western. Moreover, as with all Tarantino's movies there is a socio-political subtext which isn't for So, all by itself The Hateful Eight is not the best movie ever, but looking at purely at the artistic aesthetics in combination with experiencing this as the first 70mm roadshow in almost 50 years and with the first original Morricone score in 40 years, the whole package definitely became an unforgettable experience, one that may never have a repeat again. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino, for this awesome Christmas present!",10,3,21,27 December 2015
Burn After Reading," As good as comedy gets
","This movie is brilliant beyond words and I'm sure that those who don't understand the Coen brothers' sense of humor, and there are many of you out there, the movie is neither funny nor good. To those who do understand their humor and who can appreciate total absurdity, this movie will be the best of the bunch.The casting is out of this world. Who'd've thunk that Brad Pitt could play the biggest dweeb on the planet, who'd've thunk that John Malkovich would be used only to scream obscenities and play a lethargic, self-absorbed and self-important nobody, who'd've thunk that George Clooney would be typecast as just a regular but good looking man, who'd've thunk that Frances McDormand would be reduced to a shallow, physical looks-only 1-dimensional character? Then throw in some random supporting roles that totally take apart the very fabric of what they are supposed signify.The storyline and acting is spot-on, but most of all, incredibly all out funny. But you may have to watch it a few times in quick succession to grasp the meaning of it all.Don't miss this!",9,2,4,20 January 2009
Gran Torino," 7 out of 10 ... for now
","I think this is one of those movies that at first leaves you kinda lukewarm, but over time will become a true classic. That is the main reason why I gave it a 7 out of 10 and not a 5 out of 10.The story is shallow in content, it is racial, it is politically incorrect, but it is also true and real and unapologetic. It is that combination that will make this movie end up in the same pantheon as Crash, as Babel, as Doubt, as Seven Pounds. Movies that make you think about the content, and it will keep you thinking about it. Therein lies its strength, not in the acting, not in the spectacular dialog, not in the action scenes. It is the truth behind the story that will make this movie being regarded as great.Another reason for its inevitable greatness is the fact that Clint Eastwood shows himself as an old man and he is not afraid to show that his character is hopefully out of touch with today's world, today's society, today's technology ... but he still has a passion to instill virtues and values in the people he cares for.Don't just dismiss this movie based on Clint's stereotypical acting, on the stereotypical typecasting, but base your rating on the lessons you can take away from this movie.",7,0,2,20 January 2009
Hero," Breathtaking
","Contains spoilers and almost nothing but spoilers ...I just can't get over the fact that a lot of people seem to think there is no storyline, no plot. Well, open your eyes and mind just a little bit, because there's a huge plot behind it, however small it looks.This movie poses interesting, disturbing and very poignant questions about leadership, democracy, unity, love and loyalty:<ul><li>the way Moon is completely loyal to her master Broken Sword</li></ul><ul><li>the way Flying Snow is dedicated to her plea of revenge and her willingness to surrender her love for Broken Sword</li></ul><ul><li>the way Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow are united in their love and faith in Nameless to kill the King of Qin</li></ul><ul><li>the way that the King of Qin wants to unite all the peoples of China to have just a single language (at first only Broken Sword sees the greater scheme of things)</li></ul><ul><li>the way the King of Qin dominated and oppresses an entire country with good intentions but poor communication</li></ul><ul><li>the way Nameless gives up his life for a goal he understands is greater than him and his revenge</li></ul>Yes, there is so much plot and storyline in this movie that I still have not unraveled it all during the first two viewings of the movie!And then there's the visuals, which are truly stunning, and as you may have noticed the five colors are also a symbol for at least five different story lines ...Please take a look again and this time genuinely WATCH IT and TAKE IT IN.",9,12,19,2 October 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Missed Opportunity
","After being underwhelmed by the book I had my doubts whether I should see the movie or not, but I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt and seeing the line-up of the actors I hoped that Ron Howard would make the most of it.But, to be honest and in my opinion, after all the hype that preceded both the book and the movie I found The DaVinci Code to be a huge disappointment.Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon performed incredibly flat and one-dimensional; and he looks like Steven Seagal and I can only hope Tom didn't try to emulate Steven's acting abilities. Audrey Tautou looks lovely, but she played her role as Sophie Neveu without any emotion whatsoever and her grandfather (or at least who she thought was her grandfather) was murdered. Jean Reno was horribly painful miscast as Bezu Fache.The only two that made the movie a little bearable were Paul Bettany as Silas, since he was allowed to show a range of emotions, although still I had the impression they were downplayed by the director and/or editor, and Ian McKellen who stole the movie as Leigh Teabing in every scene he was in showcasing his class and talent.Considering they shot a great part of the movie in Louvre, they could have done so much more with it; for all I know, they could have filmed this entirely on a sound-stage. The other locations were pretty bland as well and much more dramatic effect could have been achieved with more daring camera work. The movie could also have used a little more humor; I think I smiled about two times, while I believe there was more room for a few quips.And the movie was way too long with 2.5 hours. I realize that making it shorter it would mean that there would be less room for flashbacks telling the back-story of some of the events, but leaving out all this detail could have been beneficial for the story arc. Also, every lead Robert and Sophie follow up is explained to death, so it shows that this is an American movie made primarily for an American audience (no offense, though). I saw this movie in its second week, and halfway during the movie people left, the friend I went to see it with fell asleep for about half an hour and after waking up he felt as if he didn't miss anything.Perhaps another director and a different cast would have made a difference, then again, the book was pretty bland as well, so perhaps not turning this book into a movie would have been the best choice. For all the people who loved the book let me point you to Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, written 15 years before Dan Brown's movie script, but so much better on all levels.Overall, let me advise anyone who is in doubt to go see it to wait till the movie is releases on DVD and spend the ticket money on another film; I'm sure you can think of a few, because I can.",4,1,4,4 June 2006
