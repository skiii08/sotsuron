The Avengers," Novelty Hype Avengers
","The avengers is one of the most talked about films in recent memory especially when it made such an explosion at the box office. The avengers was breaking and creating box office records left right and centre. The avengers you would think would be an interesting idea if done right and it most certainly has been.There are 6 avengers members and there master nick fury which you would think with all the characters history and really complex individual story lines it would just be a great big mess just trying to fit them all in equally and there lives to fit into the story which is surprisingly done well but could be better.Although the Avengers does great at fitting the characters in, that isn't always the case. On some occasions such as Bruce which is the Hulk, is given a more of a side character feel, such as his dilemma being the Hulk and given into anger is sidestepped a bit. There are inconsistencies in the story for example during the beginning they build up Bruce's character slightly (when not giving in to one liners and action movie formula cliché's). Bruce has to deal with his hulk anger issues and attacks the female avenger but later is completely in control out of the blue, which isn't bad, it could probably have been done better and built up more.The movie of course does have some shinning lights in the picture, Iron man and Thor clearly take front row in the story due to Thor having family issues with the antagonist to resolve and Iron man's very big charismatic personality is hard to ignore and could be seen to take some of the spotlight in the movie.The American avenger possibly needs more conflict in this movie like dealing with the modern day world or having a deep connection with somebody he didn't just share less than 1 minute of screen time. The American avenger is just the usual possible leader figure of the group, that is just there to deliver one liners and be the conflict with iron man.The avenger with the cross bow didn't really have a developed background in comparison with the others but did instill some form of sub plot that could have probably been done without. To be fair even though well performed it wouldn't of made a real difference if he wasn't there, he doesn't add to the story and has next to no real conflict to speak of.Nick fury which is performed by Samuel L Jackson which really does suit the role and definitely needed more screen time as this was simply the best actor in the film and the films greatest asset. There is hope that in the next film of the avengers there will be more conflict and story for this character, Nick Fury wasn't well developed in his background and didn't really have enough to do but was performed brilliantly.The portrayal of Loki was an excellent role for the unknown actor Tom Hiddleston and really excelled at being the vengeful younger brother. This role probably would have been more fun if he had played to more humour(It's not that like he's the god of mischief or anything) instead we got a more one dimensional character that was bitter, jealous and ambitious which was just about it.The script itself was not flawless there were a good few plot holes and a few lazy and convenient plot point to carry the story forward. The villain leader of the mighty alien army that the avengers was fighting and what seemed dark and mysteries figure. The villain came and looked like he could double cross Loki at any time and what seemed like a very fragile alliance came to nothing.(A waste of a very potentially brilliant story ark).The film you could argue didn't really have enough tension in the story, the story possibly made it a bit to easy for the heroes and during the conflict. They had the attitude as if it was a sports match instead of the end of the world dilemma, so there was no real fear, dread or relevant emotion from the heroes and just stayed in the comfort zone characters. The villain Loki could have been made better if he had been a bit more humourful instead of the stubborn whiny, I want power now attitude.The CGI in the film was amazing and used really well, not to the point it's shoved in your face or there is to much going on in the background to notice it. The CGI was used really well and found the right balance with making the dangers threatening and not overcrowding the whole scene with explosions, in every street corner until the audience get bored, the fireworks if overused to the point of having the same affects as sparklers on the big screen as the novelty wears off.The avengers was a great film, not a flawless film and certainly no where near the hype it was given. The film is family friendly and does have a few good characters and a paced developing story. The film is something worth noting as a film that is definitely worth seeing not going as far as saying unmissable and does get to slow at some points but all in all worth catching if you have time.This film is a good 7 out of 10 and definitely recommended film to see but could be considered overrated, to much hype and a dab of the novelty effect.",7,1,4,1 May 2013
Iron Man 3," Worth Watching but overrated
","Iron Man 3 Iron man 3 is an exciting new film from Marvel after it's very stunning Avengers line. Anyone who is familiar with Marvels film will not be disappointed by the usual arrogant characteristics of our main character as he tries to defeat our main antagonist which acts the part as well as the main protagonist.The story itself is very grand and elaborate, the usual marvel story that appeals to the usual family audience which it pulls of very well. The story itself keeps very well and in line with the comic books story developments and characters, like in the comic books there is the usual arrogance and self satisfied exterior of our main character that helps any old school boy fans out there and will help the film win favour with the underground comic book society.The usual idea of the unrealistic and elaborate story is one that will appeal to the usual comic book fandom everywhere. The outer world experience from the story is really felt, the villain himself is not to frightening and doesn't really stand out and even though the villain does have a simple aim and goal of heightening humans evolution pace but the plan is very impractical to say the least as he wants funding for his research even though he tries to get funding from terrorists but later we find out that was false and only a rouse or a distraction so where did he get the funding? the story never tells us and there are a good half a dozen examples like this.The mandarin which is the villains identity later turns out to be a random somebody who is just an actor on drugs which once again is very elaborate and doesn't have explanation which is the only fault that we have with the movie, the fact that there are many plot holes and lose ends unexplained but they are unnoticeable problems. the film is worth watching, enjoyable and if marvel have shown us anything is they know how to do well at the box office and become a smash hit with the critics.The kid that plays the role from insidious does a great job for a child actor as they can be the one annoying film in the film that happens to be the directors nephew that simply can't act. The wife of our protagonist which isn't really a rememberable personality. The one thing the film does lack a he load is simply character development and not necessarily a weak villain just not good enough to be remembered maybe the film should have had more build up and dialogue with our main protagonist without the usual cliché's and bad puns.The best fact about the film like all marvel films is the good CGI, regardless of what weather you like CGI or not, the one thing is that it is used well, not to much and not over the top to point it gets boring, the 3D is definitely worth having for the cinema experience, they really use it well. I must say iron man has more explosions in this film then Rambo there seems to be more iron man suits get more blown than a Chinese fireworks nights.yes so all in all a good film and certainly worth watching. I personally would give this film a recommendation to see and a good 6/10 but could be considered overrated.",6,2,4,30 April 2013
Frozen," Frozen is just OK but seriously over-hyped and overrated
","First I am not saying that Frozen in a bad movie, in fact I thought the animation was impressive and creative and that's certainly the strongest part of the movie. I thought that half the songs were incredibly pointless and some parts just felt like filler. There were a bunch of fantastic songs and some were even remember able. I believe the weakest part of the story was the characters and the plot, the plot is centred around the ice queen substitute and what her fear influencing her power to harm others.There was no real antagonist which possibly would have gave greater heavier weight to the story which really does seem to be lacking, when there is no clear antagonist, there is no gravity to the situation. The characters were all either bland or really annoying, the main protagonist is the usual stereotypical quirky dork that seems to be accident pro. The twist at the end was extremely weak and anti-climactic, the twist being that the person who the main protagonist has fallen for is actually a power hungry villain. The antagonist is extremely forgettable and only the over-hyping super fans would probably remember the name. At one point the movie pokes fun at three of the Disney Formula's oldest and most famous Cliché's which is 'love at first site' and 'the prince will save the day' and 'first love's first kiss will conquer all' but it just seems to be Disney's reaction to officially stating that it recognises that times have changed and is more of an out of place, unnatural, forth wall joke, pandering to a main stream audience.There were many characters that were just plain forgettable such as the Scandinavian looking merchandise store on the outskirts of nowhere, just to be forgotten as soon as he arrives so it appears more like a short family guy sketch then a full in depth character, this was just a simple distraction and regular filler until the story continues on with the weak plot. Talking of weak and forgettable characters, what did you think of the gnomes that appeared twice? The story was very weak with little explanation of the Queen's duties, how this world functions? The origin of her power? The limitations of her power? Whether the power is Genetic or whether there was a prophecy or any background at all of how she got these powers or how the gnomes relate to all this?. Anyway Papa Gnome tells them that the young Ice Queen substitute that she will be unable to control her power if she has fear but he doesn't explain how he knows this. After this Papa Gnome wipes the main protagonists memory but doesn't explain his power, limitations, origin or purpose or there relation to the royal family in anyway at all. A weak plot all round, very disappointing. You have to really respect Disney for changing up the formula but even still there appears to be cliché's in the story such as the light relief merchandising snowman and his never ending story arc of whether the Reindeer will eat the attached carrot nose, (very important to the story). The other is a very familiar Disney cliché's of the parents dying and every central character is an orphan, (the mentality seems to be if formula is not broken don't fix it).In conclusion I can only say that the animation was incredible and some songs were as equally amazing but where Frozen falls short is the annoying, bland and some forgettable characters, the gnomes come to mind. The story has a very weak plot although a new spin on the story and it was good to see Disney change it's grand old formula but the hype doesn't do this movie credit and should be seen for what this movie is which is an OK movie with some great bits.",5,6,14,11 April 2014
