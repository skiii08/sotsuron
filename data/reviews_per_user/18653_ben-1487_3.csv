Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great characters, Great Design and Wonderful music score.
","having just watched this movie again - 18 years after it's release, I felt it was time to add my thoughts on this entertaining film.I feel it delivers great atmosphere for the Star Wars Universe right from the first scene, and watching the two Jedi at the start, really does remind you of their immense skills and awesome presence.the action throughout the movie is breath taking, and the story line is captivating, with really strong performances from all the main characters. Liam Neesan was superb (he is in most things to be fair) After consideration the Lightsabre battle between the two Jedi and the impressive Darth Maul, is the most impressive in the entire series - the stunt work and coordination in this sequence is simply incredible and I wish to applaud the film makers/actors for delivering this.The end whilst sad is fitting and coincides well with the future of the story.On a further note Jar Jar Binks is a little annoying but does bring a fun element to what is more of a family movie - don't think we should be overly harsh on this.Don't listen to all the naysayers, this is actually a rather enjoyable film with some truly classic moments - enjoy!",8,6,8,28 August 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Amazing Addtion to Star Wars Universe
","I've been a fan of the Star Wars Saga ever since I was a five year old, jaw-dropping at the amazing Return of the Jedi in the cinema, I can safely say I regard this as the best in the entire series.The acting was extremely well delivered - story line was superb and it had perfect blends of drama, action, shock and amazing story telling.Like many when I first heard about the spin of movies, there was a part of me that thought - 'where's this going to end up', I can safely say I should not have had any doubt.This film was mind blowing, innovative, and delivered what I felt the last 4 movies didn't quite manage - a modern version of a classic masterpiece.Hope you enjoy as much as I did.",9,2,10,18 December 2016
Casino Royale," A great bond film. If you were not a bond fan! you will be now.
","Daniel Craig gives what I can only describe as a top notch fantastic front of the seat performance to the handsome action spy that many have come to love.I too was someone who wondered how the new man would do at the task in hand and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed at all. The film from start to finish is so entertaining that the moment it comes out on DVD there will be a nice spot on the shelf ready for regular viewing. The acting is superb, suspense gripping and the storyline action and stunts come together in a superb feature length completely brilliant movie.Daniel Craig is a man to watch in his new found role and I reckon the only way for him is up. Great job keep it going.This is one of the only action films that I have seen that I can honestly say is worth every penny and a decent viewing in the cinema - if you have not seen it already do so before all your family or friends have already talked about it non stop.",10,1,2,8 December 2006
