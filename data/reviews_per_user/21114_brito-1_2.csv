Love and Death," One of Woody Allen's best!
","I've seen this movie twice, and both times I laughed hysterically.   Allen pokes fun at a range of things, everything from Russian culture to the follies of war to the absurdity of Shakesperean the-ah-ter (WHEAT!!! WHEAT!!!  Fiiiiiiields of WHEAT!!).  His one-liners are top-notch ('If God has to test us, couldn't he just give us a written?' and 'At first I thought the man dressed in black with a long beard was an Italian widow'), and his and Diane Keaton's acting is hilariously funny.  If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now!!!  Even if you don't like Woody, this movie is sure to make you laugh!  Go!  Now!  NOOOOOOOOOOW!!!",9,0,0,21 June 2002
Army of Darkness," One of the greatest movies of all time, bar none
","Even after having watched Army of Darkness a MINIMUM of 20 times, I still love it more than ever.  The one-liners are classic, the acting twisted and hilarious (especially by Bruce Campbell, one of Hollywood's most underappreicated actors and natural talents), and the storyline convincing enough.  I can't do the movie justice except to say that if you haven't seen it, see it now because it is HILARIOUS again and again, and if you think this movie sucks, then go get a stapler and close your trap for good because you're a moron.  GROOOOOVY!!!!",10,1,1,24 July 2002
