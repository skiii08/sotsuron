Ford v Ferrari," Looking in the rear view mirror, with blinkers on.
","How (sort of) the gigantic Ford Motor Company bought itself victory over the tiny Italian company Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966. Heroic warrior/engineer/designer/entrepreneur/drivers Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby (and Miles' wife, who would seem from this to be an android) struggle, mainly with corporate interference, to put one - well, four - over on the Italians. And while it's a stirring tale, they don't play fair, truth be told.But hey, winning is everything, isn't it. Isn't it?It says that 15,000 jobs were provided by the production, meaning that the credits are slower than Ken Miles' Le Mans lap record.To look at the film, 99.9% of those jobs were to white males - well, it was the 1960's. FvsF isn't interested in any socio-economic truths from the 1960's that would get in the way of a nostalgia-fest. (That makes it very old-fashioned).Not only FvsF a convincing recreation of nearly 60-year-old scenery, venery (look it up) and machinery, it's a convincing recreation of early 1960's corporate and environmental laissez-faire as though that was a really good thing.Well it was a good thing if you were one of the entitled then, and are so now. I hope you don't watch this film and not realize that times have changed; this is not a story of noble aspirations, it's a story of American industrial might post WWII (and Korea and during Vietnam) trying to recapture the buzz of liberating Europe.It's a 'good movie', but unimaginative, conservative and derivative. Essentially an uncritical tribute, made by today's equivalent of an industrial behemoth, to a golden age of industrial behemoths that was dying when these events happened. Watch once, don't be indoctrinated, and forget.",6,1,2,8 February 2020
The Avengers," Every cliché known to man, and cinema as a game console
","By geeks, about geeks, for geeks. Tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with a thrill that can't be bought on the Xbox.Is it The West Wing in space? Or is it Stargate meets X-Men? There is not a shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy, flashy, ugly commercial behemoth. It is part of an action figure marketing campaign; a film made by men who still think like pre-teenagers, who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people - who at least had a grasp of characterization.The now-grown comic-book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense, fear, or loss. They must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic-book buzz. A long-lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves - or you - experience.Will you join them? Will you sit in a darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have a 3D screen, surroundsound, and a broadband connection? Will it be enough for you to escape into Joss Whedon's stunted teenage netherworld, or will you go outside and attempt to engage with - god forbid - strangers, rather than aliens, superheroes and vampires?There are movies, even trashy ones, that will echo, embellish and enhance your experience of the world. 'Avengers Assemble' isn't one of them; it's shiny, expensive, overwrought trash that assumes we are all as insecure, stupid and frustrated as those who created it.You will have forgotten it long after you still remember how much it cost to get in.

Blade Runner 2049," Blade Crawler
","In 2017, Hollywood successfully clones a film from 1982. New features include enhanced eroticism, several powerful female characters and implanted shoutouts to the original. All that's missing is an emotion chip, and a fast-forward button. The story is about who the lost replicant baby had grown up to be; this plot maguffin didn't appear until 28 minutes. That's 28 pages of script before there's any story at all, and that's about as suspenseful as 'The Sixth Sense'. Mostly it's CGI, models, green screen, all very fascinating, heavyhandedly recreating the atmosphere, but not the impact, of the original movie.An hour and a half in, Harrison Ford appears, living in a sort of Star Trek TNG holodeck crossed with the Overlook Hotel from The Shining, then a man of 29 and a man of over 70 have a fist fight. Time begins to stand still. 1980's shoulderpads make a comeback. The climax is a cliché-packed replicant fight against rising flood water that goes on and on and on. And on. Like Cape Fear did, only that had thrills. Then somebody dies, eventually, on the snowy steps.Harrison Ford is worth watching when he's on, so there's a mark out of 10. Ryan Gosling also masterfully conveys the severely limited emotional range of an android. He's a natural. But you miss Rutger Hauer.Who's real? Who's a replicant? Who cares after TWO AND A QUARTER HOURS? Retro flying cars by Peugeot. Look out for this movie shown every Xmas for the next 40 years. Especially Xmas 2049.",2,12,24,10 October 2017
Black Swan," Intense, frothy melodrama saved from pretension by tight direction
","My hat goes off to Natalie Portman for what was the most convincing and obviously committed portrayal of a professional ballerina and her inner life I've seen. Not that I know any professional ballerinas, but the best thing about Black Swan is that in spite of straying very close to the line where tortured artists look ridiculous on screen, it doesn't let up the cinematic feast for a minute, and so your disbelief is maintained. Reminiscent in a way of the Vincent van Gogh biopic Lust for Life, which on paper is as corny as heck, but still manages to convey his tragedy and inform everybody's (who's not an art historian) perception of that painter. Black Swan will inform everybody's perception of prima ballerinas for a long time. The Red Shoes trod similar ground (play on words intended), but far less accessibly than this. Black Swan works as a melodrama - meaning a drama where the characters are unexamined and stereotypical - because it is constantly exciting to look at, and the Steadicam work is reasonably restrained so those of us used to Jean Renoir films don't get nauseous. Nina's story seems to be an allegory of a woman discovering her own physical sexuality (I don't know if IMDb accepts the V word), and this aspect of the film is mercifully not overplayed, because then it would certainly be pretentious. Black Swan's sheer style manages to keep it enjoyable as a cinematic spectacle; it will not transfer well to DVD because the characters and story are pretty much out of the 'Fame' script vault.Let me pick at it now: everyone in the cinema laughed when Nina dragged the body across the floor - I think it was the tutu that did it. 'My new production of Swan Lake', says Thomas. I know the film wasn't about the production itself, but Thomas' production looked pretty goldarned pedestrian to me. The mother's teeth? Those will haunt me longer than Natalie Portman's arm-waving, I have to say. Don't take it too seriously, don't laugh out loud and let your girl/gayfriend wallow in what might have been. I just wish French and Saunders, the UK comedy duo, were still around to give us their take.",7,0,1,30 January 2011
Come and See," Disturbing, vivid depiction of Nazi atrocities, without being gratuitous
","A pre-Glasnost Russian movie about one of the 628 (SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT) villages in Byelorussia alone that were annihilated by the Nazis' 'Dirlewanger Regiment', a unit comprised of criminals released on condition that they simply executed the 'final solution' in Poland, Russia and the Ukraine. The regiment was commanded by notorious alcoholic sadist, murderer and pervert Oskar Dirlewanger, who was (probably) beaten to death by his guards in 1945.Mainly from the POV of Florian, a twelve(?)-year-old boy who digs up a rifle in order to join the Soviet partisans. We follow his journey from greenhorn to traumatized veteran. Over a week or so.'Come And See' isn't very explicit in its depiction of battle; the worst you actually see is a cow being hit by machine-gun fire; but the sense in which you are a witness to the insane, drunken, vicious roundup of a village into a barn which is then torched and machine-gunned is very real. What's left to your imagination - including the obvious multiple rape of the young heroine Rose, destroying any idea Florian had of a heroic partisan romance - is more than enough.Towards the end, we see the rise of Hitler in reverse, which owes something to its Soviet propaganda origins, but this doesn't detract from the sheer emotional power of the whole film. Makes Saving Private Ryan look like Hogan's Heroes.",10,6,7,26 June 2019
Skyfall," James Bombed: formulaic film-making at its worst.
","Choice lines from the script: 'What's going on?', 'I'm gonna get whoever did this'. Judi Dench as ever completely miscast - she seems to be advertising Marks and Spencers ready meals, not running MI6. And indeed, the film itself is about M, not Bond's struggle with global villainy. I thought Daniel Craig had nailed Bond in Casino Royale, but here he does completely the wrong thing - he makes it look hard. And hard it is, to watch that is. One point - from earlier Bonds, kids of 8 or so learned to play fight and stay cool, to use only necessary 'violence', or invent a way out of a tight spot (in play). From this Bond, they learn to play broody, angry and vicious, and sulk when things go wrong. That's what the iconic Bond has lost.And then they call in Ralph Fiennes, the world's stiffest actor, to replace the dead Dench M. Have they forgotten it was he who made The Avengers a turkey? Rory Kinnear totally humourless, as is this poor excuse for a Bond film which is more like an episode of 'The Bill'.",1,38,79,4 November 2012
A Star Is Born," A Viewer Is Bored
","Lady Gaga is quite good, in an 'Oh, she can act as well as sing' sort of way. But she sacrifices her edginess.Bradley Cooper is one of those American actors whose name sounds like a corporate lawyer and whose performances have about as much charisma. Perhaps writing and directing as well as learning to play the guitar really badly was a bit of a strain.In the end this is no more than a 'tribute movie'; a tribute to the Streisand/Kristofferson version. The songs are mediocre, the story is laboured, and the clichés are polished and arranged in a display cabinet like glass animals.Oh for a film that takes chances.",1,40,74,6 December 2018
Gravity," Would it be any good without 3D?
","There's a story about the early days of mass cinema where the audience fled the venue when a train was shown heading towards them. Watching Gravity reminded me of that story because in spite of millions being spent on CGI, and the film being a next-generation 3D flick, I was still sitting in a cineplex wearing cheap, uncomfortable, plastic polarized glasses that I'd paid an extra two bucks for.Gravity doesn't overplay the 3D: there are just enough bits of wreckage, teardrops, frogs and spanners and dental braces floating towards you to make it fun, but essentially it's a suspense/survival movie - the story might just as well be set in a submarine, or up a mountain for all the logic or relevance there is of Clooney and Bullock being in space. Funny that although it's a three-dimensional movie, the orbits of the satellites had to be contrived to be two-dimensional, otherwise the flitting-from-wrecked-satellite-to-wrecked-satellite shtick wouldn't have worked.But the opening scenes do give you a feeling of what EVA must be like, even if they're not accurate. Gravity does make you feel things you didn't expect, which can't be bad.But in the end Gravity, however well put together, is not groundbreaking in any way beyond the advanced integration of 3D CGI, which means you should only hire/buy/visit it if you want to be able to say you were there in the early days of 3D CGI integration, like those people who ran away from the steam train back in 1903(?).10 stars would mean 'perfect', which it isn't. 5 would mean 'average'. which it isn't. A seven, I suppose, which means good, but not outstanding.",7,1,4,11 January 2014
I'm Not There," Not Any More, I'm Not.
","Marcus Carl Franklin as a 14-year-old itinerant hobo songwriter is great. Funny, sweet and good to listen to, much like Bob back in the day. For the first hour, INT treads ground familiar to anyone who's seen 'Don't Look Back', and even 'A Mighty Wind'.It's funny. It's also confusing. I lost track of whether I was watching an actor playing the fake Dylan, or the fake Dylan himself. And before I had time to catch up, Richard Gere appeared, doing his 'Dude, where's my car?' expression for a good seven minutes. So I paused it and took the dog for a walk.Don't look back.",5,0,0,18 June 2020
The Fan," The Fan: Review
","Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) is a $40m, Hummer-driving signing to the Giants baseball team. Gil Renard (Robert DeNiro) is a sales rep for his late father's hunting knife firm. He's also Bobby Rayburn's 'biggest fan', calling in a radio show to defend the price tag that other fans question. Gil, you see, was a Little League Baseball hero, aged 11, and is fixated on Bobby - shades of King Of Comedy.Gil is also in a bitter divorce, being a psychologically abusive father to his son Richie (AJ Ferchland) and wife Ellen (Patti D'Arbanville). Must be all the knives. On the opening day of the season, Gil takes his son to the game, completely blowing his last chance at keeping his job, but also managing to abandon Richie at the game and to become violent towards Ellen. Bobby, meanwhile, finds his lucky number 11 is already taken by Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro), and he has to settle for #33, unless he pays Juan $500k. He then loses his lucky #11 pendant, and despite hitting a home run in the first game, goes into a complete slump.To cut a long story short, Gil, after failing to persuade Juan to give Bobby his #11, murders Juan in a steam room, and carves his #11 tattoo off his arm (with a hunting knife) to be later placed in Bobby's freezer. Would you believe it, Bobby's slump ends. Gil, who gets away with it, and is now fired as a knife salesman, is very angry indeed that Bobby seems not to be grateful to him for his return to form. At all.After this, The Fan goes downhill fast. Gil gets nuttier and nuttier - DeNiro melds Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin, Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein and Max Cady, and the whole thing gets into a confused, melodramatic, cliche-ridden mess that wouldn't hold up in an episode of TJ Hooker. I understand that Phoef Sutton, the original screenwriter, doesn't recognise any of this as what he wrote, and thinks Wesley Snipes was miscast. That's the least of what's wrong with it.We're now expected to believe that Gil, after kidnapping Bobby's son and Hummer, sneaks into the stadium as an umpire with nobody the wiser, let alone that Bobby is fit to play after the night he's had. Directors: if you're depicting a raving nutjob as a master of disguise, your movie's in trouble.Suffice to say that after what seems a very long, rainy time the Giants, the dog (Bradley) and the kid survive but the old LL baseball buddy Coop (Charles Hallahan) gets his head bashed in, as all old baseball buddies tend to do. Gil comes to a worse end than Bickle and Pupkin did. Not as bad as Cady, though.Director Tony Scott was English (as I identified till I moved to Scotland) which is why to American tastes, the baseball may be inauthentic, and overcooked for dramatic purposes. However, I can say that I think I now understand it - for which I thank him.",4,1,1,3 April 2018
The Impossible," Atrocious. An insult to the victims, their families and the audience.
","'Splash!!!' 'Lucas!' 'Thomas!' 'Daniel!' 'Simon!' 'Dad!' 'Mum!' 'Here's your tickets home!' The End.A kind, generous, hardworking man I am proud to have called a friend - whom Britain subsequently deported back to Sri Lanka - lost 11 of his family in the tsunami of which this film is loosely the very cursory story. Also, a colleague and his wife who were on holiday there lost their infant daughter (and nearly each other) in the same disaster. This film is an insult to those who died, their surviving families and the unlucky people who might (mistakenly) watch it.A white, middle-class couple and their three children suffer a temporary separation, only to be reunited by chance just in time for the closing credits - yes, that's all the story there is - while thousands of lesser beings around them experience actual pain and sorrow. But we don't want to look at that, do we? We want to be reminded how useful holiday insurance is. The sole element of suspense in this patronizing, mawkish, exploitative, dated heap of claptrap is whether the mother will lose her leg. She doesn't. All concerned - hang your heads in shame.",1,10,22,27 February 2016
Argo," Shallow, dubious and gung ho but sublimely thrilling
","Are you watching, prospective next-Bond-film directors? This is how to do suspense in a movie, and keep piling it on right to the end. The supposedly true story of how 6 American embassy staff were rescued from the Canadian embassy in revolutionary Iran in 1980 by the trick of creating a fake sci-fi film production. Historically accurate? It's a 100% safe assumption that Hollywood will have taken gross liberties with the facts as it always will. That's how it's done, because real history doesn't do suspense like this.But (I hope) you don't watch Hollywood for history lessons, you watch to be taken out of yourself, and Argo does a great job of that. You may consider that everyone but the Americans gets short-changed in terms of cultural stereotyping, and in that sense Argo is no more than an up-to-date Western, with more accurate period detail to cover its lack of genuine depth. If you like Ron Howard movies, Argo is of that genre, with more edge and sharper humour - a lot of metaphorical waving of the Stars and Stripes and obligatory Arab-bashing, but in the end it's a very exciting movie that pays off like few contemporary thrillers do.",7,1,1,15 March 2013
Us," Stylish, witty, well acted, but at least half an hour too long.
","Another of Jordan Peele's worthy Afmerican takes on traditional US horror. This time it's the Zombie apocalypse. Great acting, direction, production, funny jokes, but (here we go again) ep-ic story fail.By way of exposition, the opening titles mention 'thousands of miles of tunnels under the continental USA, some of which have no known purpose'. There are also millions of frames in this movie, some of which have no known purpose. That shows somebody in the cutting room being a bit precious about their movie.The budget's bigger, the cast is starrier, the script has just as many good jokes ('Alexa - call the police!' and 'What's 'Home Alone?''), but oh dear, the story is feeble. It tries desperately hard - and doesn't succeed - to explain 'why zombies', but in a slasher movie, there is no need. Not too gory though, so that's good.At about the 1 hour mark, I was wondering if the zombies were meant to symbolize a part of Afro-American-ness that wants to reject the aspirations to WASP middle-classness that the protagonist family epitomize. That might have been interesting to explore, and the scene of the black zombies slaughtering the white family is quite edgy for that, but the notion disappears in a flurry of overwrought boss-zombie-clone-combat (zombat?) which GOES ON FAR TOO LONG, Mr. Peele. 'Get Out' was tight; this is flabby.",4,1,3,14 December 2019
The Irishman," The Godmother Of Mob Movies
","Scorsese pulls it off: all the cosa nostra movie stars (apart from Liotta) brought together for a final reflection on life, death and Al Pacino's hairpieces. The bones of the story are clear: Frank Sheeran (Bob deN) is a truck driver who demonstrates his worth to the Mob, while also being factotum to Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) - and ultimately - SPOILER!!! - his assassin. Shtump-Shtump!Godfather II meets Once Upon A Time In America Meets Hoffa meets Godfather III meets Goodfellas meets JFK. Yes, it's that epic, and it succeeds on that level. The whole JFK thing is sorted out after only ninety minutes.Scorsese has nailed it as entertainment. The whole movie is essentially vivid; so vivid that my dog (an HMV-style Jack Russell) couldn't stop watching. Me, I couldn't believe in Al Pacino's hair or crumpled physique; maybe Hoffa's death was really a hit by the Randomly Variable Scalp Doilly Standards Association (RVSDSA). And Stephen Graham achieves mob-movie immortality in spite of being a small Scouser. Good for him - he went where Clive Owen, etc, failed to tread.Get my drift? It's very, very corny, but knows its audience, and is staged to the highest standards. Up there with the best Godfather movies.",6,0,1,25 December 2019

","Heard of Richard Curtis? Wrote the excruciatingly sentimental Four Weddings, Love Actually, War Horse, Mr. Bean's Holiday, etc., you know. Hangs about with Ben Elton. Got an MBE and a CBE for services to entertainment. Whatever service to entertainment 'The Boat That Rocked' provided is not apparent from the movie itself. Unless of course it's supposed to be for people who've had frontal lobotomies who have difficulty processing plots, dialogue or acting. Bad Cliff Richard movies are not dead, they live on with Curtis.Everyone who had any part in this mawkish pile of badly written, badly directed, stupid, puerile, patronising, preposterous, poxy, pretentious, unadulterated, indigestible tripe should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves and should you, dear reader, be a movie executive, you should cross them off your Christmas card list forthwith.",1,3,6,25 May 2013
The Hustler," Fast Eddie. Slow film. Overripe script.
","Positives: The cinematography deserved all of its Oscar, and George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason are majestic. When they're on screen or the story picks up, it's a gripping movie. There's not a duff turn among the supporting cast either.Negatives: Was Newman trying to be Brando? Because for me, his performance bombs - he looks like a nerdy college kid trying to act tough, the cockiness is totally forced and overplayed. And what are the redeeming features of Piper Laurie's character that Eddie puts up with her? She goes around being a mouse and bringing everybody down, the wrong sort of drunk for the story. These tough guys would have found a good-time gal, or at least told her to cheer up once in a while. If Eddie's trying to help her because he feels the need to help himself it doesn't come over in the script. Her aspirations to becoming a writer consist of four lines typed up one drunken afternoon, and the three (ten-dollar) words on the mirror. That's pantomime. There's no hint that she knows she's deceiving herself, or drinking secretly, or that she has any inner pain at all - she's just grumpy ALL the time. (She had polio and her father died - that's it? Maybe it's the hairdo). Sarah's misery is all taken as read, same as Eddie's genius (he never practices) and the characters come across as half-baked. Sarah's story also steals the focus from Eddie; she does make a far bigger sacrifice after all. But because the character is so thinly written, there's no chemistry between her and anybody. In fact the only dramatic tension is in the pool contests, which may make you feel 'The Hustler' is better than it is. Presumably this movie was part of the early 60's gritty realism trend in drama, but these preppy actors attempting a methody thing with the progressively more overripe script just come across as pretentious. 'The Cincinnatti Kid' is a far better sports drama of the time. 'The Hustler' tries to do too much.",5,17,29,7 November 2007
Midnight in Paris," Miracle on the Boulevard Haussman (spoiler)
","It's not a bad Woody Allen film, it's not a bad film for people of a certain age with a certain level of education - Woody Allen fans, in other words. If you see MIP in a comfortable cinema with nice company you'll probably enjoy it. It will absorb you if you let it. Owen Wilson does a good job as an aspiring 'serious' writer on a pre-nuptial family vacation in Paris conflicted by his desire to follow the writer's path against his impending marriage to a self-absorbed WASP heiress. I do wonder that Woody wasn't credited as 'Mr. Wilson's voice coach', because once again his leading man appears to have been instructed to do an impression of the director, and it's to Wilson's credit that he makes this work. A simple enough premise - Gil Pender (Wilson) is regularly picked up by a vintage limo at midnight and transported to 1920's Paris where he runs into most of the cultural icons of that time, who help him both with his novel and his love life. The best turn is Adrian Brody as Salvador Daleeeee!, but most of the cameos (Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, etc.) are very convincing. Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is not so good, she just comes over as a Midwestern community support worker - the character could have stood a lot more edginess and neurosis, considering how important she is in the script. Eventually he falls in love with - sorry, can't remember the name, and that's an illustration of how 2-dimensional the character is - Hemingway/Picasso's girl, and realises he wants to stay in Paris, unlike his fiancée who wants a Malibu beach house. And this is where the ending of the film lets you down, because Gil and - sorry, can't remember the name, and that's an illustration of how 2-dimensional the character is - his fiancée have a fairly tame argument and he walks out of the hotel. That's it. The climax. Luckily he meets up with the extremely cute (and extremely badly acted) girl who runs the nostalgia shop where he's been picking up Cole Porter 78s. Sorry Woody, this is one-o-one scriptwriting. When he and fiancée split, there needs to be more at stake than just mild inconvenience. The supernatural premise is allowed to carry the film, and it's well staged enough to satisfy most of the way, but the story fizzles out. The fact is, the characters are not developed enough for any sort of deeper conflict to arise. The female characters are particularly thinly drawn, especially Carla Bruni (joke). Speaking of bad acting, Carla Bruni as a tour guide does manage to be better than Madonna. Just. Good music, good scenery, a few good gags (the French PI steals the end) and a few wry observations of Americans abroad, MIP will suspend your disbelief and leave you feeling warm inside. If it were Goldilocks' porridge, she'd like the taste and temperature, but think it a little thin.",Null,0,0,29 October 2011
The Prestige," Atrocious acting, preposterous plot, sadly not a joke
","'Prestige' starts as Jules Verne and ends as Star Trek on a bad day.Atrocious acting: Ever heard of 'Mummerset? It's the word used to describe the ridiculous accent that actors use to indicate they're from the English countryside, the sort of 'ooh-arr' sound that Robert Newton makes in 'Captain Blood'. In 'The Prestige', the ridiculous accent used is 'Mockney', the one actors use to sledgehammer that they're from London. Luckily for Michael Caine, he was born an East Londoner, but the rest of the troupe in this pile of tripe look and sound like they're auditioning for 'Eastenders' (a dreadful UK soap), trying to out-gorblimey each other. Caine does his usual reliable turn as the worldly-wise buddy who's powerless to stop things going wrong, as seen in 'The Man Who Would Be King'. And go wrong they do. When David Bowie is the actor giving the best performance in your movie, you're in trouble. The interchangeable cardboard magician's girl assistants do not manage the transition from TV acting to big screen at all. Caine once did a TV 'masterclass' about screen acting, the upshot being that you shouldn't blink in closeup - note how all the other actors fail to observe this rule, and it shows Caine was right.Preposterous plot: The movie opens with the death of Jackman, where Bale is on Death Row for his murder, and is told partially in flashback to when Bale and Jackman are rival magicians. Bale, for some reason he can't remember, contrived to cause Jackman's wife to die in a trick, so that naturally Jackman is obsessed with revenge. He's also obsessed with discovering the secret of Bale's 'Transported Man' trick, where the magician instantaneously moves from one side of the stage to another. Now at this point, about an hour in, I thought I'd guessed the ending. Jackman has to hire a double in order to pull off Bale's transportation trick; the only problem is that he ends the show beneath the stage while the drunken, stroppy double gets all the applause. (Somewhere along the way, Jackman acquires a wooden leg, which appears overnight, but doesn't seem to inconvenience him beyond a slight limp). Of course, I thought - Jackman eventually gets the double to perform the 'Pledge and Turn' (the opening premise of the trick), so that the double is the one who gets drowned in the tank placed below stage by Bale. I was wrong. We are eventually asked to switch from a reasonably atmospheric period melodrama (think 'The First Great Train Robbery') to schoolboy science fiction. Jackman, at vast expense of which we get no explanation, buys a cloning machine - yes, a cloning machine - from real-life distinguished inventor Nikola Tesla (Bowie). Every time he performs the trick, Jackman dies and is cloned back to life, in the traditional 'Star Trek' transportation manner. What? WHAT? Just as well Tesla's machine didn't work, or he'd be back to give Christopher Nolan a piece of his mind. Sadly not a joke: if 'Prestige' were even just a little tongue-in-cheek or camp, you might be able to feel that your intelligence was not being not just insulted but placed in the stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables, ordure, and pseudo-science as seen in ads for hair conditioner. No, 'Prestige' is deadly serious about itself as a history lesson and as a drama. Starting as Edgar Allen Poe meets Jules Verne, it ends up as Doctor Who meets Star Trek, and it's a train wreck. A terrible film.",1,49,121,25 January 2012

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Looks like twenty people wrote the script and gave up at the end.
","Divorced woman (Frances McD) whose daughter was raped and set on fire hires three billboards (conveniently in her road) to goad the police chief (Woody H) into action after several months of nothing.Sadly, the police chief is dying of pancreatic cancer, and his deputy (Sam R), who is a racist sociopath with a heart of gold, decides to set the billboards on fire, throw the billboard agent out of his window, and arrest Frances McD's boss on marijuana possession. Meanwhile Frances McD has assaulted the dentist with his own drill, Woody H has shot himself, and a random stranger threatens Frances McD in her gift shop, just before Woody H's wife turns up with his last letter to her.Wow! A lot of story there, hey? Makes you think that you're in for a fantastic ending, don't it? What actually happened is that the fifty or so people writing this all got tired of thinking up more and more destructive turns and sick characters á la Coen brothers (which this isn't a patch on), and realised they had to conclude it. Unfortunately they didn't manage to.Now if it had turned out (as was probably in the ninety-fifth draft) that Woody Harrelson had been the rapist in the first place (believable, seeing as all the other cops are suffering with major anti-social personality disorder), some sort of resolution might have been achieved. As it is, we share Frances McD's complete lack of closure. Was that the point? Highly overrated film, give it a miss.Seen Olive Kitteridge? Frances McD reprises Olive, except here she acts out - firebombing the police department, among other stuff.",1,6,15,30 July 2018
The Village," An episode of 'Outer Limits' stretched to two hours...
","And I mean stretched. The pace - well, there is no pace. The whole movie is at a standstill. How many slow tracking shots of people doing mundane things are there in 'The Village'? Because if you are forced to sit through it because, say, your fiancée loves it, or you are trapped in M. Night Shyamalan's house, it might help you through this turgid melodrama to try counting. That's the worst problem. The second problem is that Bryce Howard can't act. Well, she can act, but only at the same level - no light or shade. You never believe she is blind for a minute, only that she's stepped out of an amateur production of 'Hamlet' by mistake. The third problem is that there's not enough story. That's why after fifteen minutes you start to get restless and pick holes in the thing. Guessing the twist? It's not hard to guess WHAT it is, only the 'why' is different. The fact that ********SPOILER************ the village is a wildlife (p)reserve for the wealthy families of the victims of urban crime is all the story there is. In the longeurs at the beginning, you start to wonder how they live, where all the oil comes from and why the 'elders' of the village are all under fifty. Shyamalan is too busy trying to create atmosphere to bother creating authenticity, which The Village completely lacks. In Witness they took the trouble to explain the commercial life of the Amish, for example, and that gave it a reality within the movie. This community never gets remotely believable. If The Village had been an episode of 'The Outer Limits' or 'X-Files' even, it would probably have been a classic. But it's ninety minutes too long. Oh, and I thought Lucius's colour must have been red. Blood, you see. The fact that they left his fate open is an acknowledgment that the twist isn't strong enough to close the story.",2,3,7,10 July 2008
Knowing," 'Close Encounters' meets 'The Omen' with an overkill Deus Ex ending.
","So what you get is young kids pretty convincing in major roles, cutting-edge disaster FX, cool music, and all the right plot buttons pushed at the right moments - until the end. (Also frantic DIY efforts). And mostly until the last sequence it keeps you guessing - is John Koestler (Nic Cage) just succumbing to gross paranoia after his wife's random death? Or is it really and truly The End of the World? What you also get is a lot of high class hokum; for a man cracking up enough to sink a bottle of Scotch every night, Koestler displays amazing resistance to continuously major trauma, and amazing fitness too - but in this it started to strangely remind me of 'Vertigo', as the obsessed, damaged hero (Cage is very like Jimmy Stewart) frantically follows a path at all costs that we hope will lead to some sort of redemption. And it's towards the climax that 'Knowing' starts to fall apart, because those mysterious 'men in black' take a hand. Literally, it's a Deus Ex Machina. 'Knowing' abruptly stops playing games with your head in its previous Hitchcock way, to switch to an over-the-top I, Robot-style FX-fest. Battlestar Galactica eat your heart out, and 9 out of 10 up till then.**********SPOILERZZZ*********** The last worthwhile plot turn is a car smash almost as shocking as the one in 'Adaptation'. And then - bunny rabbits? BUNNY RABBITS? The way the ending plays out is boringly neat and logical in story arc terms (and racist? - I mean, only two WASPS will be saved..?) and after the high drama and twists and turns of the previous 90 minutes it's a complete letdown. And slow. And FX overkill, actually - did they do this just to say 'we can portray the destruction of New York better than anybody before or since'? Because the story we were asked to buy into at the beginning, ie John Koestler's paranoia, grief and issues with his son and our doubt over his sanity, is literally overwhelmed by a sub-Close Encounters meets Armageddon meets Contact running-through-cornfields affair, which I momentarily thought was an Aero Bubbles screensaver kicking in. The bunny rabbits killed it for me. That was Harvey, not Vertigo. 4 out of 10 for the dénouement, which in hindsight makes no sense anyway - after all, why did the aliens choose those kids in particular, or Lucinda 50 years ago? What on Earth made them special? Hollywood demographics, I suppose.",6,1,3,5 April 2009
The Shining," Great ghost train ride ruined by dumb plot turn
","A family takes on the caretaker job of a haunted hotel - the father develops homicidal psychosis.When the 1980 'Shining' came out, it was considered surprising that Kubrick should take on the horror genre but there are many touches in TS that echo the spine-tingling bits in 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc. And the extended (typical Kubrick) shots following Danny Torrance either on his go-kart or running through the snowbound maze in the hotel grounds are exactly like a 'haunted house' fairground ride. Good stuff.Jack Nicholson nails the nasty psychopath writer, the kid acts well in spite of being overdressed most of the time, and Shelley Duvall only just goes over the top. It's an entertaining haunting/horror yarn. Unfortunately there's a dreadful plot mistake when Jack gets locked in the kitchen storeroom, which would seem to have cooked his goose. The ghosts unlock the door. This completely breaks the logic of the story because either the haunting is all in the family's heads (which is what we are led to believe), or it isn't. For the ghosts to physically intervene in the story when they haven't before and don't afterwards is a complete clunker. If Jack Torrance had 'always been the caretaker', why not give him inside knowledge of the kitchen that allowed his escape? Stupid, stupid plot turn. But a movie you can re-watch, nonetheless.",7,0,2,22 October 2013
"I, Robot"," Blade Runner it ain't
","In spite of the great future-design touches, the clever Asimov premise, and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. The clichés come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant, to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off). This movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good in closeup, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad Disney -the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years.",4,23,40,7 May 2005
The White Ribbon," Deep, dark and disturbing - and Ich weiß nicht whodunnit.
","Spoilers? Absolutely. Maybe even an explanation.This (long, sorry) review is for people who have already seen The White Ribbon. If you haven't, you should. It's superb.The pivotal scene in The White Ribbon is when the schoolteacher, the film's narrator, tentatively voices to the priest his suspicion that the priest's own children may be responsible for the series of horrific, random acts of violence that drive the story and provide its mystery. In a clever reflection of when the priest forces his son to confess to masturbating, the priest turns the tables and lets the schoolteacher know exactly where he stands in the social order. From that point, the schoolteacher is no longer in control of the story and the mystery must remain a mystery. The priest can live with mysteries; the schoolteacher and the audience find it less easy.From the beginning, Haneke tells us that the story is the imperfect recollection of the schoolteacher, so no-one should expect resolution in the Hercule Poirot way. It's a subjective account by an unseen old man, not some sort of contrived detective story (though for my grey cells it was the midwife all along).The first thing I wondered when the film ended was 'what happened to the doctor and his children?' - when he shut up shop and disappeared with no explanation. Of course, the doctor must have realised that now that the Down's syndrome child he probably fathered by the midwife was dead, he had no reason to remain, especially now that the woman herself was quite likely unhinged. This sense of obligations paid is reflected in the Baroness's earlier split-up scene with the Baron.The second thought that occurred to me was that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was as much an inexplicable act of violence as any of the events in the village - it's just that the consequences would be global. Many of these people would be sent to war, like the cabbages being laid to waste by Death with his scythe. In the scene in church where the Baron calls on the whole village to watch out for and denounce the perpetrator of the latest atrocity, he might as well be calling on all Germany to avenge the death of the Archduke.So the white ribbon (such as the priest wears round his neck) is a symbol and reminder of innocence; what happens in the film is that everyone loses their innocence, and no amount of repression, control or self-delusion can prevent that loss. Just as the little boy learns that 'everyone dies - and your mother didn't go on a trip', everyone in the village learns that the social order is a illusion, and neither the church nor the aristocracy is going to be there to hold their hands or provide a satisfactory explanation when they need it, and all the police can do is bully little girls. In time, the state will harness your self-hate and send you to kill people; in this sense The White Ribbon is like a prequel to All Quiet on the Western Front.The acting, photography, costumes, sets and direction of The White Ribbon are up there with the best, and the use of black and white is absolutely right; it's like putting your eye to a magic box which transports you back to 1913. Of course there are times when nothing seems to be going on, or scenes seem to be pointlessly long, but not for a moment do you lose the illusion that your are witnessing reality, and the sense of mystery is strong enough to keep you guessing. It's just that you'll still be guessing after the film has ended, though not in a frustrated way because Haneke gives you so much to look at and think about. If nothing else, The White Ribbon has the best set of child actors I've ever seen.There is no suggestion in The White Ribbon itself that Haneke is trying to 'explain Nazism' or anything like that, but it did strike me that the schoolteacher and his innocent Eva (a stunning performance by Leonie Benesch) were prime candidates to become leading lights of the local party later on - Eva, after all, is so perfectly Aryan.If Spielberg had directed this, we would have had a scene in colour at the end where the 130-year-old schoolteacher, or maybe his and Eva's war criminal son, bashed it into our heads that the mystery was never solved, and he was sorry for any offence Germany caused during the 20th century. Unnecessary; if TWR has a message, it's that your innocence is between you and your conscience, not the responsibility of church, employer, or state.Plot points: 1) Who strung the wire that brought the doctor down? Whoever had access to a long piece of strong wire, such as a farm labourer. Was it because the doctor might have been Jewish, I wonder?2) If the children blinded (the only true innocent) Karli, who wrote the Biblical note? The priest's eldest daughter might have done, but surely this was an another attack on the doctor with racial/religious overtones, or the midwife by herself in a Munchhausen way - but plenty more people in the village than just the characters we met were capable of doing this. 3) Who fired the barn? Who birched and strung up Sigi? Anyone with a grievance. We know who destroyed the cabbages, but anyone we see in the final scene might have been evil enough to have done any of those things, that's the point. And in a way, it's a Poirot solution - they all did it. My money's still on the midwife though - she even stole a bike.",10,0,2,26 January 2012
Spider-Man," The best comic crossover yet.
","This film definitely recreates the engrossing entertainment that a good comic delivers. There is clever humour, exciting action and plenty of reasonable plot complexity to keep you guessing. Tobey Maguire is cast perfectly, and even manages to make the script sound intelligent. Spiderman is completely successful in translating the atmosphere of the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comic book, and that's a good thing.Minus points? The Willem Dafoe villain. While Spiderman is a neurotic, error-prone (semi-)human, Green Goblin is a cardboard cutout, a stereotypical sci-fi bogie man - even the graphic style of his costume is wrong, he looks like a 1980's Marvel villain, and doesn't match the perfectly captured vintage webslinger. Maybe his son, in the inevitable SpideyII, will get it right.That said, this is how superhero films should look!",8,0,0,14 June 2002
Collateral," Miami Vice producer meets Caribbean Pirates writer and...
","...the result is a film that feels like a TV crime show with over-extravagant set-pieces. Collateral is written to the classic 'Hero's Journey' formula. To précis; Jamie Foxx refuses the call to adventure, is mentored (by the villain), then passes the threshold, enters the belly of the whale, undergoes the ordeal, seizes the sword (the cop's gun) and brings back the elixir of some revelation or other. Nothing wrong with that, but following that thread is the only thing that kept my attention in this flashy, overwrought thriller that ultimately collapses into cliché. It stops working when Jamie Foxx throws his case away and Cruise doesn't kill him. So any sense of urgent motivation is lost. After that, when Cruise attacks the busy club, it's so confusingly directed that my mind started to wander, and the immense plot hole that others have mentioned yawned open. Why is this supposedly top hit-man going round in a car with a big light on the top? Why can't he drive himself? Why can't he take the subway? Is it self-destructiveness? A sense of tragedy is feebly hinted at, but it doesn't wash, it's lip service. I didn't know Michael Mann had produced and written on Miami Vice but it makes sense. Collateral is strong on visuals and weak, very weak on thought processes. And then they hit you with a coincidence straight out of 3rd Grade storytelling: the DA is the hit-man's final target, but she just happens to be Jamie Foxx's prospective love interest. Nah. You blew it. There are a few interesting touches: there are vague echoes of Blade Runner, they try to deconstruct a couple of clichés (the bin through the glass door), and it has to be said that Tom Cruise is convincingly scary - that may be the Lizard People Theory association. But long before the time Collateral gets to the climax you can't suspend your disbelief any longer. I mean, this guy can pick out targets with a thirty-round clip in a crowded club but he can't hit two people in an office? And to end it with a subway chase is an Eighties' homage I could do without. Disappointing.",1,10,19,4 April 2008
Dunkirk," Like a 99-minute computer game cut scene. Without CGI.
","SPOILER ALERT: The Germans won this bit of WWII.Tawdry rubbish. Summed up by the modern train carriages the 'soldiers' board at the end.Saving Private Ryan's famous opening scene had you flinching and wincing at the succession of gory death scenes without letup; you never had time to worry about WHO was getting butchered. In order to stretch exactly that sort of thing writ large with ships and planes to an hour-and-a-half, Christopher Nolan has had to allow some kind of characterization to happen. The suspense occurs in that you never know whether the character you're looking at (I'm sick of Steadicam btw) is going to last another few minutes or not. This movie is for the generation that has grown up with live, amateur disaster footage.This is a terrible way to inspire any kind of identification with the characters; everyone is expendable, and none of them are drawn in any depth whatsoever. A little vulnerability here, a little courage there, but after half an hour of this all that's left is the spectacle of violent, horrible death. And Kenneth 'No-Lips' Branagh practicing for when he inevitably does Churchill. (The English politician, not the car insurance bulldog. I won't be advance booking).This is why 'Dunkirk' resembles a series of computer game action scenes cut together. You're just waiting for the next one to find out if anything happens. And the music, sorry, the synthetic drone that goes on throughout (what happened to war movie themes?) adds to that sensation. No development, no change in mood - apart from stealing 'Nimrod' from Elgar (a cliché, by the way) - and in the end, no surprises apart from unexpected death. The whole movie feels synthetic, ie artificial, instead of engaging your deeper emotions.It's technically interesting - I wouldn't say 'impressive' - and may look authentic compared to 'traditional' war films, but it's actually just as false, and has less emotional involvement.",1,31,56,26 July 2017
The Usual Suspects," Doesn't quite pull off the trick ending
","The Usual Suspects is a great caper movie; stylish, exciting, intelligent and all that. The problem I had with it was that it's too easy to guess the ending. By the final scenes, the upshot is that the only mystery is Keyser Soze's true identity. Then you've really only got one character out of the main four that fits. It's too obvious for it to be Keaton; the other two aren't fleshed out enough for it to matter; Kint it has to be, the only mystery is how they explain it. So the final revelation is an anticlimax. The scene where the cop pieces together Kint's lie from the chaotic evidence in the office is great, but just to have Kevin Spacey walk off with no further twist is a letdown. Maybe if it had been Fenster back from the dead, or one of the cops, or even Pete 'Nice Try at Japanese Accent but It Goes Scottish Occasionally' Postlethwaite, who might shoot Spacey from the car, or maybe even the girlfriend - and this movie is very light on females - there would have been a final extra twist to make this movie more than just good. As it is, you think this super-duper master criminal seems to have made things extremely difficult for himself for no reason. Too much like 'and it was all a dream, The End'.",7,0,3,13 January 2007
Yesterday," Not today, thank you.
","The story of a less-than mediocre singer-songwriter from suburban Suffolk who becomes a world superstar through plagiarism.No hang on, the story of an ugly nerd who nobody realises is a tribute act.Sorry, start again. A film about how much better the film world would have been if Richard Curtis had given up and gone into teaching. It's even got James Corden, whose chin auditions for the role of Ringo's nose.Even if you like the Beatles' songs (which I don't), you will hate Yesterday, because Himesh Patel makes such a terrible job of them.As per usual, Richard Curtis' script sounds like it was rejected by the local amateur dramatics group who decided to put on 'An Inspector Calls' again this year.",1,10,24,20 July 2019
Quantum of Solace," Weak plot, idiotic direction and progressively more disappointing.
","I'll start positive - the very watchable Daniel Craig has nailed Bond as well as Connery did for his time, and QoS manages in many scenes to supersede the glamorous traveloguery of the earlier franchise. There are a (very) few jokes, the totty isn't just totty, and they've also slightly toned down the CGI and product placement from CR, which can only be a good thing. (Though Bond's phone never loses coverage, never needs charging, and zooms in on single faces in a crowd of thousands. At night. Is it nuclear powered?) But QoS isn't much bang for your buck. It's just an extended chase, which would be okay if Marc Forster hadn't made such a truly, unforgivably dreadful job of the action sequences. In Bond, you're expecting stunt work much like a great circus act - you want to be blown away by the skill and ingenuity of the performers. But Marc Forster's direction completely gets in the way. He literally loses sight of the action every time a sequence comes up; the only one that half works in spite of his pretentiousness is the plane chase. This means that you leave the film unsatisfied by the weak plot because you couldn't follow the action that would have made up for it. Meanwhile any Bond character development you've heard about is minimal, Judi Dench still doesn't understand the character she's playing, and the final climax is a clichéd and dismal melodrama. (Imagine 'Backdraft' on a budget). A final point: it would have been far more accurate, funny, and true to the 'Bond reboot' to see the British Secret Service struggling with ancient clunky technology, rather than that unbelievable super-slick Minority Report-style system, which is plainly a pathetic nod to the action film competition - and maybe the sponsor.",4,28,41,8 November 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Ingmar Bergman does 'Deadwood'. Not an action western.
","TAOJJBTCRF is a long dramatised documentary of what the title says. Some people here didn't catch the suspense that runs through it - basically who will die next? - and weren't seduced by the top-notch period recreation. Some picked up on the feeling that it might be bit of a Brad Pitt vanity project, allowing him to play a pantomime villain for once. He certainly does Jesse James like a cross between a young Burl Ives and a Midwest Tony Soprano. But for me, it worked. It sagged when the gang members became hard to distinguish, the casual disappearance of Frank James was a bit well, casual, and as others have said the pistol shots seem strangely muffled (a period detail?). To be honest you do get to the point where you feel 'I've watched two hours, I might as well stick with it', but if you take it at face value as a historical psychological study - of Bob Ford and of Jesse (and how the legend was what people wanted), and don't take it as seriously as it occasionally takes itself (the voice-over is a flaw in that respect), you'll be able to enjoy how beautifully made it is. It's epic without having a huge cast or massive number of setpieces, and rewards concentration, a bit like a long stage play put on screen. If you 'get' Ingmar Bergman movies, or liked Deadwood, you'll probably enjoy it. If not, move along, nothing to see here.",8,2,5,19 April 2008
Get Out," A horror movie for people who don't like horror movies. Racist? Oh per-lease.
","'Get Out' is what you shout at a character in a horror movie who's doing everything but what a sensible human being would do - looking in the basement, getting into the car, going to bed with the vampire. Don't go there! Get out!Chris Washington (Afro-English Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American photographer with an old-money white girlfriend (Allison Williams) who goes to her (weird) parents' country place for the weekend. Get out, says his buddy (LilRel Howery) over the phone, who's minding his dog. But Chris can't. Or can he? Should he? What's wrong with all the black people in this house? It's all good. Until it isn't.The great thing about Get Out is that it creates its own logical universe and sticks to it. There's a reason for everything that happens, including how all the characters react, and it all makes sense within the movie. It's also refreshing, knowing and funny in its treatment of the Guess Who's Coming To Dinner angle, with a lot of er, black humour.My fave is where the buddy goes to the cops to explain that Chris has been missing for 2 days. I won't spoil the joke.As well as good jokes, there are excellent shock and suspense moments too; it's a well-paced, quality movie and there's some class acting turns. It puts a modern racial angle on a pretty traditional horror scenario, but It does this very well indeed. Ultimately it's an old-school thriller with a social twist; and the gore and violence levels pitched perfectly. Enough to make you cringe, but not to make you retch, Also includes things to think about and things to laugh at.",9,2,6,7 June 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Romcom, travelogue or skateboarding flick?
","Walter Mitty, the nerd with a strong fantasy life. Ben Stiller has a fantasy life as a classic film director. This nerd chases a missing photo negative (google it) across the North Atlantic and Middle East only to find he had it all along, and his mother saves it from the trash. Ben Stiller's film lurches from genre to genre. One minute it's hyper-CGI superhero, next it's Greenland/Iceland/Afghanistan travelogue, then it's a divorcée romantic comedy. Oh, and not to forget the junior employee who gives venture capitalism back its humanity. And grows a beard, just like the bad guys.In this version of the James Thurber (google that, too) story, Walter is also an ex-punk ace skateboarder, which allows him not only to connect with his single-mother love interest, but also to pursue Sean Penn across Iceland.TSLOWM isn't bad, but it's strange. Its heart is in the right place, but the script is overambitious, trying to accommodate CGI, world travel, finance-free romance and the 'quintessence of life' on a pretty flimsy premise. See 'Billy Liar' for a better treatment of that.",1,1,5,15 January 2014
Gran Torino," They don't make 'em like this any more. Cars, that is.
","***This comment definitely contains spoilers***'Gran Torino' presses all the buttons it aims to, and joins old-time Western movie values with contemporary issues in a comfortably liberal way. The ending is nice and resonant, though the final funeral and will-reading scenes were probably too much. Just show Thao driving the GT with the dog, huh? And without the singing. For a moment, I thought he had a tape of Walt in the car.A lot of people who marked this down seem not to understand Walt's motivation to change, which I suppose is a script shortcoming. When Walt gets the report back from the doctor and then tries to talk kindly to his son for the first time in years, the message you're supposed to get is that he's looking at weeks, months at best till he joins his dead wife, and I don't think the horror of that finality comes across as well as it should have. Walt's reaction to the news - which was really no reaction at all - was true to life, but cinematically dull. Whatever Walt was ill with (strong hints at advanced lung cancer) is left unresolved, and that doubt and his indifference somehow undermines the ultimate passionate decisiveness of his character. It must have been a deliberate decision to let the ending resolve that doubt, but I think this is a dilution of the theme, and the film suffers for it.It's not a ground-breakingly original film, it's not supposed to be. It's very solid, nicely photographed, wistful and warming comfort food, with some wry and sharp lines from Clint peppering it throughout, and there are some wild allegorical touches to think about in the odd slow bit (like the whole somewhat formulaic priest thing). Gran Torino does a good job of triggering emotions at all the right points, and we should be thankful for the fact that people are still making movies with that in mind. You'll hate it if you're uncomfortable with having your heartstrings tugged in the old-fashioned way. But then you probably drive a Korean car. Me, I drive a 25-year old Mercedes. Get off my property!",7,1,5,22 February 2009
Meet Joe Black," It's A Wonderful Life If You're Extremely Rich
","Not a terrible movie, but it isn't the great movie it has pretensions to being. If you're going to release a three hour epic, then more has to happen, or actors have to act better, and scripters have to script better than this.Brad Pitt comes off best of the star cast, and in spite of looking like a nine-year-old Robert Redford at times, shows - for Tinseltown - a lot of subtlety, and carries off the comic angles to the script. He and Jake Weber as the creepy bad guy spark off each other well.Anthony Hopkins does his usual irritating 'slow, slow, quick quick slow' performance, and I got the feeling that they could have shaved a welcome half hour off the running time without his pregnant - er - pauses. And, er... portentous - um - procrastinations. Get on with it, man! Stop mumbling! The script is turgid enough!Clare, the totty, nods her head a lot. A hell of a lot. The face of L'Oreal 2001, I gather. I wonder how they got her to keep her head still long enough for the photos? This film may well have stalled her movie career, but at least she got three hours for her showreel.The supporting cast are pretty good on the whole; Jake Weber makes the ridiculous maguffin about the company takeover almost credible. But the Quince character (Jeffrey Tambor) has no place in a global media empire, even if he did marry the boss's frumpy daughter (a good turn from Marcia Gay Harden). And the character's obviously gay; they could have ramped that up. Even the outrageous Bill-Joe relationship is not commented on by supposedly high-powered executives. Brad's too pretty!The main plot about Death hanging about the old man gives you enough to think about to sustain your interest (kinda Bergman) until the immeasurably tedious and tacky party sequence. Then you stop caring, and begin to wonder about things, like:If he's a media tycoon, where did he get such a terrible band? (They make James Last sound like Guns 'n' Roses)Why does he spend most of his 65th birthday party in his home office when he's just retired - knowing he's going to die? Why are none of the members of the board at his party, when they're all available for a phone conference? Who cares whether overprivileged stuffed shirts live or die anyway?And the big twist: (SPOILER)Right, so Death leaves Brad Pitt's body, and takes Anthony Hopkins anyway. I read you that far. But it's got more holes than a cheese grater. How come Brad - suddenly even goofier - is physically 100%? Didn't the hospital, where the daughter Susan is such a brilliant part-time resident, hear about the accident? So do they never find Bill Parrish's body in the grounds? And do Susan and Joe - who must have to change his name - never resolve how he disappeared off the street and woke up weeks later at her Dad's party? Didn't his family miss him? And how come Death can't tie a tie, but knows enough to wash, shave, and change his boxer shorts regularly?You see, you start to ask these things in the pauses and longeurs of this movie, of which there is an abundance towards the end. Someone has already mentioned the annoyance of watching the angst of the fabulously wealthy. The main problem is the time it takes to get there, and your disbelief is unsuspended about half an hour short. The plot device is strong, but not THAT strong.",4,3,6,24 July 2005
The Illusionist," A decent pantomime, but it fizzles out.
","Two-dimensional characters can be fun in a pantomime or melodrama, such as the infallible wizard Eisenheim (Norton), the adorable-in-spite-of-being-a-duchess Sophie (Biel), and the black-hearted Crown Prince (Sewell). The only character in The Illusionist who undergoes any sort of development is the police inspector, who starts as the evil prince's lickspittle and ends as Eisenheim's greatest admirer. This isn't enough - or it's too much if all you want is pantomime.If the actual story were stronger, the fact that The Illusionist is only a bare melodrama wouldn't matter; it's beautifully staged, and the actual premise of the cabinet-maker's son and the ultra-posh duchess separated as teenage lovers promises a solid, if corny, ending.But the script fails to deliver *SPOILER*. At the end, the way in which Eisenheim has managed to fake Sophie's death is all explained in a multi-flashback in the police inspector's head, because both hero and heroine have left the stage about fifteen minutes previously. This is actually a clunky Deus Ex ending, not the twist which it pretends to be, and it doesn't resolve the story properly. It seems that Eisenheim was an expert chemist, as well as a virtuoso hypnotist, engineer, and all-round decent cove.Not a bad movie to share with your kids at Christmas maybe, and still better than the ridiculous Prestige because it's unpretentious.",5,2,3,25 September 2012
1917," Like watching someone else play a high-end computer game
","Two young English soldiers (possibly Cockney) must deliver a message across enemy lines to save 1600 men from certain annihilation - and one of them has a sibling in the doomed attack.Technically, directorially, cinematographically, 1917 is stunning; amazing. As you probably know, it's supposed to consist of one continuous 2-hour shot. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.Nearly 500 rank-and-file digital artists alone might tell you different, and I'd be interested to learn about the size of the camera disk drive they used, if it was 'one take'.Emotionally, 1917 is suspenseful, scary, shocking, sad, exciting, nightmarish, and yet: your engagement with the two main characters is more to do with 'what will be thrown at these actors next?', rather than 'what will happen to this person I really care about?'It's like watching someone play a massively multiplayer online WWI game, with graphics and camera movement that blows the competition away because it's actually staged. It's not like feeling anger at the stupidity of war, or feeling grief at the deaths of thousands over a pointless dispute between royal cousins - any Germans certainly get a very rough ride from the script.1917 is impressive in the way 'Saving Private Ryan' was impressive, but not as moving in the way 'Paths Of Glory' and many others were emotionally moving.Ten stars for technique, five for throwing money at a series of old soldiers' gory tales without any more context than, 'Wow, look at this!!'",7,31,61,24 January 2020
Children of Men," Production, cinematography top notch. Concept, acting, mediocre.
","In then year 2027, civilisation has collapsed due to human infertility, apart from in Britain, where refugees are hunted down and kept in cages by many thousands of men in riot gear. Clive Owen, who works at the Ministry of Energy, is tasked with getting the last pregnant woman on Earth (a 'fugee herself) to a rendezvous with a boat called 'Tomorrow' off Bexhill-On-Sea.Sir Michael Caine, that renowned social justice warrior, is a Lennon-lookalike flatulent old hippy with a wife who does nothing but sit in a wheelchair and blink. She still acts the pants off Clive Owen.Clive's acting range is stretched here, it has to be said, but he makes a brave stab at going from mild bemusement to utter incomprehension. Especially when he delivers the first baby born in 18 years in about 90 seconds. Yeah, right.Production and cinematography, yep, great; Very convincing and comprehensive vision of the collapse of British society into a neo-fascist dystopia. There are even funny bits. But the loss of human fertility appears to be the sole concern of the male population, apart from some superannuated hippy women, who manage to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle in spite of worldwide chaos, thank you.",4,1,4,12 February 2020
Children of Men," Top notch cinematography and production, daft script

The Imitation Game," Spoiler: The Nazis lost, but MI6 was almost as bad.
","Cheesy and inaccurate, but dramatic enough. The very fictionalized story of the man who paved the way for computers, if the film's end titles are to be believed. The film is well paced; there's plenty of suspense, incident and emotional turmoil. On the other hand, historical accuracy goes out of the window, if that's a problem for you when handing over your spondulicks.The inaccuracy that bothers me is the drama-class portrayal of emotional turmoil, the tearful confessions and crises, the repetition of encouraging catchphrases, and the billboard-sized depiction of what we have to assume is Turing's Asperger's syndrome. It's difficult to distinguish between Turing's struggle with having no friends, illegal sexuality (in the 40's) and his struggle to build an Enigma decoder, which makes him a joyless hero. And in the end, the government stitches him up royally - if only he'd known.What with the school bullying flashbacks, Benedict Cumberbatch has a tough time of it, and Turing's only happy moment seems to have been in finally getting 'Christopher', his computer, to work. I'm not asking for John Gregson or Kenneth More but it's all a bit wimpy and weepy. Gays, huh? What can you do? (Ironic).There's a lot of exposition of the fundamental problem of daily trying to find one out of 159,000,000,000,000 Enigma setting variations within 18 hours, which it's essential to appreciate to get the whole maguffin of the film, but this is well done, and on the whole the film is immersive and atmospheric.More exciting than, but easily as cheesy as you'd expect.",6,0,1,28 October 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Watchable, but a wind-up: the ending is pathetic.
","That's 'wind' to rhyme with 'mind', non-UK readers. There's a whole lot of running around, and pseudo-theo/philosophical bilge, and 'will-they-won't they' romancing, only to end up with 'The Chairman' (presumably God) changing the plan to suit Matt Damon and Emily Blunt because he can.In scriptwriting 101 that's called a 'Deus Ex Machina', from the ancient plays that ended with God descending on a stage lift to sort out all the mess that the mere mortals had got up to. You know - 'it was all a dream'. It was never a good way to end a drama in 200BC, and it's no better now.And the trouble is that TAB, for all its paper-thin characterisation, is (fairly) engaging and watchable to start with. This is why it winds you up. Where you start to think 'shouldn't I be sorting my laundry?' is when John Slattery, the hard-ass chief of the men in hats, is replaced by Terence Stamp, the even-harder-ass chief of the men in hats. There's no dramatic logic to this - they simply replace the bad guy with a badder guy halfway through.Also from script school you will note that the 'Magic Negro' trope was alive and well in 2011. This is the black man with amazing powers whose sole dramatic purpose is to aid the white man hero to succeed in the end. See 'The Green Mile', among others. Now if the Chairman had been James Earl Jones, well...",1,2,7,20 February 2014
Prisoners," Here's a spoiler to save you the trouble. It's RUBBISH.
","Two young girls are kidnapped. They are rescued at the end, but the blonde one loses the ability to act. They were kidnapped by the surviving widow of a couple who went round kidnapping kids in order to make people lose their faith in God, after their own son died of cancer. The nephew they adopted, who is unable to string a sentence together much, is suspected, abducted and tortured to death by Hugh Jackman, the blonde girl's father. At the end Hugh is drugged and bleeding in a deep hole, blowing a whistle which Jake G. may or may not hear.There. If I can save just one person from having to endure this pile of dung, then my life will have had meaning.You might think there would be fun to be had by pointing out complete nonsenses in the plot, characters and script of this film. There are so many, however, that it gets tedious. Just off the top of my head, then...1. It rains and snows, heavily, all the time. However, Hugh Jackman is dumped in a pothole which miraculously remains completely dry, despite being covered only by a bit of tin and an old car.2. In such abduction cases, the parents are usually initially considered prime suspects until eliminated. Despite the fact that Hugh Jackman is hysterical, violent, defensive and alcoholic, Jake Gylllenhall doesn't even have his house searched. The half-bag of lye he finds in his later casual inspection of the garage gets mentioned, then dropped.3. Jake Gyllenhall assaults a suspect in custody, with the result that the suspect manages to shoot himself (yes, the 'gun in mouth, blood on the wall' trope again). Such a cop would be IMMEDIATELY suspended. Not our Jake, however.4. Jake G arrests a priest who confesses to having imprisoned to death the husband of the evil couple in his cellar. Once that point is established, the priest and any reference to him completely disappears.5. Blonde girl's mother, after having suffered hell for a week or so, blithely tells other parent to wheel her just-rescued daughter out of the room for a little while while she talks to the cop.6. The maverick cop releases dozens of snakes into the community, without apparently bothering to determine whether they are venomous, valuable, or what; or bothering to retain them as evidence.Oh dear. There are many enormous red herrings and dead ends in the plot of Prisoners, but not with any logic behind them. A character or artifact is placed to suggest one plot turn, then dropped immediately when another comes up (eg the 'Maze' thing). This is the sort of plotting that children in junior school do. And much better, as a rule. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a TERRIBLE film.",1,5,12,7 February 2016
The Dark Knight," Eventually disappears up[ its own batcave
","I'm not going to comment on individual performances or technical aspects, these are covered elsewhere. What made TDK a disappointment for me was the loss of story halfway through. In the beginning, there are enough coherent scenes, strong supporting cast and even flashes of brilliance to tempt you into sticking with this latest episode in the comic-book-as-film-noir franchise, but TDK loses any sense of scale.The story leaves you high and dry; it loses any relation it had to an engaging story of complex supeheroes and Ã¼bervillains, and becomes an unnecessarily complicated, overwrought, overstuffed mess. The film becomes like a nightmare fairground, where all the sideshows are at full volume, in your face, and all of them drowning each other out, in the hope that you won't notice that none of them are very interesting at all. Just like that mobile phone multiscreen towards the long-distant end, which doesn't make sense as a plot device, as a technical gizmo, or as anything that one operator could make head ot tail of. Minority Report had a similar imaginary device that looked believable: this wasn't, even in the post-Luc-Besson design world TDK is supposed to inhabit.The point where TDK quite literally loses the plot is when DA Dent is switched to become Two-Face, which would naturally be the point where you would expect the movie to end - except that the Joker isn't anywhere near being dealt with at that point: so TDK has to carry on with a completely new villain in order to resolve the story of the old villain - and it doesn't do that properly either.In all, TDK is like half a good film with a bad one tacked on the end, loaded with flashes and bangs in the hope you won't notice.",1,7,18,4 March 2009

","Apparently someone thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about entitled, privileged white people who think it is a good idea to litter the Earth's wildernesses with polyester, oxygen bottles, and their own dead bodies. At vast expense.Never mind that the only distinguishable character in the whole movie is Aussie /Kiwi Helen, the base camp co-ordinator (I think), whose job it is to express anxiety on the satellite phone when everybody else is wrapped up in garishly-coloured polyester in atrocious weather conditions. Up a mountain, in case you hadn't guessed.Completely overblown Euro-soundtrack, and ridiculous visual effects whose only effect is to indicate that the danger is a simulation: if you film a snow bridge from every angle possible it simply indicates that what you're filming is make-believe.

Once Upon a Time in America," A bloated, self-indulgent epic fail
","A few very rich people and a great many very talented people, not least Snr. Leone, invested a great deal of time, talent and moolah to bring this movie to completion. It shows, and the movie is a rich spectacle - but nothing more. No-one should waste their time watching this except to learn how to overspend on art direction. I just want four hours of my life back. Naively, I sat through endless period son-et-lumiÃ©re, gratuitous sex and violence, dubious ageing makeup jobs, unrealistic dialogue and nondescript music, hoping that the ending would tie it all together in a satisfying way. Epic fail. It's a bad B-movie plot dressed as The Sting.*SPOILER* Noodles (De Niro, wasting his prime - the ridiculous name of the protagonist says it all) returns to New York after 30 years to find he has been advanced a million bucks for a hit, but why? It's Max, (James Woods) his boyhood gang chum that he thought he'd double-crossed and got killed, wanting Noodles to kill him before the real baddies get hold of him. What rubbish; after all, a million buys a lot of secret hideaway. It is so telling that the movie's premise considers a huge sum of money a good enough maguffin to hang a four-hour marathon melodrama on. Mild, ostentatious tedium follows - mystified, Noodles wanders from mausoleum to left luggage office to cold-cream besmeared dancer's dressing room, all the while flashing back to a squeaky-clean 1930's gangland, where we eventually learn that it is a bad idea to call Max 'crazy'. Because instantly he goes crazy, in a piece of character development that probably had the Scooby-Doo writers looking to their laurels. That was said of 'Bugs' Moran, actually - you didn't call him 'Bugs' to his face. There's no chance of any such real-life wit or irony in this script. No chance of any reality at all, because the intention seems to have been to make grand opera, so it doesn't matter that a man can be forced to sit in a vat of gasoline (and drink it) yet jump out when rescued as though it were gameshow gunk. It doesn't matter that driving a car at speed into a quay with no-one wearing belts would result in a bloody mess, not male bonding. Grand opera requires grand passion to drive the plot; Noodles' only passion is for looking at length through one of the movies' two terribly unconvincing peepholes at a budding ballet dancer, whom he goes on to rape. As you do; another piece of meaningless quasi-characterisation. Grand opera requires grand symbolism to resonate with people; there is no symbolism in OUATIA, the whole thing is a completely pedestrian display of directorial indulgence. But then, in 1984 we all thought the money would last forever. This movie certainly feels like it.",1,179,355,15 April 2011
The Artist," Great candyfloss, but still candyfloss
","For 'The Artist' to win the accolades it has done is pretty telling of the Hollywood movie industry as a whole. A silent remake of 'A Star Is Born'? In 2012? It's beautifully done, and a few gags keep up your interest, namely the dream in which Georges imagines himself silent among foley hell, and in the end where he reveals his impenetrable accent, and I suppose the dog, which out-Mooses Moose from 'Frasier' deserves credit. But essentially The Artist is a shallow melodrama, and that's something which bogs it down in silent-movie tedium.In parts this movie was very much like, and better than, one of Woody Allen's period pieces, with the well known faces (James Cromwell, John Goodman), mugging for all they are worth, and the whole 1929 feel is excellent. But to what end? To tell a story that is no different from one of the cheesy silent film romances that are now forgotten.",3,2,6,8 April 2012

Limitless," Hero, anti-hero, or villain? How to get it completely wrong
","Deadbeat writer takes mind-expanding pill (NZT) that brings instant brilliance except that they haven't sorted out the side effects and loads of bad, bad guys want it bad too. Great premise, great FX, thrilling action, but ultimately a big letdown.PhantomAgony's excellent review of Limitless says much of what I think: there are really, really stupid plot beats for one thing:1/ The police don't bother to search Morra when he calls them to his shot-dead suspected drug-dealer brother-in-law's apartment. He has a large bag of NZT pills stashed in his waistband while in custody for several hours.2/ In spite of now being a financial genius worth $2m, Morra forgets to pay back the vicious thug he borrowed $100,000 from.3/ A man suspected in two ongoing murder investigations carries on an unprecedentedly successful senatorial campaign. Like that would happen.4/ He hires bodyguards who are not on NZT rather than buy and learn to handle a gun himself. That would be too obvious, I guess.5/ The professional hit guy cannot outrun either a small woman or a man with a badly injured leg.The second problem is the faulty character development. Ed Morra (Bradley Cooper, really good) starts off as the plain, inept, ordinary hero who gets a crack at greatness. Over the course of the movie, he cheats on his fiancée twice, possibly murdering one cheatee, tells his fiancée to take a dose of the drug so she can escape a bad guy in spite of having just left his ex-wife who advised him that it's one-way ticket to miserable death, and abandons said ex-wife completely once she has fulfilled her plot purpose. He then becomes a smarmy, unpleasant Wall Street politico who's the biggest SOB in the valley and do you know what? HE DOESN'T PAY ANY PRICE. Getting away with being a total a-hole is completely wrong in terms of the starting character dynamic. In fact, Robert De Niro turns out to be the most noble character, simply by default. Cooper goes from Forrest Gump to Gordon Gecko. It's like Faustus (Walter White, even) getting away with it; dramatically totally unsatisfying.And the nasty undercurrent of this movie is its misogyny. Cooper's ex-wife (Anna Friel) is simply a cipher to indicate the misery of NZT's side effects. Once she's done that, she's dropped completely, in spite of the character being a vital part of his past. Cooper's fiancée has no existence beyond her relation to him, and once he has told her to take the same deadly NZT we don't see her again for over a year; and she's perfectly fine, as though she's been in the character fridge. The scene with her as a woman using NZT (and physically assaulting a young girl) to outwit the bad guy is obvious tokenism. And when he buys this super-duper apartment, why doesn't he move his fiancée in with him - or at least have to explain to her why not? Because in this movie, women don't matter.In the end, Limitless turns into another grating Wall Street politico/financial drama (Bob De Niro as hardass CEO, anyone?) and you end up not liking the hero; not feeling that he has redeemed himself, not rooting for the troubled villain - you just don't like him because he turns out nasty. The more I think about Limitless, in spite of its fine dramatization, the more I dislike it.",4,2,2,13 January 2016
The Departed," Really bad. Really, really bad. $90 milllion of bad. Watch 'Infernal Affairs'.
","'Awful' doesn't begin to describe this insulting, puerile, stupid waste of everybody's time. Do you hear, William Monahan? You wrote a script that is lamer than the massed teams of the 2012 Paralympics. Not one character in it is believable, engaging or sympathetic, not one word of dialog in it bears any relation to actual human speech patterns, and any semblance of plot is absolutely smothered in unnecessary, bloated, self-indulgent pretentiousness, disguised with profanity as the 'honest' language of the good old Oirish Boston Police Department.Martin Scorsese, you directed a tiresome, overlong, overcomplicated mess. The only actor that comes out of 'The Departed' with any credit is Alec Baldwin because it's so obvious he doesn't take it seriously - he does a prototype of his '30 Rock' psycho-boss.For the rest of the cast, they frown harder and harder as this extremely tedious film lurches to its anticlimactic conclusion, as if that would make a viewer any more interested in it. If Jack Nicholson, the scruffiest and most inept gang boss in cinema history, had been looking for the 'rat' in his gang, he could have chosen a worse candidate than Ray Winstone, whose American accent falls off somewhere west of Shepherds Bush. As it is, he fails to suspect anyone at all.OK, so it was purely a money-making enterprise, and succeeded in that, but please; why could they not have fleeced their customers with a little good humour? Avoid this film like the plague - it's on cheap channel reruns at the moment (Aug 2012), and it is disgracefully badly written, poorly acted, and sloppily directed.On the other hand, if you want to hear Dvorak's 'New World' (you know, the 'Hovis' ad) played on the bagpipes, which I am asked to believe is what the Boston Police play at all their funerals, fast forward to the end. Everybody but Mark Wahlberg gets shot. Monahan and Scorsese should have been.",1,7,10,31 August 2012
Love Actually," Cheap, cynical, threadbare racist chick flick
","Hmm, let's see... according to Richard Curtis, all American girls are airheaded nymphomaniacs, all Portugese are poverty-stricken kitchen staff, all black people in England want to be middle-class white people, working in p0rn is no different from working in any other area of showbiz and provides a decent living to even the slightest member of the crew, the Prime Minister spends Christmas chasing skirt and would be unaware of where his sister worked, the 'dodgy' area of Wandsworth is populated totally by white not-quite-so-middle-class families, the record-buying demographic of the UK consists mainly of the mentally deficient, British airports continue working at full capacity with no holdups right up to Christmas Eve, high-powered frumpy British wives forgive their husbands' infidelities all the time - especially at Christmas, middle-aged men become gay after becoming disillusioned with years of one-night stands with women... I could go on. If you are prepared to accept premises like these without question, then please, go ahead and enjoy 'Love Actually'. To people like me who don't turn off their critical faculties at the sight of Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, or Joanna Page's lady bumps, this movie is plainly the work of a group of white, middle-class grammarschool boys who decided to add every ingredient they could think of to appeal to an audience they obviously hold in the deepest contempt.

Man on Fire," Writer and director should have been fired
","To begin with, MOF is quite promising: an alcoholic gunslinger in obvious need of redemption is hired to bodyguard the precocious, annoying daughter of a rich, important Mexican and his leather mini-skirt-wearing WASP wife. The dynamic of how Denzel quickly develops a better relationship with the girl that she has with her father is plenty of plot to be going on with and rolls along quite well: however, he unexpectedly and incompetently doesn't manage to prevent her from being kidnapped. And that's where MOF goes off the rails. It turns from a sentimental 'troubled tough guy redeemed by cute little girl' movie into 'alcoholic gunslinger eventually does Death Wish with fajitas'.Christopher Walken, as Denzel's mentor buddy, demonstrates that Mexico has no decent Euro-hairdressers, and as the movie goes on (and on), you get more and more gimmicky frame-jumps, intermittent subtitles, gratuitous digital effects, and oh, to be honest I gave up at this point. Apparently Denzel (Creasy) does all sorts of unmentionable things to the bad guys, and there's a letdown ending - but frankly, I'd stopped giving a hoot by halfway. Didn't care about the kid, didn't care about Denzel, didn't care about the Mexican police force's corruption problem. Nor will you.",1,16,33,22 September 2014
Downfall," 'Saving Private Ryan' without the schmaltzy overtones.
","You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable.",10,14,18,29 June 2008
"Hail, Caesar!"," A cryptic crossword of a movie
","A friend came into the room about ten minutes after I'd started watching this and I had to explain it to her: so Josh Brolin is a devout Catholic Hollywood studio fixer who's got to replace the star in a movie but the only actor available is a trick-riding singing cowboy who can't act; meanwhile he has to cover up the out-of-wedlock pregnancy of a musical-swimming star, field two Tilda Swinton columnists and give up smoking. Then George Clooney, star of 'Hail, Caesar!', a sort of Victor Mature sword'n'sandals epic. gets kidnapped by a communist writers' study group.It's a good job she came in when she did because any later and this movie would be impossible to explain any more - as it is, there are several threads running though it, and the Coens throw in a few more.It's beautifully made, entertaining, witty and funny by turns, but you do get the feeling that the brainstorm session(s) that put it together might have been a little overenthusiastic; Hail, Caesar! has a bit of everything in it and you find yourself trying to pick up the references more than feeling any suspense. As Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) soon makes friends with his kidnappers, that plot turn is completely defused. Then there's a tremendous 'On The Town' type dance number, complete with outrageous double-entendres, but it outstays its welcome as its relevance to the plot (and it is relevant) isn't apparent at the time.The Coens being slightly self-indulgent is still better than 90% of mainstream Hollywood, anyway.",8,0,0,10 January 2019

That may be so that people a little slow on the uptake can keep up.And puerile jokes, drip fed, is all there is. Even Fred Willard failed to keep up my interest fnarr, fnarr.

The Green Mile," Sanitised, sugar-coated and shallow, unless you BELIEVE.
","It's not all negative; the period feel is strong, if very middle-class (the sharecroppers have a phone???), and so are the ensemble performances. The Green Mile unquestionably does a good job of pressing the right emotional response buttons for entertainment purposes. So does 'Bambi'. My problem with TGM is the amount of disbelief that has to be suspended to enjoy it. In Disney cartoons you know that anything is allowed to be possible, it's an animation. In TGM it's completely obvious - and completely unnecessary - that John Coffey is holding a light bulb in the 'help' moments; it's completely obvious that his breathing out the 'badness' is gratuitous CGI; couldn't they just have left him and the others to ACT it? The overwrought SFX turn Coffey's miracles into cheap sideshow stunts. Don't get me started on the mouse, by which the cardboard characters are upstaged. TOO MUCH MOUSE!It's a shame that the script characterisations are totally subservient to the sentimental story, like in a pantomime. Cold Mountain Block D managed to recruit the most liberal-minded bunch of warders in the country - but not one of them ever has a twinge of conscience, let alone any sense of smell! The only point where a character seems to get complicated is when the oh-so-nasty nephew turns co-operative for five minutes after striking a bargain with Tom Hanks. He soon reverts to stereotype. The rest of the film they all just follow paths that wouldn't be out of place in a high school nativity play. At no time does any of these sensitive, earnest death row wardens question the morality of capital punishment - from either end, even to get slapped down. Nobody criticises it, nobody justifies it, it's just not an issue, even in the modern, smell-less old folk's home at the beginning. You're left with the conclusion that in spite of all their caring, sharing postures, that those warders are just pretending, and just want to see those guys fry, like waiters longing for the last customer to leave. And so you stop believing their good intentions, and your disbelief is suspended. Same as I felt when I saw that poster covering the hole waving in the draft in 'Shawshank'. The morality of capital punishment is an elephant in the room that TGM and its sensitive, liberal characters ignore - apart from the attorney - he had the right degree of bloodlust.TGM is effective as broad entertainment, but the reality of the situations (execution, racism) it deals with is so horrible that you almost want to shout 'stop sugar-coating it!' at the screen. Tom Hanks - his usual dependable, if ever-so-slightly bland performance - experiences ten times more pain from his NSU than from the gruesome job he does, and the ghastly system he is a pillar of. And the reason TGM takes so long between story beats (how many times must we see him screw that thing on his head, already!) is that if it didn't, the paper-thin story would crash and burn in an hour. Don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, it's a well-dramatised piece of mummery.",6,5,13,3 March 2008
Parasite," An epic dark comedy. Really funny, really dark, 90% epic
","Two nuclear families - Mum, Dad, son, daughter; one filthy rich, one filthy poor. The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation. Did I mention the great acting?I do wonder what happened when the son's friend, who got him the tutoring gig in the first place, got back from university. Parasite II, anybody?

Casino Royale," A big, shiny, fun-packed mixed bag
","Pros: They threw out all the old camp JB stuff like Q and Moneypenny and the gadget-packed car. The fights are believable; stunt performers at the top of their game, esp. on the cranes. The plot is on a human scale; no doomsday machines or stuff like that. Daniel Craig is physically right, and the romance angle is well written and acted. Music, credits sequence, cast, are all refreshingly well put together. Amusing nods to the genre.Cons: Product placement is too obvious; 'I say, darling, let's take a boat on the canal - you don't mind if my S*ny V*io comes along too, do you?' Maybe just me, but the CGI and miniatures were just obvious. About five too many helicopter(cgi?) tracking shots at the beginning of scenes. Plot holes galore. And when do they charge all their phones?",8,0,1,29 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A bourgeois fantasy that fizzles out in 50 degrees of narcissism
","VCB is the tale of two American women, Vicky and Cristina (Hall and Johanssen), who visit Barcelona one summer. Both fall in love with the same man (Bardem) who is terminally entangled with his (utterly narcissistic) ex-wife (Cruz). Cristina temporarily enters this menage-a-trois, then she breaks up with them and goes to Antibes for a while. Vicky is then tempted to kick over the traces with her boring new husband (blah blah), but thanks to the ex-wife's use of a gun, decides to return to the USA with her husband and Cristina.If you've never been to Spain, Woody Allen's VCB will make you want to go. The look of VCB is great, all honey, warmth and harmonious landscape and architecture (if you stay in the pretty bits). You will also find a lot to enjoy in looking at Scarlett Johanssen, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall, who are fine specimens of sexy human beings and do what I believe is called 'Acting'. The music is also great. Unfortunately, the story doesn't lead anywhere. And the anonymous WASP narrator gets rather annoying, particularly as the dialogue is so wordy anyway. Chris Messina as the husband wins the 'I am the Woody Allen character' badge, by the way.I call VCB a bourgeois fantasy because it's like (and inferior to) one of those Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies from the thirties, in that all the characters are free to explore their romantic impulses in this beautiful setting without ever having to worry about bills, rent, doing their roots, selling their art/photographs/poetry, cooking, shopping, dentists, weight gain, laundry, contraception, mosquitoes, ageing parents, neurotic children - you get the picture: real life, apart from some jet-set lifestyle from a magazine, does not figure in this movie. And that would be fine, which it is in Fred'n'Ginger movies, if VCB wasn't so dependent on the audience caring what happens to the two friends. The feeling goes, 'Wow, this is a tough dilemma; but since all the characters' luxurious lifestyles (including invisible domestic staff) are unaffected by it, the problem isn't really serious. Therefore there is nothing to worry about'. At this point you say to yourself, 'Get on with it then, Mr. Director!'. And the story fails to deliver anything resembling resolution, because there never really was any conflict. Fred'n'Ginger movies usually had some sort of 'real-life' problem to resolve, like a show to put on, or a divorce or social differences; Woody Allen focuses exclusively on problems of the heart, which as anybody who lives in the real world will tell you, is only part of the story. In spite of its pretensions to true drama, there is never in VCB a single moment of pathos.3 stars for the acting, photography and music. None for the story or direction.",3,2,5,27 March 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," Let down by plot compromises
","Die Hard 4.0 is enjoyable on the level of 'how many cars can they smash up in one movie?', but on the human level they've compromised John MacLean. In this story he's little more than a bodyguard for the tame hacker until halfway through, and then it's as though they thought, 'Oh, we'd better give him some motivation - let's put his daughter in a hostage situation'.This is fine all the while it's leading up to the final confrontation with all sorts of CGI and stunts, but the ending is a real letdown. They make us swallow all that nonsense about patching networks at lightning speed and literally wrestling a jet fighter to the ground, and then what's the big finish? A bog-standard boring old Mexican standoff - in a shed or hangar - that might have come from TJ Hooker. There's no payoff for believing all that hokum! MacLean should do something even more amazing to turn the tables ON HIS OWN; instead it's a group effort and Bruce pulls off a cliché. 8/10 for a stylish CGI actioner, 4 for the ending. And the violence against women in this movie is not right; that must be why the PG rating. But it's not right.",6,3,6,1 July 2007
Flight," Back to front; bolt shot in the first ten minutes.
","A great central performance doesn't make a bad script any better. 'Flight' begins - after a somewhat overwrought sequence establishing that 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic coke head - with a literally fantastic plane crash sequence in which he saves the lives of all but six of the 102 on board by being a super-cool ace pilot, unlike his co-pilot whose hysterics are completely over the top. Scary, but the shots of a flaming 727 or whatever upside-down at 500 feet make you feel admiration for the FX team, rather than empathy for the passengers. If you want a seriously terrifying plane crash sequence look out 'Alive!'(1993), about the Chilean rugby team cannibalism episode. In 'Flight', you'll end up chewing your own arm off in boredom.But 'Flight' isn't about planes crashing, it's about an addict and his redemption. In which case, Zemeckis has got the cart before the horse - or in UK English, the whole thing a*** about face. After the way he handles the plane crash, anything else Whitaker does will be a complete anticlimax. And it is. The whole film is too long, John Goodman annoyingly retreads his 'Lebowski' role, and of course the female characters are about as deep as a Stoli and orange.Don't believe the hype; turkeys don't fly.",1,28,54,28 December 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," If Bob Dylan were Jesus Christ, this would be 'Life of Brian'
","'Inside Llewyn Davis' has quite a small scope: a week in Greenwich Village in 1961 (based on the Dave Van Ronk memoir - DVR released an album called 'Inside Dave Van Ronk') with a short excursion to Chicago: in the dark, which isn't much cinematic bang for your buck these days. But it's definitely a Coen Brothers movie, with all the rich black humour, mystery and tragedy that implies. Quite Barton Fink in places.Llewyn is an also-ran folksinger on the Village scene who's a complete ratbag; in the first ten minutes he gets beaten up for heckling another performer, loses his university-professor patrons' prize ginger tomcat, and discovers his dead partner's widow is pregnant (possibly not by him). The movie is actually a flashback leading up to the beating, as he couch- surfs and hustles his way from the Gaslight Club to Columbia Records to the Merchant Seaman's Union. Via Chicago.Of course, you expect the Coens to have been clever, and what is clever is the way that Llewyn (Oscar Isaac, the only Oscar this will get) actually performs his very downbeat folksongs full length in a completely convincing way, except that as Albert Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) in Chicago says, 'I don't see a lot of money here'. Benjamin Pike as the 'young Bob' at the end, and playing over the credits, is actually refreshing and pleasant after Llewyn's self-absorbed misery.Is Llewyn suffering from grief at the recent suicide of his partner Jim, who jumped off the George Washington bridge? Is Llewyn headed the same way? Is John Goodman really a master of the black arts, able to control Llewyn's life remotely? This is what the Coens do - they put questions in your mind all the time, and don't usually bother to answer. Which is fine by me, I just want to watch ILD again and soon.",9,3,7,19 January 2014
Spectre," Better than Skyfall, sort of. Meh.
","Superannuated super-agent noisily and expensively kills nasty rich people during exotic travelogue and finds love. The end.Bond, having deconstructed himself, deconstructs the British Secret Service. Better stunts than usual, more humour, but Jeez is it EARNEST. By this I mean we're supposed to give a flying finagle about James Bond's sad childhood and his loss of a mother figure ('M', we get it). NOBODY DOES. NOBODY, not even Bond. Get on with the story!! Future writers and directors of Bond films, get one thing through your head: the audience KNOWS Bond is going to win. No amount of torture, low-exposure camera-work or CGI collapsing buildings is going to alter that outcome. Therefore to base your suspense on 'will Bond make it alive?' is a major error, because there is no suspense that way.The only suspense available to the Bond filmmaker is, 'What crazy, improbable, unexpected scheme will the villain come up with next, and how will Bond foil it?' Therefore you have to have a crazy, improbable villain with crazy, improbable schemes, NOT torture-fetishist, ex-good-guy, seriously menacing men-about-town double-agents. These are cannon fodder, not adversaries. The current Bond villains are way too clever and nasty - if we feel no grudging respect or affection for at least their stylish megalomania - as we did for Goldfinger, Scaramanga, etc., then Bond is boring. Fear of the villain is wasted, because Bond always wins.And even though the Mi6 seems to have entered the austerity age like the rest of us, essentially 'Spectre' is painfully dated, as Daniel Craig's portrayal is becoming - in future years the dour, vicious, and pouting Daniel Craig Bond will be seen as how NOT to do it. Come back Timothy Dalton.",3,2,7,5 December 2015
Moon," The Loneliness Of The Long-Distance Blade Runner
","Astronaut nearing the end of his 3-year contract running a dark-side-of-the-moon energy mining operation develops a psychosis and discovers that he's a pre-programmed clone - or does he? Well, does he? And who cares anyway? You won't. For one thing, if the idea of using clones was to save the cost of sending relief missions, then how can storing so many clones ON THE EFFING MOON be economical at all?That's it. Fx as good as 2001, mind, and the acting is fine and dandy. But the whole premise could, and should, have fitted into a half-hour TV drama. The problem being that the character of Sam (the single-handed protagonist) is completely bland. It's taken for granted that we empathise because he's the small cog in the interplanetary corporate wheel. That's not enough.There are a few moments of decent, if predictable (ie his possibly imaginary wife is long dead, he's dead, etc) drama, but these are very sparely distributed over a film that overstays its welcome almost as much as Sam overstays his stint on the moonbase. Kevin Spacey revisits 2001's HAL 9000 as the sinister voice of Gerty, the merciless support computer droid thing, and overcooks it.If you can manage to stay awake until the end, congratulations. But you won't be rewarded by any denouement or big reveal. Anticlimax all the way, unrelieved by knowing nods to other scifi movies.",1,5,16,29 April 2017
The Social Network," Where did the $25 billion go?
","Those were the days, when Facebook was new. The Social Network is the story of how socially inept CEO Mark Zuckerburg is sued by two different sets of very annoying Harvard students who claim he ripped them off, when all he really wanted to do was not break up with the GF he subsequently abused big-time on the college bulletin board, giving him the idea for Facebook.You remember Facebook? It was big up until about 2013. Fast-paced, and Justin Timberlake steals it as old-skool hacker/webpreneur Sean 'Napster' Parker, since he's the sole interesting character.Essentially TSN is a watchable courtroom drama with flashy flashbacks. The only lives that matter in this story are white and extremely rich.",6,0,2,16 June 2020
