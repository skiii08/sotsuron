It," I Liked IT, but it's not so good.
","Well, i don't know how IT get so many good reviews, i liked IT but there are things that were really bad, like the script, it seemed like it was not a movie, it was like putting together several pieces the first half of the movie was just scaring the kids the dumbest way possible but the second half was nicer for me. I really liked the cast and the connection the movie make between us and the characters. I loved Jaeden Lieberher as Henry and Finn Wolfhard as Richie and Bill Skarsgard killed it, omg, so good interpretation, i really liked him. That's my review, i give IT a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,7 November 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson at it´s best!
","Wes Anderson may be known as that director who likes to have all the shots of his films in perfect symmetry. Many say he makes the most peculiar and fake films. But in my opinion, this director's films are like paintings moving and revealing themselves right before our eyes.In 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' Tom Wilkinson plays the character Zero Moustafa who, in a sequence of flashbacks, remembers his past self, telling his life story to the new hotel doorman. Within the story, many years before, Ralph Fiennes is the doorman of this hotel and a younger Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) is the new errand boy of the place and is also the apprentice and protégé of Gustave H.With names like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton and Jude Law in the cast, this film had everything to make a mockery of confusing and uninteresting events, but 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' uses this cast to make truly comical little 'cameos'. Ralph Fiennes does a fantastic job as Gustave H. managing to cause dramatic drama and comedy and his chemistry and interaction with all the other characters, especially the character of Tony Revolori is from another world.
The production design is wonderful, as is the costume and art direction. But, in my opinion, what stands out most is the composition of the space, the color and the lighting.The composition of space is used intelligently by Wes Anderson because it demonstrates superiority and inferiority between the different characters, as for example at the beginning of the film, when Zero Moustafa is officially hired by Gustave H, Zero is usually more at the bottom of the screen, small and out of focus, while Gustave H always remained in the center of the screen, as a big object, showing the superiority he had over the boy. But the two characters start to appear in the center together, right after Zero gets Gustave out of a complicated problem and his former boss starts to see him as an equal.The color and lighting, during the whole movie, show the state of mind of the characters, for example: when the movie starts, the character of Zero Moustafa is presented to us already in his old age. When he starts telling the story of his life, the colours are bright and sparkling, which shows that he feels good remembering the stories of his past. But later, almost at the end of the film, the only scene in black and white is what Zero Moustafa believed to be one of the darkest days of his life.Another key point that differentiates 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' from all other projects of the genre is the proportion of the screen, which varies several times during the film. This technique is used to demonstrate the different time periods in which the film takes place. The 80s, the 60s and the 30s.Comedy works perfectly because it uses clever jokes in addition to using violence for comic effect at certain times. I personally laughed quite loudly at various scenes in the film, such as the cat scene, which, anyone who has seen the film will know for sure what I am talking about.In conclusion, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2014. It is absurd, funny, captivating, violent, dramatic and colourful at the same time, it has an immense attention to detail, in the style of Wes Anderson and it is a film that I will want to see again in some time.",9,0,0,9 February 2020
