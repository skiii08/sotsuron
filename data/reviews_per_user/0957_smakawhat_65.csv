Requiem for a Dream," Unabashed near perfection..
","I could not take my eyes off this film for a second.In this highly fast paced story about 3 drug addicts and the mother of one who descends into diet pill addiction, I was mesmerised.  Besides the fact that it has a great cast (what MARLON WAYANS in a non comedic role.. he was good!), the visual style and scores left me breathless.  That violin music is still stuck with me. And TALK ABOUT EYE CANDY! Those edits and sounds had me awestruck.I have just left the theatre less than 15 minutes and I can't stop thinking about this film in its perfection.  Sure I have seen movies about addiction, 'Trainspotting', 'Drug Store Cowboy', 'Rush', and what I felt was the best one 'H' but this film beats them all.  There is no real plot, and at the start of the film we all know the story, but it's the ride that the director takes you on that will leave you stunned.I will never look at my refrigerator again with out feeling pure fear, as Ellen Burstyn did in her best actress nominated performance.  If she doesn't win (which goes without saying cause she probably wont), then there is no justice.A MUST SEE FILM!!  And anyone who is even THINKING of doing drugs, should see this film (heck it should be mandatory in schools as far as I am concerned that every student see this film).  This film blows 'Traffic' (which is great too) out of the water.Rating 9.5 out of 10PS - Did anyone notice the boom mic gaff, with the conversation between Leto and Burstyn after he visits her to tell her about the new TV?",9,0,0,10 March 2001
Minority Report," A very solid well done thriller
","FINALLY... Collin Farell gets a vehicle to showcase his talent.. The guy should have got better roles after Tigerland, but I guess he had to take a couple hard knocks first before getting into a better film.Luckily Minority Report is a great thrill ride, when it appears a cop is framed for a murder.  The twist is the futuristic setting, and backdrop, where the crime hasn't been commited yet, it is only perceived by an organization that can see the future.  THis could have been an overblown drama exagerating Orwelian tendencies, or the rights of liberty, but it doesn't cause it just sticks to one thing, the story of a cop trying to clear his name.How it turns out is quite ingenious.  This film is a great ride.Rating 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,26 July 2002
Training Day," See it for Denzel
","What can I say Denzel is the MAN.  He just steals the show.Training Day focuses on Ethan Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt), a young LAPD cop.  He is on his first day to start off in a new position to work in the narcotics division.  Jake is eager, he tells his wife how excited and nervous he is for this assignment comparing it to first day of high school football tryouts.  Jake plays by the book, is intelligent and strong, but his world is about to be turned upside down by a hardcore veteran named Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington.Alonzo takes Jake on a ride of insanity through the drug plagued worlds of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in gritty Los Angeles.  Alonzo is hard, he is succesful and good at what he does, but he does things differently. Alonzo is essentialy a cop who makes his own rules, and this of course creates a conflict for Jake.  After a few minor routine assignments it's easy to see that Alonzo is dirty.  In short Alonzo's attitude to fighting crime is simple, to beat the street you have to be harder than the thugs and pushers who inhabit it.  But Alonzo has been doing this far too long and is in a lot of trouble.This movie COULD have been a bad exercise in good cop bad cop shlock.  But what evolves is a very well acted character study of 2 men with different views on how crime should be fought (in fact 2 polar extremes).  Denzel is masterful as Alonzo playing one of the most feared dirty cops I have ever seen on film, and Hawke as Jake does what he does well in most films, playing tormented characters caught in a bad situation and looking very shocked and perplexed.  There are great scenes of dialogue between the 2 such as when Alonzo asks why Jake wanted to join the squad.  Jake replies that he wants to get drugs off the streets and give something back to the community, and Alonzo only replies what is the real reason you joined narcotics?  Jake then says, 'Cause I want to make detective'.  It is this line that is the basis of Training Day.With that, director Antoine Fuqua's work of pictured gang plagued LA is masterful.  Black distraught neighborhoods, Hispanic tatooed thugs sitting around a card table,  Fuqua creates hell and shows it brilliantly.  There is some good cinematography and a good score (but used too infrequently) creating a nightmarish uneasyness.  It's also wonderful to see Denzel play a bad guy for a change and play it sooooo well.  When Alonzo is interogating suspects you can't help but squirm in your seat while you watch him on screen.The film tries to tie in a plot, so that it can create a conclusion in the end.  It isn't that distracting or even neccesary but it only shows the inevitable of Alonzo's work.  The film ends unresolved and this is good, because the film isn't about the good guy winning and the bad guy getting his just desserts, it's about how 2 men of different moral belief try to survive and do what is right.  There are no heroes in this film, just great characters.While the use of placing 2 well known rap starts in cameo rolls, 1 Snoop Doggy as a wheelchair pushing crack dealer [good acting], 2 Dr Dre. as a cop henchman for Alonzo [bad acting], was really unnecesary.  While Snoop holds his own in the spotlight Dre's acting is just so canned.  Minor points, but I'd EASILY recommend this for Denzel's performance alone.Rating 8 out of 10.",8,1,11,29 October 2001
Erin Brockovich," Ok I guess
","Based on a true story, Erin Brokovich is a single young mother who is trying to find a job and raise her 3 kids.  After getting in a car accident and loosing in court, she litteraly FORCES her lawyer (Albert Finney) to hire her at her firm to do some clerical work.  Erin discovers some old case about some former client wanting to get more money for her house that the nearby watertreatment wants to buy.  In probing deeper she discovers, more than meets the eye and that it appears the company was responsible for contaminating groundwater thus poisioning everyone in the community.  So it turns out Erin with no legal experience and working in a VERY small firm, sets out for a courtroom battle david VS goliath story.
Hollywood loves these movies.  It seems this role was perfectly tailored for Roberts.  Finney is good a her boss too.  The movie is somewhat interesting but I didn't feel the need to route for the good guy, or get seriously pumped or motivated by the film.  I didn't find it that humourous either considering that Erin is portrayed as someone with a very short fuse and acid-tongue.  The only scene I got a good laugh out of was when the legal team from the chemical corporation was coming in to the small private firm.  In some quick thinking to show that the small firm wasn't going to be bullyed, they get half of the clerical staff to dress up like lawyers and walk in the meeting room as a combined show of force.  The movie was at least entertaining and OKRating 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,22 April 2000
Unbreakable," Dead Zone remake anyone???
","Bruce Willis is David Dunn.  We first meet David as a guy who has just survived a massive train derailment.  Everyone on board was killed except him, and stranger still he survives without a scracth.  Dave works as a security gua at a football stadium who seems to know how to pick out all the crud that passes through his domain just by (exscuse the pun) sixth sense. We learn more about him, as he never gets sick, and survived a previous fatal car accident.  Is he untouchable??Samuel Jackson is Elijah Prince who runs a comic book store and discovers about Dave's strange past.  He is intrigued because Elijah suffers from a degenerative 'brittle bone' disease, which leaves him feeble and easily prone to injury (as a kid he was teased and called 'Mr. Glass').  In finally meeting David, Elijah tries to find something about David's unique ability and perhaps something about himself..This movie reminded me a lot of the film 'Dead Zone', with it's psychic twist and turns.  The acting is fine nothing special, groundbreaking or memorable, the characters are not that fascinating, it is a good story.  However, the real great work in this film is Shyamalan's directing who has a knack for establishing great mood and ideas with just one simple shot of a camera. I can't go into detail about this movie without giving away too much about the plot, but I did enjoy it.  It was pretty entertaining with a little Hitchcock twist at the end (even the director makes a cameo in the film just like Hitch!!).Not bad.  This being Shyamalan's second major film, I think he will start seriously establishing himself as a solid respeted director.  Good for him.Rating 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,16 December 2000

As Good as It Gets," enjoyable characters
","This film is really not about anything.  It starts off simply introducing some of the characters who you will soon never forget.  We are immediately introduced to a crumudgen named Melvin played by Jack Nicholson.Melvin in short is a SOB.  He is rude, racist, paranoid, homophobic, and just a horrible person.  Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down.  This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.This is pretty much the pace of the film.  All the characters have their shining moment.  Melvin has several, Simon has many, and even Simon's lover played by Cuba Gooding Jr. has a great confrontation scene with Melvin telling him to lay off Simon.There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).  In short this is a bit of a flaw cause it makes the viewer not sympathize with Melvin right away.  Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example).  When he finally gets kicked out by the owner all the patrons stand up and cheer.  To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through.  It's a testament to Jack's performance for creating someone who is truly an absolute unbearable person to witness.  Melvin seems VERY real..But in short all these characters come together in the end out of bizarre circumstances and life changes for the better.  It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality.  This dog even has better acting chops than most actors  in films I have seen!  The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommendedGreat feel good film.Rating 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,11 November 2001
Memento," Unbelievable piece of writing and storytelling craftsmanship
","A film noir of unbelievable twist and turns!!!  Guy Pearce (from L.A. Confidential) is Leonard Shelby, a man with an odd condition.  He suffers from short term memory loss.  All he remembers is easily passed in obscurity within a few short minutes.  However, he has a fix for this condition by tattooing his body with post it remind letters to remember important things, and taking photos and writing on the back of them.  It's important he does this cause after all, he's out to find out who raped and murdered his wife and get his vengeance.  Even though Leonard can remember everything before his wife's murder about him and everything else, the trauma from the incident has scarred him and put him in this condition. However, we get the complete uneasyness and confusion of Leonard as people enter his life such as a bartender (played by Carrie Ann Moss of Matrix notaritity) and another somewhat perhaps shaddy character known as Lenny portrayed by Joe Pantoliano (Ralph from the Sopranos) may have alterior motives.  Since Leonard will loose what he learns in a short time, you wonder if the other characters are exploiting his condition for their own needs and leading him to the wrong killer.The film with great acting and great characters, excels at one thing that you will notice instantly.  That is its use of story telling and narrative. This film starts off at the end, and then litteraly plays out BACKWARDS as we try to piece togethers actions from litteraly Leonard's point of view. This movie is UNBELIEVABLE with twists and turns, and who's and what's, and the simple fact that you are litteraly in Leonard's shoes.  No movie have I EVER seen has placed the viewer inside the characters mind as this film.And as for the ending, suspense, dry humour, use of grayed film / colour, voice overs, twists, writing.... the people/person who wrote this....  God dang it.. if they DON'T get nominated... heck if they Don't  WIN the academy award for best Screenplay..  Then there is something wrong... NO wait... I take that back.........If this film's writer(s) don't win the PULITZER PRIZE!!!!!!!!!  There is NO JUSTICE.GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just so you won't forget like good ole LeonardGO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!Rating 9 out of 10.

12 Angry Men," Solid. Period!
","For a film that takes places almost 100% of its entire time in one room with 12 actors, it is a brilliant piece of work not just for its great acting, but for its relevance.Anyone seeing this film today, can remark on how the wheels of justice are no different than the trials of today, that people are filled with good faith, that there are people who are innocent, that there are times when what you see is not the entire truth, that people are cruel, that people are bigots, that people are heartless-disconcerting and these things still haunt us in our present lives, but mostly that someone can stand for their beliefs when everyone is against them and overcome them.So perfectly portrayed.  Looking at this film you will see that it is timeless, and that is what makes a film a classic work of art.Rating 10 out of 10",10,0,1,29 December 2000
Billy Elliot," Get off your Duffs stupid gits and see this FILM!
","Billy Elliot, is several great things.  It is about becoming something important when the odds are against you.  It has fantastic acting, where a hard fought striking coal miners family has to face odds with an impatient young man or face the wisdom of his father.In this you add, the look and feel of a North England town, and the saga of a kid who wants to be a ballet dancer.  What genius of writing only made brilliant by the fantastic cast in this film.  THIS is what makes that Banal C**P coming out of Hollywood so mundane.  Gary Lewis is fantastic as the coal miners father, the chain smoking ballet teacher is fantastic... and then there is Billy...WHERE did they FIND THIS KID!!  This kid is pure magic, how he acts and then to top it off dances in front of our eyes.This is a film not to be missed and one of the best of the year.Rating 8.5 out of 10",9,0,0,15 November 2000
Finding Nemo," gem mint!
","Marlin is an overprotective clown fish, worried about his young son Nemo who has an underdeveloped fin.  In an effort for Nemo to prove himself to his father he decides to venture out into the ocean against his dad's wishes away from school.  In the end, he is caught by a deep sea diver, and Marlin is determined to resuce and find his son against all impossible odds.Nemo ends up in a fish tank in a dentists office, where he is made an honorary member, meanwhile the rest of the film plays itself as Marlin travels through the great worlds of the ocean, and meets many characters and unique places in his search for his son.It seems like somewhat of a similar story that we see in children's animation, even a sidekick is provided.  However, the sidekick is a short term 'female' memory fish named Dory (voiced hillariously by Ellen DeGeneres), and the world that Marlin inhabits is filled with numerous funny characters in a giant ocean (in-therapy sharks, surfing California sea turtles, crazy pelicans, a giant whale [which provides the most hillarious dialogue in the film], a school bus driving manta ray, to all the aquarium creatures in the dentist office).  Also the film centers on a father son relationship and the overbearing protectivness of the father is explained very quickly and simply in the first 5 minutes of the film.  In fact Nemo's dissapearance is a transformation not just for Nemo as he has to learn how to survive and do things on his own, but also for his father who realises he has to venture out of his shell and get out and see the world without being afraid.But hands down the seagulls in the film, are the most ingenious bit in the entire film, those guys when on screen steal the show and are a riot fest!It seems Pixar has a formula that just can't be beat and gets better everytime.  The animation is superb, the screen is filled with things to look at it in the ocean, and the fish move through it so realisticaly through worlds of colourful coral, wrecked ships and rust, to the cuteness of the aquarium.  You could just sit back and watch the screen like a giant fish tank for hours.  The characters are also very charming, and the story does not get bogged down in sentimentality.Great film, and nearly perfect.  Plenty of things to see for adults and children alike.Rating 9 out of 10",10,0,0,17 June 2003
Chicken Run," Absolute, Complete, Total, perfection...
","From the creator of 'Wallace and Gromit' comes Chicken Run, a claymation movie about chickens trying to literaly fly the coop!  Ginger is a chicken who keeps getting caught, trying to escape from a chicken farm where the chickens get the axe if they stop laying eggs.  After several failed escapes, Ginger spots a rooster flying overhead, and it lands in their coop. His name is Rocky, a real 'Rhode Island red' as he puts it.  The site of Rocky in England has all the other chickens excited, they never have had anyone from America before in their coop.  But Ginger sees Rocky as the chickens ticket to freedom.  Ginger thinks they can escape by getting Rocky to teach everyone to fly (of course he can't, he's just an awol rooster escaping from the circus who is routinely shot out of a cannon).  But time is short, and the farmers wife has plans for a new machine where you insert chickens in one end, and out the other end comes out instant chicken pies!!This movie is hilarious, touching and absolutely perfect.  The film contains, Mac a scottish inventor, 2 vicious guard dogs, a clueless chicken named Bab, 2 shady mice (one sneaky the other dumb) who steal stuff and provide all the tools for the escape attempts from the farmers house, and Fowler an old English rooster who dis-trusts the 'American' as a Yank who knows nothing about discipline.  Fowler is probably the best character and my favourite in the film who waxes poeticaly about his days in the RAF, and is literaly the English version of Sam the Eagle on the Muppet Show. 'Always late to the war you Americans' he keeps saying.  This movie is also filled with lots of British and American bashing which is very funny, and it contains lots of parodies of other films such as 'Stalag 17', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Star Trek'.A perfect film for kids, and adults will love it.  Also the animation is INCREDIBLE.  It seems like this claymation movie could have taken 5+ years just to make!!.  This is absolutely one of the best films of the year.. and the only one so far that I have seen to come out this year to receive this rating..Rating 10 out of 10.If you did not like this film there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with you!",10,0,0,21 November 2000
Insomnia," GRIPPING!
","Taken from the film of the same name done in Norway, Nolan re does the tale setting of an LA cop set out to help solve a brutal murder of a teenage girl in a small remote town in Alaska.  In short, Nolan creates a killer noir thriller with Pacino working his craft to perfection.  The supporting cast is great too, and hallmarks of Nolan's cinematography and suspense show up much like it did in Memento, his amazing masterpiece from last year. Excellent film, look for Pacino for an oscar nomination or maybe even a win for best actor.  Nolan is an unbelievable director.Rating 9.5 out of 10",9,0,0,25 June 2002
X-Men," Enjoyable.
","Overal a statisfying movie.  They did a good job. Good points: Very real to life in making the characters exactly like their comic book counterparts. Wolverine was done so well that he stole the show and it was good that this movie focused on him. Fantastic looking and perfect casting for the characters Magneto, Xavier, Logan, Storm, Sabertooth and Cyclops. When Xavier (P Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan - God and Monsters) get together it is pure magic. Well done fight scenes that make the superheros show off their 'talents' excellently. Bad points: Xavier and Magneto feed off each other so brilliantly and I only wish the movie had more of them together on the screen. There could have been a little more on the human fear factor how everyone was scared of all the mutant business, at least they covered it in the movie. I did not like Ana Paquins acting ability as Rogue.  She started off well but seemed to go downhill as the film progressed. Overall the good more than outweighs the bad probably cause I was so taken with Logan (after all he is my fav X men character).  Is it true that apparantly 45 minutes of this film went on the CHOPPING BLOC!  I wonder what those scenes would have been like to the movie??  Maybe it could of had more dialogue and story explanation..  Me thinks though that they totaly went for the simple adventure-action-effects film.  Although that succeded I wonder what the other 45 minutes would have done. Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,19 July 2000
MASH," More comedy than horror of war
","Having been familiar with the TV series for years I never made the effort to see the 1970 movie.  Now having seen it I can say that it is a total scream.The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but is a good example of how a group of people try to survive amid the horror of war by essentially goofing off. The football scene was a riot I thought.Also the casting was perfect for the choice of actors involved.Not bad perhaps a little dated but still goodRating 7 out of 10",7,2,6,11 June 2000
Blade II," Picture Aliens II but without the fear and terror...
","Enter once again that realm of Hollywood action marketing...The sequel....In this case what is new?!?!?  Well they stuck pretty much with the same winning formula.  Blade is his old comic book self as well as his sidekick and nemisis parts, little on dialogue, big on action and looks.  Here director Guillermo De Toro (Mimic, Devil's Backbone) tries to see if he can put his crowning touch on this very likable character.In short this film was kind of odd, It started off kind of dissapointing, and then got better, and actually kind of did real good towards the end. It also had some GREAT scenes.  The basic plot involves a new breed of vampires (Reapers) that are stalking all of the planet including the ordinary vampires.  The high council asks Blade for his assistance in stopping the threat which is more powerful and more thirst ridden and could wipe away all life..  Henceforth Blade allies himself (cautiously with his small team of humans) AND with the 'Bloodpack' an elite vampire fighting force that was originaly set up to kill none other than the daywalker himself.My biggest problem with this film was that there wasn't alot that was new. That being said the first Blade was just a great neat thing, but watching this I couldn't help but have the feeling, yeah I've seen this already... been there done that.  However, with the addition of these new Reapers there was something more to get excited about.. only problem is they are introduced very slowly into the picture... just enough to tease the audience..Also the director has some great looking shots that are very eerie..  there is alot of suspense.. but not much dialogue but after all it is a comic book like script.  The action is first rate involving some great fight scenes that are 1 half Matrix like, 1 half standard bone crunching, and 1 half WWF!! (I think the director has this thing about wrestling moves)...  In the end it comes out very unique as the Reapers are no EASY kill..My biggest beef though was that the film wasn't scary..  unlike the first one.  Maybe they needed more women stalking guys and then ready to do the ole praying mantis thing (in the first film that just gave me the chills), here however, the film comes across as re-make of Aliens II with the Reapers (LOTS OF THEM) and the rag tag 'Bloodpack' is a knock off of the alien marine fighters but without any of the charisma, depth or likeableness. Picture Aliens II with the spaceship co-ridors and aliens replaced with improved vampires and sewer tunnels but without the chilling edge of your seat terror.That being said the film is what it is, a simple action film, with some good fight scenes, neat villain(s), and some good shots.  I just wish they could have made some of the supporting cast have more lines, and more insight into their characters.... some of them were kind of bland and they could have done WAY more with the script. But overall it was a good film.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,1,22 March 2002
Lost in Translation," gets it so right..
","About 8 years ago I lived in South Korea for a short time.  There were three things that Lost in Translation reminded me of so much right away.  One was the very first things I saw while walking down a huge metropolis in 1995 was a giant billboard of Shannon Doherty selling perfume.  Another was turning on the TV and finding a very absent and different looking McCauly Caulken selling computers.Lost In Translation's story of a down and out actor shooting a whiskey commercial in Tokyo, could have just been about the absurdity of the situation.  But the main thing it gets so right, is the sense of culture shock and the sense that the little problems in life cause you great pain living and staying in a place you don't understand.  More importantly it becomes that time you pull through as one of the biggest life changing events you will ever witness.  That would have to be the third thing this film reminded me of so much.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson are perfectly cast, as 2 Americans stuck in a world and time they don't quite understand.  Soffia Coppola's direction is superb, and is peppered with a great soundtrack setting the perfect mood. Then there are the little nuances that I could go on about forever that are done so well, the karaoke rooms, the temples, the hotel lounge, the endless concrete skylines, the overwhelming neon.. and so on..A film that stays with you, for a long time.Rating 9 out of 10",9,0,0,23 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Disappointment
","I never thought Lucas could make a film uninteresting but he now has.  AOTC is a major disappointment where there is virtually no cool scenes, no flair, a dumb trite love story (coupled with bad acting), and worse of all no new interesting characters that deliver any interest.Lucas has managed to only create an ordinary movie, there is nothing special about this film and in comparisons to other sci-fi movies it hardly stands out.  I sat in the theatre after about an hour and a half bored out of my skull, and wondering when this film would end..This bothered me since I love the Star Wars saga so much.  But you can't say much when it takes 2+ hours of nothing to wait for a neat 5 minute light saber duel, and the only eye candy is Portmans outfits which seem to change every 5 minutes.Lord what happened, where's the charisma?  where's the charm?  There was no force to be had in this film.Rating 5 out of 10",5,1,2,19 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Pretty good escapism
","Well I won't go into detail explaining the story.  It's pretty much one that we all know, good vs evil, a young man gets the weight of the world put on him a task he is not sure he can burden.  In this case its the role of Frodo played by Elijah Wood and its perfect cause in every movie I've ever seen him in this is how he acts as if he's always burdened down by something.The greatness in this film is not just in its sharp sets and good casting, McKellan has a fantastic screen presence as Gandalf, and I didn't think Liv Tyler could make an elf look so sexy.  It's not even the great worlds created of the overly green Shire and the lands of Middle Earth.  What is most impressive of this film is its picture of evil, a world (the darkside if you will) that is hell bent on strangling light and enslaving the good in humanity.The depiction of Orcs, and the evil armies in this film is one of sheer terror.  Particularly done amazingly well are the Ringwraiths (evil horsemen who are in search of the ring who are neither alive nor dead), who ride across the screen like some vision of the apocolypse.  While we all know this movie is a fantasy, director Peter Jackson's creation of these creatures is one of sure terror, he makes them out to be EXTREMELY frightening.With that being said, the film does have minor faults.  It suffers at times through the cute factor, and over camradare.  Cutesy music always pops up when the hobbits are together, or old friends meet after a long absence. Also they seemed to make the actors use Irish accents which some tend to loose half way through the picture.  It's kind of cheesy, but once the adventure is set off and the party is on foot, there is no holding back to the joy that awaits on screen filled with evil armies, an ingenious looking cave troll, and a magical demonic mythical beast, and some well done battle scenes.An enjoyable film for what it is.Rating 7 3/4 out of 10.",8,0,0,20 December 2001
Cast Away," If it weren't for Hanks, this film would have drowned.
","Tom Hanks gives a VERY good performance in this film and I was never bored. The cinematography of the island, and the shots at end (which are symoblic to the story) are great and Hanks' acting talent is unreal.  I don't know how he does it, here's a guy who was basicaly a stand up comedian and a television actor, until Big hit the screen and then he ended up in great roles in films like Phillidelphia and Forest Gump.  He is the key in this film, if they got some other actor that didn't work this film would have been terrible.This being said, the film has constant 'What would you do scenarios?', throughout the entire movie, and I am not always crazy about that.  The biggest flaw I think with this film is that the trailer GIVES away the fact that Hanks gets off the island, in short the trailer TELLS you the entire movie.  This is stupid, and the director said he did this deliberatly. Second...  Hanks' return to the real world I think is VERY unrealistic and RUSHED through and perhaps even somewhat unnecessary. Basicaly he ends up back and there is literally a short scene where he is having a welcoming party with his office colleagues.  They all come up to him and say things like 'Well we see you back at the office tomorrow regarding meeting ...',  'Hey how about we shoot a round of golf, I am teeing off tommorow at 8', no no no... How about...'Let's spend 1 year in psychotherapy, to figure out how to live again after not interacting with humans for 4+ years' This would be more the norm... and more realistic.
***POSSIBLE SPOILER DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE FILM ***And thirdly, the meeting with the 'other husband' was done VERY badly, meaning it wasn't acted out or handled well.  That's my take.
*** END SPOILER ***This being said it is NOT a perfect film, it is NOT deserving of Best Picture, it is NOT deserving of Hanks WINNING Best Actor, but it does deserve a nomination but I don't think he should win not because his performance is bad, but because I think that other actors in films I have seen this year did better.  Hanks did a fantastic job.This movie I think is more of a spiritual, psychological awakening movie, than a tearjerking sappy love story film.  Even with all this I did enjoy the film, and was never bored through it's 2 1/2+ hour run time.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,9 January 2001
Lilo & Stitch," Typical Disney, but if it aint broke don't fix it..
","This has to be one of the more simple straight forward animation movies I have seen in recent years.  Gone is CGI, 3D backgrounds or the latest tricks.  In an odd way, it seems refreshing.  Put that to boot with a charming story, well voiced characters, and a lead that you can't help but enjoy and you have a winner.Lilo & Stitch is about a space alien that was an experiment gone wrong, that ends up escaping and crashing to planet earth (Hawaii specifically).  A ragtag of 2 aliens are out to capture the creature (dubbed experiment 622), but run into a road block when a lonley misfit girl named Lilo adopts the creature when it pretends to masquerade as a dog in an animal shelter.  She names the creature Stitch and tries to teach the 'thing' about the love of family, which is difficult since Stitch is programmed to be nothing but a destructive wreck.Stitch is absolutely HYSTERICAL..  Take a blue Koala figure with 4 arms that crawls like a bug, and has a temperment like the Tasmanian Devil and speaks like Donald Duck on hyperdrive..  Stitch is a laugh a minute, (the first scene when Lilo brings Stitch home, and he jams his hind legs into his mouth and rolls into a ball, had my dying on the floor..)The story continues and concludes with standard Disney fare, (the good guys win, everyone goes home happy), but there is certainly more than enough entertainment for adults in this film as well as for kids.I wish I had Stitch when I was a kid...Rating 8 out of 10",8,2,2,30 June 2002
American Psycho," U care for no one in this film, and that's the idea
","Bale plays 'Patrick Bateman', an upbeat all-with-it corporate business man working in Wall Street in the mid late 80's.  Being the son of the companies owner, he is pretty much in a cushy position, high paid, surrounded by other yuppies, goes to upscale restaurants, spends time in his high scale Manhattan apartments, and shmoozes with all his other same yuppie friends.  The only difference between him and all the others, is that Patrick is a serial killer.There's one thing I can say about villains in movies, we all secretly want them to win.  Bale in the yuppie peak of the 80's is surrounded by fakes, and jerkoffs, and other sick kind, so Bale fits right in.  Since he is a serial killer, he has no emotions NONE, and he blends in so easily with all his normal yuppie compatriots.  This is what makes this film unique, in that it's more of a statement on what the era was like than on Bale's horrible obsessions.Bale's acting is amazing in this role, playing such a complicated character. The murder scenes are filled with such tension, and the idea of chopping someone up into pieces whiles doing a soliloquy of why Huey Lewis's songs and music is so influential (which Bale's does as he usual waxes nostagicaly about 80's music while he's about to pounce on his victims) was just unreal.Interesting twist in the end as well.  However, there is only one interesting character in this film and everyone else is pretty plastic and uninteresting.  But I suppose that's the idea, thus making us feel no sympathy for any of these yuppie scums.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,14 October 2000
Spider-Man," Swing baby swing!
","Sam Raimi has created one enjoyable ride.  It seems without question after watching Spider-man that Raimi is a comic book fan.  This film litteraly plays out like the so many paneled stories in the Spiderman series, and even the shots look like art work taken from many of the books.  A particular shot of Spider-man getting hit with a grenade seems like a drawing lifted from the artists pages.The casting is quite good.  Maguire who is usualy bad as a leading man excels here cause Peter Parker is a young kid who is cocky yet very unsure about the weight and burden now put on him with his new superpowers.  This forces Maguire to take the role of a person who doesn't have a lot of confidence but must do what is right, and it suits him very well.  Dunst is fine as Mary Jane, and who can't like Dafoe as the Green Goblin.Also while I knew the story of Spiderman's origin, Raimi gives the audience plenty of suspense in telling the already familiar story.  Some of the acting between Mary Jane and Parker is a bit contrived, maybe sometimes even a little long winded, but at least they have a chemistry on screen.  It also looks like they created the most memorable on screen kiss this year so far...Also the swinging special effects look neat, can't say I've seen anything like it before and it's very refreshing.  But what would be even more refreshing would have been to have more J Jonah JAMESON!!!  Man that actor was a scream!!!  If anything he captured the spirit of this film, 'dumb fun'.Rating 7.5 out of 10",7,0,0,25 May 2002
Spirited Away," unbelievable masterpiece!!
","I ran and took the metro for about 45 minutes way across state lines. Living in Northern Virginia, this show was playing in only 2 theatres in the DC metro area (composed of DC, VA and MD). I had to head to the Mezza Galeria in Friendship Heights way out on the edge of NorthWest DC on the border with Maryland. Basically it is a trip that I will never forget and I will now always associate that area with the greatness of witnessing this masterpiece.. This film has already grossed over 200 million dollars and won major awards at film festivals, all without even being released in North America. Until now....Basically put here it is (not giving any info away that would be VERY wrong). Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away), is a trip about a 10 year old girl who enters a magical spirit land with her parents who end up imprisoned. It is up to 10 year old Chihiro to find the strength inside to survive and perhaps rescue her parents.But this film isn't about that plot, it is about the imagination of youth, the magic and characters who exist in this world, and about growing up and gaining courage.I'll say this. I am having a really REALLY hard time putting the emotions I felt after witnessing this masterpiece on the screen. The scenes are masterfull, the animation is incredible, the backgrounds are pieces of art, there are things that happen in great stillness, and in great motion that take your breath away. It is very funny, and charming. However what separates this film from say Miyazaki's last recent work Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is that this film is more universal for all ages and more imaginative, incredibly so on the later. Where Mononoke was more political and intriguing and ingenious this film is something every person can relate to including 7 year olds. As one earlier minor review I read said, 'Kids will like it, parents will love it even more'. I can't begin to describe my jaw gaping mouth that stood there hanging almost every 5 minutes at what I was witnessing.. I could spend hours describing the myriad of characters in detail, but I would be writing to the end of time....There is a scene in this film that just highlights everything that is grand about this movie. Chihiro takes a train ride with 3 spirit characters all very different and unique in their looks and personality. The purpose of the ride is simply just to go from A to B. Its not important for the story, it does not advance the plot on the grand scale of things. It is just something that is simply there to look at.This scene had me in tears. Not because it looks sad, or the characters are tragic, or because the story at this point is so gut-wrenching (think of the opera music scene in Graveyard of The fireflies). It just pulls the emotion out of you because it is just so mesmerizing and beautiful to watch.This film which has just been released in North America, looks to be in limited release so far. I'll put it to you this way. I am not a major fan of Japanese anime, but I have seen a small handful of good ones. I was speaking with people after the show, and I ran into one guy who as he puts it, has seen SEVERAL anime movies. He said this is the best one he has EVER SEEN. Period.This film is going to be HUGE.. It just may get the North American public addicted to Japanese anime, an art form that has been nothing more in the eyes of America as an overly grotesque cartoonish immature art-form, that seems to be overtly sexualized, and overrun with violence and nonsensical stories. This film will not just break that barrier, it will be a tidal wave of movie history crashing through it with tsunami punch! If it DOES NOT... then anime does not even deserved to be shown in this country to be appreciated. I can't see this film not being a huge buzz within the next few days. The audience I was with which was very varied kids and adults of all ages, were entranced and applauded massively when this film was over in celebration.I can only think of one film I have seen that is of this level and would rank now as a tie after seeing this film for best film of the year (that would be Monsoon Wedding). A very different film obviously which can't be compared to this.This isn't just a great animated film. This isn't just a great Japanese film. This isn't just a great award winning film. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.Rating 10 out of 10",10,3,6,20 September 2002
Tigerland," The perfect movie not about war, but being in 'the army'
","Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp.  We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general..  Great acting, and very memorable.  Also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam.  Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle.  The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.Fantastic film.  Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.Rating 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,6 May 2001
Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan is a genius
","Finally Hollywood has figured out that you don't take a talent like Nolan and mess with his creations. Nolan has given the only serious looking Batman comic adaptation I can think off. Christian Bale isn't just a man in a costume, he is literally put into a metamorphosis. The screenwriters have connected what matters most and that is the transformation from a naive rich kid, to man who conquers his own demons.Secondly this film looks so much like the panels of a DC comic book, that the similarities are unreal. Bale as a young man looks so much younger than the reserved changed Wayne even on film, although Bale of course never ages in the picture. The shots of the death of Wayne's parents are so much like the comics that I was transported to reading them again.Nolan has a great touch for directing darkness (not just physical but mood as well), and playing with shadows. This Batman, we hardly see, and foes drop around like flies before we the audience can figure out what is going on.Dr. Krane, is also brilliantly cast as a sinewy doctor that looks like he will waste away at any moment.Not quite the perfection of Memento or Insomnia, but it's good enough for me.8 out of 10",8,0,2,20 June 2005
The Pianist," Great start, slow pacing middle, triumphant end
","One of the best picture nominees this year about the true life of a Jewish Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who somehow in the madness of W.W.II managed to elude the death camps.  Yes it is a holocaust film, albeit it does not take place there, but in the ghettos of Warsaw where over 300,000 jews were rounded up and confined to live in a small segregated area of the city in absolute squalor.  I've always said that good films are never depressing, but this one does get there.  And how can it not sometimes. Towards the middle of the film when the audience is aware of the impending doom, the characters still cling on to hope of radio contacts that the allies are coming to save them (not knowing of course they will fail), and the idea that all the moving is temporary..  This is the only slow part of the film, and we're stuck in some powerful yet obligatory scenes,  soldiers whipping and torturing jews, starvation, plagues, death marches, random on the spot executions,  jews turning on each other in the ghetto just to survive, some pretty hellish stuff.  But Polanski manages to bring together a great cast (nazis and jews alike both good and bad) that bring the film to its peak as Szpilman at one point manages to escape and live with the resistance who will protect him.  But life is not easy, and a crushingly good scene involves Szpliman hiding out in an apartment by himself, running out of food and then we watch helplessly as he breaks several dishes accidentally while rummaging through the cupboards and gives himself away to his German neighbors.Thinking of how it must have been to live in that era and not be found out, must have been just pure hell.  And it is when these moments when we know that just the slightest exposure of Szpilman's talents and presence will get him killed in an instant, that the film exceeds tremendously.  While the middle slows down, the last 1/2 hour is a cinematic triumph and for the most part turns the murderous German forces on its head (I won't give the scenes away).  Throw in a cinematographic great look at bombed out Warsaw, and you have some more to entertain you.Remember... War is madness..Pretty good filmRating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,15 February 2003
The Transporter," Like the French setting, true ripe camembert
","Enter Jason Stratham, a guy who has certainly kicked in some steroids and new muscle entering the new found territory of 'the action hero'.  Certainly along stretch from his roles in Snatch, and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels.  Jason is the 'Transporter' and ex military guy living in France who delivers stuff for 'dubious clientele' so long as they follow his rules. However, the transporter screws up by breaking the rules by opening a package and getting involved when he ends up transporting a Chinese woman to someone.At this point you want to know where the story is suppose to go, but what really happens is it goes nowhere.  Sure it's an action film, with a great car chase and some great unique fight sequences.  But at some point the people making this tried to make the story solve itself within 5 minutes in an office room as they start introducing more bad guys, and try to write up a hasty conclusion.From this point on you can't even like the film for its stupidness.  It doesn't even get to maintain some degree of B movie camp.  Worse is that the acting when needed particualry between Straham and You Qi is so chessy and SOOOOOOOO bad it is cringe inducing to listen to.  Like the great French setting this movie reaked of over ripe camembert.It's too bad cause Stratham is definitly passible as an action hero, and the oil slick fight scene is quite ingenious.  But the HORRIBLY bad acting, horrible dramatic moments, and lack of any comedic fun make this film DEATHLY DULL.  There are also some unbelievable continuity errors the most obvious being that one of the rules for the transporter is that nobody knows his name, but 1/2 way through the film at one point, You Qi is calling him Frank for no reason or explanation.  Sure an action film can be void of these things sometimes, but at some point the film has to be a fun ride. This one sure is not.Rating 4 out of 10",4,6,11,14 October 2002
City of God," CRUSHINGLY good!!!!
","This film is breathtaking, yet it does get slow in a few places. Nevertheless, it is a film that is incredibly eye opening for this country of Brasil and its culture of violence in the favelas (slums).It's also a gripping tale show casing one young boys desire to somehow get out of the madness, where if anything life is cheap.  The fact that it is based on a true story (what parts those are, I am not certain) is even more chilling, particularly the end credits in which a real tv interview with a gang leader was taken word for word in the film.Probably the greatest triumph of the film is its ability to show that violence is cyclical and that in a culture where only guns and death exists there is almost no escape no matter how moral you might be, or try to do what is right.  An amazing picture.Rating 9 out of 10",9,0,2,25 January 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This is the BEST FILM I have ever seen since renting Akira Kurowsawa's Seven Samurai 5 years ago.
","I went in to see this film with mixed emotions.  I had been highly anticipating it for months, like no other film in living memory that I can think of. I felt that all the praise and words that people told me of it would leave me disappointed in the film.  Rumors abounded that it would not play in my city, it was going to have a limited running (luckily all untrue).   It just made me want to see this film even more.  It's as if I was expecting too much from the film and it wouldn't deliver.  Would my expectations be to high?  On the other hand I felt that it had to be phenomenal, I LOVE martial arts films, I LOVE foreign films, and I have a special heart for Asian themes in cinema.  How could I not like it ?? With these conflicting thoughts I sat down and after the full movies runtime I could think of only one thing.Every high comment made by either well know critics, or lesser known ones, or just from people on the street who had the opportunity to see it before I did are all right.  This movie can never be duplicated.  It is PURE MAGIC!THIS IS THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE RENTING AKIRA KUROWSAWA'S 'SEVEN SAMURAI' over 5 years ago.The film follows the lives of several Wudan warriors, who besides possessing fantastic marshall arts skill can defy the lives of gravity as they battle in stunning choreography.  Chow Yun Fat plays Li Mu Bai, a warrior who is giving up his way of life to settle down.  In doing so he asks a former Wudan warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to meet with him as he decides to give up his sword 'The Green Destiny' as a gift to a local governor.  We soon learn the 2 warriors have an unspoken special bond, yet neither of them will admit it since their roaming warrior lives have always kept them distant.  Within the Governors compound resides Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) a young woman on the verge of getting married.  She is entranced by the lifestyle of Yu Shu, a woman who picks her own destiny, goes on adventure, and is her own boss.  In contrast Jen, really bonds with Yu calling her 'older sister' and secretly wants to live the life of a warrior.  The idea of giving up a life to support a husband instead of living on her own seems a death sentence. But a disturbing thing happens.  Without giving away too much of the plot, after presenting the sword to the governor, it is mysteriously stolen by another unknown Wudan warrior!!  The story then revolves around finding the sword, wild adventures, and the outcomes of the characters backgrounds in the story.First off on a martial arts level it is stunning.  Killer fight scenes, brilliantly choreographed and intense.  On top of this the films heroes and focus is on the women warriors and has to be the only film I have seen where the story is carried by female heroes.  Ang Lee's direction then goes into overdrive as he takes the actors (NOT THE STUNTMEN!) and suspends them on wires to make them do amazing things such as skip across vast stretches of water, climb walls and rooftops, and fight in a stunning bamboo forest. And like I said, 90% of it is done by the women.I fell in love with these women (particularly Ziyi) after seeing this film.Combined with these fights scenes are STUNNING shots of cinematography. Huge ancient cities, snow cragged cliffs,  parched sun burnt Western Tibetan deserts,  lanterned light night courtyards, giant waterfalls, and colourful costumes are all in abundance.  And the shots of the bamboo forest fight scenes are spectacular.Now this film is NOT all martial arts.  It has a great compelling epic story.  The acting is impeccable from the stern Chow Yun Fat who steals every scene he is in, to the fiesty young Ziyi Zhang who is incredible! But the brilliance is in the story, that reads like the greatest adventure you have ever heard of.  With the great fighting are characters who are betrayed, humorous consequences (some that are VERY FUNNY you'll never think twice about loosing your comb), love and eloquent romance, memorable scenes characters and lines, and a story that means achieving your destiny that you so desire in a land that wants you to conform.Such perfection will NEVER be duplicated ever.  I'd hate to say things you hear all the time but I will say them now anyway cause they are true.If you can only see ONE film this year, see 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. I have see a lot of the great films of 2000 (Yes there were good films this year!) and this one is the best (even though I picked Chicken Run, Almost Famous, and High Fidelity).Take everyone you know, all your family, and take all those other people you know who say either:I hate subtitled filmsI hate foreign filmsI hate martial arts filmsI hate Asian filmsand change their life.Rating 10+ out of 10.PS - This is a MUST see 'In the theatre' film.  It will not have the same brilliance if you decide to wait for the DVD or video.",10,0,0,14 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well done...
","Once again we are brought to the realm of middle earth as the fellowship is out to to complete its mission.  Sequels are always a double edged sword, they either maintain our interest in the characters we were introduced to in the past, or they seem to re-hash the same thing with little interest. Luckily for us in Tolkiens world, there are still more interesting stories to tell, new people(creatures) to meet, and worlds to explore.I have never been interested in reading the books, but I will have to admit after seeing the 2nd film that it has really sparked my interest.  2 Towers is a monumental achievement in film-making.  Director Peter Jackson manages to create an amazing world out of this novel, and choreograph some amazing battle sequences.  The comparisons to Kurosawa's 'Ran' are well justified, but Jackson's vision here is much different and the end result is spectacular.Much like I had noticed in the first film, what seems to be the key to making this film a winner is how it describes the battle inside ourselves basicaly between light and darkness.  I also found more things and issues that this movie brought up than the first such as the dilema between Sam and Frodo over Smeagle which hinted at the arguments for and against capital punishment, then there are things about pacifism, and envriomentalism to some extent, and of course the pure corruption of power.  So I got even more out of it than the first.Certainly one of the best films of the yearRating 9 out of 10",9,0,0,22 December 2002
Pi," Great stuff!
","Filmed in grainy black and white, we enter the world of recluse mathematician Max Cohen (Sean Gullete) who is working for a brokerage firm. Max is hired to find a way to predict the stock market.  What's his theory???  All life in the universe is subjected to patterns, and that nothing is just random but based on a series of  formulas, calculations, patterns, and that if this is true the market has one.  However, the closer Max gets to finding answers, the more insane and mad he seems to be getting. An older mentor warns him that his obsession will kill him, but it looks like that might not be the only thing.  Max ends up getting contacted by a Jewish Kabbalah sect who is trying to decode the Torah and can't help but see the similarities to his findings with that of their higher teachings. Also another brokerage firm is set on capturing his formula for their own greedy interests.  Finally it seems the apex has hit when Max discovers that the pattern involves something more powerful and higher than he can imagine, and it may be an answer that could be bigger than life itself.A low budget GREAT concept and PERFECTLY acted little film that will leave the viewer guessing of its outcome.  Tense action a good simple thrill ride. Get a good story, good actors, and a good script and you can't fail no matter what the budget.Rating 8 out of 10",8,66,103,15 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," This is (for a Lynch film) very straight forward, and one of the best of the year
","For a David Lynch film (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks TV Series) this is a pretty simple story.  Most people are getting caught up in the 'what the?, and the huh?' factor when in reality it is pretty straight forward.  I will not give the story away due to spoiling the film, only saying that half of the film is a dream sequence [mocking a cliched hollywood story], the rest afterwards takes place kind of in flashbacks explaining everything (an NO it is not difficult to figure out).  The only other thing I can say is that it also portrays the idea of the dark side of Hollywood in the way actors are abused and repeatedly humiliated in the 'business'.  This is without question one of the best films of the year.I can only say that this film had me glued to my seat.  The lead actresses were so perfect and accompanied by a great soundtrack which set the perfect tone.  Lynch goes for a very complete film noir with dark rooms, shadows, even some 40's hairstyles and even the shots outside in the daylight seem mysterious and eerie.  Complemented by Lynch's dark humour, this film also has many funny moments, and some of the most memorable bizarre characters (following up on the Twin Peaks like-ness) I've ever seen on screen.This is definatly the year for film noir since 2 of the best films this year are this one and Memento.  For those who are not 'getting it' it's kind of unfortunate and they are probably reading too much into it particularly the first half.  If you REALLY want to be confused go see Eraserhead (which this movie borrows alot from in style).Great scenes, Great mood, Great look, Great feel, Great casting, Great concept.  I had a blast with this film but others may not due to Lynch's qwerkyness.  Some like it, some don't I myself have never been a huge fan of Lynch, but when I think back to how much I liked Eraserhead, Wild At Heart, The Straight Story, and now this film, I think I will seek him out more often (with the exception of Dune).  One of the best films of the year.Rating 9 out of 10",9,2,3,14 October 2001

Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun in spite of itself
","I haven't seen a summer popcorn flick in ages, let alone written a review of one in some time. However, if an excuse to see a gun totting raccoon with a rag tag bunch of misfits doesn't get me interested, then I'll consider this a lifetime opportunity missed.Guardians of the Galaxy at first seems to start off like any sci-fi block bluster but quickly separates itself from the rest of the pack upon first viewing. The hero (Peter Quill) is a goofy, smart ass, unintentionally funny character as he sets on collecting an artifact for ransom. In the end, his goods are stripped and a bizarre bunch of misfits just like him set to get it back. The artifact's 'the orb' importance becomes more clear, as we learn if it falls into the wrong hands it can unleash unparalleled destruction on the planets and galaxies.Films like this suggest for you to suspend your disbelief, the bad guys never shoot straight, the heroes dodge all the bullets, the evil guys never time their powers right. We never take these things seriously, and more so the film takes these to more moronic highs. A walking plant and raccoon make an interesting pair, spitting off dialogue that isn't cliché. Quill has an affection for cheesy music, and it's discussion and genre in significant moments amongst other characters who just want to save the world, makes much for much moronic viewing. After all the aliens have no idea of this foreign concept that makes no sense to them. The female character is all green, giving a nod almost to Star Trek and an interest of Captain Kirk that Quill must conquest, but takes a much more realistic turn.Aside from the fact that a brute character doesn't understand the concept of metaphors, the filmmakers have also bathed this picture in a fascinating light. Giant reams of purple blue and green bathe the screen with interstellar light, creating a universe that doesn't look like anything we have seen before on screen. Even the characters and aliens look like... aliens, with the exception that some are still bi-pedal, many skin tones are represented, never mind a blue bounty hunter who kidnapped Quill as boy, seems to wield the most dangerous knitting needle known to man. His presence and somewhat Texas?Alabama accent (which adds to even bigger irony) seem just the perfect fit as the absurdity grows larger when Quill and him cross paths. Each opportunity is an excuse for him to remind Quill he's lucky he wasn't eaten alive by him and his henchmen when he was first captured.In reality the film mocks itself and its own ideas for telling us that this is all ridiculous and just dumb fun so come along for the ride. The whole thing knows it's absurd, and it's dialed up to 11 by the film-makers giving us a thrill that is the perfect escape for summer.It's not brilliant or amazing, it's quite stupid, but if it was perfect it would ironically be a heck of a lot less interesting and enjoyable. It's the self mockery and stupidity that makes the film work ingeniously. If anything it's the perfect movie to not take things seriously, and bathe yourself in the wild characters and colors on screen. In the end it's a great interstellar trip and escape unlike any you have been on before, and that's really all it needs to be.",8,4,9,5 August 2014
Jerry Maguire," Enjoyable.
","You know, I have only liked Tom Cruise in one film role (that of his portrayl of the superstud in Magnolia).  Here Cruise seems to be the perfect choice to play a sports agent out on the hussle with no scruples.  Until one day he feels the enormous guilt and horror of his actions.Tom is perfect in this role, and Cuba steals the show being the loud mouth football player as his client that wants the fame he thinks he so richly deserves.Lots of fun, and enjoyable as the 2 actors perfectly bounce off each other in funny, touching ways.Rating 7 out of 10",7,4,9,8 October 2000

After Weigand is fired from his high position in the company he later meets up with Lowell to blow the roof off of Big Tobacco.Russel Crowe plays Weigand to PARANOID Perfection.  You get a real sense of how far outreaching the tobacco companies have by watching this film, as Weigand who's atempts to tell the truth, has people following him, threatning his family, and eventualy even threatned to be sent to jail.  It's also a great portayal of how the media machine works to get a story out amongst competing news interests.Very Good FilmRating 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,24 April 2000
The Red Violin," Music is all that matters..
","This is a story about a spectacular violin that was made long ago.  The story starts off as a master craftsman in Italy looses his wife and newborn during an awful birthing.  As a result hey uses the blood of his dead wife as a varnish for the instrument and it transforms all who come across this violin into pure fanatics as it seems the soul of the dead wife inhabits the instrument and makes music like the heavens.  There are 5 stories as the violin is handed down, traveled through countries from France, Germany, China, and then modern day North America.  The climax of the film towards the end of the story involves an auction house that has the violin in which several parties are all trying to get it.This was a great film and even though it dragged at times it truly shows what music can do to ones soul.  Relationships broken, hopes lost, joy found all through music as it transcends history.  Although some parts were a bit lengthy the music score keeps you sitting tight and pleased.  There are also some humorous moments for the film, certainly lead violinists all have a chip on their shoulder.  But one thing is for certain, music is all unifiying, it breaks down walls, politics, hate, greed, and is all encompasing and all it takes is one little instrument.Rating 8 out of 10",8,0,1,23 March 2001
Detroit Rock City," Fun concert adventure
","Being that the story is about kids who want to go to see their favourite band, you know that in the end they will somehow get to see the show.  It's a question if you enjoy the ride to get there.  And I did.Although being a teen comedy (which always means an obligatory puke scene), and some physical comedy which was a little distracting, this film was just fun.  The film works cause everyone can think back to the days in high school when you worshiped a band, played their music, and would DIE to see them play live, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.  It also captures the era perfectly with the music, cars, good soundtrack, and the pot shots at of course... disco (Did you see those SHOES the disco chicks were wearing??).  And of course it was VERY funny in places (I thought my jam sessions were bad...).Also the film had me guessing as to what would happen, sometimes I thought it was predictable, then it switched gears and surprised me, particularly the ending which was so perfectly sweet!!  Perfect music high school camradare done wonderfully.  Even though I am not a fan of KISS, everyone can think back to the time when your fav band was your TRUE means of salvation.Rating 7 out of 10.",7,36,42,20 January 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Fun, not totally original but somewhat, but definatly BRITISH!
","A good film which is very stylish, taking ideas used in other films like 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', and 'Mean Streets'.  Therefore on that level of originality it is not that original.BUT the characters and the settings and the crazy story line is totally original and I applaud it greatly.  Sometimes I think the movie tried to hard to be off kilter (one to many surprises and jumps), but it is still enjoyable and totaly English!This movie confirms my suspicions of what I always felt.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Potter ROCKS!!
","I am a movie nut.  I see a lot of stuff.  One thing I don't do though is read often.  I use to when I was younger, but I find that at my age works of the printed word rarely raise my interest.  Then one day, someone gave me a Potter book, and I was hooked instantly on the characters and the imagination of JK Rowling's world.  I have read all 4.With that being said I was very anxious, and VERY concerned to see the first adaptation of Rowling's first novel.  I wondered if they would trash it's world, commercialise it, trivialise it, or worse somehow Americanize it in an attempt to appeal to US audiences. Luckily none of these things have happened there is no sacharine just pure sweet joy.Chris Columbus has done a marvelous job in directing this film.  First off, the movie just looks amazing.  The 'other world' beyond the muggles is so richly detailed, every corner alley, every costumed character, every piece of wooden furniture, the shining red train of platform 9 and 3/4's, even the etching of chiseled emblems, team scarves its all there in abundance.Then you have the young actors.  Radcliffe as the perfect Potter, Emma Watson in her bookish teacher pet charm as Hermione,  Tom Felton as the slick haired Draco Malfoy Potter's nemesis, and the best Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly Potter's sidekick and best chum who gets all the best lines and steals the show with his facial expressions alone.Even at 2 1/2 hours long I didn't want this film to end.  Sure things have been kept out from the book which is far richer, but if they included everything I am sure the film would have went on for 4 hours straight.  What is important is that key scenes were kept that added to the plot of future films for those uninitiated with the story.  Also those scenes that are included are just enjoyable, the Quidditch MATCH!!!, Potter in the wand shop, the escaping snake, Fluffy the dog, the flying keys... its all as I had imagined it.Then you have a cast of minor players which I wish could have more screen time,  Father Dursley's bumbling, Hagrid's stern but dumbness persona, and then the best Alan Rickman as the devious professor Snape, who draws out his lines with such skill it makes your skin crawl.No the movie is not perfect it couldn't have everything, and I do think that those who have not read the book would be somewhat confused by its story as well.  But all in all this movie is perfect for fans, adults, kids, and that small 1% of people who have yet to be initiated in the world of Hogwarts.Bring on book 5 and Chamber of Secrets to film I can't wait.Rating 8 out of 10",8,0,0,21 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Crafty
","There has to be something to be said about crafting an action film (and a sequel might I add), with some thought.  Luckily Matrix Reloaded fills that void with a well thought up script, and a neat idea translated into a simple good action film.Matrix Re-Loaded works, because it uses some simple action cliches but doesn't rely on the action to drive the story, it is the intriguing concept of 'the matrix' and its inhabitants that make the film enjoyable.  But even more so the story gives us an opportunity to witness things that we can deem plausable and believable in an action film.  These concepts might I add are done very well like dodging bullets, scary villans, realistic fights, and a GREAT car freeway chase.Nobody is a real thespian in the film, but it doesn't matter, since the most interesting thing is 'the matrix' itself.  What a great concept this film series is turning out to be.Rating 8 out of 10",8,0,0,15 May 2003
Mystic River," Overhyped - Incredibly uneven
","Clint Eastwoods latest directoral film 'Mystic River', explains exactly why I can never go see one of his directed films ever again.It has great acting, a good cast, a wonderful setting, much like his other films.  But the problem is always the connection with the characters in the story.  At many times this film doesn't know what it wants to be, at one point it becomes a story of innocence lost, then it becomes a crime thriller, but it tries to be both at the same time never giving the audience enough time to breath and catch up.Characters life stories are crammed in with little time to develop leaving the viewer assaulted and hopelessly confused if they miss something.  A smarmy cliche ending doesn't help either, and the relationship Bacon has with his ex seems only there just so the director can force some sympathy on his character it is WAY too obvious.This film is incredibly uneven even with the very solid performances by Penn, Linney, Harden, Fishburne, Bacon and Robbins.  But many times they're just going through the motions and not connecting with the audience.  This film looks like one of those adapted to film novel type films where they tried to cram everything from the book in but tried to do it in a span of 30 minutes.I should have known this after seeing Unforgiven, cause it was the exact same feeling I had when I walked out of that picture.  Implausable characters never connecting with the story.OverhypedRating 5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,22 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Beautifully done
","Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love.  The Insider, L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize.  The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless.  Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has.  For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point, when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing.  This is the performance that I know he is capable of, complicated, passionate and serious, none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair, every twitch, eyes darting, and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor.  Nash is a recluse, almost an autistic savant, we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library.  He is seriously gifted, but a social misfit.  Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 1/2 of heart.Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life.  Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad, or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film.  She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help.  But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering, watching from a distance, trying to understand.  Here we have a film that literaly puts us in the mind of the sufferer, as to what it is to live with such a debilitating illness.  We get Nash's sense of accomplishment, but also his demons and paranoia.  And probably the most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isn't something that gets cured, the people have to live with it, and it never goes away.Also Crowe and Connely age in this film wonderfuly, so many films try to age actors/actresses in makeup and it doesn't work, but here it is done flawlessly..Minor faults in the film deal with that some of the supporting characters are reduced to props and people we don't know, and at one point the film bogs slightly when Nash is trying to return to Princeton to study.  But these points are minor since the performances of the main characters are so well done, and the stories focus is on them to begin with.Crowe will probably get the best actor for this.  Great film.Rating 8 out of 10.",8,33,54,11 January 2002
Ice Age," Mildly Entertaining
","Keeping up with the standard Disney fair, heartstrings are pulled, comic side kicks abound, and funny looking computer animated characters are created once again.. Is it any good?  Well It seems to be fairly good for kids and adults alike..Take a tree sloth, a wooly mammoth, and a sabertooth tiger who end up adopting a child in hopes to return it to some humans tribe.  While the animation looks great and some of the voices are a perfect match (particularly Ray Romano as the Mammoth), there is still a lot of formulaic plotting meant to sheepishly tug at your heartstrings..  The animation is quite good, particularly a running repeating montage involving a squirrel like character and his desire to crack an acorn throughout the film.  There are also some pot shot humour that is clearly aimed at kids, (gags involving doo doo) and adults alike (We have to be the most screwed up herd in history)..So I guess all in all it turns out ok, but not a good picture, yet not a bad one either Rating 6.5 out of 10",7,2,2,16 March 2002
Downfall," Stunning!!!
","This was one of the most brilliant war films I have ever seen in my life. The description and portrayals of the Reich are one of absolute shocking madness, and what a performance by Bruno Ganz. It could be so easy to make a mockery, or comical, or over the top performance, but no. When you see Ganz up on screen you are literally staring into madness, you really think it's 'him'.Amazingly executed, wonderfuly crafted, insanely scripted by the demons that only 'der Fhurer' could provide, der Untergang is a flat out MASTERPIECE.Nobody in this film is sympathetic, that is beyond obvious. The greatest thing this film shows (ecspecially those people who are it's detractors) how his followers so blindly led him and were gutless to stop anything, so much so that when Magda murders her 6 children it becomes the most powerful scene on film I have witnessed in many years.A MUST SEE!!",10,4,9,22 March 2005
Stalag 17," At ease.... At ease...
","For a movie that is set in a German prisoner of war camp during WWII, I had a hard time believing it's well.... realism.I realize that the idea of creating a comedy with characters who make fun out of there situation in a POW camp just felt like the wrong start. With this in mind though, the basic plot about a snitch in their base was good and I did like the characters and I realise if anything its just a story and not a true account of German war treatment of allied prisoners.  But it was hard to get past.I did like trying to figure out who the snitch was but other than this and the interesting characters, I thought the movie was ... OK.6 out of 10..",6,3,6,28 January 2000
Platoon," Expecting more, but was good
","When this film came out in 86/87 there was so much buzz about it.  Now after FINALLY seeing this film in my adult hood, I can say that the film is good but not the masterpiece I remember people saying it is..The film is good and has great performances.  It shows war as it truly is 'Senseless'.  The soldiers walk around through filth and muck, shoot at shadows, disrespect each other, get killed and dream of getting out.  Its as if there is no method to their madness, and the only way of expressing their frustration is to murder, rape and pillage.It's also a great accurate portrayl of what I feel IMHO of American soldiers in Nam.  Not the best war film (IMHO Grave of the Fireflies is) ever made but Platoon makes it's point.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,20 May 2000
Blow," Flat.
","Johnny Depp is George Jung, a man we are told at the begging of the film narrating his own story, is the man who was the sole contributor of cocaine to America during the late 70's early 80's (or at least 85% of it as he claims).  In the end though, the only thing I could think of about this statement on which this movie basis it's entire story on was so what'. Problem is other than that, and a weak lead trying to carry the film, this movie I felt was pretty boring, uninteresting, and uneven.Johnny Depp is an actor I find who can't seem to act well when needed.  It seems every emotion his character has to play, fear, anger, hate, jealousy, sadness, love, all comes out in the end as a blank less stare and a wooden face.  Instead of seeing the real George Jung as a man who just wanted to have a normal life but didn't know how to do anything else (but smuggle drugs), we are just treated to Depp not even aging well but just going through several decades with a bad haircut.Other characters enter his life, but we never get to know them.  Some seem more of a distraction (like making his first love die of cancer), or they end up disappearing through half the film (like George's gay hairdressing contact to Hollywood played by Paul Reubens of Pee-Wee Herman fame).  Simply Jung goes and deals drugs, then he tries more, gets caught, tries again, gets caught, friends come, friends go.  We all know from the beginning of the film that it won't work for George in the end, but the wait to get there is a romp through many uninteresting scenes, and characters which just didn't hold my interest.The only time the movie seems successful is the interaction George Jung has with his Mother and Father which are played greatly by Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths, but they only amount to small parts in the film.In the end they throw on a soundtrack reminiscent of the era, and try to glitz up a couple shots, but the movie just doesn't have enough interesting characters, memorable scenes or dialogue, and goes on for far to long. There have been better films on the subject matter which are more interesting, have memorable characters and scenes such as GoodFellas, and Scarface and perhaps that's the problem.  The good films on upcoming dealers/hustlers and their rise to the top and hard fall, have already been done.Unfortunately I can't recommend it.Rating 4 out of 10.",4,8,14,25 April 2001
The Iron Giant," Spectacular!!
","Fantastic family film about an Iron Giant robot that falls from the skies in the late 50's.  A young kid named Hogarth finds a 50 foot tall steel eating 'Iron Giant', after discovering it trapped in a power plant station.  After saving the giants life, the two bond and Hogarth has to figure out how to keep the whole thing a secret, as a nosy government agent arrives in town convinced there's an enemy 'something' created either by the Russians or martians that must be destroyed.This is the perfect animated film, the giant looks great and has a neat personality and a cool sounding voice (like synthesized grinding metal). There's also enough humour to keep things a little on the lighter side.  But the movie shines spectacularly in its portrayl of a 'friendly giant' and a kid who tries to convince the world that he's harmless.  This is a total setup for a very sappy, preachy, and didactic story line, but the film is not like that at all.  It comes out with the ingenious of an aesop fable handled with great simplicity and without being a paint by numbers moral lesson.  Great for kids and even better for adults.Rating 10 out of 10.",10,3,4,21 May 2001
Shrek," The perfect fairy tale for adults!!
","Shrek is the name of an ogre who lives in a swamp.  He is a grump and hates everyone and would rather be by himself than make any friends.  One day though, he discovers that fairy tale characters are flocking to him for protection after he reluctantly saves a talking donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy.  In a desperate atempt for Shrek to get everyone away from him, he goes to a midget wannabe King and demands that they remove the vagrants off his swamp land.The King agrees so long as he rescues a princess and returns her to him so he can marry her.  What insues is an Ogre that rescues a damsel that falls for him even though he is an unwilling participant at first, but of course we find out the Ogre has a heart and wants to be with the princess instead of giving her to the King.In short this movie is hysterical, unique, qwerky, and massively entertaining.  Eddie Murphy steals the show as a wisecracking donkey, and the animation is really top notch.  Many parodies abound, and the humour is directed more towards adults than it is for children (not that they wouldn't like it) making it more enjoyable.The perfect fairy tale for adults!!Rating 8 1/2 out of 10",8,0,0,17 July 2001
Vanilla Sky," A Disapointment
","Being excited once again to catch another Cameron Crowe flic yet again.  The director who brought one of the greatest films of last year into being if not the best (Almost Famous), and the work of Jeremy Macguire, gives us a rework of a Spanish film named Abre Los Ojos (open your eyes).
However the results of this work pale in comparison unfortunatly to Crowe's previous glorious shining moments.  This twighlight zone, dreamscape of a film ends up being not a fascinating memorable piece of work, but a tedious exercise.  While everything seems to be there, good casting, good actors, and an intriguing story, it doesn't flow.  It seems very choppy and more distintresting.  Vanilla sky has the unfortunate habit of leaving the viewer stranded, instead of letting them hitch on a more intriguing ride.
Basicaly Tom Cruise is a rich kid with an easy life, and easy beautiful woman he lusts after on one side, until he falls for Penelope Cruz when she comes to his birthday party.  As the film progresses we meet more characters, we are subjected to flashbacks, intercutting of scenes in the future, some in the past, all with that twighlight zone feel and leaving you disoriented (I can't describe more without giving away too much).  In reality we as the viewer soon begin to realize that we see is not the whole truth as the film toys with the idea of is this real? or is it imagined?  While this has been done greatly in films this year like Mulholand Drive, and the BRILLIANCE of films like Memento, Vanilla Sky leaves the viewer unwilling to even care.  Too many of the scenes go on for far too long, and I lost interest several times.  Many times I wanted this film just to end.  The film does make sense to me and I don't think a second viewing would add to my experience, if anything the first viewing was more of a chore, its one thing to watch a film and be motivated and be awed on screen, than to sit through a disoriented piece with no connection.
Cameron really missed the ball on this one and it's unfortunate.  His touch is there ecspecialy the incorporation of music and scenes (loved the opening scene of empty New York) but in the end this film fails.  So many people in the audience just kept groaning within the last 45 minutes as the scenes and developments kept popping up. I felt their pain.. Rating 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,14 December 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Tries too hard to be 'hip'
","Disney's Emperor's New Groove, is an atempt to throw slapstic and Tex Avery, Ren Stimpy-ish humour in a Disney formula.  In the end it just comes off as being totaly lame.The animation is fine, it's a typical Disney story, but it's atempts to generate laughs will only work on someone under the age of maybe 6.  The film is not entertaining and comes across as Disney trying to be 'hip' and 'with it' like the crazy ingenious animation of other studios.

Ben-Hur," Da epic
","One of those 'epic' type films made in the golden age of cinema.  I thought this film was pretty good and had some great stuff going for it.  Heston was good, and Stephen Boyd as Massala was excellent might I add.  At times I did find it a little slow but not totaly.  That chariot race was also amazing, and looked intensly painful and real for the participants even though it was made so long ago with simple technology.  It boggles my mind that people back in the late 50's made films like this pulling out all the stops with killer locations, killer cast, killer costumes, killer cinematography, and a killer epic story. Although in the epic category 'Lawrence of Arabia' remains my all time fav, I didn't mind this one that much. Rating 8 out of 10",Null,1,2,13 May 2000
Signs," Great work!
","From the director of Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable comes another great work for Shyamalan.  This guy is on a ROLE!!  Gibson plays a former priest (Father Graham) who has left the faith.  He is a farmer and also is accompanied by his brother played by Joaquin Phoenix (Merril) who lives on the farm with him.  Graham has 'left the flock' after the tragic death of his wife in a car accident, and is now left to raise his 2 young kids. However, one day a crop circle appears in his corn field, and at first glance seems a prank.  But later on the events that unfold at Grahams farm, and around the world, put his beliefs to the test.First off, Shyamalan has created another GREAT film.  There is great tension, story telling and casting.  Needless to say the film isn't totally flawless but what is good is done magnificantly.  Shyamalan's tricks us into believing this is a thriller, but in reality its a very spiritual movie about a quest for faith.  Because of this, when things suddenly start to 'go bump in the night' the movie kind of looses focus from an intelligent look into a troubled family, to becoming almost a horror show.  Keep in mind, the little bumps in the night are done with great artistry!!  Also Shyamalan is now starting to pull off what I call 'Tarrantino' syndrome, in that he is starting to appear in his films more obviously.  In this one, he is actually a minor character.  His presence doesn't ruin 'Signs' but it is a bit of a distraction since it is obvious the he is not an actor.Luckily there is very little to be picky about in this film, and I look forward to this guys next 'project'.  EXCELLENT stuff..Rating 8.5 out of 10",8,0,2,4 August 2002
Amélie," Charming, good in its simplicity
","I went to see Amelie and was quite surprised by the amount of buzz it generated.  I am a big movie nut and see a lot of foreign films, instead of the regular Hollywood stuff [which I do see as well].  However, this little picture seems to be taking over.  I went to the theatre here (early as always) and found out that people were even buying tickets for the next day.I would describe this film as a coloured washout view of Paris about an adorable qwerky woman who decides that her destiny in life is to make other people happy, adding a dash of Run Lola Run hyper intensity.  She, like all other people in the film is weird.  There are no ordinary people in this film at all which makes it that more interesting, and there are comical moments.I think most people seeing this film are drawn to its simplicity and think that its unique, its really inspiring to them.  For me it's a good film (no not the best of the year [see my thoughts on Memento, Mulholland Drive, and Sexy Beast, who knows I may see something even better still]) but I think It's one of those films that will force people who wouldn't see alternative theatre, to see something different [and maybe stick with it].The film does get a little slow, and has an overly romanticized view of Paris and Parisians.  But you don't mind, even the cafe that Amelie works in reminds me so much of the cafe's I use to sit in when I was on a trip to Portugal.  The movie is definitely a feel good film, and probably the best feel good movie of the year.Tautou is just enchanting as well and the movie has great magical scenes such as when she remarks to the audience how when she goes to the movies, she turns around sometimes to see the smiles on everybody's faces.  The camera pans back showing the audience in joy.  It's that feeling you connect with after seeing this film.Overly sentimental??, perhaps, best film of the year??  No  A film worth seeing,  `Definitely'Rating 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,14 November 2001

After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theatre.Colourfull clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene (I consider the BEST I have ever seen film ever), and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?While Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen.

","Amsterdam Vallion watches his father die in a gang battle in New York by the hands of Bill The Butcher.  After being sent to reform and now grown up, he sets out for vengeance in 1846 New York.So aside from the location, history time period, just what makes this film so unique considering its nothing more than a boilermaker of a script we've heard a thousand times before???It's unfortunate there wasn't some other story to tell, cause this is really the only thing wrong with the film.  Daniel Day Lewis's performance is masterful, and the others are good as well, and most of the minor characters (John C Reily and Gary Lewis) are exceptional.  Great direction, great cinematography, but can't make for the lack of script and something to engage the viewer than the simple plot story line.Still worth seeing.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,14 January 2003
The Breakfast Club," Damn good
","When I saw this film in the 80's as a teenager I totaly identified with it. I enjoyed the humor and the characters.  It was a riot and very real.  I knew many 'Benders' in my school (one I knew even killed himself) as with all the other characters.  It even meant more to me cause so many people liked to remark how much I looked like Anthony Michael Hall back then (who was in all these movies playing the same stereotyped character).Looking back the film is still great.  However, my only criticism with the movie now was that it didn't go far enough in letting the characters vent. I think that just reflects the time it was made. THe movie wasn't ready to handle HARD ISSUES not because it couldn't but because the time it was made no one was doing that.Kids now are faced with harder issues and are forced to grow up faster. Also kids are more accepting I think of other cliques compared to back then.. Except the geeks I guess...Anyway...  A film that will stand the test of time.Rating 8 out of 10",8,1,3,22 April 2000
Gladiator," Russel WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MESS!!
","So this is how I start my summer movie bonanza.  Looking forward to Russel and a good story and some big budget action to produce serious eye candy.How disapointed I was soon to be.  Gladiator is an unfortunate rehash of the same ole good guy revenges against evil and of course it's ALWAYS the evil one's love interest that is in love with the good guy.  This movie falls into that same ole trap, and none of the actors and actresses have anything to work with.  Everyone seems fine, Crowe who is normaly dynamic and plays interesting characters is uninteresting cause his character is the same banal hero in every BAD revenge movie out there. Joaquin Phoenix as Commudus is ok he seems like the only person in the film who looks like a Roman but he's BORING.  It's not that they are bad, it's that their characters are so stereotypical and bleak that there's nothing interesting about them.  And then of course it plays into that HOPELESS cliche when the weak evil guy we all know how pathetic he is, will try to defeat the hero in  a battle we know he will loose.  WHY??? cause he's a looser.  Gee couldn't figure that out..So then I would think at LEAST there'd be some good action in this picture.. Wrong again..  Sure some of the battle scenes are neat, but I found them boring and they were hampered by the BIGGEST complaint I have with this picture.  This film was SOOOOOOOOO darkly shot that I could barely even make out the characters faces.  There is nothing wrong with this effect but it was used so poorly here that the fight scenes were chaotic and blurry (I found my eyes jumping all over the first battle scene), to the simple dialogue scenes where I could barely see even the characters eyeballs. 
Historical inacuracies??  Probably several, do I care?  No.  I went to this film for the entertainment value and it didn't even give me that!

Princess Mononoke," Who will save the forest??
","An eyepopping piece of animation, with a unique story.This anime does not confuse, or leave the viewer bored.  There are always interesting characters to run into such as the small tree spirits, or the gigantic forest creatures.The message at the end is a bit preachy, but the idea and concept of living in harmony with nature is told well.  The story even makes it more interesting when they parable the infighting with some of the other forest creatures as to how they should deal with the encroaching humans.Not the best anime I have ever seen, but CERTAINLY not the worst.Rating 7 out of 10",7,1,2,30 September 2000
Cinderella Man," Made for the Oscars
","As much as Howard has captured the bleakness of the depression 30's era, and a well talented cast provides some good performances, Cinderella man is very much a formula picture where we all know how it is going to turn out, but will just go along with the ride.What I would call this 'Seabiscuit' of boxing, is tailor made for the Oscars for its easy to identify story line and spirited typical feel good plot device.You know who the good guys are, and the bad guys are overplayed. So much so that Max Baer comes off as a complete psychopath in this film.If you like formula movies this one is tailor made for you, and the boxing scenes will leave you pummeled. I swear my hands hurt after watching this. But if you pine for something with a little more creativity and less paint by numbers I would steer clear of it.7 out of 10",7,7,19,21 May 2005
High Fidelity," To true to life..
","John Cusak is Rob Gordon, a record nut aficionado who owns a vintage record store in Chicago.  Rob's store is a carbon copy of every music/vinyl nuts salvation.  The movie is told through Rob's narration.  Many times he speaks directly into the camera right to the audience.  He is telling us his life is a dismal failure with relationships and that is what the movie is essentially about.. Rob's relationship screw-ups and that he is a failure.One thing Rob does is classify everything into top 5 lists.  He then proceeds to talk about his top 5 break ups of all time just as we are introduced to him and see his current fiancée leave him.  We are also introduced to other characters in his life particularly 2 people who work at his store.  Rob hired them to work in only 3 days a week but they drop by EVERY DAY to work and talk shop cause they have no life other than talking about music.  Rob can't get rid of them, particularly one guy who is so uppity with his taste in music, that he frequently insults customers tastes who come to the store with his elitist music attitude.  Thinking Rob is somewhat cursed he decides to revisit what happened to the other top 5 in his life to find answers, and perhaps but his soul at ease.This movie is a total riot.  You will TOTALLY recognize all these characters as someone you knew or currently know in your life, and that's one of the movies greatest successes.  The characters are so real as they talk about, love, loss, rejection, money, sex etc This movie also has some hilarious scenes, one in particular that is SO funny that I thought I was going to die in the theatre.  The audience was just HOWLING!!!  I can't tell you what it is you have to see the film.Also the flashbacks of Rob that are shown are great particularly when he is in college during the 80's.  They had the style of the decade down perfectly (even though it was a very small part in the film).  Also it is probably the best movie that deals about relationships that I have ever seen.  Every guy can relate to Rob and his experiences with other women.  I certainly know that for a fact being through what Rob went through as well.  Also a good friend of mine had the exact same thing happen to him with someone he was living with.This is one of the few movies that I have seen that shows what relationships really are.  They are complicated, they are NOT simple.  There were very few faults I could find with this film.  The only one that I felt somewhat was that it seemed a little long.  Tim Robbins, and Catherine Zeta Jones also make some good cameos.  And the movie has the coolest ending credits I have ever seen in a film.Needless to say, this is the best movie I have seen this year so far.Rating 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,16 August 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Enjoyable 30's nostalgic ride, with characters you care about
","This movie is based on the classic story of Homer's 'Odyssey' set in the 30's in Mississippi.  3 convicts escape on a quest, and the adventure takes them throughout rural Mississippi in classic scenery and memorable characters.  I am not familiar with the Odyssey story at all, but I really enjoyed this nostalgic romp.Clooney is great in this role as Ulysses Everett McGill, a wise cracking, brylcreme addicted personality, who goes on about the state of his affairs with a huge smile and a rambling southern accent.  It was a real treat to watch him in this role.  The cinematography is also quite good, and it had that great 30's nostalgic feel and captured the era perfectly.  I am a big sucker for nostalgia in movies and this film handled it perfectly.  And Turturro is great as always, he's definitely another favourite actor of mine.I suppose being familiar with the original story I would have gotten more out of it, but still it was a fun ride.  It is not perfection, but it is a refreshing change from the same old same old, by placing a spin on a classic story in an interesting setting.Rating 7 out of 10",7,0,0,27 February 2001
