First Man," Incredible
","Cinematography, sound, SCORE, acting and editing are top notch.I really enjoyed this film.The music is unbelievable. Especially using a simple repeating bar of music in one specific scene, it made me feel anxious and right there in the moment. And the final piece of music is hauntingly gorgeous.The camera work really puts you in the movie. Especially scenes showing the Armstrong household in wide shots and moving handheld whips, along with the set design blended so well to, again, put you in the movie. And the space sequences are so creepily realistic and so different from any other space exploration movie.Very happy it was made on film instead of digital.
First Man is incredibly worth the watch.",10,2,5,12 January 2019
Jersey Boys," Great adaptation
","For fans of the broadway show, like myself, it's good to know that you can keep the story at the heart of it with the music as a garnish. For the show, the music is more to the max. I think this movie was exactly what it needed to be. Especially with Eastwood's raw directing style it compliments the actors and everything so well.",10,2,2,14 January 2019
