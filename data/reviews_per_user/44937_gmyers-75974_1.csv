Deja Vu," Ridiculously confusing.
",The production staff paid no attention to detail. Very confusing and non sequential. They go into a major scene with no lead into it so it's purpose makes no sense. In one scene Denzel Washington actually takes off the same shirt twice. I wouldn't waste my time if you pay attention to detail.,3,0,1,20 April 2019
