Iron Man 3," How bad can a plot twist be?
","Iron man 3 is not completely fresh in my mind considering I saw the movie over a month a go, but it was a movie to remember.Iron Man 3 was the first movie on my list of anticipated movies for summer 13, and I thought it was a delight. Robert Downey Jr. was great in the suit as usual. He steals every scene, charms you, and is an overall funny guy. War machine ( haha) had good chemistry with stark and remained a relevant supporting character.I am a big Guy Pearce fan! I loved him in movies such as: memento, hurt locker, and la confidential. He was good as an actor in this film, but I felt they could have made him a little deeper of a villain. Which brings us to the supposed downfall of this film. The Mandarin. Die hard fans of the Mandarin will be disappointed as ever by the mandarin in Iron Man 3. He appears as a large threat and as a ruthless terrorist in the first half of the film. Halfway through the movie you actually find out he is a drunken actor. In the end, no one can deny Iron Man 3, unless your a Mandarin purist. 9/10",7,18,26,20 June 2013
Scary Movie 2," The roast of scary movie 2
","Last night, some of my friends insisted upon watching a comedy. While comedy isn't my favorite movie genre, I do like them. We ended up watching scary movie 2 and oh boy was it bad. I can find enjoyment out of bad movies like sharknado but not this one. It is a fact that I laughed only once the entire movie! The saddest part is that it was in the first five minutes of the movie so I sat through the rest of the movie bored out of my mind. There are no characters to care about, no plot, and shitty special effects. But guess what I fully expected that and put that aside. AND I STILL HATED IT! I just wanted the movie to make me laugh and it failed at that. Well, it did make me laugh once so I'll give it 1 out of 10 stars.",1,1,3,26 January 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," An unforgettable movie
","Let me start off by saying that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my favorite movies of all- time. It is directed, co-written, and produced by one of my favorite directors of all-time, Stanley Kubrick, who has directed other masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. 2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. This movie is not for the average movie-goer. If you do decide to watch this movie, you will be treated to: fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story. One things for sure, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a complex film. The film is frequently interpreted differently amongst people. This is especially true with the oh so famous and confusing last 30 minutes of the movie. Whether you end up liking the film or disliking it, you will not forget 2001: A Space Odyssey.",10,4,8,9 March 2015
