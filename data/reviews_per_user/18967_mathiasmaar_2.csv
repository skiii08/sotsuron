It," Instant Classic.
","This adaption simply converted the book into the big screen in exactly the way I envisioned the book when I read it. There are so many layers in this movie, so many nods and references aimed at the readers. At the same time, a person who has not read the book, will get so much more than a simple horror movie. This movie succeeds at getting so many genres enveloped in each other, with horror being the overarching genre. As a grown up person, I found it to actually be scary and unpredictable. Furthermore, this movie has so many unique and memorable scenes that will simply stay in your memory for a long time after watching it. Definitely the best movie of 2017.",10,2,3,30 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Insulting
","Absolutely a disgrace to writing and cinematography. Breaks established lore, pacing is horrendous, several things are just left in the movie and never followed up upon, and you do not have time to connect with any characters. It is so terrible that it is not even fun to make fun of it, it just makes you sad.",1,65,78,27 May 2020
