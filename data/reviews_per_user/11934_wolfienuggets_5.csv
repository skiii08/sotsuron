It," Mediocre at best
","This is a pretty over rated, it's not scary, it's too goofy, and it's just not great, if you've read the book it'll ruin because this just is no good compared to the book. As a movie I guess this is alright, decent acting, somewhat decent cgi, but it's just not that great",6,1,4,27 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A great movie, but fairly over rated.
","Ok, don't get me wrong I did like this movie, it was fairly good, BUT I'm not sure it deserves to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. Yes it was dramatic and better than a lot of marvel films I've seen. Good special effects as always and some really nice views, but I wouldn't call this top 250 worthy. The ending is honestly pretty predictable and honestly very stupid, Thanos literally could've just used the gauntlet to make more food instead of killing off half the universe. It's just a cliche and stupid ending. I do think it'll be cool to see what happens in the next movie though, still ending was just bad, even if it's not the technical 'end' still over all it was decent, and worth watching.",7,0,1,16 January 2019
The Lion King," Below mediocre cash grab with absolutely no emotion
","We've made so many advancements in technology, evolving from 2D animation to 3D, pixels to hyper realistic models, and apparently now days 2D to mediocre live action remakes. This movie is utter s***, the CGI is meant to be super realistic, and one way of doing that is by giving the characters absolutely no emotion, depth, anything! They don't do anything new from the original, it's shot for shot, and it's utter garbage, skip this one for your live actions, you'll be disappointed.",3,4,6,1 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Ehh, kind of over rated
","I saw this movie with well, expectations, and was honestly disappointed, the movie wasn't necisarrly 'bad' but it also wasn't really good. For starters this family has been living in this apocalypse for a while now and yet there are times when they just do the most stupid things. In the beginning of the movie the kid dies when he plays with a toy, of this kid is that dumb how have they not died yet? And also, couldn't te batteries have just been taken out so it doesn't make sound? There are a few things wrong with this. There were just parts in the movie that really made it kind of ehh, and honestly it was just kind of boring, there were a few parts that had suspense but that was really it. It was a cool concept don't get me wrong, but the way it was executed was just poorly done, also if they had that bunker where you couldn't be heard, why the heck didn't they just stay there the entire time? The movie was also way to fast, the pace just felt uncomfortable and it felt more like I was watching a tv episode than a movie. There was some entertainment but over all the movie was kind of boring.",6,1,1,16 January 2019
Green Book," Extremely well done and emotional biography
","I'll be honesty I only watched this movie cause I wanted to watch something and couldn't pick anything, but this movie was not at all a let down! The performances given were above exceptional, the story was well paced and there some moments that made me laugh. It's a wonderfully done movie and deserves more attention than it has right now. And seeing them grow and develope on screen is just incredible, this is a loveable movie and a must watch.",9,25,46,16 January 2019
