The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino is the devil!
","The Devil's advocate is a one man show signed Al Pacino. In this movie he shows us what acting is all about. He also gives perhaps the best portrait of Lucifer so far. He plays him as a charming, intelligent, manipulative and scary S.O.B, who takes what he wants (he is exactly how the devil is supposed to be). Al Pacino also delivers two magnificent monologues.",Null,0,1,24 March 1999
Fight Club," Like watching the wet dream of a fascist...
","I felt sick when I sat and watched Fight Club because of it´s pro-fascist tendencies, and the entire ubermenschenmentality that this film salutes.Sure, the film is very cool to look at but that doesn´t matter when the movie oozes of a terrible message that violence is the ultimate form of purification of the mind and soul. Stay away from this lousy piece of fascistpropaganda! To quote Apocalypse Now: 'The horror, the horror'",4,2,8,16 June 2000
Léon: The Professional," So beautiful, so touching
","Léon is a masterpiece, a modern classic. And it´s also filled with religious symbolism, such as when Léon opens the door for Mathilda and she enters his apartment, you don´t have to look very hard to see the 'light of salvation' coming out of the apartment covering Mathilda. This movie is one of my favorites, and the acting is one such a high level that it´s almost scary. Gary Oldman, and Jean Reno delivers their best performances to this day. And the hugely talented Natalie Portman acts with the vulnerability and sensitivity of an actress filled with routine, although she was but 13 years old at the time she acted in this masterpiece. This movie is well written, it has a beautifully painful cinematography, it´s amazingly good directed, it´s extremely well acted, and the music is so beautiful. I do not think there exists a person who hasn´t been touched be this violent, touching and beautiful film. A true masterpiece.   10/10",10,0,1,23 March 2000
