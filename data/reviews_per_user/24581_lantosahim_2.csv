It," If It was not a horror.
","In the past years, since I watch films not just for fun, but as a piece of cultural marvel and I simply didn't feel the originality to write anything.And I feel the same with some genres, where the creators does not will, can, able to find anything new – and profitable at the same time. It was a nicely shot, well directed (after the first terrible hour) and really really well played movie. I don't want to argue about the raison d'etre of horror, but even my mother tongue is not English, the first thing flashed in my mind is the word: pointless.This movie has a first and second Act, that is trying to push the standard horror clichés, like the strange camera angles, raising music tones and sharp, choppy cuts. This made me a bit angry, but it also spotlighted the biggest problem of the whole industrialized movie making. They have to make money, and just like any other undertaking, the studios have to position their products for the customers. So we sometimes get this fragmented kind of 'product'.On the other hand, I think this movie worked pretty well, when it (or It – ha ha :) ) didn't try scare the sh*t out of the audience with jump scare or with the previously mentioned aggressive method. And here comes the pointless side of the 'horror'.I have no problem with the fear. But it must be a tool not a goal. You rarely can get a great dramatic play and an amusement center in the same room. But when it is used as a tool, to settle the whole story and its own Universe with its own rules, then it could work.The lighting was good, the child actors were great, the cinematography was okay, the music I don't remember. At the end of the day did I like the movie? Yes. But not because it was a well- mad-piece-of-art, but because I had some really great moments and a great story behind all the 'effort' of making this great mystery drama to a horror movie.",6,1,5,24 September 2017
The Lion King," One of the best tech demo I've ever seen...
","...but beneath the surface, there is nothing to adore. Parts of the movie, when they copied the original frame-by-frame and the tunes note-to-note are still working, but as a whole there is no art left on the bones of the original.I have never understood when people used the phrase 'no soul in it', but I could not describe this better. It was heartbreaking to see the lack of emotion. And I really hated the timing and editing during the whole movie. This was bad in so many ways that I cannot stand.",3,3,4,26 October 2019
