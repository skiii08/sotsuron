Iron Man 3," A huge waste of hype and time. I'm a sucker.
","... but they'll still get our money right?... of course - it's Iron Man. But if this review can save one person the cost of admission I will feel that I've done something good today. IM3 is a (not-so) colossal failure. In hindsight, they didn't even NEED to drag The Mandarin into this movie. It's unbelievable to think they casted one of Hollywood's best to play Iron Man's arch enemy and turned it into an embarrassing hoax.... uuughh. 90% of the time Stark is running around playing detective without a suit. 2 hours later, he summons an army of Iron Men to do the job... that's when I threw my popcorn and thought..'WTF????'. Stark has these annoying panic attacks whenever NYC is mentioned. At one point an Iron Man suit gets hit by a tractor trailer and the suit breaks into hundreds of pieces... WHAT!!! The Mandarin in this movie is NOT THE MANDARIN AT ALL..... THERE ARE NO RINGS... NO MAGICAL POWERS..... NO EXTRATERRESTIAL TECHNOLOGY... NOTHING. The real bad guy in the movie is just like the Human Torch and renders Iron Man completely useless at one point WITH JUST ONE FINGER! I'm not a comic book enthusiast, but I do enjoy a good super hero movie. This is not a good super hero movie. Any good review is absolutely paid for... no doubt. IM3 has done a great job of destroying (for me) any future Iron Man movies. But, on the good side, they saved a ton of money with less CGI and bad writers so the stockholder will be happy. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",3,3,6,7 May 2013
