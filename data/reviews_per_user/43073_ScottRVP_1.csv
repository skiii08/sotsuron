The Blair Witch Project," Doesn't live up to the hype.
","I viewed this movie on August 1st with five friends. Myself and two of the others are huge moviegoers/film buffs. Not one person in our group thought the movie was the least bit scary.  Futhermore, none of us thought the movie was very good either.  To sum it up, we were very disappointed.  Especially since the concept for the film is really terrific!  I mean its just a great idea! However, I felt they really failed to deliver on it.  My biggest complaint about the movie was how stupid the characters acted.  Of course this is the problem with almost all horror movies made today.  If someone would only make a horror movie that didn't use stupidity to move the plot along then perhaps we would see a scary movie.  Another problem the movie had was an inconsistency in the behavior of one of the characters who goes from being a complete coward to someone who doesn't appear to be scared of anything at the end. Between myself and the others in my group as well as several people I've talked to since I've seen the movie, we've come up with a sizable list of things wrong with this movie. However, here's the bottom line: its a great concept and I'd love to see a re-make of this movie.",4,0,2,3 August 1999
