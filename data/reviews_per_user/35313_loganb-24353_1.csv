Alien 3," What a snore
","Watched this because of the Sardonicast boys. If you want a long movie with not many rewards for your time, this is it. It's not nearly as entertaining as Aliens or as suspenseful as Alien. I'm really not sure what I could say happens in this one. There's a xenomorph in it, so I guess if you're obsessed with the franchise check it out.",5,1,2,15 July 2019
