Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," niiice
","I was laughing throughout this movie, it is hilarious. There are so many memorable jokes, my favourite was the scene at the dinner table.'In my country men would go crazy for these two', says Borat gesturing at 2 of the guests wives. 'Not so much for...' He points at the pastors wife. However, every now and then it did make me feel uncomfortable, especially when he talks to what seem to be average American Joes' who turn out to be either racist, homophobic or just ass-holes. There was one scene when i had to literally close my eyes, the fight between the naked Borat and the naked producer Azamat was disgusting. 'Eat my ass hole' says Azamat as he rubs his behind on Borats face. I think the film could have done without that.Despite that scene, i thought the film was the best comedy i've seen since Dodgeball and Anchorman- much better though.] Whatever the critics say about Borat being a crusader exposing the Americans as being bigots like himself, that is a load of rubbish. it is just a comic going to America and getting a phenomenal movie out of it. whether or not all of it is genuine or staged is another topic altogether...",10,3,15,5 November 2006
