United 93," 'Gets you right there'
","I was a little worried that this film was going to be some Hollywood monster which would be in bad taste of this flight and the events of which happened on and after this day forward.After watching this film, and still today a day later I can feel that lump in my throat. This is a very sensitive subject and i think it was an excellent representation of possible events, i don't know exactly how this film was written but i can imagine that a great deal of time and effort went in to keep this film accurate.I hope that a good proportion of money made on this film is going to victims and the families to help them progress and move forward with their tragic loss.",10,0,1,10 December 2006
Hot Fuzz," Laugh a second high paced action movie...C'mon
","Went to see this film last night, was a little worried that it would'nt come close to Shaun of the dead, but i believe it scores par. Shaun of the Dead is one of those films you can watch again and again and never grow tired spotting new things all the time, and i think Hot Fuzz is the same, as soon as its out on DVD it will be a part my video collection.Due to the little advertising i had seen and heard, nothing was spoilt and everything was a surprise, not what i expected and very cleverly written, gags were cracking and i enjoyed the carryover from Shaun of the Dead. If you haven't seen this film you really don't know what your missing! Loved it, will be watching it over and over again, lets hope they create a third film equally as good if not better...",10,1,3,24 February 2007
