Hereditary," Absolutely rubbish
","This film was a total disappointment. I wasted one day of our holiday going to the cinema to watch this. The acting was questionable, the plot decidedly loose and a complete waste of 2 hours of my life. I have watched better B horrors than this film. I had been looking forward to watching this film as it had very good reviews and hyped up. Don't waste your time",1,7,16,19 June 2018
