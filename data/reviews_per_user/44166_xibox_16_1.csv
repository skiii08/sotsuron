Conquest 1453," It is a great movie about Ottoman
","This is the best movie in Turkey ever made. Everybody should watch and see how Turkey cinemas developed. For war movies such this, the movies' budget looks ridiculous. So it is good work. While you're watching it, you do not get bored even a minute. The characters are awesome, especially Sultan Mehemd, Hasan and Giustiniani. The Musics are also fantastic. Benjamin Wallfisch has a sign on this amazing musics as well. In short, you just see it and then decide. Faith Aksoy, the director, made bad movies in past like Recep Ä°vedik but his new movie is very different and great. You should see this great movie. It shows Ottoman Historiy and Tradition incredibly. It is really great. I did not watch a movie like Fetih 1453 in Turkey's cinema history. Faith Sultan Mehmed is great sultan in Ottoman History. He is a giant. I will continue in Turkish. Noo :( I tried but not permission. Anyway where were we? I hope this movie will come the U.S.A and Europe. The people who live in these countries have a chance to see this amazing movie. If you have a little information about the history of Ottoman, you love it so much.",10,57,136,19 February 2012
