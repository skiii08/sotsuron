E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good Movie!
",I loved it when I saw it the first time at 7 years old.  E.T.  was so cute. Everyone had to have a stuffed E.T. and you had to eat Reeses Pieces. Reminds us that you don't have to make every d*mn movie animation and computer generated crap! like today.  It's fun to share with the younger generation of kids who were born way after this movie came out.,Null,0,1,27 March 2002
