Airlift," its all about being akshay
","I have never been a fan of akshay with his so works including only action & commando roles, but one must see this flick to actually witness the macho man deliver an act of his life..be it his eyes, his mannerisms or simply his anguish or frustration, it all is one hell of a work & simply outstanding... also praiseworthy is the fact that the production house had the guts to take upon this forgotten piece of history 7 bring it alive on celluloid with being known to all that there have not been many movies in India similar to this.. Plus to the team for keeping the tension up & not making the script bogged down by too much of melodrama.. It does make me proud to be an Indian , a sure watch...",8,1,3,24 January 2016
Gravity," a gripping & inspiring breathtaking experience. Afford to miss it at your own risk
","Do you miss out being part of a life less exciting n boring, then u better watch this heart wrenching depiction of survival amongst all odds. This beautifully conceived story is not only just some gr8 visuals n breathtaking special effects thrown in. It rises above that n gives us an inspiring tale of a lone human being left at the perils of an alien space n incoming debris of a satellite. Its about how she survives n is helped by a friend n inner strong instinct & how she fights all the demons in herself & makes her way back to earth. It really keeps you seated tightly in your cushioned seats n one can only exclaim in wow at the gorgeously picturised view of earth from up there. Plus the special effects like the tears converting into bubbles, devastation caused by the incoming debris... n not to forget the confidence n the next to perfect booming voice of George Clooney with all the humor thrown in. An awesome experience. Will surely be counted as one of the forerunners in the list of inspiring tales a list that includes schindler's list,etc. Cant afford to miss it..",9,2,5,11 October 2013
Rush," an Oscar stuff but sadly without any nominations!!!
","Man, we all have been crooning about the great acts in the likes of gravity n American hustle but what is more axiomatic is the true sheer pleasure n the thrill associated with the flick in question,post watching it.. Director Ron Howard who has given us classics like a beautiful mind , to name a few has delivered a directorial take resplendent with tight editing n in the process bringing us a slick, stylishly crafted, intelligently made n high on octane, edge of the seat thriller , accrued by some good confident performances by both the lead actors.. Even though i ain't a racing fan & till now haven't witnessed a single race even on TV but such is the intensity, racy feel to the movie, right from the first scene, that one doesn't even require an intermission.. Though the rivalry shown is guess, a tad exaggerated but who cares with the great view on offer!!! Not to seize any credits from both the lead actors, Hemsworth & Daniel, who as shown later during the end, look quite the champions they have portrayed on screen.. There is the flamboyant, boisterous & carefree maclaren driver, who believes in living life on the edge, making use of every min.available & never abiding by the rules.. Contrastingly, his competitor up next is a German , a boring , serious guy who stops in the middle of a race to avoid any mishaps, after images of his wife appear in his mind.. Who speaks not so fluent English but is a master at his work, knows his machines inside out n is a disciplined types.. Worth seeing is when he ,while driving a borrowed up car is questioned of not being a racy driver, since neither does he possess long hair, nor flamboyant enough to be called one!!! At this he retorts saying that he does not see any incentives /rewards on driving faster!!! Also worthy is the detailing, the picturisation of races, the cars itself, the background score by the famous zimmer.. In fact, the human emotions, fear & risks involved have been explored & presented to us in a never seen manner.. Indeed their rivalry is the highlight of the movie, which prompted each of them to give it their best.. They don't interact much with each other but do look the part ,especially at the end, seen conversing with each other.. It indeed is a great watch, & not only for some cheap action or some racy sequences..",9,3,4,23 February 2014
Trouble with the Curve," more than just a sports flick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Whoa!!!!!!!! that oldie(clint eastwood) can still pull off the act with so much class and attitude..... amazing bro. watched this movie just when had nothing substantial to do n hell i have been left in awe!!!! It ain't just another sports movie based on 1 team winning over another n all the passion n the excitement the final moments bring.. Nah... It simply is a portrayal of relationship between an ailing father and his young doctor(ably enacted by amy adams),to start with the old man doesn't wish his daughter around him but she being egged on by the charismatic actor(justin timberlake)gets closer to him in the process opening him up ,making him reveal the reason behind his effervescent brooding nature.. some scenes between the two are simply a great take on life..kudos to the debutant director to wrap up the movie so brilliantly. even though i too watched it on lap only(it could not find its way to the theatres nearby),but i wish such movies get more serious response.....Lean back n watch it for its true substance...",8,3,4,9 January 2013
Now You See Me," on the edge spin into the world of magic.
","A smartly done work of fiction which keeps u engaged with its twists n fast paced mysterious plots at every corner.. An on the edge thriller ,with decent performances by the star studded cast.especially the lead horseman.. Its worth every penny though one may notice flaws in the script now & then..at the end though the director leaves us with few unanswered questions.. Still a breezy ride through the world of magicians...seems a sequel is in the pipeline..& if the character development had been given some time & space.. One seems not to be able to identify with either of them...good different churned out product from Hollywood stables..",7,0,2,1 November 2013
Uri: The Surgical Strike," True showcase of national patriotic fervour & 'high'
","Mr .Kaushal, what a smashing n engaging performance n complete overhaul of Ur looks n physique n vocals . you truly make d movie our own. Plus Mr. Mohit too leaves a long lasting impression in his small but significant role. What a tight editing n screenplay n importance on detailing.. indeed the USP is it's focus on detailing right from close resemblance of reel life characters based on politicians ; sequence of events. Flick scores well on its two twists in the 2nd half taking it away from the predictable course ! Patriotism at all time high. Fills one with so much of high & urge to be of some worth to outlet beloved nation .. 1st half packed with so many teary moments. The scenes between Vicky & his sister & his niece are too good..
Also praiseworthy are the surgical strikes scenes & proper n adequate training and planning..
Director kudos to you for a great debut .
If only the music department had been as good!!",9,1,3,20 January 2019
Victory," a winner on hands
","what a fantastic soccer movie.. I mean if we keep aside some of the visible glitches, then it sure is a good watch. The players keeping their possible escape half the way down the match and putting forward their morale ,their self esteem ahead to give an eventful 2nd half amidst some nasty ploys adapted by the Germans!!! Its heartening watching PELE dribble around with 1 of his hands supporting his injured chest n that last goal off his feet is a treat to watch.I am surprised how come this movie is not even in all time gr8 sports movies lists of IMDb. Max Paine as always has given good performance too.. Some actors do sound a bit wooden but considering that most of them were not actual players....Highly recommended...",7,2,2,13 December 2012
Man on Fire," A revenge story with its heart in right place
","I always had doubts about this movie just being another action film. But m i glad i had my dilemma shooed off!!!! Brilliant is the word.. Full credit to the late director & his team for making such a beautiful movie... This ain't just a revenge film but it does have its emotional moments.. Mr. Washington is indeed a special man ,he is worth every frame n boy, he is a fine actor, whether he broods, tries smiling ,caring for the little child or wat he does best-killing, he does it with such conviction & intensity to leave the viewer asking for more..also good work done by the roles played by both the mother & the little girl.. The late director gives a simple revenge story his touch & what a fine product he delivers.. Be it the emotional scenes or the crime ones, he directs it with such finesse & with his facial closeups, frequent flashbacks keep the spectator on the edge...plus the background score keeps the momentum going with tinge of local music adding to it.. A must have in your watch list..",8,1,2,22 March 2014
