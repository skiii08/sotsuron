The Blair Witch Project," The Emperor Has No Clothes
","Remember when--as well as pitching a good idea and creating a positive buzz--people were expected to make a good movie in order to succeed?  The latest triumph of marketing over substance is THE BLAIR WITCH PRODUCT, the cinematic equivalent of a celebrity: famous for being famous, not for anything it does well.  A nice success story for film students--UNKNOWNS MAKE FILM ON A SHOESTRING! USE THEIR LIMITED EQUIPMENT AS AN ADVANTAGE! BECOME FLAVOR OF THE MONTH! ARE GIVEN LOTS OF MONEY FOR NEXT MEDIOCRE FILM AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER!--but hey, why not just have everyone send them a check for $3 and save the 87 minutes it takes to be up on your latest pop fad?",3,0,1,26 November 1999
American Beauty," No surprises here
","Well anyone who has seen Ordinary People, Twin Peaks, or The Ice Storm knows that all those seemingly placid suburbanites are really emotionally dead and sexually frustrated.  At least in Ordinary People there were values to lose. Movies like this one are so nihilistic that they just present the brave honest characters as being the ones like Ricky who don't bother to profess any values (because as we know anyone who does is a hypocrite) and are thus sensitive enough to see the beauty in what everyone else calls ugly.  I was bored.",5,1,3,10 October 1999
The Green Mile," Good but (COME ONE PEOPLE) not great
","Why do IMDB voters shoot every new movie up the all time great list? According to you people 6 of the top 30 movies of all time have been released in the last year including: American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, and now the Green Mile.Sigh.The movie was reasonably entertaining, especially the acting.  Hanks and Morse were all likable.  But it was too long, Mr. Jingles too cute, the exposition too Spielberg (think Saving Schindler's etc.)  Isn't anyone besides me tired of over long movies capping the story with a narrator on both sides to tell you what it means, just in case you are too stupid (as they clearly think you are) to figure it out from the film itself?The saving grace is I know that as soon as some other 'B' film is released next month (Stuart Little, anyone?) you people will shoot it up into the top ten and forget this flavor of the month.",6,0,2,22 December 1999
Any Given Sunday," You all are joking, right?
","Has to be the worst movie of the year by virtue of the following logic: 1) I love football 2) I love movies 3) I love Al Pacino 4) I found this movie to be loud, long, boring and pointless.  How can one make a boring movie about football!?  I hoped with all the real football talent in cameos that I might get a bit of an accurate look at what a football team is like. But Stone just uses his subject matter to jack up the volume.  A waste of time talent and money.  More objections at kenmorefield.com for those who care to read the extended diatribe.",1,8,14,20 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," Whoa people.
","This film was a competent entertainment piece, but to rank it among the best films of all time?  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film, but let's have a little perspective please.  The top 250 list seems to be heavily loaded with 'new releases.' Is this self created studio buzz, or just the opinions of people who haven't seen 1/2 the movies they are purporting the Sixth Sense to be better than?",7,0,0,21 September 1999
