Antz," in-freakin'-credible
","I have never seen such an amazing piece of animation in my life. Everything was so real and rich that at points you would swear that these were actual living creatures. The facial features, the range and flow of movement, everything! The dialouge was funny and energetic, Woody Allen was at his neurotic best and Christopher Walken's character almost seemed to be written for him. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact that, for the tots the dialogue was a little too rich and sometimes a little too vulgar (just a few minor infractions). There was also a scene where the ants head out to attack the termites and a pretty violent and bloody battle ensues, I will admit it was awesome but. . . (pretty intense for animation war). Overall a love, revolution, good vs. evil story; great dialogue, but parents be prepared.",10,0,0,14 November 1998
