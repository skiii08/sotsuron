Requiem for a Dream," Well I can't say I was disappointed
","Let me start of this review by saying I didn't think I would like this movie before I rented it. This is one of the movies that all of my friends talk about being a great but messed up movie. For years they have been telling me to see it so I finally gave in and rented it for fifty cents. I don't think I was ripped off but I can say that I wasn't entertained.I knew the movie was basically about drug addiction, but that was about it. What I found was exactly that, the only problem was it was missing a plot. Never taking any kind of drug or really being addicted to anything there was nothing I could relate to in this movie. There was also almost no one in the movie that you even slightly care about.There were some good parts to the movie. Both the way the movie was shot and the acting I enjoyed but unfortunately that dosn't save this movie.",4,1,3,29 August 2007
