Blade Runner 2049," A rare sequel passing the Voight-Kampff test
","Hollywood is usually predictable, but it can still surprise you sometimes. It can be an unpleasant surprise, like the guy who made the wonderful Lord of the Rings movies churning out the turgid mess that was the Hobbit trilogy. And it can be a welcome surprise, like a Blade Runner sequel being, you know, actually good. Count me as one of the fans who rolled their eyes at the idea of a follow-up to Ridley Scott's masterpiece... but 2049 won me over. No, it's not on par with *the* Blade Runner, and no, I don't believe in thirty years this will be part of the collective cinematic imagination like its predecessor... but it's still better than I expected: neat science fiction made with intelligence and care.Denis Villeneuve crafts a stylish, atmospheric piece, slow-paced but never boring. The introductory vignette with two men confronting each other in a remote outpost has a Sergio Leone vibe; the nightmarish future cities imagined by the great Philip K. Dick are portrayed with a mixture of dread and fascination. The cast is game, with always reliable Ryan Gosling as the lead and Harrison Ford giving his best performance in decades. Lovely Ana de Armas gives a star-making turn; the relationship between the protagonist and his holographic partner is the most interesting thing about the film, once again highlighting the question underpinning the whole Blade Runner mythos: what does it mean to be human?The antagonists are underwhelming. They are not exactly poorly made - even if some dialogues by smug demiurge Wallace (Leto) have the cringingly ponderous quality of Supervillain Fortune Cookies - but they are a little obvious compared to the original's memorable Roy Batty.Still, the script avoids many potential pitfalls - screenwriter Hampton Fancher (who worked on the first Blade Runner as well) was involved, and it shows. There is (thankfully) no definite answer to the 'Is Deckard a replicant?' question; on the other hand, we learn immediately that Officer K (Gosling) is in fact a replicant, instead of moronically trying to mimic that specific conundrum. K is as different a protagonist from Deckard as possible, a deliberate and clever choice. The plot references the events of the original but without parroting them Force Awakens-style. 2049 doesn't try to top the legendary 'tears in the rain' monologue, which would have encouraged unflattering comparisons; a similar scene at the end is entirely silent and works just beautifully. Once again, it's about finding a moment of grace and freedom in a decaying, oppressive world.7,5/10",8,6,14,6 November 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slow burn
","No doubt wars and revolutions, like any other human activity, can be derailed by the emotions of those involved at its higher levels: jealousy, fear, revenge - even love triangles. It could be a compelling premise, to see how far someone can be distracted by his personal feelings and forget the big picture while Rome burns, but this doesn't feel like what Mockingjay is doing - at all. The movie just assumes you are very, very interested in Katniss' (Jennifer Lawrence) angst over choosing between gloomy Gale (Liam Hemsworth), the stoic alpha male, and milquetoast Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), the endangered, sensitive one, now prisoner of the government led by white-bearded boogeyman Snow (Donald Sutherland).The idea of a protagonist who is supposed to lead a revolt but lacks natural charm and charisma is interesting, but too much time is devoted to a weepy Katniss brooding in an underground base as she is torn between Gale and Peeta. We get it - will you please go back to your revolution, lady? Never thought I'd miss murderous monkeys and poisonous fog, but there you are. A fine cast is wasted, with Woody Harrelson, Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman having little to do, and the electric Jena Malone - the stand-out of Catching Fire - getting a few seconds of screen-time.For all their flaws, I rather enjoyed the two previous movies; Katniss spent an inordinate amount of time worrying about Peeta in them as well, but the context was more cinematic. They had cliffhanger endings, but at least felt like complete entities in terms of structure. This is just truncated, a 'to be continued' bridge to the next chapter.5,5/10",5,5,10,30 May 2015
Alien 3," The great betrayal
","I have a great respect for David Fincher's craft as a director; even if I'm not a fan of most of his movies - with some exceptions, for example I loved Zodiac - I recognize their quality.However, I hate Alien 3. Fincher is mostly blameless, I guess, although his cinematic debut here doesn't show many traces of the superior visual control he has become famous for.No, the real culprit is the screenplay. Characters are uniformly one-note and unlikable (with the exception of Charles Dance's doctor), so different from the relatable space truckers of Alien and the well-sketched marines of Aliens. The troubled production history rears its ugly head here, with many rewrites and rejected ideas - the Xenomorphs were initially supposed to come to Earth, then to a forest planet inhabited by monks.Also, killing off Newt and Hicks like that, before the film even starts, feels like intentionally trolling the fans of Aliens (it certainly offended James Cameron, who was very vocal about it at the time). While I like Hicks a lot, he was expendable; Newt wasn't. Her relationship with Ripley was the emotional core of Aliens. Her lazy demise retroactively makes the climax of Cameron's classic, where Ripley goes back for her, quite pointless.Now, if they absolutely wanted a dark sequel where Newt died, it could have been done - but it should have felt like a central moment, in a situation where the protagonist had some agency. Imagine a climax where, say, Ripley has to choose between saving her 'daughter' or stopping some corporate goons from bringing the Xenomorphs to Earth. That would have been gut-wrenching.Instead, we get this limp mess. Once Newt and Hicks are dead and we find out Ripley is incubating a xenomorph and is therefore doomed, all the characters we like are gone; tension and audience investment whoosh out of the picture like air out of a punctured balloon.The series never recovered.4/10",4,4,5,29 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Of kids and Gungans
","I will say this in defence of The Phantom Menace: it is better than Attack of the Clones. This is the first act of Lucas' take on a reverse hero's journey, a fascinating idea with a deeply flawed execution.Acting is a mixed bag. Neeson's portrayal of Qui-Gon as a wise mentor works. McGregor is also decent, although his performance improved throughout the trilogy. Unfortunately, the reverse is true for lovely and talented Portman, who is passable here and becomes unwatchable in the next films. Throughout the movie, Lloyd's performance ranges from decent to poor. Pernilla August does well as Anakin's mother.Enough has been written about obnoxious comic relief sidekick Jar-Jar, who makes the galaxy-saving teddy bears Ewoks look positively Shakespearian by comparison. However, even his absence wouldn't have saved the movie. Dialogues are clunky, pacing weak: the Tatooine section *drags*. Also, the idea of introducing Anakin as a child doesn't work; when we met him in Clones he is essentially a different character, making this movie redudant. Another misstep is the introduction of Midichlorians, an unnecessary effort to give the once Zen-like 'Force' an inappropriate pseudo-scientific component.The Phantom Menace's highlight is the 'Duel of the Fates' lightsaber duel. It's a thrilling set-piece with a great score by Williams. Sadly, this powerful sequence is intercut with Jar-Jar's antics , mixing compelling action with juvenile material.6/10",6,6,9,27 May 2007
Skyfall," Home Alone
","A respectable entry after the lackluster Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is propelled by two strong performances: Craig's ruthless Bond and Bardem's ghoulish supervillain Silva.Set-pieces are also vastly improved, although with the occasional misstep - a stupid, unexciting brawl next to Komodo dragons being the worst.Skyfall suffers from the 'bad guy with ludicrously complex plans' syndrome, which exploded in modern action cinema after the memorable shenanigans of The Joker in The Dark Knight. Silva's impossible machinations all go off without a hitch and yet turn out to be an absurdly convoluted way to achieve revenge for someone who can blow up a building half a world away with a few clicks of his mouse.Good guys, on the other hand, are astoundingly thick. In the climactic finale, Bond and M lure Silva and his army to an isolated location and face them with no reinforcements aside for an old caretaker. I understand preventing civilian casualties, but why not bring, you know, MORE MI6 AGENTS? It's kind of their job. It makes no sense even for a series featuring henchmen with steel-capped teeth or deadly bowler hats.I am also doubtful about delving into Bond's past. It's fairly well done, but in these long-established sagas the protagonist's past is best left vague, imagining it being part of the implicit pact between creators and viewers. This isn't an origin story, and it isn't LOST: after 22 movies, I didn't need to see the hole young James crawled into when his parents died.6,5/10",7,5,7,2 October 2014
Marie Antoinette," Let them eat cake
","Although watching Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is akin to enduring Chinese water torture, there are lessons to learn from it.First, if you make a biopic, it's wise NOT TO CUT OUT the most relevant events of that person's life. Examples: don't make a movie about Hitler which ends in 1939. Don't conclude a biography of Julius Caesar in 45 b.C. And don't film a Marie Antoinette biopic without showing her trial and execution.Second, if your protagonists elicit bored irritation from the audience, it's not a good thing. Personally, I have always regarded the French Revolution as a great event in human history, but I don't think Marie Antoinette (or her unfortunate husband) was the devil or deserved death. Still, after watching for two hours these parasites thrive in useless luxury, I positively wanted them to die. Movies like Marie Antoinette could probably turn even the staunchest monarchist into Robespierre.Third, I am beginning to think Kirsten Dunst isn't a very good actress (evidence: her little range, her one-note acting), but she is not drawing much attention to the fact thanks to her good looks and to some promising early performances.Fourth, expensive costumes and set design (the whole thing looks like a glorified Barbie house made with an unlimited budget), plus a slick collection of popular and monstrously anachronistic songs do NOT make a good or even a decent movie.Last, if you are the daughter of a powerful director and feel depressed because your life is a golden cage, you should seek professional advice rather than making a tedious, somewhat semi-autobiographical movie with an idealized protagonist with whom you identify.3/10",3,3,4,14 March 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's not the years, it's the mileage
","There are critics who point fingers at Raiders - and Jaws, and Star Wars - because, regardless of their quality, these movies kickstarted the new wave of setpiece-focused blockbusters, with a detrimental effect on Hollywood. However, Raiders is no more responsible for The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor than J.R.R. Tolkien is to blame for The Sword of Truth, Bram Stoker for Twilight, or Isaac Asimov for Transformers. There is a main factor which makes Raiders a timeless masterpiece and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a piece of garbage: RESTRAINT. Consider the elegance of action scenes. Spielberg's setpieces here are stylish, kinetic, with attention to spatial relationships, cause and effect. Every action by the hero has a direct result on his surroundings, and vice versa (see the legendary prologue, the iconic truck scene). Practical effects and stunts allow for a realistic, gritty feel... which is lost when you indulge in absurd acrobatics and frames cluttered by CGI stuff (hello, Star Wars prequels!).In Raiders, the protagonist gets dusty, bloody, beaten up: every battle takes a PHYSICAL TOLL on him, much like in the first Die Hard (while in the last ones John McClaneis essentially a superhero, which DEFIES THE WHOLE POINT of it). If action has visible consequences, it's compelling. On the other hand, show our hero slamming on a hard surface after a fifty feet fall and walking away without a bruise (hello, Hobbit trilogy!), and everything INSTANTLY becomes boring. And then we have the 'Grandpa Syndrome', which pushes aged directors to film movies their grandchildren 'can watch too' - laudable for family comedies, often disastrous for other genres (hello, Greedo shooting first!).The plot shows restraint as well. Everything is trimmed down, elegantly simple. A clear goal (find the Ark). High stakes (if the Nazis find it first, they will gain terrible powers). Non-stop tension: Indy and Marion are constantly chased, on the run, at disadvantage, out of time (much like Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back and unlike in the SW prequels). Every scene advances the plot, every dialogue defines characters; there is not a single wasted frame or line.Of course, credits goes also to the fantastic script by Kasdan, with its quotable lines and the most wickedly ironic ending in action cinema; to Ford's effortlessly charismatic turn; to John Williams' soundtrack, which is the stuff of legends.A classic all directors and scriptwriters should revisit before inflating their blockbusters with useless bloat. Raiders works as well now as it did thirty years ago... while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Attack of the Clones, The Desolation of Smaug and A Good Day to Die Hard feel already stale.10/10",10,5,9,12 March 2015
Minority Report," If there's a flaw, it's human - it always is
","Spielberg does it again. Minority Report is another fine film with a tone-deaf epilogue. It's hard to put my frustration into words. How many brilliantly crafted, intelligent science-fiction flicks do we get today? Very few... and, when one finally arrives, it ends with a whimper.But I should have seen it coming. Spielberg is a peerless visual storyteller, but he is an odd choice to direct a movie based on a story by a pessimist like Philip K. Dick. It's like John Hughes adapting Lovecraft.Minority Report takes place in a future where three 'Pre-Cogs' can predict murders, so the Pre-Crime Unit led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) can stop the killers in advance. When the Pre-Cogs see him shooting a man he doesn't even know, Anderton finds himself on the run, trying to unravel what's happening.Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow and Samantha Norton all give solid performances. For most of its running time the movie is clever, thrilling, fun, Spielberg at his best; there are some really neat scenes, like the vision of the first murder and Anderton's rush against time to prevent it, or the sequence with Anderton and Agatha evading the Pre-Crime.Alas, during its last act Minority Report collapses; it reaches several potentially interesting endings and ignores them all, choosing a sappy cop-out.Still, what precedes it is good enough to recommend the movie - if only to ponder what could have been.7,5/10",8,7,9,29 August 2007
In Bruges," Like Tottenham
","There is something to admire about In Bruges. It's a black comedy, which is the hardest genre to make, as it comes with all possible pitfalls of both humor and drama. It's ambitious in themes and symbolism. The script makes an ingenious use of set-ups and pay-offs: every element or character introduced in the first half has a relevant consequence in the second - a sort of Chekhov's armory.And its premise is intriguing: killers Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) hide in Bruges after a botched assassination, waiting for further instructions by their boss Harry (Fiennes). Ray is fuming with boredom and irritation; older, pensive Ken enjoys the atmosphere of the enchanting medieval town - until Harry orders him to kill Ray.Writing in this movie has something of a cult following. Humor is subjective, but I found it hit-and-miss. See, the problem isn't the amount of jokes about gays, blacks, yankees and dwarfs (the latter turned into a painful running gag); Tarantino, for one, thrives on this politically incorrect stuff - except he is actually funny, has a point to make and a gift with words this script doesn't display. Smug cynicism is mistaken for humor; we are supposed to laugh because a man child is obsessed with 'midgets'. You can wax philosophical, portray Bruges as a sort of purgatory, fill the movie with imagery straight from Bosch... but, after the fourth dwarf joke, your lofty ambitions scrape against your facile humor - it wasn't that funny even the first time, McDonagh. See a confrontation between Ray and Harry when a pregnant woman angrily stops the armed men waving guns in her hotel and, when they agree to go kill each other outside, quips 'You people are crazy!'. This isn't 'deep', it's a sketch. Confront it with another aborted Mexican standoff - the one at the end of Pulp Fiction, which had humor, tension and the affecting musings of a man rethinking his life.Ray, who has the central arc, is unbelievable: a killer who acts like a goofy 10-years-old and switches between moping for his hatred of Bruges, pursuing a local girl (Clémence Poésy) and feeling devastated for accidentally shooting a kid. That's not a character, it's a coat rack for a writer's unused ideas. More coherent and interesting is Gleeson's melancholic Ken. For the definitive black comedy about anti-heroes dealing with honor, karma and atonement, watch Pulp Fiction. For more light-hearted crime comedies, good picks are Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - and, for a straight-up comedy about neurotic killers, Richard Armitage's Grosse Pointe Blank.What's odd is, McDonagh's following (and better) movie Seven Psychopaths is the opposite of this - a paper-thin premise, but a script which is actually amusing.5,5/10",5,6,10,5 September 2015
John Wick," Keanu's dog day
","Although I will never forgive Keanu Reeves for ruining Coppola's Dracula with a legendary terrible performance, he is not an inherently bad actor. Like a well-honed tool , Keanu is fine if put in the right place; if misplaced (say, as a 19th century upper-class Englishman), he is disastrous. Here Keanu is ideally cast as titular assassin John Wick; the part exploits his wiry physicality and doesn't stretch his limited range, requiring him to project deadly efficiency as he slaughters Russian mobsters who killed his dog. The latter may sound stupid but it's actually the smartest decision in the movie, as it places the story firmly in comic book territory, which fits the hyper-stylized violence seen here. The script also features a few clever touches, like golden coins used as currency for special services in the criminal underworld (such as corpse disposal) or a hotel known as a truce zone for killers; again, an appropriate comic book feel.Director Stahelski uses his experience as stunt coordinator to craft energetic set-pieces, peaking in Wick's attack to an underground pool. There is a great moment when the camera pans laterally showing the silhouette of a mobster shot against a blue panel, then follows another thug until Wick takes him down, all while the music throbs in the background.The cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Adrianne Palicki and Michael Nyqvist; the latter steals the movie with a combination of sharp malevolence and detached sense of humor, like when he recalls Wick killing three men with a pencil then walks next to one of his henchmen and casually mimics a stab at his throat.As far as revenge/power fantasies go, this one at least is competently made.6,5/10",7,4,9,3 September 2015
Fury," John Wayne's Platoon
","Perhaps the biggest surprise in Fury is how the last wave of murderous Nazis is not led by Hitler himself, with Brad Pitt's heroic Sarge chucking a spear at Adolf and nearly killing him.A movie with major identity problems, Fury starts off as some kind of Casualties Of War drama with a wide-eyed rookie (Logan Lerman) pushed around by hardened comrades and a ruthless sergeant; then, with a complete 180, it turns into over-the-top schlock as Pitt and his men slaughter like a million enemies who charge at them with much trampling of boots and ominous singing - there is a priceless bit when the approaching Germans sound like they are intoning the Carmina Burana acappella style. The last act plays like a zombie movie, as the scarred, barking Nazis besiege the protagonists, whose brave deeds are accompanied by a soundtrack of heroic trumpets and mournful strings. It's so portentous I chuckled quite a bit, such as when a shovel-wielding Nazi dives into the tank attempting to club Pitt.The best sequence is a tense confrontation between tanks attempting to outmaneuver each other. It's a solid set-piece, and lacks the rah-rah rhetoric of the final battle.5/10",5,8,17,8 November 2015
Inglourious Basterds," That's a bingo
","Quentin Tarantino is known for his abundant use of violence and profanities, but his subversiveness runs a lot deeper than that. Consider Inglourious Basterds, his first war movie, a choral story with intertwining plot lines set in Nazi-occupied France during WWII.It's amazing how Tarantino treats conversations like set-pieces: with his great ear for vivid dialogues he crafts magnificently tense scenes of verbal sparring, the best involving British officer Fassbender and his men, all disguised as Nazis, trapped in an increasingly dangerous discussion with a clingy Gestapo Major. See how Basterds plays with different languages - many conversations take place in (subtitled) German and French, with cunning manipulator Landa (Christoph Waltz, stealing the movie with his affably villainous performance), a skilled polyglot, ably switching between them.In fact, the only battle scenes in Basterds occur in the propaganda movie-within-the-movie Nation's Pride, a stream of gruesome killings witnessed by an enthusiastic movie theater full of Nazis - Tarantino takes a jab at the audience' expectations, much like Joss Whedon would do a few years later in the horror genre with The Cabin in the Woods.Tarantino also draws a clear parallel between brutalities committed for the sake of the good cause and those perpetrated by villains. Consider how the audience shares the point of view of fallen Germans savagely branded by the Basterds, or how the appearance of the 'Bear Jew' is akin to that of a serial killer in a slasher movie, emerging from a dark cave preceded by the ominous thuds of his baseball bat. This is the spiritual successor of Robert Aldrich's queasily brilliant The Dirty Dozen.Performances are fine, with the already mentioned Waltz, Pitt in one of his canny turns proving he is a much better character actor than conventional romantic lead, plus Fassbender, Kruger and Mélanie Laurent in a star-making turn as the movie's real protagonist. 7,5/10",8,3,5,30 August 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Oh, it's... beautiful
","Rogue One ('How the Death Star plans were stolen') is an entertaining flick with strong moments and a few issues; inferior to the original trilogy and superior to the prequels, I'd rate it higher than The Force Awakens as well because at least it's not a remake of A New Hope.The film does plenty of things right - the look of it, in particular, is perfect; sets, effects and costumes are great, with a 'lived-in' feel which is classic Star Wars. Edwards is a fine visual director, his set-pieces are neat and stylish. Rogue One also features a rare case of clever retcon: the Death Star's fatal structural flaw was implanted as a revenge by a Rebel-sympathizing scientist. Not bad.Also, the final hallway scene restores in a minute all the sense of menace Darth Vader lost with the Attack of the Clones - the one prequel I completely dislike, as it portrayed Anakin Skywalker as an emo teen.The main issue is haphazard characterization. Characters are well-cast and competently acted but they are sketchily drawn, missing moments of development which would have made them pop to life.Felicity Jones's Jyn Erso (Dark Forces reference duly noted) has two father figures but interacts meaningfully with neither, and goes in the space of a few hours (though admittedly eventful hours) from cynical loner to idealistic leader making pep talks about hope. Diego Luna's Cassian has a promising 'Han shoots Greedo' scene at the beginning but then we never learn the reason of his devotion to the Rebel Alliance. Forrest Whitaker's interesting Saw Gerrera gets little screen-time after a long build-up.Donnie Yen has some cool moments but blind monk Chirrut and trigger-happy pal Baze (Wen Jiang) feel more like NPCs with great stats in a role-playing game than fleshed-out characters. The Alan Tudyk-voiced robot (possibly inspired by KOTOR's HK-47) is droll.Riz Ahmed's pilot is underwritten for such a crucial role; we don't learn what made him desert the Empire, but we do get a confrontation with a lie-detecting octopus (?) which is supposed to drive him insane but just leaves him a bit weird for a couple of scenes. It's a silly moment which sums up the movie's aimless approach to characterization (either cut the scene or give it meaningful consequences).The lack of arcs and developed relationships make several supposedly emotional moments feel unearned - like Baze calling Jyn 'little sister' near the end (I think that was the second time they spoke to each other) and Bodhi's 'For you, Galen!' (the two never share a scene).In fact, the more coherent character is villain Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn): a smug, amoral officer who is way over his head dealing with bigger fishes like Vader and Tarkin.Speaking of Tarkin, he is played by a CGI version of Peter Cushing; although it looks good as far as these things go - and they don't go THAT far yet, a seamless CGI human is still impossible without the uncanny valley effect - pasting a dead actor's appearance into a movie he didn't choose to be a part of, in a role he had no creative influence over, is creepy. As iconic as Cushing was, just recast the part.There are also some puzzingly strange narrative choices. The pilot in the final battle should be flying a ship, not plugging cables. To say nothing of Krennic, who (SPOILERS) is shot down not by Jyn, whose family he destroyed, but by Cassian, with whom he has zero connections. Although Krennic's final moments - hoist with his own petard - are fine.Rogue One was just a few tweaks away from greatness... still, for me it's the best Star Wars movie in thirty years.8/10",8,5,10,30 December 2016
Shakespeare in Love," A stolen season
","London, 16th century: young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) faces a bad case of writer's block, not making any progress in the comedy commissioned by Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) and his associate Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson). The work's title? 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'. Enters Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), beautiful lady with a passion for theater, who, disguised as a man, gets the role of Romeo. Will falls for her and their affair ends up shaping the final version of 'Romeo and Juliet'.The two leads have a nice chemistry. Paltrow is delightful as Viola; Fiennes is likable as Shakespeare without losing the character's edge. But I enjoy the performances by Wilkinson, Rush and Dench (who is great as Queen Elizabeth) even more.In fact, the movie features a group of colourful secondary characters played by an interesting cast, including also Imelda Staunton as Viola's nurse, Colin Firth as Viola's boorish suitor, Ben Affleck as a famous thespian and Rupert Everett as playwright Christopher Marlowe.Frankly, I don't believe Shakespeare in Love deserved its stunning success at the Academy Awards. It had too many great competitors for Best Picture in 1998, including a genuine masterpiece like The Thin Red Line. As for Best Writing, it prevailed over The Truman Show, another modern classic and personal favourite.Still, I bear this movie no ill will. It's a charming little thing.7/10",7,10,13,27 August 2007
Passengers," These are not robot questions
","The premise of this sci-fi romance/drama had potential. During an interstellar voyage, passenger Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up from hibernation 90 years before the arrival due to a system error. He is the only person awake on the whole gigantic spaceship apart from a robot bartender (Michael Sheen), while all other thousands human passengers are still asleep in hibernation. After useless attempts to repair his pod, Jim briefly enjoys the luxurious life aboard before loneliness nearly drives him suicidal.At this point he decides to awake an attractive female passenger, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), to have some company in his hopeless situation...I've heard people complain that the premise is creepy, but that's the whole point. If you take away Jim's moral dilemma and selfish choice, and have both passengers awake due to random circustances, you get the most boring movie imaginable (and it's not as if Passengers right now is incredibly lively and exciting).MAJOR SPOILERS Sadly, Passengers chickens out in a last act where the two leads cooperate to save the ship, the morally dubious Jim becomes flat-out heroic, Aurora forgives him and the two live together their remaining years in a bittersweet conclusion which is far too sweet and not nearly bitter enough.
The premise was screaming for something darker, like Aurora going to sleep on the repaired pod and Jim resigning himself to loneliness; even better, Jim
dies and a half-crazed Aurora, now alone on the ship for months in the same situation as Jim was, starts eyeing the pod with a handsome male passenger, implying the cycle of selfishness and deception may soon start again. END SPOILERSProduction values are solid; the leads are fine and so are Sheen and Laurence Fishburne in the only relevant supporting roles. Pity about that last act.5,5/10",5,5,8,24 May 2019
Zootopia," What do you call a three-humped camel?
","Slick, funny and at times rather clever, Zootopia is the kind of animated movie even the most miserable curmudgeon would have a hard time hating: it looks bright and pleasant, features likable characters and manages to sneak a few complex messages about prejudice and civil societies into a neat piece of family entertainment.A rookie cop bunny (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a con artist fox (voice by Jason Bateman) pair up to crack a case of mysterious disappearances and predators gone wild in the animal-inhabited city of Zootopia. Film noir and buddy movie tropes get an affectionate parodic twist: the water buffalo chief wants results, an arctic shrew is a crime boss, the DMV is managed by sloths, and so on.Special praise because, in a cinematic age of excess and useless padding, the film is well-paced and runs at a brisk (for today's standard) 105 minutes - it leaves you wanting more, instead of hoping it will finally end.Unsurprising, and for once deserved, box office triumph.8/10",8,10,18,29 March 2016
The 13th Warrior," Eaters of the dead
","A famous box office bomb, this Michael Crichton adaptation is better than its reputation - as far as non-supernatural versions of mythological sagas go (Beowulf in this case), it definitely beats Petersen's Troy and Fuqua's King Arthur.Directed with a deft hand by veteran John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), the movie boasts solid action scenes and a compelling premise: Arabian traveler Ahmed (Banderas) reluctantly joins a band of Vikings facing the mysterious Wendol, a savage horde of raiders with a beast-like appearance. Fine battles aside, there are a few neat moments: for example, a clever and effective 'character slowly overcomes a language barrier' montage.The biggest flaw is how, Banderas aside, nearly all fellowship members remain underdeveloped - with the exceptions of leader Buliwyf and Ahmed's pal Herger, everyone else is a bearded, grim cypher. They should have reduced the group, developed every character and called it The Seventh Warrior instead.7/10",7,2,2,18 October 2015
Hostel," Torturing idiots
","What's up with horror movies today? Either they are wimpy, toothless stuff or they rely only on violence, forgetting character development, pacing and other essential elements of the genre. Both extremes stink: Hostel falls squarely in the latter group. Three sex-starved friends reach a town in Eastern Europe and meet a group of attractive, suspiciously friendly local girls. One after another the friends disappear, only to wake up in a dark room tied to a chair.Torture is not interesting - and it's not scary or entertaining, just unpleasant. What's sad is the idea beneath Hostel had potential. Every time one of the protagonists vanishes there are intriguing bits with a creepy atmosphere and the growing realization something horrible is happening. Hostel features also an attempt at subtext about the comparison between sexual tourism and 'torture tourism' by sadists who pay the hostel to bring them victims. But the movie squanders mood and social commentary and goes for cheap, gratuitous gore. The unnecessarily long first act is a crass teen comedy, the last part essentially plays as a snuff movie - 'tonally inconsistent' doesn't quite convey it. Worth no viewings.1/10",1,4,6,3 August 2007
Knives Out," Postmodern Poirot
","I didn't like Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi but this is a clever little comedy/murder mystery with some interesting twists; Rian's brand of irreverent, postmodern humor works better here than in Star Wars, where winking at the audience while mocking characters and lore was noxious to the whole thing. The cast is great and efficiently delivers the required ping-pong of quips and zingers.See also the much darker (and superior) thriller/black comedy Sleuth with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, which probably served as one of the inspirations for this, starting with the setting, the secluded mansion of an eccentric mystery writer.7/10",7,5,8,20 March 2020
Black Book," Slick but unexceptional
","I am no Paul Verhoeven fan, but I notice he is one of those rare directors liked both by the lowbrow and the highbrow critic; the former enjoys his penchant for nudity and violence, the latter appreciates the self-consciously campy, 'wink-wink' quality of his movies.Zwartboek is compelling. Pacing is tight and Carice van Houten gives a powerful performance in the main role. The rest of the cast is solid, but van Houten owns the movie with her nuanced portrayal.But Verhoeven, known for being daring, chickened out. Rachel, a young Jewish woman whose family was murdered by Nazis, joins the Dutch resistance and becomes a Mata Hari-like spy. However, Muntze (Sebastian Koch), the German officer she sleeps with to gather informations, happens to be a decent, charming fellow who refuses to kill POWs and civilians and yearns for peace and love - so much, in fact, that she falls in love with him. Two days after meeting Rachel, Muntze finds out she is a spy and, unbelievably, it doesn't bother him. Instead of having her arrested and executed, they have an earnest chat and continue their relationship. Wait, what?The problem is, making him so squeaky-clean robs the movie of any sense of moral conflict on Rachel's side. The character of Muntze should have had more of an edge.Likewise, Rachel's duties as she pretends to work with the Nazis are quite anodyne and neutral - she has to copy reports and decorate rooms with Nazi flags. You never get from this cooperation the feeling of dreadful moral compromise which would have given the heroine more depth and self-loathing.Given the premise, Zwartboek is surprisingly tame. Sure, van Houten spends so much time bare-breasted that she probably caught a cold but, for a war movie about a Mata Hari kind of spy, the result is almost bland and pulls too many punches - with some exceptions, like a painful scene of humiliation ending with a shower of manure.Zwartboek lacks subtlety in terms of characterization: not a surprise if you know Verhoeven. There isn't any depth to these people; yes, we get the final twist, but it isn't as earth-shattering as Verhoeven seems to believe: not all German officers were monsters and not all resistance members were saints. Duh. Hardly a revelation.This is competent film-making with good performances, nothing more.6,5/10",6,10,15,10 August 2008
Hot Fuzz," Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled 'Aaaaaaah'?
","I confess my first reaction to Hot Fuzz was thinking it was droll but a little disappointing after the faster-paced, hilarious Shaun of the Dead. How wrong I was... now I believe this is the funniest Edgar Wright movie. The first act is slower than Shaun, yes, but the script is meticulously crafted, a comedic masterpiece of setups and payoffs.Pegg and Frost are great as the by-the-book city cop and his sloppy partner who have to unravel the mystery behind the killings in a model British village. The duo is surrounded by an inspired cast; Broadbent and Dalton shine as, respectively, the jovial Chief and a smug suspect. Considine and Spall have minor roles but get their share of amusing moments. And a brief scene featuring cameos by Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy is a thing of beauty.Wright is, quite simply, the best comedy director working today. Unlike most of his colleagues he doesn't just rely on witty dialogue and funny performances: he makes the movie *visually* entertaining as well, with his rapid-fire montages, clever transitions and the way he can turn a mundane scene into something hysterical simply by the way he frames a shot.Worth multiple viewings - in fact, Hot Fuzz gets better every time.8,5/10",8,10,12,11 February 2019
Troy," Toy horse
","It would take a cinematic genius to turn one of the greatest epic sagas ever narrated into a worthy two-hours movie. Alas, director Wolfgang Petersen is no such genius, just a competent craftsman.A passable historical epic in its own right, Troy is a disastrous adaptation - every choice reeks of bad art, from hilarious title cards to dialogues alternating between sub-Whedonesque pithy banter and lofty one-liners a critic astutely described as 'faux legendary'. Individual duels are glossy and energetic, but set-pieces with a wider scale fall disastrously flat, lacking the creativity of, say, Jackson's for the Lord of the Rings saga.Casting is canny, with Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Peter O'Toole being the highlights. Pitt is decent, but fails to capture the terrifying side of Achilles - among the many miscalculations of the script, the omission of the carnage in the river with its water turning red didn't help. Usually reliable Cox and Gleeson are embarrassing: blame writing and direction, since they've abundantly shown elsewhere they can act. Bloom is a non-entity smartly cast as vapid Paris. Kruger is lovely and that's all the role needs - I have to smile at the 'not THAT beautiful' comments, as that's exactly what the character gets in the poem too.The script is visibly uncomfortable with its source material. It's not just that the Achilles-Patroclus relationship is amusingly turned into a more blockbuster-friendly 'cousins' kinship. The biggest mistake is erasing the mythical element so crucial in the saga, with gods meddling in the war, fighting among mortals, their fates deeply interwoven with the human protagonists' - without this, it becomes the rather mundane history of a siege. I guess they assumed modern audiences wouldn't appreciate battles involving beings with supernatural powers. Oh wait, Star Wars, X-Men, Lord of the Rings... never mind.A few scenes glimmer in the midst of Troy (like the poignant confrontation between Achilles and Priam), the power of the source material shining through this lackluster execution.6/10",6,3,4,13 August 2014
Insomnia," When a villain protagonist becomes an anti-hero
","There is a scene in the original Insomnia where the protagonist (there played by Stellan Skarsgard, in this remake by Al Pacino), desperate to obtain a damaged bullet to tamper with the evidence of an ongoing investigation, approaches a dog in a dark alley and kills it. The remake mimics the scene, except the dog shot by Pacino is dead already. In a nutshell, this shows the difference between the two movies.Before this sounds like some kind of anti-remake crusade, I'll say Nolan's movie surpasses the Norwegian original from many points of view.Performances are stronger, led by a nicely low-key turn by Pacino, who reminds us what a great thespian he can be when he isn't hamming it up. The character of the killer is more developed, here aptly played by Robin Williams in one of those creepy clear-eyed, smug-faced turns of his. Dialogues are crisp without getting too cozy, cinematography makes an interesting use of colors and light.So, where does this thriller - focused on two veteran Homicide detectives searching for a killer in Alaska - goes wrong? It erases most of the moral ambiguity of the original. Skarsgard's dark protagonist was genuinely unsettling - a lost man who quickly sinks to ignominious lows to cover up his own mistakes. Here, Pacino is flawed in a much safer and more traditional way. The extent this remake goes to soften his main character into something more palatable to a mass audience is actually rather amusing in a meta kind of way.The greatest betrayal, though, is the ending, with the martyred hero redeemed by his own blood who passes the torch to Swank's young idealistic cop with a smile and a moral lesson. From the director of the dangerous and abrasive Memento, it's a real shame.7,5/10",7,4,6,9 March 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," World's still the same, there's just less in it
","The last thirty minutes of Pirates of the Caribbean 3 feature plenty of swashbuckling adventure and a few brave surprises. Sadly, what precedes them isn't always as thrilling. Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and ex-villain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) attempt to locate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), while Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) controls the Flying Dutchman's captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and his monstrous crew.Within the first two hours there are droll moments, but also a terrifying amount of bloat: lots of scenes should not have made it past the editing room. See, for example, the hallucination with the multiple Jacks, an interminable piece of slapstick which goes on and on. The whole movie needed a good trimming; director Verbinski has many qualities, but brevity isn't one of them. Knightley is a firecracker as usual; Bloom is still a bland actor, but his Will has grown into a darker, more interesting character. The great Bill Nighy brings pathos and a delighted wickedness to the role of Davy Jones. Depp and Rush have fun hamming it up.The Black Pearl is still the best of the trilogy by a (nautical) mile, but this final chapter surpasses the second (which was a bloated mess) and offers enough exciting set-pieces to make it watchable.6/10",6,35,66,23 May 2007
Ready Player One," Philip K. Dumb
","I love Spielberg - he made four of my favorite movies of all time - but file this one under his 'missed opportunities' section.There was a great premise buried deep behind this, a cyberpunk quest with intriguing philosophical elements. The execution is juvenile, clunky and masturbatory though. What's truly baffles me is how set-pieces are visually busy and tiresome: it is, in a word, tawdry, which is astonishing for Spielberg.This CGI MacGuffin hunt feels more like a barrage of MMORPG trailers than Blade Runner. Pity, really.5.5/10",5,2,2,22 June 2020
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt
","Since I am a fan of both John Le Carré and Gary Oldman, this looked like a perfect match. For once I was not disappointed: Tinker Tailor is a fine adaptation and a masterful spy thriller.(Now do Smiley's People, please, keeping Oldman and the same writers. The Honourable Schoolboy we can skip, as it's both harder to adapt and, to be honest, not quite as good as the other two Quest for Karla books).Oldman, one of the most versatile actors around, is phenomenal as George Smiley. Smiley - Le Carré 's owlish, middle-aged spy who is essentially the anti-James Bond - investigates a Russian double agent inside the British Secret Service. Oldman perfectly captures both Smiley's wounded humanity and his keen intelligence - a quiet, unassuming man who, in the dangerous world of spy games, can turn into a skilled hunter.The stellar supporting cast - including John Hurt, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, David Dencik and Ciaran Hinds - is also excellent. I have to say Hinds is underserved by the otherwise perfect script though; his Roy Bland (nomen omen...) is the only significant character who remains a blank. Everyone else is so well-sketched, he sort of sticks out.Director Tomas Alfredson crafts a meticulous, intelligent movie, one which requires attention but rewards it with a tense, compelling viewing experience, the thinking man's thriller.8,5/10",9,12,13,12 November 2018
Alien," I admire its purity
","Less is more in the horror genre. Give us a fight between a giant humanoid albino and an octopus-like creature and we'll think of the special effects guy eating a taco in front of his PC screen as he is rendering the octopus' slime. Show us a maze of dark corridors where a monster may be hiding, and our pulse rate rises. We don't need to be bludgeoned in the head with horrific imagery: glimpsing something creepy out of the corner of the eye is more than enough.Alien's closest kinship is not to the exhilarating but vastly different sequel Aliens, and certainly not to the clunky prequel Prometheus, but to its contemporaries Jaws and The Thing, horror movies as lean and taut as hungry tigers, masterpieces tapping on primordial fears. For Alien, it's predators and rape: the first is self-explanatory, the second a disturbing undertone running throughout the movie, with the creature's attacks portrayed as increasingly sexualized in nature.The quintessential contained sci-fi/horror, Alien's iconic status is a product of many factors: Scott's masterful direction, a fine cast, Giger's still unparalleled reptilian monster and O'Bannon's script, as vicious and essential as a bear trap ready to snap. The brilliance of the premise - reminiscent of an episode of Van Vogt's The Voyage of the Space Beagle - lies in implying a dark, almost Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious looming threats, both horribly dangerous and beyond mankind's understanding. Then of course came Prometheus and started putting tags on what was best left merely alluded to.At the end, Ian Holm's Ash says it best: 'Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.' 10/10",10,4,6,12 March 2014
Interstellar," Do not go gentle into that good night
","When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction.The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all.The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar.Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems.See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf.Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter.At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act.When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here.6,5/10",6,3,4,5 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Force ain't with Disney here
","Yeah, first world problems, I know. And yet guess what? It still bothers me. Stories help shape who we are, and this movie is another act of vandalism towards one of my favorite stories of all time.The film is glossy and fast-paced in the usual J.J. Abrams kind of way. I was ready to cut it some slack after Rian Johnson stomped in and obliterated in The Last Jedi all the setups J.J. had planted in his (admittedly mediocre) The Force Awakens. Not THIS much slack, though. The movie is a mess, breaking the lore and destroying any kind of victory our heroes had accomplished in the original trilogy.Say what you want of Return of the Jedi but its climax, with Luke defeating the Emperor by refusing to embrace the Dark Side and triggering his father's redemption, was a thematically perfect conclusion which should never have been undone. This should have taken placed 300 years after Return of the Jedi and let the original heroes and their victories rest in peace.It's becoming a monkey's paw kind of curse: I didn't like (most of) the Expanded Universe and I got these; I was bored by the Force Awakens and Johnson 'subverted my expectations' in The Last Jedi; now Abrams returns and delivers this desperate thing, reeking of damage control and course-correction. Words fail to convey how overstuffed this movie is. It's like asking for a ham sandwich and getting a giant baguette filled with roasted mutton and dripping with marmalade, goat cheese and peanut butter - and you have to eat it while running at full speed. It's nauseating in its excess.A few words about Rey. She had a good beginning; her introduction in Episode Seven was excellent, among the few things of value in this whole trilogy. However, in spite of Daisy Ridley's charisma, she is such an unrelatable character, with no growth and no arc.What made Luke compelling was his progression from naive everyman to wise and powerful Jedi. Rey is already there from the start in terms of skills, spine and moral fortitude. It's a monumental storytelling mistake - an overpowered protagonist can work in a power fantasy (James Bond, Mission Impossible, John Wick...), NOT IN THE HERO'S JOURNEY. At the end, like a cuckoo's egg in the nest of the Skywalker story, Rey ends up stealing all the achievements of the original heroes.Finn was a potentially great character sidelined to hollering sidekick (I will be very happy if I never hear poor John Boyega shout 'Rey!' ever again). Isaac, one of the best actors of his generation, is wasted as the quip-delivering hotshot. Driver gets the only memorable performance in the whole thing; while Kylo's arc is a mess, Driver manages to pierce the barrage of noise, explosions and frantic hunts for MacGuffins.Sadly, J.J. Abrams is a copycat: he can imitate something cool but does not understand what made it cool. Take the scene with ghost Luke rising the X-Wing from the sea. It mirrors the one with Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, but THAT was awe-inspiring because we had never seen anything of the sort. However, in The Last Jedi Rey lifts half a mountain, earlier in this movie she almost pulls a bigger spaceship out of the sky... so Luke's display is rather pathetic. I was almost expecting a smash cut to Rey rising from the sea a whole Star Destroyer as Luke is startled and a sad trombone plays.It's funny. Abrams made the safest, most unimaginative sequel possible, then Rian Johnson gleefully whacked all the story hooks for the third movie, so when Abrams is kicked on stage again he starts babbling incoherent nonsense. As J.J. stands under the limelight sweating, he smashes Rian's story in retaliation.This is what happens when you don't plan ahead. Sure, even the original trilogy changed stuff during its production, but there is a difference between reworking your initial ideas and making *everything* up as you go along. It's possible to create good Star Wars content in the modern era (Rogue One, The Mandalorian), but not with this lack of foresight.4,5/10",4,197,412,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," You're gonna need a bigger Mech
","Pretty much the textbook definition of 'fun summer movie', Pacific Rim takes a Lovecraftian scenario with giant Cthulhu-like monsters ('kaiju') popping out of a portal in the middle of the ocean and mankind building giant robots to face them.Visuals are striking, with humongous reptilian creatures rising from the waves under a pouring rain and spectacular battles in cities laid to waste.The most interesting gimmick is how Mechs ('Jaegers') require two pilots to work, and they need to share a neural connection: the better their mutual understanding, the more effective the robot. A promising plot point which could have been explored more.The script is serviceable. It moves fast and introduces some basic relationships and conflicts, like the broken hero who lost a loved one (Charlie Hunnam), the rookie with a personal vendetta against the monsters (cute Rinko Kikuchi), the stoic gravel-voiced leader (Idris Elba), the arrogant rival like Iceman in Top Gun - who, incidentally, is quite indistinguishable from the protagonist: if you cast two blonde guys with similar faces, age, height and build, and even put space suits on them, at least give one a moustache or something. Minor characters like the Russian and Chinese pilots are so sketchily drawn they come across as caricatures.Del Toro has reportedly been struggling for years to adapt Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. Pacific Rim evokes Lovecraftian imagery, but is essentially an attempt to take the sting out of it (more palatable to a mass audience!) by adding heroic characters, romance and an optimistic tone.From a director of Del Toro's caliber I was expecting something more special and personal, but a competent, entertaining blockbuster is already a cause of minor celebration in these days.6,5/10",7,6,11,20 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Puberty leads to the Dark Side
","Attack of the Clones is the weakest Star Wars prequel. Revenge of the Sith has its moments; The Phantom Menace at least feels like a Star Wars movie, although a mediocre one. Clones is soulless. People run around with lightsabers, we hear John Williams' theme, but it does not *feel* like Star Wars.Anakin Skywalker (Christensen), talented but arrogant Jedi apprentice, falls for former queen Padme (Portman), while his mentor Obi-wan (McGregor) tracks down the bad guys. The climax is a battle between the Jedi and the forces of Count Dooku (Lee), allied to Palpatine (McDiarmid).The love story is atrocious: writing is almost impossibly bad, ranging from the infamous 'I don't like sand' line to Padme finally falling in love with Anakin as he reveals his homicidal tendencies (does she have a thing for murderers?). My favorite moment has to be Christensen's grimace as he intones 'I WISH I could just WISH away my feelings': he spits the line out like a morsel of rotten food.By the way, what happened to Christensen? Unlike Natalie Portman - who was equally bad but landed on her feet - and the blameless McGregor, Hayden seems to have disappeared. I know right now he is probably chilling out with some hot model in a swimming pool, but I like to picture him atoning for his acting sins in a remote monastery. Although, to be fair, he did better in Revenge of the Sith.The movie lacks atmosphere. In a subplot inspired by Ford's The Searchers, a scene with Anakin finding his mother is a gem of unintentional humour, with Shmi's theatrically expiring in the arms of her son. Count Dooku. the second of the prequels' disposable villains after Maul and before Grievous, is introduced anticlimactically as he walks around chatting with a bunch of alien termites.Weak characters abound: some, like Dexter, are puzzlingly useless. Others, like Boba Fett as a grinning child, are pathetic. Also, we have to endure an action scene with Yoda. Not only it looks silly, it's wrong on a deeper level: Yoda should have been above fights. But this is nothing compared to the character assassination of Darth Vader. In Clones, Anakin is an obnoxious, petulant teen who whines at his father figure and leers at the girl he fancies. Is puberty the path for the Dark Side?If we needed to see Darth Vader's years as a teenager with raging hormones (and I'd argue we really didn't, the prequels would have worked so much better if we had started with a more mature Anakin as implied in A New Hope), a little more gravitas would have been mandatory.. It's like watching a young Sauron getting wasted with a bunch of Orcs and playing prank calls to Gandalf. Seriously, it's awful.Special effects are everywhere, drowning the story. See the coliseum battle, a boring set-piece with a bunch of extras waving lightsabers at a maelstrom of CGI foes. Duels are chaotic and forgettable; say what you want of The Phantom Menace, but the Darth Maul fight at least was cool.4/10",4,5,8,26 May 2007
Bird Box," Don't look now
","Bird Box is a mix between A Quiet Place and The Happening - not as good as the former but much better than the latter.This horror film follows a pregnant woman (Sandra Bullock) and her group of companions as they struggle to survive after the arrival of mysterious creatures whose mere sight turns people crazy and suicidal.If you were annoyed by the plot holes of A Quiet Place (a film I loved, but it does have many implausibilities), Bird Box will make your brain boil. A huge dose of suspension of disbelief is necessary to accept how these constantly blindfolded people can do things like drive around (using GPS, but still...), hike through a forest, navigate a river on a boat.The film is well-crafted enough that the inherent absurdity of these situations didn't irritate me, although it did often feel like the (blind) elephant in the room.There is a nice amount of tension, but the movie misses some major opportunities. First, we often hear the creatures but never get to see them. Now, giving us a full, clear look of the monsters would have been idiotic and broken the whole film, as no CGI beastie could have lived up to the main premise.The moviemakers should have designed some kind of Lovecraftian/Gigerian eldritch abomination, resisting the temptation to show it in its entirety but giving us just some glimpses: an eye, a claw, a tentacle, scratches on a wall, footprints in the mud (think the first act of A Quiet Place minus the initial bridge scene).There are some neat ideas - when the monsters are close, birds go wild and gravity seems slightly disrupted, with leaves and hairs floating upward - but the premise was screaming for more of this stuff. In fact, they could have gone full Lovecraft, adding details like constellations in the night sky being slightly off, weather out of control, people plagued by nightmares...Also, the creatures never physically attack the survivors; they represent a constant threat, but a somewhat passive one. There is a chase in a forest which should be terrifying but is only tense...because we have no indication the creatures will *do* anything to our protagonists if they catch them. Sure, the concept of these monsters you can't even look at is creepy, but it's never going to feel as scary to our mammalian brains as something which is physically, actively trying to kill you.Imagine Alien... if the Xenomorph could hurt you ONLY if you look at it. It's still a frightening scenario, but it doesn't quite pack the same punch, does it?In fact, a group of victims introduced late in the film - when exposed to the creatures they don't kill themselves but turn insane and force other people to watch - feel more menacing than the actual monsters.Still, I enjoyed the film. Director Susan Bier does a great job with the material she is given. Performances are solid: Bullock is excellent and her character feels believably flawed without going overboard; John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson and Tom Hollander are fine in secondary roles.7/10",7,6,12,3 January 2019
28 Weeks Later," Hits the ground running
","The epidemic started in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later - a virus turning people into rabid, zombie-like creatures - is seemingly quiescent. However, when a carrier reaches London, the infection spreads quickly with disastrous results; we follow the events through Don (Robert Carlyle), his children Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), sniper Doyle (James Renner) and medic Scarlet (Rose Byrne).The prologue is exceptional. It's such an effective sequence that it sort of hurts the movie in retrospect, as none of the following scenes reach that level of tension. Quality-wise, 28 Weeks Later peaks in the first ten minutes.Performances are solid, even those by young actors. Visually, the movie offers some impressive scenes, like the apocalyptic climax with the bombing of London. The soundtrack by John Murphy is wonderfully creepy.There are a few missteps, like a fleeting but stupid scene where the blades of a helicopter become a weapon, in a moment which belongs to a lesser zombie movie. Also, the way Carlyle keeps popping up in the second half is excessive; I applaud the script for making a brave choice (turning the protagonist into a villain halfway through), but the way he chases his children through the ravaged city is too much - he becomes like a zombie Energizer Bunny.7,5/10",7,3,4,2 October 2007
Bridge of Spies," Solid Spielberg
","This Cold War thriller confirms two things about director Steven Spielberg.First: he is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. It's amazing how he makes every sequence visually interesting, fluid and well-paced, from dialogue scenes (which represent the bulk of Bridge of Spies) to action set-pieces (here just a brief plane crash). He gets strong performances from his actors, here Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the latter in an Award-winning turn as a mild-mannered Soviet spy. The director's efficiency on set is legendary: Bridge of Spies looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards!) forty millions budget. Spielberg was just born to narrate stories...... and that's why his films, even the few I don't particularly like, as a general rule still have *something* worth recommending.Second: Spielberg's movies have diabetes. Sugar is sprinkled everywhere, peaking with sappy endings. Bridge of Spies would be greatly improved by radically altering or excising the last ten minutes... much like War of the Worlds, AI, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Minority Report. Looking back, it's surprising Spielberg delivered in Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the most memorably ironic epilogues ever.... and that's why I prefer Spielberg's more lighthearted films, like Jaws or Jurassic Park; in serious movies his fluffy endings feel more grating and inappropriate.Overall, Bridge of Spies is solid. The Coen brothers co-wrote the script, their touch shining through in several absurdist, humorous moments.7,5/10",7,3,5,5 April 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminates the saga
","Those machines won't give up. After sending a Terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother in the fist movie, then a T-1000 to kill a teenage John in the sequel, now the time-traveling cyborg assassin is a T-X (Kristanna Loken), targeting twenty-something John (Nick Stahl) and his future wife (Claire Danes). *Of course* the rebels send back another android (Schwarzenegger) to stop the T-X.Terminator 3 lacks tension, mostly because of the weak villain. Loken, with her supermodel looks, is utterly wrong for the part, as she tries and fails to mimic Robert Patrick's superb performance in the previous film. Patrick, with his glacial stare and sinister body language, conveyed a deep sense of menace. Loken is terrible - her stiff walk, the comical way she tilts her head... it's a vapid, inane performance. The only mildly clever use of the new female terminator is a five-second scene where she looks at a lingerie advertisement and inflates her bust to a bigger size; it took the android only a quick glance to understand how to be more persuasive in our sexist society.Stahl is a better actor than Furlong in Terminator 2, but writing in his scenes with Danes is cringe-inducing. Ahnold is Ahnold.Plot is nonsensical and contradicts the whole point of the previous movies. So, is Judgement Day inevitable or not? Future *can* be altered, but only in plot-convenient ways? Sorry, time travel stories require a little more thought than that.All would be forgiven if this boasted magnificent action, but director Mostow, who made the decent submarine flick U-571, doesn't deliver anything memorable. Say what you want of James Cameron, but the man knows his set-pieces.5/10",5,7,9,24 May 2007
Van Helsing," Van Boring
","I didn't expect Van Helsing to be Citizen Kane. I didn't WANT it to be Citizen Kane. Popcorn movies have a dignity and a reason to exist, and there is place for a cheesy werewolf/vampire feature in cinema.Sadly, Van Helsing is a bloated mess. It bombards the audience with a moronic plot full of arbitrary rules, stupid McGuffins and absurd twists. A convoluted story should not be confused with texture or genuine complexity; for these movies, simplicity is a virtue. Instead we get a lot of mumbo- jumbo about the relationship between werewolves and Dracula, an antidote, Frankenstein being necessary to reanimate the count's spawn, and other preposterous rules.However, what drives a stake through Van Helsing (har har) is the mediocrity of action scenes. With an overuse of awful CGI and a cartoonish 'everything can happen!' attitude, they are pointless and incompetent. See the vampire attack, with Beckinsale's Anna bumping everywhere like a ping-pong ball in a tornado, without any consequence or sense of danger. And that silly werewolf kept springing out of nowhere like a furry Jack in the Box puppet. One is tempted to say Van Helsing resembles a video game, but the truth is no major modern video game is so badly plotted and devoid of atmosphere. It's more like one of those platform games from the middle Nineties, with lots of jumps and lots of swinging on vines.Jackman as the titular monster-slayer comes across as sedate and moribund. Beckinsale provides the eye-candy, so the camera can PG-13 leer at her tight trousers and cleavage, admittedly quite a sight. Roxbourgh has an original take on Dracula: he portrays the legendary monster as a campy, effete clown. Wenham as the Q-like comic sidekick/inventor is the only mildly likable character in this whole disaster.4/10",4,4,6,9 October 2008
Duck You Sucker," If you shoot me down, they will have to change all the maps
","Bridges are linked with death in Sergio Leone's filmography: the 'flyspeck on Headquarters' maps' contended between Union and Confederacy in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; the arc-like structure from which the brother is hanged in Once Upon a Time in the West; the bridge from which Bugsy emerges armed with a gun in Once Upon a Time in America.Leone's best bridge sequence, however, happens in Giù la Testa (also known as Duck, You Sucker!, Once Upon a Time the Revolution, A Fistful of Dynamite): an exhilarating set-piece in which Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger, chewing scenery with glee) and Irish revolutionary John Mallory (a magnificent, melancholic James Coburn) face a whole army and blow up a bridge in the most cathartic explosion ever committed to celluloid.Leone's most nakedly political movie, in which the director's obvious sympathy for the revolutionaries clashes against his pessimism and distrust of revolutions as social movements (see the memorable moment where Mallory tosses Bakunin's essay in the mud after Juan's shockingly eloquent tirade), Giù la Testa features one of the Italian master's best scenes, rivalled only by the graveyard sequence in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Under a pouring rain, Mallory spies a mass execution; when he witnesses the forced betrayal of broken doctor Villega (a great Romolo Valli), a flashback finally reveals a defining event of his past. It's a gorgeous moment, enriched by Morricone's haunting score: cinema doesn't get any better than this.10/10",10,7,10,31 July 2014

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Butter scraped over too much bread
","The Desolation of Smaug occasionally entertains, often meanders. It has a pointless prologue (a flashback with people discussing stuff we already know), an equally pointless epilogue (a superfluous set-piece which is only there because the project was stretched over three movies) and a lot of filler between them. There are some neat moments but they are buried under an obscene amount of bloat.McKellen as Gandalf is always good, although he has to deliver way too many cryptic asides. Freeman is perfect as Bilbo. Armitage invests Thorin with charisma and a darker streak. Pace's aloof King Thranduil provides an elf who is way more interesting than pretty stuntman Legolas (who is back, needlessly). Bard's role has been rightfully expanded. Smaug the dragon is great, his confrontation with Bilbo the highlight of the movie.As for non-canon character Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, she of the pensive stares in Lost)... the extent they go to make her likable - including heroic horns blaring in the soundtrack every time she jumps on screen slaying enemies - is rather embarrassing. And this is from someone who liked the expansion of Arwen's role in the previous trilogy.Jackson's visually busy set pieces are tiresome, with weightless characters bouncing around and zero sense of threat. It's all very 'pew pew, here come the good guys', like some hyperactive child playing with his action figures, if the child was a multimillionaire owning WETA.What's worse, these sequences often don't advance the plot in any way: take the final fight against Smaug, which accomplishes exactly nothing. The dragon could have left before the scene started, or maybe halfway through it, and it would have made no difference. The last act, cutting back and forth between three parallel story lines, feels clunky and unfocused. Also, new villain Bolg, aka Azog 2.1, is criminally generic.Howard Shore, who composed three amazing soundtracks for the Lord of the Rings, is also once again below expectations: continuity is one thing (by the way, where is the Misty Mountains theme which dominated the first movie?), but the amount of recycled material from the previous trilogy is distracting and the new themes nowhere as memorable.It seems Jackson is finally doing what Christopher Tolkien (J.R.R.'s son) had
unfairly accused him of doing all along with The Lord of the Rings: turning his father's work into shallow action nonsense. I shudder to imagine Tolkien Jr. 's reaction to these new films: since he hated the trilogy which was actually good, this one must feel like Jackson is intentionally trolling him.5/10",5,9,17,15 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Don't that picture look dusty
","An elegiac Western with a strong Terrence Malick flavour, Dominik's movie is thoughtful, slow-paced, as it follows the last year of life of outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) through the eyes of Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), the young and initially starstruck gang member who eventually shot him.Pitt is excellent as James - mournful, dangerous, enigmatic, a man of long silences who is just as likely to ponder over his own mortality as to hold a knife at your throat and study your reaction. Affleck, with his squeaky voice and averting eyes, is also great as the uncharismatic rookie planning betrayal: his Ford is a cunning, duplicitous boy who is *almost* able to sell himself as loyal, but not quite - his answers a little too calculated, his pauses a little too tense, as you almost hear the wheels spinning in his head. The supporting cast is strong, with a typically stellar turn by Sam Rockwell as Robert's brother Charley.James' death scene is superb - the sad, weary Jesse essentially commits suicide-by-traitor - but what follows is even more interesting; having acquired ephemeral celebrity, Ford starts to re-enact the killing in theaters, at first uncannily oblivious to the growing contempt towards him. As his brother Charley (playing James for their farce) glares at him from the stage, and the audience boos him from the darkness, Ford recoils with anger and horror, realizing the price he paid for his fifteen minutes of fame.A remarkable movie - and Roger Deakins' cinematography is something to behold - although anyone expecting a brisk, action-heavy, classic Western will be bitterly disappointed: this is a drama and a character study on themes like envy, mediocrity and deception, more 'Amadeus meets Badlands' than Rio Bravo.8/10",8,5,6,27 May 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," More is not better; more is just more
","I know Tolkien fans who enjoy the Hobbit trilogy and admit: 'Yes, the movies are too long... but the more Middle-earth, the better'. I believe this is wrong in a fundamental way. Sometimes there is too much of a good story; in fact, I'd argue many stories are good BECAUSE there isn't too much of them. They knew when to start and when to finish. Take two of the highest-rated movies on IMDb, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Shawshank Redemption (SPOILERS for them if you have been living under a rock). Would the former be better with a flashback to Tuco's miserable childhood? Would the latter be improved by a ten-minutes epilogue with Andy and Red drinking Piña Colada on the beach? I doubt it.There is a tendency of modern blockbusters to add bloat, in the form of irrelevant subplots and characters sprouting on every scene; this is mistaken for depth. But complex and complicated are not the same thing (L.A. Confidential=complex; Revenge of the Sith=complicated). It becomes conspicuous when Jackson adapts this slim children book in three movies with a total running time of nearly eight hours - about 474 minutes (theatrical cuts) for 300 pages, little more than half a page per minute; by comparison, The Lord of the Rings adaptation was about two pages per minute.(For the record, I don't think making a trilogy was necessarily a blunder; the mistake was making each entry so insufferably long. You could cut at least 30-40 minutes from every Hobbit movie with no discernible loss in terms of plot and characterization).Irony burns when a coming-of-age story/cautionary tale about war and avarice becomes the devolution of a great storyteller delivering action set-pieces porn in a greed-fueled project.So, bloat. The other great sin is tone, which is all over the place. Jackson could have chosen between the ominous atmosphere of The Lord of the Rings and the whimsical one of The Hobbit. Pick one or the other. Here we have juvenile antics (like the embarrassing rendition of Radagast) mixed with lugubrious horror villains. This jarring discrepancy infects set-pieces: the orgy of action takes place in a consequence-free zone. Characters fall fifty feet and walk away without a bruise; in the execrable Goblin Town escape, the Dwarf company rushes through a million enemies like a lawnmower. It's tedious and unexciting. Compare to the sense of physical threat of the Moria sequence in Fellowship.A positive note? Acting, with McKellen a welcome return as Gandalf, Freeman excellent as fussy Bilbo, Armitage an effective anti-hero as Thorin.Not a disaster (here and there, Jackson's former good touch shines through); just a major disappointment.5,5/10",5,4,5,16 February 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," I suppose you'd call that a draw
","A living poster boy for the auteur theory, Wes Anderson makes movies so idiosyncratic - the surreal humor, the whimsical bittersweet tone, the distinctive visual style with pastel color palettes and quick cut-aways, an uncanny ability to marry images and music, weird but sympathetic father figures - that if you ended up 200 years in the future with a time machine and found a thirty seconds scene from an unreleased film by him, you'd recognize it at once. Of course, a deadpan Bill Murray would be in it somewhere.A choral story focused on a murder mystery and a mitteleuropean luxury hotel, the movie finds its center in the relationship between concierge Gustave (Ralph Fiennes in a phenomenal comedic performance) and his lobby boy and protegé Zero (Tony Revolory). Among the rest of the cast, Willem Dafoe as an ogre-like hit-man and Saoirse Ronan as a young baker have the most significant roles, plus Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham providing the narrative frame as a writer interviewing an adult Zero. Anderson's veterans Murray, Wilson and Schwartzman get cameos.The director crafts his tableaux with meticulous attention. See how the unstoppable determination of Dafoe's killer is conveyed through his constant movement, as he appears to be menacingly propelled towards the viewer; how the passage of time at the Grand Budapest is portrayed with a change in the dominant color palette; how mentor Gustave occupies the left side of the screen and Zero the right one in their scenes together, only for this to be reversed with older Zero and the writer.The Grand Budapest Hotel is more Anderson quirkiness. From another director it would feel like stagnation, but since nobody else at the present does what he does, it's still welcome. To quote the movie, he certainly sustains the illusion with marvellous grace.7,5/10",7,5,8,25 June 2014
Foxcatcher," Did you catch the fox today, Mother?
","If movies have taught me anything, it's never to accept an accommodation from a man who collects stuffed birds and lives with a mysterious, reclusive mother. Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), however, doesn't look like one who watches many movies - he is shown as a huge, somber man focused solely on his training, unlike his elder brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), more genial and family-oriented.Therefore, when millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) offers Mark economic support and a job in an isolated country mansion as coach of his personal wrestling team, Mark jumps at the chance. It doesn't take long before du Pont shows a sinister streak: usually as emotionless as a cold fish, he displays mood swings, wakes Mark up in the middle of the night for impromptu training sessions, fires a gun in the gym to gain attention; worst of all, he has an unhealthy obsession to be seen as a leader.There are also strong homosexual undertones, with the suggestion that du Pont's penchant for training with burly young men was not merely a product of his love for sport.Channing is fine as a dour, simple man faced with one humiliation too many. Carell, cast against type, is surprisingly creepy: with a beak-like nose and a smile as rare as it is unpleasant, his du Pont delivers endless moral platitudes, his vacuous stare showing hints of a malevolent nature. As soon as we meet him, we know it's not going to end up well between him and the Schultzes, and this tension drives the whole script.The best is Ruffalo in the least showy role of a decent family man struggling to mediate between his brother and their boss. In a neat little scene, he has to record an interview for one of du Pont's self-celebrating documentaries. When asked to describe du Pont's influence and teachings, he struggles to distill a plausible answer from his boss' vapid inanities; deeply uncomfortable, he claims du Pont is his mentor, words sticking in his throat. However, Dave ultimately proves more resilient than Mark, which leads to unsettling developments.A compelling psychological drama. 7,5/10",8,3,4,30 August 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," All men dream: but not equally
","I first watched Lawrence in the stupidest way possible, with a ruined, skipping DVD on an absurdly small PC screen, lying on the bed during an incandescent August afternoon, to kill time before returning to the beach.It's a testament to this milestone of cinema how, in spite of everything, I still found myself swept away by the gorgeous visuals, by Jarre's haunting score, by O'Toole's fey Lawrence: his character arc from showy dreamer to overconfident warrior/poet and finally to bitter, disillusioned legend is one of the most compelling ever filmed. Seldom in my movie-going experience I have been as thrilled by a character entrance as by Sheriff Ali's, still a black dot on the horizon as he shoots a man for the water of a well; as disturbed as by the nightmarish scene in Daraa and its implied horror; as betrayed as by the transmogrification of Alec Guinness' Prince Feisal from soft-spoken paternal figure to shrewd, manipulative politician; as exhilarated by cinematic craft as by the cut from the match to the rising sun, or the panning shot of the assault on Aqaba.Epic at its finest: when Lawrence steps on a puddle and smiles as he appears to be walking on water, it tells us more about him than a whole hour of exposition would.A vital, timeless masterpiece.10/10",10,5,8,4 March 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Deserves extinction
","Spielberg's worst movie until Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this sequel of the 1993 classic bears little resemblance to Crichton's novel - although, to be frank, The Lost World wasn't a very good book either.Scientists Malcolm (Goldblum) and Sarah (Julianne Moore) explore Isla Sorna, populated by dinosaurs created by Ingen, meeting the mercenaries led by greedy Ludlow (Arliss Howard). Good guys and bad guys team up to escape when T-Rex and Raptors start eating everybody. The less said about the ignoble Godzilla-like epilogue in San Diego, the better.Goldblum reprises the character of Malcolm but without the dry wit of the first film. It's typical of sequels: a funny character gets promoted to protagonist and suddenly he isn't funny anymore, because now he has to drive the plot and endure the obligatory arc (think Jack Sparrow in last Pirates movies).I've always been a fan of beautiful, talented redhead Julianne Moore, but here she is wooden and miscast, her worst performance that I recall. Postlethwaite's hunter is the best character but disappears before the last act, which is dramatically unsatisfying. Now, if the last act had disappeared altogether, *that* would have been a satisfaction.Character development is a failure. In Jurassic Park even secondary figures like Muldoon , Arnold and Gennaro had some effective bits of characterization. Here, a bunch of nobodies run around screaming like in some abysmal straight-to-video horror flick. Were we supposed to care about the bearded paleontologist? About Tembo's hunting pal? Sorry, who were they? I must have missed the scenes which actually gave them a personality.Another issue are the dinosaurs themselves. In the first film they were awe-inspiring; here they have become just more CGI beasties, and occasionally even look fake (see the Compys attacking Stormare).The score is also a disappointment. Williams' work for Jurassic Park was magic. Here, every time you expect the beautiful familiar theme to rise, it falters and stutters - a good metaphor for the movie as a whole.Spielberg being who he is, there are a few neat visuals and set-pieces (the trailer hanging from the cliff, the Raptors in the high grass), but not enough to redeem this misbegotten sequel.4,5/10",4,4,9,30 July 2007
It Follows," Creepy Carpenter shrine
","Reminiscent of classics like Halloween and The Thing in tone, feel, pacing and even score, It Follows is a neat horror movie doomed to be mocked for its seemingly silly premise: a sexually-transmitted curse whose victims are stalked by a slow-moving but implacable shape-shifting entity, like a sort of zombie syphilis.Still, there is more artistry here than may be immediately obvious. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell does a phenomenal job in terms of atmosphere, creating a palpable sense of dread as the young protagonists try to evade their supernatural enemy escaping through gloomy, Bradburyan suburbs.7,5/10",7,19,33,21 July 2016
Get Out," Solid thriller
","I was extremely curious to watch this horror/thriller after all the hype surrounding it. I mean, an Academy Award for writing? Wow. That's rare enough for thrillers, truly exceptional for horrors. Not even Dan O'Bannon for Alien, Stanley Kubrick for The Shining and the Benchley/Gottlieb duo for Jaws got as much as a nomination.Turns out this film is... fine? It reminds me, in terms of craft, atmosphere and structure, of M. Night Shyamalan's early phase (you know, the good one). I liked it well enough, even if I don't quite get all the hype.Young African-American Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets the wealthy parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) in their isolated country mansion; the two appear friendly and Chris' initial fears about their racism seem quelled... until he notices something 'off' about the family, their white friends and their black servants. It's essentially Guess Who's Coming to Dinner... if Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn had been evil brainwashing body snatchers.I enjoyed the first two acts, with the growing realization of a disturbing secret involving Rose's family; I was, however, a little disappointed by the specifics of the twist. Maybe it's a pet peeve of mine but, whenever thrillers feature scientists inventing and performing revolutionary procedures in their backroom, my suspension of disbelief crumbles. I mean, Mary Shelley could make that material work two hundred years ago... but with modern science it's so far off the left field I honestly wish Get Out had gone the extra mile and opted for a paranormal explanation (a coven of racist witches? whatever). In this kind of schlock magic feels less distracting than unbelievable science.Performances are excellent. Kaluuya is a relatable everyman and Williams is fine in a tricky role. Veterans Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are great as the parents, walking the perfect balance between smug joviality and creepiness.7/10",7,4,10,28 June 2018
Frozen," The cold never bothered me anyway
","Count me pleasantly surprised: this is probably Disney's best since Aladdin (not counting Pixar, which is in a league of its own).There is much to appreciate, including likable performances by Bell and company, memorable characters, a catchy main song. Still, what elevates Frozen is the script by Jennifer Lee. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but it has a subversive streak which I found refreshing, featuring two strong female protagonists (where 'strong' doesn't mean 'acting like a man', marking this as the first truly feminist Disney film) and a clever deconstruction of narrative tropes such as love at first sight and Prince Charming-like figures. One could argue the first two Shrek movies took a shot at those ten years ago, but the lack of cynicism here makes it even more effective.Even more surprisingly, what defeats the curse is not romantic love but a selfless act of brotherly (er, sisterly) affection, deflecting in the process another typical Disney cliché - how, for all the cutesy and feel-good atmosphere of their narrative, conflicts are invariably solved with violence and murder, as villains meet a gruesome demise, usually thrown from great heights.And seriously, how can you not like a magic snowman who yearns for a warm summer day and is naively oblivious to the consequences? 8/10",8,8,14,12 December 2014
I Am Legend," Legend, he ain't
","First Asimov's I, Robot, now Matheson's I Am Legend; one has to wonder which sci-fi classic scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman will desecrate next, turning it into a lowbrow action movie starring Will Smith. Stranger in a Strange Land? Ubik? The new Fahrenheit 451 adaptation? *shudder* The way I Am Legend follows only the bare-bone premise of the book, leveling every finer detail to the lowest common denominator, feels actually quite disturbing - a nasty middle finger shown to the audience (and to Matheson), the equivalent of saying 'you don't deserve anything deeper'.Last human survivor of vampire/zombie apocalypse Neville (Will Smith) has been turned from resourceful everyman into a superscientist/action hero (a ridiculous character if ever there was one); his canine companion goes from miserable beggar to highly trained German shepherd; most disappointingly, the creatures crawling out at night are all simply evil monsters (and very poor CGI monsters), erasing any moral ambiguity. The whole point of the novel is lost: the very phrase 'I am legend' implied that Neville had become the anomaly, the monster; in the movie, the title is reinterpreted with a dumb 'I am the man!' meaning. Originally the ending was different (not identical to the book's, but at least thematically consistent with it) but it was received poorly by test audiences. Just sad.Regardless of its value as adaptation, does the movie work as sci-fi/action entertainment? Well, the premise is ripe with potential, but the result is lightweight. One example can clarify this. There is a cool (in theory) scene in which Neville falls into a trap prepared by the monsters - never mind they had been described and portrayed as mindless morons: the script doesn't have clear ideas about their nature - dusk is approaching and three infected dogs are lurking in the darkness, ready to attack. The scene should be edge-of-your-seat stuff. However, since Goldsman has no clue of how to develop this material and director Francis Lawrence no idea of how to film it, it's simply another mildly suspenseful, 'there goes my doggy, let's shoot the baddie' action scene, doing the absolute minimum with a solid concept - a description which fits the movie as a whole.Smith gives a charismatic performance; however, he was probably not the best choice to play Neville. Smith's greatest asset as a star is the easy chemistry he develops with his fellows actors - trouble is, here his fellows actors are a dog and some mannequins. Smith is not a very introspective thespian (unlike, say, Denzel Washington), so casting him as the last man of Earth (kind of) was a rather poor idea.Since Goldsman is also responsible for the assassination of Asimov's works, Batman & Robin and The Da Vinci Code, while Lawrence's pedigree includes some Britney Spears videos and Constantine, it would probably be a good idea to lock them together in a high security prison to prevent them from making other movies; and, for all I care, after Men in Black 2, The Pursuit of Happiness and I Robot, Will Smith can join them.So, who's the next revered sci-fi author to murder? Bradbury? Dick? Fredric Brown? Time will tell.Rating: As an 'independent' movie: 5,5/10 As an adaptation of Matheson's novel: 3/10",5,10,13,11 May 2008
A Quiet Place," The power of silence
","An effective horror movie with a brilliantly simple premise, A Quiet Place follows a family (the parents are played by Emily Blunt and her very lucky real-life husband John Krasinski, who is also the director here) surviving in a farm after most of mankind has been wiped out by blind monsters who use sound to locate their preys, so any loud or even moderate noise can attract them.This neat but potentially schlocky scenario is elevated by a strong execution. Acting is solid, set-pieces tense; a scene involving a nail sticking from a stair tread had viewers in my theater breathless and deathly still, myself included.It's a testament to the movie's quality how this was one of the quietest audiences I've ever met in a cinema, which for a horror film is always a good sign... and for *this* horror film felt particularly appropriate, as it features some of the best use of sound and silence in the last years. Many recent blockbusters are so constantly noisy that even an explosion doesn't register; this movie is so quiet that even a floor creaking has viewers grimacing in terror.I would say the first half is pretty much perfect. The second part is also fine, but more conventional; as usual, the more we see of the monsters, the less they become threatening.Overall, this is one of the best horror films of the last years, as long as you don't overthink its (admittedly numerous) inconsistencies... say, how these people cannot play Monopoly normally because the pieces tapping against the board would make too much noise, and yet are somehow able to silently manage a farm or maintain their various electrical equipment without attracting the creatures. However, A Quiet Place is so entertaining and well-crafted that I can forgive its internal logic not being airtight.8/10",8,5,8,7 May 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Pill-popping Bourne
","Doe-eyed Rachel Weisz has the rare talent of playing potentially annoying characters - here 'damsel in distress' meets 'naive scientist who ignores what her works are used for' - and yet making them sensible and sympathetic. And yeah, I like Jeremy Renner too, although obviously in a more platonic way, with his quiet intensity which never turns into obnoxious macho posturing. Add to them Ed Norton as the antagonist coldly barking orders to a room full of technicians and you have a solid cast.Unfortunately, both direction and writing fall short compared to the Matt Damon trilogy - and before someone says they don't need to be compared, let me remind this was titled The BOURNE Legacy.Set-pieces are competent, nothing more. There is a rooftop chase, inferior to the one in Ultimatum, and a high-speed chase, inferior to the one in Supremacy. The movie clocks in at an acceptable 135 minutes, but feels longer - and *is* in fact longer than the three Jason Bourne movies, which were tight and breezy.The script has issues, which is surprising as Gilroy is one of the finest writers of action/thrillers working today. Again, comparisons with the original trilogy are problematic. A mystery man who is found floating in the sea with a bullet wound and displays unexpected combat skills is more compelling than a super soldier popping pills to get stronger and smarter. An amnesiac spy struggling to unravel his past and achieve revenge against the agency which trained him is more interesting than a rogue agent infiltrating a factory... with the help of a scientist who does have access to that factory. In the first trilogy scale and scope were larger, stakes higher. Norton's antagonist gets no closure, which is just weak (and his previous connection with protagonist Aaron Cross feels pointless); the other bad guy is the series' typical unshaven hit-man who gets killed in a flurry of blows before he can utter a single line. Still, this is per se an entirely watchable spy flick. Maybe they should just have titled it Crossing Aaron.6/10",6,2,2,26 August 2015
Shrek the Third," Remember when it was funny?
","I enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2 for a simple reason: they made me laugh. I hated Shrek the Third (from now on S3) for an even simpler reason: I sat through it bored and stony-faced. I think I giggled three times during the whole movie, all in the first ten minutes.The series is now as trite as the tales it's supposed to be spoofing. It's basically a Disney movie - modern Disney, not classic one, which was great - only with the obligatory fart jokes (something which, contrary to what Hollywood believes, has never been funny) and a handful of pop references tossed in. The biggest offender is Artie (King Arthur of the myth), a corny 'troubled youngster who finds a father figure and accepts his responsibilities'; it's about as funny as it sounds.Series veterans Myers (Shrek), Murphy (Donkey) and Banderas (Puss in Boots) sound tired and collect their paychecks.There is a lot of slapstick and little parody; S3 follows the school of thought that if things happen fast, even without actual jokes, the result will be amusing. Sorry, folks, it doesn't work that way; humor benefits from speed, but requires intelligence as well.An interesting rule about movies in general and comedies in particular: if they have more than two-three people listed under 'writing credits', it's usually a bad sign - the cinematic equivalent of being on a cruise ship where crew members start gathering on deck, whispering at each other and pointing at lifeboats. According to IMDb, S3 had THIRTEEN writers.3/10",3,6,7,9 December 2007
Ex Machina," Turing test
","There is a neat moment in Alex Garland's remarkable Ex Machina when schlubby programmer Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) objects he is not really performing a Turing test on robot Ava (Alicia Vikander), as he already knows she is an AI; his boss Nathan (the great Oscar Isaac) replies they're already past that: the real test is to SHOW Caleb she is artificial and THEN see if he still believes her to have consciousness and feelings.Now, isn't that a variation of what movies (and fiction in general) do? They show us characters we know aren't real, and yet for a couple of hours we believe in them, root for them, bestow our empathy on them. There is an interesting meta layer, with Ava beguiling Caleb just as Garland's disquieting script captivates us viewers.Ex Machina succeeds thanks to strong character work and excellent performances. Gleeson is fine as the audience surrogate; lovely Vikander is both vulnerable and uncanny as Ava; Isaac, who is becoming one of the best actors of his generation, absolutely kills it as smug demiurge Nathan, a brilliant man hiding a sinister streak behind is cool bro facade.7,5/10",9,23,33,13 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Empire Pranks Back
","The Last Jedi is an interesting failure, unlike the slick but obvious The Force Awakens - which I guess was a boring success, aiming at an easy target and hitting the bullseye. The more ambitious Episode VIII has intriguing ideas and neat set-pieces, but they are obliterated by major mistakes.I could go on and on about those.<ul><li>Luke Skywalker has become a bitter hermit haunted by his failures. Considered in a vacuum this characterization has potential, but in the context of the whole saga it just feels wrong. It retroactively damages the original trilogy, which had completed Luke's character arc - much like Han's, and that's why I dreaded the return of the old cast and would have preferred the new films to take place two hundred years after Return of the Jedi. Still, kudos to Mark Hamill, who is great in this in spite of everything.</li></ul><ul><li>The hyperspace-ramming moment, for the sake of a cool visual, opens a whole can of plot holes about the entire saga (why nobody ever did that with the various Death Stars?) and involves Holdo, a character we have no reason to care about; it's like Mon Mothma blowing up the Death Star, if Mon Mothma had the relational skills of Cruella De Vil. This would have been an effective send-off for, say, Leia... or Finn, who has a similar moment sabotaged later in the movie.</li></ul><ul><li>Speaking of Finn's aborted sacrifice, it highlights the movie's garbled handling of themes. So, is sacrificing yourself for the greater good the right choice or not? The Last Jedi gives two opposite answers (Luke, Holdo and Rose's sister versus Rose/Finn) and frames them both as correct. Or maybe it's the right choice only if you have no romantic interest. Wow, deep.</li></ul><ul><li>I also don't get what the film is trying to say about the Force. That everyone can be a hero regardless of Force powers? We already knew that (Han, Lando, Chewie...). That you don't need to be an 'official' Jedi to tap into the Force? We already knew that too (Luke in A New Hope, even Chirrut in Rogue One). That *everyone* can use the Force regardless of innate sensitivity? I guess not, or every person in the galaxy would be waving lightsabers, performing telekinesis, etc. Or is it saying that you don't need an important lineage or a famous name to be a Force-using hero? Look, the prequels were mostly a failure, but you don't need to turn them into galactic strawmen. Episodes I-III showed a galaxy full of Jedi of different species; Anakin himself was born a slave! As stupid as Midichlorians were, nobody ever implied the Force was some kind of selective aristocratic privilege.</li></ul><ul><li>The Canto Bight subplot is useless in terms of narrative economy. Like many recent blockbusters, this movie is bloated - you could easily cut 30 minutes from it. See also the Multiple Climaxes Syndrome: what looks and feels like the final battle is followed by yet another very last act.</li></ul><ul><li>I understand wanting to raise the narrative stakes and leaving the good guys in a difficult place at the end... but all the surviving members of the Rebellion fitting inside the Millennium Falcon? That's hysterical. It's a GALACTIC conflict. These people wouldn't be enough to hold ONE CITY in one of the MILLION PLANETS in the galaxy! It's like a version of The Two Towers with only Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli fighting against 10.000 Uruks at Helm's Deep - in a misguided attempt to make it 'more epic', it *instantly* becomes ludicrous.</li></ul><ul><li>While The Last Jedi is, to its credit, more original than The Force Awakens, it does sometimes commit a similar mistake: imitating the original trilogy's narrative beats without any of the underlying logic or deeper emotional meaning. When Luke risked his life to redeem Vader, it was the sacrifice of a son to save his father's soul; when Rey does the same for Kylo, it's unearned and absurd (he is nothing to her other than the guy who kidnapped her, wounded one of her friends and killed another). The character motivation for this baffling choice is some vision of the future, a lazy screenwriting shortcut which was rightfully booed when Lucas employed it in the prequels and isn't any better here.</li></ul>But my main issue is TONE. Star Wars has always been a lighthearted adventure, not a parody. There are moments here which could have taken place in a Star Wars spoof like Spaceballs (Poe prank-calling Hux, Finn's brusque awakening, the Porgs annoying Chewie, Luke and the green milk, Finn leaking fluids from his suit, Rose zapping Finn, Snoke and Kylo tossing Hux around like a ragdoll, BB-8 commandeering an AT-ST...). It's like Jar Jar Binks all over again, only not concentrated on a single character but spread over the whole film.Now, you shouldn't approach Star Wars like it's Crime and Punishment... but when you mock your own characters, plot and lore for the sake of a cheap laugh, you undermine any sense of pathos you've been trying to build.Emblematic of this is Luke's first scene. While I'm not a fan of The Force Awakens (although it looks better now in retrospect, at least it got the tone right), its ending was effective: the young apprentice looking for a teacher stands before the legendary master and returns him his paternal weapon. Writer/director Rian Johnson pays it off with a gag. This bathos runs through the movie.4,5/10",4,96,148,30 December 2017
Brave," The weight of expectations
","Brave is, in itself, a droll, pleasant yarn about a rebellious princess in ancient Scotland. Package is flawless, with solid voice acting and splendid visuals.However, movies can't be judged in a vacuum - and this was made by Pixar, the animation studio which crafted some of the most imaginative, topical and daring (both in themes and form) mainstream movies of the last decade, from Finding Nemo to Inside Out. Compared to, say, the stunning, silent first half of Wall-E, or the opening montage about love and loss of Up, Brave is safe, lightweight fluff. Cue a zany witch, inevitable visual jokes about kilt-wearing highland warriors and bare rears, a curse with a prim queen mother turned into a bear (slapstick ensues), and so on. It's... okay, I guess? A fun adventure for kids - and yeah, the magical version of the typically unhelpful automated answering service had me in stitches. It just pales next to other Pixar movies (well, the majority of them), which are much more than that.6,5/10",6,3,4,6 August 2015
Saw II," The true torture here is boredom
","I know IMDb ratings mean relatively little. But 6,9 as the average rating of Saw 2? You got to be kidding me.I imagined this would be bad, but I wasn't prepared for a *boring* bad movie. This is not a bloodbath, it's a snooze fest. With the exception of a couple of scenes, it's not THAT gory for the genre - certainly not for squeamish viewers, but not the kind of 'oh so terrible' slaughterhouse described by the hype. It's more unpleasant and lugubrious than shocking.A bunch of cookie-cutter characters run around a maze, and every ten minutes one of them dies; meanwhile, a detective (Donnie Wahlberg) confronts the Jigsaw killer (Tobin). It's basically a thriller version of The Cube (which wasn't that great in the first place).Characters are uniformly unlikeable and boring; of course, there is the mandatory psycho stalker who starts murdering his companions because... well, no reason at all. He is eeeeeeeeeeeeevil, and that's it. Talk about contrived conflict.Wahlberg and Tobin are decent as the cop and the killer - their short scenes are far more intriguing than all events inside the maze - but apart for their performances, this stuff is just meh.2/10",2,3,4,27 August 2007
Paranormal Activity," Morons versus haunting - cue $$$
","Perhaps best described as The Blair Witch Project meets the Exorcist meets the Darwin Awards, Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity is one of those 'love or hate it' movies - some praise it as the scariest thing ever committed to celluloid, others claim it's boring and uneventful. Personally, I found it a passable effort, although my patience with the series has grown thinner with each successive episode. 'One-trick pony' pretty much describes it.Low budget can excuse many things - repetitive structure, no special effects, a single location, a tiny cast - but not lazy writing. If something starts haunting your house and dragging you from bed in the middle of the night, I'll guarantee you will at the very least LOCK YOUR BEDROOM DOOR.Economically, however, this was a work of veritable genius. This stuff cost less than a used car and made like 10000% of its original budget at the box office. Young movie-makers all around the world are probably salivating at the thought.5,5/10",6,2,2,27 February 2010
Mission: Impossible II," When Woo remakes Hitchcock
","Make no mistake: it takes a director of talent at the peak of his form to make a bad movie as good as this one. As pompous and uproariously stupid as MI2 is, it's compelling, kinetic and stylish - there's more artistry involved in this bombastic flick than it's immediately obvious.Plot unfolds like Notorious on cocaine - I still have a hard time believing scriptwriter Ben Hecht, who penned the screenplay for Hitchcock's classic, wasn't credited in any shape or form here. For Woo, it's an intriguing starting point to play with his action figures, including Tom Cruise, the world's most popular G.I. Joe, surrounded by a remarkable cast. Luscious visuals with sharp colour palettes, balletic fights and a masterful homage to another auteur like Michael Mann are reasons enough to enjoy MI2.The Mission Impossible series remains one of the most interesting sagas still unfolding - not for its narrative arc, which is flimsy at best, but for the triumph of gorgeous set pieces, each time with a different master action director at the helm.7/10",7,4,5,19 April 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," Dark Leone
","Sergio Leone made epic cinema - he understood events resonate only when you set them up properly.In the 4 hours extended edition of Once Upon a Time in America, it's forty minutes before the first flashback to the initial storyline kicks in, with the protagonists as members of a teenage gang roaming the streets of early 20th century New York; it's a whole hour before Noodles (played as a child by Scott Tiler, as an adult by Robert De Niro in one of his iconic performances) meets Max (Rusty Jacobs / James Woods, never better), his criminal partner.Leone's darkest movie - where his trademark male friendships are betrayed and broken - Once Upon a Time in America has a complex structure jumping back and forth in time, following Noodles' meteoric rise and fall during the Prohibition era as he poisons the relationships with his best friend Max and the only woman he loves, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly in a great cinematic debut / Elizabeth McGovern).As an aside, while I loathe sexual violence in movies, the rape scene in this film, although highly disturbing, is among the rare ones not included for cheap sleazy drama but necessary character-wise: Noodles has become so accustomed to violence, he cannot cope with Deborah's refusal and hurts one of the few people he genuinely cares about. The criminal life brings the wealth with which he attempts to win her over, but eventually ruins her life and turns Noodles himself into a miserable, lonely man full of regrets.Classic Leone themes - like the inherent violence of civilized society in general and of business in particular - are given a darker spin. Max morphs into a businessman / politician involved in the higher spheres of crime, someone who doesn't get his hands dirty (like Morton in Once Upon a Time in the West), severing his ties with Noodles until he chooses his own karmic comeuppance.Or is the whole story an opium-induced hallucination by Noodles as a young man? It's possible, but besides the point: the ending is a way to show Noodles trapped into his own self-inflicted nightmare of violence and betrayal.",8,8,15,31 July 2014
The Last Samurai," Dances with Samurai
","Imagine someone giving you a neatly wrapped, elegant package: you open it and it's empty. That's what blockbusters like The Last Samurai feel like: great photography, costumes and set design, an A-list star surrounded by solid character actors, a few nicely choreographed scenes... and yet it's vapid, pointless fare.Lt. John Dunbar - I'm sorry, I meant Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) - trains the Japanese Emperor's troops against rebel Samurai led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Of course Algren is the only survivor of a disastrous skirmish caused by his superiors' arrogant incompetence, of course he is captured, of course he discovers the nobility of the Samurai way of life contrasting with the sleazy mediocrity of their enemies - not the young Emperor, who, of course, is misguided but noble, although not as noble as Katsumoto, who of course comes across as a mix between Crazy Horse and Obi-wan Kenobi.Question of the week: what on Earth does an American character have to do with this distinctly Japanese tale? Well, obviously he gives western audiences a white hero to identify with! Because we couldn't possibly relate to a story with only Japanese characters! (Sarcasm detectors should be beeping at this point). It goes without saying Algren becomes an accomplished Samurai in a ludicrously short time, finds the love of a pretty widow - funny how in this kind of movie NOTHING is worth doing (no quest, no fight for an ideal) if you don't get laid in the process - and is quickly worshipped by the same people he had set out to destroy. In fact, there are so many scenes in which he saves the day and is gazed at with awe that I wanted to throw something at the screen.Cruise is a generally solid actor but here he gives a standard 'stoic, brooding Cruise' performance. Watanabe is excellent, dignified and charismatic; Connolly and Spall are pretty good; the whole thing is as glossy as a luxury car commercial. The result is an oriental remake of Dances with Wolves, only without guts - and, although the last battle is slick eye-candy, hearing comparisons between The Last Samurai and the works of the late Akira Kurosawa is truly depressing.5,5/10",5,23,44,24 March 2008
The Legend of 1900," Millions of keys
","There is a great moment in La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano (one of many, in fact): a musical duel in which meek pianist 1900 (Tim Roth), right after playing at vertiginous speed an impossible piece (much to the dismay of his smug adversary), gently touches an incandescent piano string with a cigarette, which is immediately ignited.Tornatore's bittersweet drama/character study crackles with creativity, emotion and wit. Roth is excellent as 1900, a childlike musical genius who refuses to leave the ship where he works as an entertainer; Pruitt Taylor Vince's portrayal of his best friend is vivid and engaging.The ending is surprisingly moving: Roth's last monologue could be his finest moment as an actor. Ennio Morricone provides the memorable score of a movie where music plays an essential role.7,5/10",8,4,8,14 August 2014
The Descent," There's something down there
","Neil Marshall's debut Dog Soldiers was a brilliant small-budget werewolf movie; his second film, The Descent, is a remarkable step forward: darker, scarier and more visually interesting.Six women - including Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who recently lost her family, her protective friend Beth (Alex Reid) and reckless Juno (Nathalie Jackson Mendoza) - go spelunking in a cave in the Appalachian Mountains but end up trapped underground while mysterious creatures stalk them.Performances are solid, if limited by the lack of characterization - every character is defined by a single personality trait. The all-female cast is an intriguing idea and feels refreshing for the genre.Although the mysterious Gollum-like monsters show up relatively late, even before their arrival The Descent is tense and suspenseful. Pacing is brisk, tone dark and unsettling; the original ending is far superior to the silly alternate version.Marshall shows talent and a true understanding of the horror genre: let's hope his career will continue at these levels.8/10",8,4,6,23 May 2007
The Shape of Water," H.P. Lovecraft's Beauty and the Beast
","There is something endearing about director Guillermo Del Toro - a childlike enthusiasm, a genuine passion for cinema in general and genre movies in particular - which sets him apart from both the cash-grab cynicism and the workmanlike indifference of many of his peers. The Shape of Water has the peculiar Del Toro touch - a sincerity which makes this fantasy romance work.Set during the Cold War, the movie follows the relationship between mute janitor Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and a mysterious amphibian man (Doug Jones) kept prisoner in the government facility where she works; as brutal Strickland (Michael Shannon) plans to vivisect the creature, Elisa decides to free it with the help of her friends Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and Giles (Richard Jenkins) and the cooperation of a sympathetic scientist who happens to be a Russian spy (Michael Stuhlbarg).This is a beautiful film, shot with grace and style, dominated by a sea-green color palette, with impeccable set design and costumes. Del Toro's films feel visually rich without showing off; there are no unmotivated camera movements, no 'five minutes steady cam shot just because I can'. I was amazed to learn this movie has a meagre (for Hollywood standards) 20 million dollars budget.Hawkins is luminous and compelling as the lead. Del Toro's regular Jones is wonderfully expressive - his amphibian being has a physical presence only practical effects and make-up can achieve. Shannon's Strickland is an effective villain, with his cattle prod, rotten fingers and a sociopathic streak somehow flying under the radar of his Norman Rockwell family. Del Toro has this gift for creating antagonists who are over-the-top horrible (see also the Captain in Pan's Labyrinth) and yet, strangely enough, they don't end up as boring caricatures. Spencer and Jenkins bring pathos and humanity to the potentially cliched roles of the sassy black friend and the quirky gay neighbour. The beginning of the relationship between Elisa and the creature, while lovely, feels a little rushed - too quick and unproblematic on the part of Elisa, who is cooking eggs and playing Benny Goodman for her amphibian pal before you can say 'The Shadow over Innsmouth'. This cavalier attitude towards supernatural threats is also part of the Del Toro touch, I guess, with the kind of unfazed acceptance of the unusual and weird you usually find in fairy tales.7,5/10",8,33,59,20 February 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Never hate your enemies
","Much of the blame for The Godfather: Part III not being on par with previous chapters is usually laid on the shoulders of poor Sofia Coppola, whose scowling, blatantly inadequate performance (her father cast her after the last minute departure of Winona Ryder) weakens the movie and stands out in a trilogy otherwise enriched by sublime acting.Still, the original sin of Part III lies in its concept: having Michael Corleone 'pay for his sins'. Guess what? It had already happened. That particular brand of Pyrrhic villainy had been masterfully explored in the last act of Part II, with Michael, previously all about family, ordering the murder of his brother, and with his wife choosing an abortion rather than having another son by him, an utter display of hatred and distance if ever there was one. The whole point of Part II was Michael emerging triumphant in his power struggle but utterly alone on his throne, his hands soaked in blood - something which was executed so perfectly, this sequel was essentially born redundant.This isn't to say Part III is worthless. Pacino brings a world-weary desperation to the part, while Garcia and Wallach convince in significant roles. Robert Duvall is sorely missed as Tom Hagen - his character was originally supposed to play a key role, but was cut because his monetary requests were deemed excessive by the studio. His absence leaves an obvious void, the calm and collected legal consigliere providing balance to the more emotional world of the Corleones. The last act set in Sicily lacks urgency and focus but, Coppola being who he is, Part III still provides moments of exhilarating cinematic craft, culminating with a superb set-piece in an opera theater and a bitter coda sealing off Michael's saga.7/10",7,4,7,23 March 2014
30 Days of Night," Good story, bad plot
","There is much to like about David Slade's 30 Days of Night: a fairly clever horror concept (based on a graphic novel), compelling atmosphere, creepy villains. Unfortunately, a few flaws prevent this from becoming a cult classic.The premise is nifty: vampires attack an isolated town in Alaska at the beginning of its month-long period of darkness. A few survivors, including Sheriff Eben (a solid Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (lovely Melissa George), try to survive until the sunrise.Character development is weak. Apart for Eben and Stella, survivors are nondescript, so it's difficult to care about them. It's a pity some interesting individuals, like Foster's Renfield-like stranger or Boone's mountain man, are not given more to do.Plot developments feel jarring and arbitrary. Survivors sneak around whispering, constantly hiding from the supposedly looming threat of the monsters; sometimes, when a character takes as much as one step outside, he is doomed... then we repeatedly see scenes of Eben & Co. walking down the streets to gather supplies, change hiding place, and nothing happens. It creates a weird disconnect.At least these vampires are effective villains: nasty, beast-like, with razor-sharp teeth and claws, a sinister guttural language. Danny Huston gives a surprisingly creepy performance as their leader. 6,5/10",6,3,4,9 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Cool Hand Jack
","The most interesting thing about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is how easily the script could have chosen the easy road, making protagonist McMurphy (Nicholson) more conventionally heroic and antagonist Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) a fully-fledged monster. This movie, however, defies easy shortcuts.We are shown from the beginning that McMurphy is scum, a violent man with a history of aggression and sex crimes. In a normal situation he would be despicable: he is, after all, a loud-mouthed criminal trying to exploit the legal system to avoid jail. And yet, in the oppressive atmosphere of the sanitarium, he becomes the leader of a rebellion - a righteous one, we feel. McMurphy is the defiant trickster in a leaden, cruel environment... so we end up on his side.On the flipside, Nurse Ratched is not the devil, but an earnest professional trying to do her job. Even if she clearly gets a kick from exerting her authority - the scene in which she stops voting to prevent McMurphy's victory has a creepy 'Stanford prison experiment' vibe - she doesn't appear to have truly evil intentions. Even her reluctance to send McMurphy away seems motivated by a refusal to give up on him. And yet Ratched is smug, obtuse, devoid of empathy... and she becomes a memorable movie villain.The two leads are perfect. Nicholson gives an infectious performance which won him a well-deserved Academy Award; Fletcher plays Ratched as an icy bureaucrat, her well-meaning cruelty scarier than dozens of foaming-at-the-mouth comic book villains.Still, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an ensemble piece: the rest of the cast does a superb job too (Forman has always been an actors' director), from young Danny DeVito and Cristopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif, from Sydney Lassick to Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.8.5/10 For another excellent movie Handling similar themes, watch Cool Hand Luke with Paul Newman.",8,4,6,9 August 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," Come find me when you wake up
","I imagine pitching Edge of Tomorrow to Warner Bros was the easiest thing in the world. With a juicy high-concept like 'Groundhog Day meets Aliens and Saving Private Ryan', executives were probably excited to throw money at it. Turns out it wasn't such a good deal for them, as the movie reportedly under-performed. A pity: apart for a glaring flaw (the ending), it's a slick, clever sci-fi blockbuster; Liman is a fine action director whose set-pieces here - apart for the somewhat lackluster last battle - are fluid and kinetic.Enough with the premise, which you either already know or should learn nothing more about before watching. Cruise gets to play a more compelling character than his usual stoic protagonist and has a fairly interesting arc. Bill Paxton as a marine sarge (Hudson got promoted!) and Brendan Gleeson as an icy general provide solid supporting turns. Stealing the movie, however, is gorgeous Emily Blunt as one of the most convincing action heroines in years, finding the perfect balance between being tough as nails and haunted by her ordeal.Without spoiling anything, the conclusion doesn't work. It breaks all previously established rules and triggers the kind of 'ehhh, whatever, it was all space magic anyway' sheepish epitaph which is never a good sign; the stench of last-minute rewrite is almost toxic. Given how much Edge of Tomorrow appears to be inspired by video games in terms of structure and general feel, I was almost expecting the message 'Achievement unlocked: bad ending!'. Still enjoyable, but joining Minority Report, War of the Worlds and Oblivion in the club of fine sci-fi movies - curiously all starring Tom Cruise - damaged by their epilogues.6,5/10",7,6,13,8 July 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," I have offended you with my ignorance, forgive me
","This Dracula adaptation accomplishes a seemingly impossible task: it's both a quite faithful AND an astonishingly unfaithful adaptation of Stoker's novel. It's faithful because no other adaptation I know of keeps all the characters of Holmwood, Seward and Quincey Morris. Besides, apart for the prologue, the story is basically true to the Transylvania (first act)/London (second act) /Transylvania (ending) structure of the novel.And yet Coppola's movie is, character-wise, very much unfaithful to the book: the Count is a tragic character rather than a soulless monster; Mina is the reincarnation of Dracula's lost wife, so the script actually develops a romance between the two. Now, when it comes to adaptations I am not against changes, AS LONG AS the final result is true to the spirit of the book: here, it's not.The always awesome Oldman is a charismatic and chilling presence as Dracula, but other performances are either forgettable (Ryder, Elwes) or hammy (Grant, Frost, Hopkins). I was especially disappointed by the latter: his Van Helsing is turned into a comedic character, a sort of Grampa Simpson on drugs. Waits is an effective Reinfield, but the fact Dr. Seward is so absurdly over-the-top makes their scenes together ridiculous - the madman here does not seem weirder than his doctor.The worst is by far a miserable Keanu Reeves, here the very portrait of hilarious miscasting, who appears to break the fourth wall while uttering the quote I put in the review title. With his repugnant English accent and laughable delivery - my favorite lines being 'if I may inquire', 'blue inferno' and especially 'Look! He's grown young!', which had me howling with laughter - he gives the kind of performance which should be punishable by law.At least Dracula is visually compelling: it's luscious, with interesting composition, odd colour palettes, memorable costumes - Coppola toying with every trick of the medium.6,5/10",6,11,14,6 August 2007
Kong: Skull Island," I've never said that name out loud before, it sounds stupid now that I say it
","Color me surprised, as Kong: Skull Island is better than it had any right to be - meaning it's harmless popcorn fun rather than unwatchable tripe. Sure, it's dumber than a brood of drunk chickens, but I don't walk into a Kaiju movie expecting Krzysztof Kieslowski.Effects are neat, with convincing CGI renditions of the titular ape and the rest of the island's monstrous fauna. Script is serviceable; nobody is going to win writing awards for this, but at least it tries to develop a few characters other than the male and female leads (Hiddleston and Larson) - they're broad, but you can tell them apart.The cast is rounded out by an exceptional trio of veterans: John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. If the first two are somewhat subdued (too professional to phone it in but below their par), Reilly steals the movie as the WW2 pilot marooned on the Island for thirty years.Bonus points for an acceptable 120 minutes running length, which is short for the bloated standard of modern blockbusters, and for avoiding a uselessly complicated plot - walking in, I was dreading a profusion of stupid MacGuffins, Pirates of the Caribbean-style (find the Magic Stone and the Ancient Staff to tame Kong in the Temple of Evil...). Nothing of the sort, the goal is simply to get out of Skull Island uneaten. Thanks.So? It's a watchable action/adventure with giant monsters. If this is your kind of thing, shut your higher cerebral functions off and open wide.6,5/10",7,5,7,3 July 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Still dwarfed
","The Battle of the Five Armies hides a decent fantasy blockbuster somewhere inside it, but director Peter Jackson drowns it beneath clunky set-pieces and bloat, tossing in every Middle-earth thing not nailed down by the Tolkien Estate and adding his own romantic fan fiction, to boot. It's a wonder we don't get a scene with a pony-riding Tom Bombadil fighting Morgoth, and the pony is ON FIRE.The cast is blameless. Freeman is fine as Bilbo and so is Armitage as tragic hero Thorin. Everyone else is at least adequate. Unfortunately, the movie hammers their performances with a noisy score (whatever Jackson developed must be contagious, as the once brilliant Howard Shore got it too) and unnecessary special effects (nuclear Galadriel! dragon-sick Thorin!).There are some grace notes here and there: a fine prologue with Bard facing the dragon Smaug in a burning Esgaroth had me giddy and quite fooled for a while - although Bilbo doesn't indirectly inform the archer of Smaug's vulnerable point, which was thematically significant in the book.Sadly, there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments as well; cut every Tauriel, Legolas and Alfrid scene (thankfully, Radagast is barely there) and about 30% of the action (conservative estimate) and the film would improve considerably.Like George Lucas before him, Jackson succumbs to set-pieces onanism. If the hero fights five enemies on a tower, it's exciting; if he fights fifty and he uses CGI-enhanced ninja moves and the tower is collapsing under a meteor shower, it's numbing: viewers stop feeling tension and mentally check out.Here, Galadriel banishes Sauron using a garish spell (wasn't that her evil/tempted form? and the one thing from the Fellowship I didn't need to see again); Beorn jumps from an eagle and morphs into a bear in mid-air; Dain headbutts armored orcs and rides a pig...... and Legolas? It's better not to even MENTION Legolas. He was already an avatar for Jackson's worst instincts in the original trilogy; here, the cheesy stuntman has googled the cheat codes. The one moment of clever, effective restraint - Thorin letting Azog fall in a frozen lake - is spoiled by its horror movie coda.The Battle of The Five Armies is the cinematic equivalent of ordering a coffee and having it delivered after twenty minutes with avocado marmalade and gummy bears by a hollering clown on a monocycle: you get your coffee, but also an major headache. And you wonder: why?The lean beauty of The Fellowship of the Ring seems like a hundred years ago.5/10",5,8,14,19 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Yo mama is so ugly, she put the 'ug' in 'Ugnaught'
","Of all the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith wastes the biggest potential.The Phantom Menace was hurt by its structure (the Tatooine mid-section is so clunky, it kills the momentum of the whole movie); Attack of the Clones is a pestilent disaster.But Revenge... there was a great premise here. Now that the new, Disney-tagged cycle of Star Wars has begun with the depressingly safe Episode Seven (a movie which is 'a bit derivative' in the same way hydrogen cyanide is 'a bit unhealthy'), Lucas' ambitions with the prequels appear all the more admirable, his failure all the more disappointing. Revenge was supposed to be the climax of Anakin Skywalker's downfall, the culmination of his reverse hero's journey; bad writing and consequently weak performances turned it into a 'what could have been' anecdote.People mock Lucas as someone whose main priority was selling action figures but, watching scenes like the Jedi purge or the Obi-wan/Anakin duel, I don't see that at all. I see a once vital storyteller trying - trying hard - to recapture what talent he once possessed.Sadly, much like Kurt Vonnegut's fictional writer Kilgore Trout, George has interesting ideas but botches the execution; his hubris got the better of him when he decided he should be the scriptwriter instead of merely the creative force which provided the basic story elements. The prequel trilogy in general and Revenge in particular were a brave, ambitious project which didn't deliver its full potential. And that's why J. J. Abrams overcompensated in terms of caution.5,5/10",6,6,10,11 November 2016
Inception," Dickian dreams
","Say what you want of Nolan, the new populist demigod of Hollywood: that his movies are overplotted, his themes overstated, his structure wonky. However, you have to give it to Chris: he is generous. Other writers/directors live and die by a single gimmick, but he keeps throwing more and more ambitious stuff at the screen - he reminds me of Philip K. Dick, another artist who casually poured in a few pages more ideas than many of his colleagues used in a half-dozen books.Nolan has the same high-concept vitality: amnesiac protagonist tries to avenge his wife guided by tattoos on his body and Polaroid pictures (still his best, by far); a feud between illusionists in early 20th century London gets increasingly nasty.In Inception, con men use a special technology to navigate through people's dreams and steal their secrets. From the tone-perfect James Bond prologue to the climactic hurricane of set pieces, the movie transcends its limits - its clunky rules and the fact the dream world mechanics are not exploited as creatively as they could have - and succeeds thanks to its juicy premise and jaw-dropping cast, with Di Caprio in another of his 'tormented young man' turns he has been perfecting since The Departed, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy.Then we have gorgeous Marion Cotillard in Inception's most poignant idea - the protagonist, obsessed by his dead wife, tries to recreate her, but she ends up as a distorted, menacing memory haunting his fragile dream world.8/10",8,3,5,3 April 2014
Prometheus," Script expendable
","For about twenty minutes, Prometheus promises to be the first worthy entry of the Alien franchise since decades: a Lovecraftian thing of awe and terror, a space version of At The Mountains of Madness, enriched by Scott's sumptuous style.Unfortunately, crisp visuals cannot stop the script from collapsing under silliness and vapid characterization. Only Fassbender's David emerges as a compelling individual, while everyone else is either flat, inconsistent, or a moron: the biologist who runs away from a corpse but stops to pet an alien snake in full threat display mode is already a meme of horror movie idiocy. These lowbrow moments - see also the stoner geologist: it's amazing how much these minor characters hurt Prometheus - clash with the film's lofty ambitions of saying something meaningful about faith, religion and mankind's place in the universe. It's like a Jackass version of Rendezvous with Rama.Oh, and I like Charlize Theron as much as the next guy, but what exactly was she doing here? How is her Vickers necessary to the plot? Waste of a fine thespian; and the same goes for Idris Elba as the captain and a prune-faced Guy Pearce in bad old man make-up.Scott complained the Xenomorph was becoming mundane after years of overexposure and tried to shock audiences with new creatures - sadly, the results include a flexible space zombie and a brawl between a giant albino and an humongous squid. Less is more, Ridley.I'll defend Prometheus on one point, though. Not explaining the Engineers' motivations has been criticized, but it's the ONE THING the script nailed. The moment you start exposing the thought process of a powerful alien race, sci-fi steers towards parody. It's one of the few ideas here worthy of an Alien prequel (sort of). Even Spielberg and Shyamalan, not exactly masters of subtlety, had the good sense of letting their aliens in War of the Worlds and Signs keep their mouths shut.Not a total disaster, but a tragically missed occasion. Then again, while Scott's first three movies (The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner) are among my favorites, almost everything else he has done since has left me disappointed.That trailer surely looked great though.5,5/10",5,4,5,25 February 2015
1408," Not the Overlook Hotel
","There is a reason why Stephen King's books are usually good while their movie adaptations usually aren't. King has one main strength as a writer: a vivid, crisp prose. Unfortunately, aside from dialogues, that's the one aspect which doesn't translate from page to screen.The plot of 1408 could be written on a stamp: skeptical writer Mike (John Cusack) - the usual King protagonist, a talented, hard-drinking, cynical novelist (how original, Steve!) - rents an infamous haunted room in a New York hotel and finds himself trapped there as Bad Things Start To Happen.Cusack is reliable, turning in an entertaining performance. The setup is fine: the conversation between Mike and the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson, wasted, as is Tony Shalhoub) is tight and well-written, with compelling performances and King's excellent ear for dialogues. And still, the result is mediocre fluff. 1408 pulls too many punches to be scary. When Mike desperately peers through the keyhole, I wanted a sharp blade to poke him in the eye. I wanted a rabid dog to come out of the picture on the wall and jump at his throat. I wanted the ghost of his dead daughter to be a vampire-like presence. I wanted the firemen at the end to remain trapped inside room 1408.

","A recurring theme in Martin Scorsese's filmography is the clash between professional and private life. In both Goodfellas and Casino, the protagonist's family is eroded by the same criminal connections which initially helped forming it. In Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle's psychosis is fueled by his nocturnal contact with the city's seedy underbelly. The paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead experiences burn-out. In The Departed, the main characters are both undercover, mirroring each other in their daily deception. Shutter Island features a neat subversion, which I won't spoil as it's the movie's main twist.This biopic of boxer Jake La Motta (De Niro) may be Scorsese's best execution of this theme. La Motta's ferocity propels him to championship, but takes a toll on his life ruining his relationships with his brother (Pesci) and wives - domestic and professional violence appear to feed each other in a terrifying, self-destructive spiral.Raging Bull is technically exceptional, with stylish black and white cinematography, perfect editing, masterful use of sound. De Niro burns the screen with an incandescent performance - one of the two-three turns which made him a legend as opposed to just a great actor - making his loutish, unsavory character an unsettling, pitiable, tragic figure.8,5/10",8,5,8,22 February 2016
Toy Story 3," Memento Mori
","Disney characters often face death, and yet death itself is usually an anomaly for them, a breach made by villainy in their happy worlds. Toy Story 3, however, might be the first major Hollywood animated feature more or less explicitly *about* death. The premise has the protagonists terrified by the prospect of their now seventeen-year-old owner Andy going to college and getting rid of them. They know they are running out of time: even when they end up as gifts in a daycare run by a dictator-like teddy bear and attempt to escape, the specter of the garbage bin looms over them. It's no coincidence the last act features escathological imagery like the hellish fire of the incinerator or the heavenly sky of the last shot.Not that Toy Story 3 is bleak; it's a good-natured roller-coaster ride with quirky characters, creative set-pieces, witty dialogues - a funny tale of flamenco-dancing toy astronauts, self-absorbed Ken dolls and happy endings. Still, this unique perspective lends it a special pathos; good movies can simply be well-crafted, but great movies need to be ABOUT something. Pixar has been tackling with serious themes (diversity, paternity, senility, abandonment) ever since the first Toy Story: this is one of their boldest projects yet. Let's hope they keep pushing the envelope - to infinity and beyond.8,5/10",9,3,4,16 August 2014
Signs," Flawed but better than its reputation
","There are few things more or less all moviegoers tend to agree about, one of them being that the career of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, after an impressive start (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), has turned out to be a huge disappointment. Opinions may differ on the moment he completely lost it, although Lady in the Water is generally regarded as the point his hubris got the better of him.Like The Village, Signs belongs to a middle Shyamalan phase, where his visual talent still made up for his limits (preachiness, plot holes, the egotistic insistence of casting himself in pivotal roles).Signs follows an alien invasion from the point of view of a small rural family including a widowed father (Mel Gibson), his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and two kids. The movie is filmed with style, intelligence and an unusual attention to silence and stillness in the build-up of atmosphere.The elephant in the room is, of course, a plot hole so conspicuous it has achieved memetic status, with the water-allergic invaders mastering interstellar travel but not raincoats and umbrellas. Why don't you just commit yourself to directing and leave screenplays to better writers and acting to actors, Night? Not everyone can be Orson Welles and pull triple duty.Special mention for the fine score by James Newton Howard, homaging the works of the great Bernard Herrman.6,5/10",7,30,45,23 March 2016
Identity," Entertaining pulp
","Perhaps the most scathing criticism against Identity is how it bears an uncanny resemblance to Nicolas Cage's bogus, deliberately silly script The Three in Spike Jonze's Adaptation. Contrived high-concept aside, this thriller is a good example of cinematic guilty pleasure.Identity features tight performances by a strong cast (Cusack and Liotta are always reliable, but watch out for John Hawkes' stellar turn as a sleazy motel owner) and an enjoyable variation of the classic 'And then there were none' formula for contained thrillers. Mangold is a fine visual director; both set pieces and quieter character moments are lean and intelligently crafted.7/10",7,3,4,8 March 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Green and yellow
","Playing as Wes Anderson's greatest hits, Moonrise Kingdom features teenagers in love, ineffectual but sympathetic father figures, memorable use of music, a whimsical bittersweet tone, an astounding attention to details, a style based on rigorous camera movements, symmetrical compositions and an exquisite use of colours - the dominant palettes here are green and yellow (Anderson has been changing them in nearly every movie).Some viewers, both those who have lost their affection for the director around the time of Fantastic Mr. Fox and those who could never bear him, might see all this as mannered and trying too hard to be quirky: I see it as an auteur with full command of the medium.Performances are superb, with a cast featuring both Bruce Willis and Edward Norton brilliantly cast against type, Frances McDormand, Anderson regulars Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzmann. Special mention for the two young leads Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, who give eye-popping debuts as the teens who escape together in a bucolic New England island and are pursued by police, scouts and parents.8/10",8,4,6,27 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Playing it safe
","The Force Awakens avoids some of the prequels' worst flaws, so hooray for that: it features no clunky dialogues and wooden performances. In fact, the best thing about Episode VII is what is NOT there. Although, to be fair to Lucas, Episodes I-III were messier than this new entry but also far more ambitious.The movie is competent but safe and failed to resonate in any way for me. The plot is a rehash of A New Hope, beyond the 'following common fantasy / sci-fi tropes' justification and more into the 'stealth remake with new protagonists' territory. To me this is like watching Gus Van Sant's Psycho: in itself it's an ok movie, but I'm already familiar with the superior original, so it's just pointless.Still, the first half or so is fine. There is some good visual storytelling as we follow Rey (Daisy Ridley) striving to survive and scavenging the wreckage of a Star Destroyer on Jakku (another desert planet... since you're already remaking A New Hope, Abrams, can't you at least change the setting?). Rey works well in these scenes; pity she becomes overpowered in the rest of the movie. Suffice to say, you leave the movie with the impression that the villain is the underdog.Speaking of the villain, funny how sequels of classic blockbusters are becoming self-conscious. Jurassic World mocked the need to introduce new dinosaurs to entertain the audience; Episode VII features a bad guy, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is obsessed with a character from the original trilogy (Darth Vader) and tormented by his inability to top him.I UNDERSTAND what they were trying to do with Kylo (the unpredictable villain who, like the young heroes, is way over his head). I respect the attempt to do something novel. But he is too lightweight as the main antagonist, he lacks charisma, gravitas, dignity (he would have been just fine as a secondary villain). The barely-seen, Emperor-like 'Supreme Leader' is a banal CGI creation; also, his name is Snoke, which sounds like something you buy at IKEA.The other new leads are Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and droid BB-8. Poe the dashing pilot is two-dimensional but fine. Finn is interesting on paper (a Stormtrooper deserter and the only hero with an actual arc) but writing-wise he is a mixed bag - a guy brainwashed since childhood by a fascist military regime turns out to be a lovable goofball; Boyega's likable performance saves this contradictory character. BB-8 is adorable.There is also the return of Han and Leia, something I was dreading and could happily have done without (likewise for Luke in the upcoming sequel)... how sad seeing them so old, having failed at everything (the Empire has returned, their son has become a monster) and, in Han's case, with their characterization rebooted to square one. The comebacks of Chewie, C-3PO and R2 are inoffensive though.While politics are not as prominent as in the prequels, there is at least one baffling choice: we have the Republic, which is good, and the Resistance, also good but a separate entity... why? It's like they went the extra mile to do something uselessly complicated. Just merge them and turn the Resistance into the REPUBLICAN ARMY (which is otherwise conspicuously absent).Music has always been a crucial part of Star Wars; unfortunately, John Williams - whose soundtracks were among the best things of the original trilogy AND the prequels - is below his par here. The old iconic themes are there but the new material is mostly forgettable. Rey's theme is the only one which stands out but it's still far from Williams' best work... and doesn't appear to fit the character, at all. It sounds like a leitmotif for Harry Potter's kooky, fey Luna Lovegood, not for this hard-nosed survivor.I can't muster up much enthusiasm about The Force Awakens, but it may be setting up some interesting progression for the next episodes.5,5/10",5,12,28,25 January 2016
Flight," See you all on the dark side of the moon
","Robert Zemeckis reminds me of Steven Spielberg - a gifted visual storyteller who is usually better at more lighthearted fare (in his case, Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) than at darker stuff. Flight, however, is Zemeckis' best serious movie, a sharp drama anchored by a magnificent performance by Denzel Washington.Washington plays Whip Whitaker, veteran pilot whose plane malfunctions during a flight (a tense set-piece which Zemeckis handles superbly). Whip pulls off an impossible maneuver and manages to land saving almost everyone on board; when he awakens in a hospital, he is hailed as a hero. Trouble is, Whip is an alcoholic - he was piloting drunk and high on cocaine. While he was unconscious, blood samples were taken from him, toxicology tests performed; Whip realizes he may go from saviour to culprit of the disaster.I've never seen Washington give a weak performance; this is among his best ones. Whip is a thorny character, a man capable of decency and empathy, but also weak and self-destructive. If the first act of the movie is about Whip's plane crashing, what follows is about Whip's LIFE crashing and burning as well.Although the incident is the flashier scene, a few quieter moments are even better, such as when, at the funeral of a crew member, Whip emotionally blackmails a surviving hostess into keeping quiet about his addiction ('Imagine your son at this same church looking at you in that box'). As far as Hollywood protagonists go, Whip is a rather unsavory type.The stellar supporting cast includes John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle - three actors who are always good - and Kelly Reilly as a drug addict who bonds with Whip; Reilly is fine in the tricky role but her subplot feels truncated and narratively unbalanced.Although the ending isn't as clichéd as it could have been, I feel Flight screamed for a darker conclusion - one tragic in the classical sense, where the protagonist is destroyed by his fatal flaw. Still, this is a powerful character study, both Zemeckis' and Washington's best work in years.7,5/10",8,5,8,24 October 2015
Rear Window," Tell me what you saw and what you think it means
","What makes Rear Window a masterpiece? Well, it's got one of the best directors of all time, one of the most likable leads, one of the most beautiful ladies... but even these first-rate ingredients don't always result in greatness, so there must be more. I would say it's about *richness*: there is a lot going on beneath the surface.Still, the surface itself is flawless. The mystery plot about Jeff (James Stewart), photographer with a broken leg who spies a murderous neighbor, can't be improved upon. The script is a masterclass in visual storytelling, set-ups and pay-offs; see how Jeff's profession provides the reason of his condition, a tool to investigate the case and a defense during the climax. Even potentially slow moments crackle. The back-story between Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) is delivered with acerbic wit in a conversation with nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter). The 'why don't they just go to the police' moment, which Hitchcock usually dreaded (he famously told Truffaut his characters don't go to the police because 'it's dull'), flows by thanks to the quirky banter between Jeff and his detective friend Doyle (Wendell Corey).Beneath this, there are several layers of subtext. The first is about marriage. Lisa wants to marry Jeff, but he is reluctant, regarding her as too snobbish and sophisticated. Everything Jeff sees from his window is about relationships (or lack thereof): the attractive ballerina with her suitors; the older, lonely woman; the bachelor struggling with his work; the newlyweds who spend all their time in bed; the mature couple with a dog as surrogate son. And, of course, Thorwald (Raymond Burr) killing his wife, which acts as a double catalyst: at first, it taps into Jeff's unconscious fears about failed relationships; then, it becomes a reason of bonding between him and Lisa, as she proves surprisingly good at boys' games. How does she finally entice Jeff? She sneaks into Thorwald's apartment and retrieves a piece of evidence... a wedding ring.Rear Window is known to be about voyeurism, but I would say it's also about *spectatorship*. Stuck in his chair, Jeff follows from his window the unfolding events, much like us viewers staring at the screen. He is unable to interact directly with the 'outside world', so he sends others (Stella, Doyle, but mostly Lisa) to do the dirty work; however, he is nearly powerless to defend them... and himself, when threat creeps into his own secluded universe. 10/10 for one of cinema's greatest classics.",10,4,7,15 February 2016
The Purge," How to be a scriptwriter in one easy lesson!
","Want to sell your scripts for a fortune? The Purge shows you how it's done. Find an easily marketable premise which grabs people's attention ('Dystopian future: one night a year, murder is legal'), and that's it - you can coast on your high-concept idea without bothering with the rest of the script. Writing for The Purge could be charitably called a mess: characters are blank slates ('the father', 'the mother', 'the son', 'the daughter'), its garden-variety nihilism laughable; dialogues so absurdly on the nose, they sound like a parody; and if you were surprised by a resolutive intervention near the end, you are the kind of viewer who would run away terrified from a train projected on a big screen, like the first public of brothers Lumière. The final scene, with the most awkward neighbors' reunion ever filmed, gives a new meaning to the word 'anticlimactic' and almost achieves a kind of unintentional, sublime ridiculousness.Action consists of people crawling in an inexplicably huge house in the dark - seriously, Headey moves around for like 20 minutes during the climax without stumbling into any of the ten or so intruders, or into her husband wrestling with them. For long stretches it feels like wandering into IKEA at night - dark room, furniture, furniture, new dark room - only punctuated by cheap jump scares. Compare this to Fincher's Panic Room, with its careful sense of movements and spatial relationships within the confined environmentHawke and Headey are both capable performers, wasted here in roles which require alternatively either wide-eyed panic or squint-eyed determination. Perhaps the worst offender is how the high-concept sci-fi premise turns out to be irrelevant: this is essentially just another 'home invasion' thriller, like dozens which have preceded it.Watch Bryan Bertino's The Strangers instead, as it played with a similar scenario with much higher craft (in spite of its wafer-thin plot) and skillful use of pacing, framing and composition.4/10",4,5,9,2 February 2014
The Matrix," Keanu versus Philip K. Dick
","Action set pieces in this movie have already become iconic: brilliantly choreographed, inventive and gloriously over the top, they represent a fine mix of science fiction and martial arts. The 'bullet-time' effect, in particular, has been ripped off dozens of times since.Unfortunately, that's the only real achievement of the Matrix series; everything else reeks of Philip K. Dick for dummies. Not only the stuff about alternative realities and cyberspace, but also pretty much every other idea seems to have been discreetly borrowed from other sources (aside from Dick, major inspirations are Alex Proyas' Dark City and William Gibson's Count Zero). Even the famous set piece where Neo (Reeves) infiltrates an enemy base to rescue his mentor/guru Morpheus (Fishburne) has its precedent in Dick, bullet-time included (read Counter-clockwise if you don't believe me). The result is an admittedly pretty collage.Human element is weak, which makes emotional involvement faint; characters are bland, showing little personality. Reeves' Neo is just a blank. Fishburne and Moss fare a little better, but the stand-outs are Pantoliano as traitorous Cypher and an icy, smug Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith: every time he is on screen the movie shift gears. It's one of the Matrix' ironies that its cybernetic villain is a lot more lively than the human hero. Kubrick did the same in 2001, but that was a deliberate choice.While Dick's works are rich with irony and melancholy, the Wachowskis go for kung fu and head shots. Still, better an overdose of action than the portentous posturing which they tried to pass off as philosophy in the two sequels.7/10",7,4,7,17 September 2008
Godzilla," Smashes Emmerich's lizard. Hooray?
","There is a fantastic moment in this film, already spoiled in trailers and posters, with parachutists launching over a ravaged metropolis, their red flares streaking the dark sky, monsters glimpsed through clouds and smoke. It's marvellous stuff, the only truly electrifying scene in the picture.Gareth Edwards follows his debut Monsters, a fine-looking movie with a mediocre script, with his new version of Godzilla, a great-looking movie with an average script.See, humongous CGI beasts trashing up a city can be visually striking, but need a strong human element to underpin them. Godzilla appears to provide it in the form of Bryan Cranston's obsessed scientist Brody (Jaws reference duly noted), a fairly interesting lead who gets dispatched one-third into the picture to be replaced with his stoic G.I. Joe son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), as generic as blockbuster protagonists get, the son's pretty nurse wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and their inevitable little kid. It's tedious stuff, and no amount of visual spectacle can turn a boilerplate script into some popcorn masterpiece.The great Ken Watanabe gets to spout exposition and look awed a lot, while Juliette Binoche gets to die within a minute of screen time.Well, at least it's no Roland Emmerich's Godzilla, I'll give it that.6,5/10",6,4,6,12 August 2014
Life," Goodnight Alien
","A crew of astronauts faces a first-encounter scenario with a hostile alien life-form, which picks them off one by one.Sounds familiar? Let's get right to it: it's impossible to discuss this without mentioning Alien (so SPOILERS for that film as well), because Daniel Espinosa' movie borrows so heavily from Ridley Scott's classic that it becomes the proverbial elephant (er, xenomorph?) in the room.Alien is a milestone of horror/science-fiction where every element – Scott's elegant direction, O'Bannon's taut script, solid performances, phenomenal creature and set design – worked together to create a masterpiece of cinematic dread. It may not be a pleasant watching experience – it's an oppressive, nightmarish film, unlike James Cameron less disturbing but breezier sequel – but it's up there in any serious Top 100 movie list.How does Life fare against the 1979 titan? Well, Alien is obviously light years above it, but Life does not embarrass itself either. It's better than Prometheus, which was much more ambitious and therefore more awkward in its failure. Life is... passable. The first forty minutes or so are actually excellent, with an effective build-up of tension as the scientists retrieve samples from Mars' soil and study a fast-growing organism (which they name 'Calvin') found in it. Direction, production values, performances and characterization are all above adequate; incidentally, Ariyon Bakare's paraplegic biologist, who sees all his dreams come true before they blow up in his face, would have been a more interesting main character. Also, I would pay money to listen to Rebecca Ferguson read aloud even a History of Fourteenth Century Clavichords.Then the movie degenerates to an extent. Why is that? Again, Alien is the key to understand this. Less is more. We see way too much of starfish/octopus-like Calvin once its killing spree begins. When re-watching Alien, it's striking how little we see of the Xenomorph after the chest-bursting scene. I don't think its various on-screen appearances last more than a minute until the climax, and, with one exception and a deleted scene, we never see what he does to its victims. In Life, Calvin keeps bouncing around like an evil CGI rubber ball, dispatching characters in gruesome detail (also, it grows a cobra-like mug to grin at its preys, which was a really silly design choice). As a result, it's far less creepy.Also less creepy is the location, although that was an inevitable problem once you go for the modern day setting, with a realistically cramped space station. Alien's colossal Nostromo was a haunted house in space, with plenty of dark rooms to explore and darker corridors for the creature to crawl in.But the real horror of Alien was how it implied a Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious threats well beyond mankind's understanding (that was before Prometheus came out and started putting tags on them, thanks a lot). Here everything is neatly explained and spelled out. That's the organism which caused mass extinction on Mars, a nasty bugger which eats everything, is nearly invulnerable and as smart as the plot needs it to be.Speaking of that, it's amusing in a meta kind of way how Life follows the tone of Alien's original ending (when the script was still called Star Beast), complete with Diabolus Ex Machina. Watching Life, it's clear the choice to tone down the Xenomorph's powers at the end of Alien was a smart one - unlike Calvin here, who instantly knows how every piece of machinery works, much like the genius sharks in Deep Blue Sea. It may be intelligent, but intelligence doesn't work like that; a space octopus which two hours ago was no bigger than an Escherichia Coli cannot simply glance at the cockpit of a spaceship and know how to pilot it, sorry.While I can appreciate a dark twist as much as any horror fan, I appreciate it more when it feels a little less contrived and smugly 'wah-wah!' - something more creepily ambiguous, like in Carpenter's The Thing, which remains the gold standard for this kind of endings.6,5/10",7,40,59,17 July 2017
The Thin Red Line," Only around people
","It's tempting sometimes for those who write a movie review to treat it as a math test: count the mistakes to see how good it is.Terrence Malick's sprawling, humanistic The Thin Red Line transcends that. In theory, its flaws are there for all to see. Structurally, it's a mess. It's too long. Pacing in the second half is cumbrous and stammering, the task to squeeze a final cut from all filmed material reportedly herculean. Cameos by celebrities like Clooney or a pencil moustached Travolta in unsubstantial roles are more a jarring distraction than an asset.And yet... as John Toll's luscious cinematography shows atolls with crystal-clear waters, jungles pierced by sun rays, crocodiles sinking in swamps and snakes slithering on emerald grass, something unique happens. The Thin Red Line goes beyond a war movie about Guadalcanal and becomes richly textured, engrossing epic. Armies clash, and so do different philosophies. Malick plays with time and memory, quotes Proust, Homer and the Gospel, imbues the movie with a mystical quality. The five major players - Caviezel, Koteas, Penn, Chaplin and Nolte - provide deeply felt performances, while Zimmer crafts an haunting score enriched by Melanesian songs of rare beauty.Malick's best, and on the short list of cinema's greatest movies, The Thin Red Line is a breathing, pulsating thing, incomplete and flawed and awe-inspiring as life itself can be.",10,23,29,9 March 2014
Annihilation," Was it carbon based?
","Annihilation is a tough sell. Fans of fast-paced action movies who just want to watch Natalie Portman shooting monsters in the face may be irked by the film's slow pace and reliance on atmosphere. On the other hand, admirers of weighty, cerebral science-fiction may consider Annihilation too pulpy; there are not many violent or horrific scenes, but what violence is there is quite gruesome and what horror is there is fairly disturbing. Nitpicky moviegoers will complain that many things here (both character choices and scientific stuff) don't stand up to closer scrutiny; it's not quite Prometheus bad, but it's sometimes baffling (funny how all these scientists handle the most sickening, pestilent-looking specimens without gloves). Fans of the source material may be disappointed by changes; I haven't read Jeff VanderMeer's novel but I understand writer/director Alex Garland took many liberties with this adaptation.Me? I liked it just fine. Annihilation is not on par with Garland's remarkable Ex Machina but it does scratch my itch for creepy science-fiction/horror made with craft and care. This feels, in tone and themes, quite Lovecraftian.In fact, the premise is reminiscent of Lovecraft's underrated The Colour out of Space. A mysterious biological entity from space infects a region of the United States; flora and fauna start mutating, mixing different species, with an uncontrolled proliferation like a giant, ever-expanding tumor. Five female scientists venture in the zone; among them is protagonist Lena (Natalie Portman), seeking a way to help her husband (Oscar Isaac), a Black Ops soldier who came back from the zone sick and deeply changed.The movie looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards) 40 millions budget, with excellent, creative production design. While it's not as intellectual or abstruse as some reviews may lead one to believe, Annihilation does put enough spins on familiar tropes to feel fresh and novel; it's not the usual Aliens clone. I did find the very ending a little obvious though.Still, the film builds up the tension nicely to some unsettling moments, like found footage of a previous mission or an encounter with a monstrous hybrid. I also like how the mutations are not always a source of horror but occasionally also of awe and beauty; again, it feels very Lovecraftian.Finally, a special mention to the climax in the lighthouse, which I won't spoil; it's creepy, unexpected and feels unique in terms of confrontations with extraterrestrial entities seen in movies.7/10",7,155,255,20 March 2018
Saboteur," Hitchcock's running men
","Saboteur belongs to the group I call 'middle Hitch' - neither among his timeless masterpieces (Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo...) nor among his very good movies (To Catch a Thief, Suspicion...), but still better than his rare weak efforts (Jamaica Inn, Frenzy...).The 'middle Hitch' includes breezy, fun genre movies (The Lady Vanishes, Young and Innocent...), with flashes of genius here and there. Saboteur follows the 'innocent man on the run' template which the director had been tackling since The 39 Steps and which will peak decades later with North by Northwest. Leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are lightweight but likable; the story of a young man wrongly accused of sabotage who must escape the police and find the real culprit is entertaining, although Hitchcock's own assessment (in one of his insightful interviews with Truffaut) that the script lacks discipline and is cluttered with too many ideas seems accurate.7/10",7,3,3,6 May 2016
Spectre," Human Bond
","I admit I prefer 007 as some sort of British-accented, Tuxedo-wearing android who travels around the world shooting bad guys and delivering witticisms. Spectre, much like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Licence To Kill and the last acts of Casino Royale and Skyfall, is about a more human James Bond, an actual person with a past, someone who needs to cope with love and loss: this is the most continuity-heavy Bond movie ever, with constant references to the last films. Not my favorite approach to Bond - to quote Fleming 'Surround yourself with human beings, dear James. They're easier to fight for than principles. But don't let me down and become human yourself. We would lose a wonderful machine' - but it's competently done here. (Only, ENOUGH with Bond's sorrow over Vesper Lynd. It's become more repetitive an affectation than the 'shaken not stirred' Martini).Overall, I'd rate this lower than Casino Royale and Skyfall and higher than Quantum Of Solace. Craig and main girl Seydoux are solid; Waltz is predictably fine as Blofeld - I love the quietly mischievous way he delivers his lines. Bautista is an effective old-school henchman.Visually, the most interesting moment is the first sequence, a one-take shot which brings Bond from the streets of Mexico City to a hotel room and finally to the rooftop where he tracks down his target. In general, the first two acts of Spectre are entertaining; however, by the time Bond shows up at the villain's secret lair and pretty much knocks at the door with no plan whatsoever, the movie lost me and only Waltz kept me engaged. Spectre also follows the school of thought that a blockbuster isn't bloated enough if it features just one narrative climax, so we get two.(Incidentally, you say Blofeld's machine will impair Bond's sense of equilibrium, you need to SHOW IT in the next action scene. Set-up and pay-off, anyone?)While the sadistic final choice Bond faces is compelling, the ending is rather bland: without giving away major spoilers, I'll just say that, considering Spectre's dark tone, I was hoping for something far braver.6/10",6,6,13,8 November 2015
Braveheart," Mel versus history
","Why is Braveheart regarded as a great movie? It's a serious question.I'll grant the soundtrack is fine - probably the last effective work by the now increasingly insufferable James Horner.Aside for that, Braveheart belongs with Gladiator and Titanic to the Hall of Fame of 'Bafflingly popular, but nothing special' pseudo-historical movies (and I'd argue it's the weakest among those three).So, why is this great? Characters? Set-pieces? The human drama is laughable. Director Mel Gibson and writer Randall Wallace never met a cliché they didn't like. The true historical events would be interesting enough without spicing them up with nonsense; see the fictional romance between Wallace and princess Isabella, something so mawkish it would make a soap-opera writer blush with shame (note that the real Isabella was about ten years old when Wallace died).Characters are painted in broad strokes: Wallace = flawless hero, giving Gibson the chance to play the umpteenth messianic figure of his career; Edward Longshanks = Satan, with Patrick McGoohan having a blast as the moustache-twirling villain; Isabella = romantic princess yearning for real love, so lovely Marceau can make puppy eyes at Gibson and have ludicrous 'Oooh, he looks so hot!' chats with her handmaiden. The only one who is given some depth is Robert Bruce, allowing Angus Macfayden to walk away with the movie. Other low points include the racism inherent in making every British character a sneering monster and the odiously homophobic portrayal of Edward II - who was just a little boy at the time - as an effete, mean-spirited buffoon (think how the murder of his lover is played for laughs!). Battle scenes, while featuring a certain visceral intensity, are not great. There is no sense of complex tactics or spatial relationships; Gibson's notion of medieval warfare seems to be 'people running and screaming'. Incidentally, swords are MELEE WEAPONS. They cannot be thrown at a great distance with a whirling sound to impale an enemy far away... unless you are in some cheap sword and sorcery flick.The funniest thing about these battles, though, has to be our heroic Scots using both face paint (which was a Celtic practice hundred of years BEFORE) and kilts (invented much LATER). It's the equivalent of a WWII movie with soldiers carrying both medieval armors and iPods. However, while ridiculous, this is a non-issue compared to clichés and paper-thin characters.Still, this is per se a watchable flick - just don't try to sell it as the next Lawrence of Arabia. 6/10",6,8,13,12 September 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Grampa Miller shows how it's done
","I guess I'm the living proof Fury Road is an action masterpiece, as I never particularly cared for the post-apocalyptic setting and I'm usually bored by car chases, and yet this movie blew me away. Set-pieces are varied and exciting, pacing is phenomenal. Hardy, Hoult and especially Theron are excellent. In fact, Charlize's Furiosa is arguably the main character and one of the greatest action heroines in years, whereas Hardy's Max is more like a Man With No Name archetype who gets involved in a pre-existing conflict and rolls along with it. Storytelling is brilliantly sparse and economical: in a cinematic age heavy with exposition and talking heads, writer/director Miller keeps everything focused, leaving minor details to the viewer's imagination. The War Boys spray some silver stuff in their mouths before attacking... what is it? We can guess it's some kind of drug used as part of their kamikaze ritual, but the movie (smartly) doesn't stop to explain. A secondary villain is named The People Eater... why? Another blockbuster would have dished out his backstory, but here we can only imagine it, as it's not relevant to the plot. The same goes for The Bullett Farmer, for the mysterious stilt walkers inhabiting the swamp, an so on. Even in terms of themes, the movie has much to say about environment and gender politics, but seamlessly weaves it into plot and characterization.And that's why Fury Road MOVES like no other action film in years.9/10",9,6,13,9 November 2015
Macbeth," O, full of scorpions is my mind
","Justin Kurzel's adaptation of the Scottish play features interesting visuals and fine performances. The movie captures some striking images, with mist-draped moors and battlefields soaked in a nightmarish red light. It does 'look good' in the simplest, most earnest meaning of the phrase, although it lacks the exquisite movement and composition of Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Ran or the ingenious way Orson Welles' Othello played with architecture.Fassbender is forceful and charismatic - a strong turn with moments of sheer brilliance, like the mirthless, desperate laughter he delivers when uttering the line I put in the review's title. Cotillard is powerful as long as her Lady is ruthless and manipulative, but gets sidelined when she spirals into madness. Harris and Considine are excellent in supporting roles.For the standard of cinematic adaptations of the Bard I would call this moderately faithful, but there are a few dubious choices. Here Malcolm flees to England after discovering a still bloody Macbeth next to Duncan's corpse, which reflects very poorly on him and makes little sense (why would the Thane spare him at this point?). Macbeth's last stand also feels too much 'tragic hero' and not enough 'villain protagonist'; he essentially commits suicide and is given a curiously dignified ending. It is true that, in spite of his deeds, Macbeth is meant to engage, to an extent, our sympathy... but he is not supposed to be Brutus.Macbeth and his wife losing a child (the movie opens with his funeral), on the other hand, is a reasonable interpretation of the source material - see the Lady's 'I have given suck, and know' (1.7).As far as Shakespeare on the big screen goes, this is, overall, a respectable effort. If in the future Kurzel will handle other plays, they will be worth watching.7/10",7,3,4,3 February 2016
Jurassic Park," Something about Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg has always been at his best with blockbusters. Although he is a master storyteller and a peerless technician, his serious movies, while always worth watching, can undermine their pathos with an excess of sentimentalism ('James, earn this!', 'Give us free!', 'I could have saved more!') and an array of weak endings (Minority Report, AI, War of the Worlds...).However, Spielberg's childlike glee and exuberance serve him well in more lighthearted fare (although the horrendous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really gave me pause). NOBODY could craft an exciting action set-piece as well as pre-2000s Spielberg: his best efforts (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark...) remain unparalleled in escapist cinema.Jurassic Park, smartly adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (is there a better premise in modern science fiction?), is one of Spielberg's triumphs. Performances are tone-perfect; Jeff Goldblum's witty Malcolm is a crowd-pleaser, but my favorite character remains Sam Neill's Alan Grant, whose evolution from sour child-hater to caring protector gives the movie some much needed humanity lacking in the sequels - see Jurassic World and Chris Pratt's tediously infallible action figure.John Williams' soundtrack is phenomenal, conveying both awe and terror, excitement and sweetness - one of the composer's best works.The attention to the smallest detail is palpable. See how chaos expert Malcolm and benevolent 'creator' Hammond (Attenborough) are clad respectively in black and white, symbolizing disorder and order, yin and yang. It's a small touch, but few other blockbusters bother with this kind of things.And those special effects... with a few irrelevant exceptions, it's mind-boggling how well they have aged. With their blend of practical effects and computer graphics, they still look amazing after twenty years (they have a WEIGHT, a physical presence), while today most special effects-heavy films are instantly dated, a garish slideshow of vaporous CGI.Still, the main star here is Spielberg. Scenes like the T-Rex breakout, the jeep chase or the hide and seek with the Raptors have earned their place in the collective memory of action cinema. Followed by four mostly worthless sequels.10/10",10,3,3,29 November 2014
Alien: Covenant," Jaws: Genesis
","I want a prequel to Jaws where a marine biologist / serial killer trains a young shark genetically-engineered to be super ferocious. Oh, and since the killer was once shot by a sheriff, he teaches the shark to be particularly vicious to law enforcers and their families. You know, I've always wondered why that Great White gave Brody such a hard time! What say you? That would be unbelievably lame? Well, I have good reasons to think Sir Ridley Scott at least would like the idea! If you need the explanation of this dull sarcasm, I hate Alien: Covenant. I kind of hated Prometheus too, but I cut it some slack because of its solid first act and the attempt to do something novel and ambitious, even if it FAILED MISERABLY.This is Prometheus all over again, now without the benefit of the doubt. My sense of dread set in ten minutes into the movie, when a space mission sent to colonize a faraway planet (you know, the kind THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE plan ahead in detail FOR DECADES) changes destination mid-route to another world they stumble into - like when you go out to eat sushi and decide halfway through you feel like pizza instead.They land - without spacesuits, because Dallas was a wimp to be afraid of breathing ammonia and unknown alien pathogens - and it's all downhill from there: schlock, stupidity, one of the most obvious twists I recall in a major production, awful characterization. The *only* individual the movie seems interested in is Fassbender's android David, while everyone else is just a name, a face and (occasionally) a single element of backstory (ranging from 'dead husband' to 'wears hat').And even David isn't that deep. His character premise - the android with a god complex - is neat on paper, but the execution doesn't make a lot of sense. Why would a sophisticated being who styles himself after Lawrence of Arabia and relishes music and poetry regard as a perfect organism a carnivorous, mute, drooling parasite? It made sense for cold, pragmatic Ash, not for this grandstanding guy - it would have been more logic, for example, to have David betray mankind for the more advanced Engineers. Congratulations, Covenant: you have *one* character arc and it falls apart under scrutiny.Most of this would be forgivable if Covenant was exceptionally well-crafted but, while the movie looks fine in terms of production values, the Xenomorph set-pieces are bland (except the first one, which does have some tension), revealing a lack of interest on Scott's behalf. He clearly enjoys lingering on David's shenanigans; almost everything else is stale routine. In fact, Scott seems to identify with the android, supposedly his directorial avatar as a dark genius creator of nightmares. Sadly, he's more like Billy Crudup's misguided captain, foolishly altering an original plan which was just fine, then making a botch of it and sticking his hands and face where he's not supposed to.Fans (rightly) gave George Lucas crap for turning the Force into bacteria in the Star Wars prequels... but at least those were just a couple lines of dialogue. Ridley Scott is making movie after movie ABOUT his own Midichlorians. Every time in Covenant you see a kernel of cosmic horror (like an alien necropolis with thousands of corpses), the movie goes out of its way to make it lame (oh, it was David who bombed them with his bio-weapon in a ten-seconds genocide). Guess what was the best thing about Alien, Ridley? Its lack of explanations. The way it hinted at a Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious threats. Now we know it was a smug villainous android who... for shame, man. 4/10 As a Prometheus sequel, it's baffling (former protagonist Noomi Rapace gets five seconds of screen time as a corpse); as an Alien prequel (something which, frankly, should never have been done) it's also a mess, as the Xenomorph action/horror material is lackluster.",4,6,10,9 September 2017
The Martian," Mars will come to fear my botany powers
","Not on par with Ridley Scott's masterpieces (Alien, Blade Runner), but still his best work in years, The Martian is a neat sci-fi movie which (unsurprisingly) looks amazing and (surprisingly) has a strong script (by Cloverfield's Drew Goddard, adapted from a novel by Andy Weir).Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, astronaut / botanist stranded on Mars after his crew left him for dead during a freaky storm. Cast Away meets Apollo 13, Watney must figure out how to communicate with Earth AND survive until a rescue mission.Cast is great (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean...), with Damon carrying the bulk of the movie with a charismatic performance; visuals are fantastic (Mars has never looked better in movies); Goddard's script is brisk, neither portentous nor dumb, the technological stuff at least *sounds* plausible, and a few clichés are bravely avoided (i.e. no teary-eyed love interest rooting for him at home).Overall, The Martian feels at times a little too cute and upbeat to achieve true epic (Alien and Blade Runner, again!). Although humor is used well, it could have done with a little more gravitas too - you never get the sense of harrowing psychological drama Watney's ordeal should have. Still, this is fine entertainment. Let's give Ridley a break - maybe with his first sci-fi masterpieces he just set the bar too high for himself to reach again.7,5/10",8,8,15,11 October 2015
