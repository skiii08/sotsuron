The Blair Witch Project," War of the Woods
","CONTAINS SPOILERS In Berkeley, The Blair Witch Project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and I avoided seeing it during its first run, suspecting that I'd feel the rip of an eight-dollar ticket. After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos, I still feel that way a little but not because I didn't like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film's setup. The self-filmed documentary approach can't quite carry the movie's weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists, as was the implication, yet there they were. No one among the three `film makers' could have managed the presence of mind, in the midst deep panic, to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of pre-established character, although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations, I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw, twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead, in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods, that they really had to get out, and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know-it-all, especially when said person is female and, thereby, largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike, aggravated and frightened as they were, still could not abandon Heather, who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat-less and being unable to admit it.The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming, almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off, the main characters are not at all likeable, which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night, marooned in a mall or mini-mart parking lot. Heather is an almost-cute, soon-to-be-overweight, classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor, or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night, freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time, comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags, you're right with them. Then, you're suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood, out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough, are not just twigs being snapped. They're branches, big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as `footsteps' but only if the feet are size-72 American. It's left up to us to fully grasp the implications.The three principal actors are, essentially, playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one's self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction, most notably the tough-minded, endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end, you know the doo-doo has gotten very deep. It's not mere post-adolescent, cheeseburger-craving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind; somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather's runny-nosed, video self-portrait, made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far, far over their heads, is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain, clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio; three somewhat loosely-wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film-making project, are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They've just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.And finally the ending, which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth, both in the light of day and dark of night, is compressed perfectly into the film's last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam, the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls, bursting rib cages, and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple, implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement, in Psycho, even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one, Mom and Dad. A child's mind will have no defense, nowhere to run, and most disturbing, nothing tangible to run from; only an invisible, meticulously goal-oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere, and everywhere, at once.",Null,23,36,3 February 2003
The Patriot," The Patrionator
","Quick Name one reason why TV is cool. Ok How about this? It lets you see movies like The Patriot without having to buy a ticket. Sure, you'll miss a bit of the R-rated carnage, but hey, that's why we have imagination. It's why Quentin Tarantino released the pull-way version of the ear-ectomy in Reservoir Dogs instead of the alternate version that actually showed Michael Madsen's razor work. The mind is the real stage, the real screen.The Revolutionary War will probably never work well on the Hollywood screen. There are several reasons for this, all of which would require more space to properly examine than is available here. Suffice it to say that, despite its crucial role in the history of America, the Revolutionary War is simply too quaint to sell major tickets; best to leave it to PBS, maybe. Pigtailed men running around in knee breeches, marching in rigorous order and firing flintlock rifles that require minutes to load between shots doesn't exactly put us on the edge of our seats. But neither does the scowling, bellowing Mel Gibson, even as he hacks his way through a platoon of Redcoats like Toshiro Mifune with a tomahawk, avenging the rather brutal and unnecessary death (in terms of the story) of his youngest son at the hands of the British. The Patriot will, and probably should, irritate anyone with a reasonable knowledge of history, the references to which, in this film, skip off reality like a flat stone across water. The War of Independence really does deserve better. It was far, far more interesting than its pro-forma representation here.So, is there nothing good to say? Well, damn near. However, The Patriot did render a superb villain in Jason Isaacs' Colonel William Tavington and it is around this somewhat trumped up spirit of darkness that the film really orbits. The Tavington character radiates the same cold light that emanated from what is possibly one of the very greatest portraits of nastiness ever brought to the screen: Jack Palance's gunfighter Jack Wilson in Shane. The fact that Tavington was forced by the powers to act more like an equestrian Reinhard Heydrich than an English gentleman of the era betrays the film's lack of confidence in its own historical foundation. The Brits pulled some funky stuff during the Revolution. Armed conflict tends to bring such things out in us. But atrocities as heinous as were ascribed to the British in The Patriot never occurred. Director Roland Emmerich is German. Perhaps he has residual issues over the outcome of World War Two. The historical person on which the Tavington character was obviously based, Colonel Banastre Tarleton, actually did command British forces in the Carolinas during the War of Independence, and was certainly interesting enough to warrant a film of his own. Tarleton was not the near-satanic presence that Tavington embodies, in fact quite the opposite. It's safe to say that if the boyish Tarleton, and not Jeb Stuart, had been commanding Lee's cavalry at Gettysburg, he would not have been dashing about stealing wagons instead of shadowing the Union army. The outcome of the battle, not to mention history, might well have been different. Still, the Tavington character is the one element in the film that really resonates. Maybe The Patriot should be re-released under the title, Bad Dragoon. Rene Auberjonois, whose alienated, unflinching Constable Odo was probably the best thing about the otherwise moribund Babylon Five rip, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and who played the courageous reverend in The Patriot, also played the young George Washington in a 1974 episode of PBS' N.E.T. Playhouse, 'Portrait of the Hero as a Young Man' depicting Washington's participation in the opening actions of the French and Indian War, when he commanded colonial militia under the British. For those wondering why Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin refused to answer his son's (Heath Ledger) repeated question: `What happened at Fort Wilderness?', I may have an answer. There was, of course, no such historical place. If the definitive authority on such matters, the eminent 19th century historian Francis Parkman fails to reference it, then, it was never there. However, there is a Disney resort of that name in Orlando. Mel was probably embarrassed to admit that he overpaid for his cabin.",Null,6,13,24 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," It has come to this...
","Even today, as a writer, having been through J.R.R. Tolkien's Ring Trilogy twice, once for the journey and the second time somewhat more analytically, I can barely comprehend how Tolkien did it; how he managed to fashion a world of such minute detail, and with scope that was at once physical, temporal and emotional. Is the Trilogy literature? Maybe not by strict definition; its concern is not so much with ideas as with pure language, English specifically, and what can be done with this amazing tool. The tale itself seems, at times, to exist only as a hanger for Tolkien's aesthetic experiments with the evocative aspect of language, how words sound, and how that quality can be made to resonate in the mind of the tuned-in reader: Galadriel, Celeborn, Umbar, Forlindon, Dimrill Dale, Withywindle, Rivendell, Mordor; words that often sound more like wind chimes or gonging bells than words, all strung together with equally melodious text.When I learned that Tolkien was coming seriously to the big screen, I was stoked, although memories of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's similarly monumental novel, Dune, had me a bit worried. One feature-length film, despite the great beauty of many of its elements, had not been enough to properly set up and display Dune's particular richness of detail and the movie tended to stumble about trying to hit a sufficient number of the book's high spots (though I still love the sequence in which House Atreides departs Caladan for Arrakis; the stately embarkation into the Guild Heighliners). It was a film that could only really work for those who had read and loved the novel. But Tolkien was to be served up in three (count 'em!) parts. Having seen the first two of the three, I have not been disappointed.When the first installment bypassed Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, the choices Peter Jackson had been forced to make were obvious. I'm sure they weren't always easy ones. Many of the Trilogy's more subtle elements had to be bypassed. For example, the book's spooky view of the Black Rider on the Buckleberry Ferry stage, seen by lantern light from across the river as the Hobbits flee the Shire - a favorite interlude of mine - was really more effective and evocative than the film's narrow escape of screeching hooves. But the gorgeous pursuit of Arwen and Frodo from Weathertop by the Ringwraiths, with its breathtaking overhead cut to the full-gallop chase, put everything back in balance. The Fellowship of The Rings was so good that it may not have been necessary to have read the Trilogy first. But in the case of The Two Towers, reading first is highly recommended. This done, the second film which must, to some degree, only imply its particular book, will play all the more richly.In the Two Towers, both in print and on screen, the story's U-shaped arc reaches its low-point before starting its climb to the end. It is the Trilogy's most challenging phase, for both reader and viewer. There was no way that the contemporary narrative cinema, with its rather rigid constraints, could have rendered it faithfully. Peter Jackson, a director of great skill and intelligence, obviously knew this as well. He taketh away but he also giveth back: eye-candy scenery, an FX for the ages in Gollum (underpinned by actor Andy Serkis' excellent performance; he blue-suited the part in real time to optimize the digital Gollum's relationships with the living actors), great Ents, and action that makes the clashes in Braveheart seem like square dances. The battle at Helm's Deep is riveting. Staged in the rain, like Kurosawa's climatic battle in the Seven Samurai, you can almost forget to breathe as the sequence unfolds.To bring a written work like the Ring Trilogy to the screen; one with which readers had already formed deep connections, took guts, not to mention great movie-making skill. Because Tolkien's characters are so vividly drawn, great sensitivity and precision in casting was also required. In that light, all main characters are spot-on, often exactly as I envisioned them in the books. Frodo is just a bit too pretty, yet still authentically portrayed by Elijah Woods, who fans out the full deck of Frodo's emotions, from grit through fright, with great clarity. But with Frodo accompanied by Sean Astin's letter-perfect Sam Gamgee, all remains well. The memory of Ian Holm's equally-perfect Bilbo makes it even better. Karl Urban's coiled, wild-eyed Julius Caesar was my favorite recurring character in the Xena: Warrior Princess TV series and I enjoyed seeing him in the Two Towers as the equally-coiled Eomer. Cate Blanchett was probably born to play Galadriel but the real, possibly unexpected, thermonuclear casting-event was Craig Parker's elf-captain Haldir. A little make up and some blonde tresses morphed the pleasant-looking Parker into a presence of  mythic nobility, as opposed to Orlando Bloom's more intense, wolf-like Legolas. Much of the innate beauty that infuses the entire Trilogy is compressed into Parker's character and I'm not alone here. Haldir websites are sprouting like mushrooms in Fangorn Forest as we speak.It's hard to say anything bad about a production into which so much intelligence, sensitivity, courage, and labor has been poured. What would be the point? There's plenty of cotton candy out there to pull apart. Any film should be judged first in terms of its respective genre. Very few films are truly great across the entire spectrum. At this point, Lord of The Rings is a magnificent achievement, magically pulling together so much of what the cinema can be at this stage in its evolution. The Two Towers is a discrete film but also a necessary and difficult chapter of a larger work. Not all films will be Tolkienesque fantasies. But when such films are made, Lord of The Rings will be the absolute benchmark.",Null,0,0,19 February 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," It's (sort of) different for girls.
","ATTENTION: All women shall wear a Versace gown and sling-back pumps when using the toilet.Ok Let's move on.While watching Eyes Wide Shut, I found myself repeatedly asking what I would have thought of this film had it not been Mr. Kubrick's work, and I think I might have liked it more than I did. Would he have made this film if he had known that it would be his last? With the master's name not in the credits, Eyes Wide Shut might have been an interesting art house effort, perhaps by a young director with a definite eye, and a future. Quite possibly, Nicole and Tom would still have been in the cast, perhaps working for scale and some points, for the fun of being in such a production, as both actors possess discernible integrity. But Eyes Wide Shut was a Kubrick, and I came away with a clear sense that this great artist of the cinema had possibly been running on fumes while directing it. Despite the seductive beauty of many of its set pieces, the film overall seemed to be walking under water. But Kubrick out of breath is still Kubrick and he still managed to give us an often fascinating piece of work, one that dripped the dark juices of life that he may have sensed were, for him, finally drying up.Although the aforementioned integrity is a good thing in any artist, that quality alone may not always be enough. An actor must still be right for the role and when Tom Cruise is wrong, no one is wrong quite like him. But this seldom, if ever, has anything to do with his skill as an actor. Like Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, or Clint Eastwood, Tom Cruise is a Movie Star and movie stars have indelible personalities that percolate up through every role. In Mr. Cruise's case, it's the shrewd, early post-adolescent we first encountered in Risky Business. Regardless of how sophisticated his subsequent characters have been, this personality has always been there and is something that Mr. Cruise will simply have to outgrow. As he seems to be aging gracefully, it may take a while.While brilliant in Born on the Fourth of July, Rain Man, and Jerry McGuire, where his core adolescence was perfect, in Eyes Wide Shut, he's a college boy playing doctor in a tent-like white coat. In the first Mission Impossible, when Cruise's whizbang Ethan Hunt told Ving Rhames' Luther that `We're GOING to do it', referring to the planned burglary at CIA Langley, he simply came off like a frat boy planning to heist the Phi Delt bell. In that film, as in Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise never really acted badly. He was just wrong for the roles. In Eyes, during the orgy scene, when the spectacular courtesan under black feathers asks Dr. Bill (Cruise) what he thinks he is doing, the veracity of the question resonates on several levels. Nicole Kidman, a humanoid blend of fox and white-tailed deer, was almost equally unconvincing as his wife. I tried, but could not buy into this glittering and now-sundered couple. Lesser-known actors of the same age would have brought more authenticity, but both roles really called out for more mature actors with more cerebral styles. The Cruise-Kidman duet were never able to gain sufficient distance from their real selves because their character-set, a young fairy-tale couple, was too much like we perceive them in real life. The real Tom Cruise would never be seen ricocheting off a homophobic boy on a late-night city sidewalk, yet there he was, despite the Dr. Bill disguise. Given this, no matter how hard the pair tried, or over-acted, I could never escape the feeling that both were often faxing it in. Thomas Gibson, the briefly-visible, young college professor, would actually have made a more believable Dr. Bill. Eyes Wide Shut is a dark film and the sparkly Mr. And Mrs. Cruise simply shed too much of the wrong sort of light on it.But not all of this film's casting choices were mistakes. The supporting cast took very good care of business, some of whom seemed to be poking their heads into the film from a parallel universe, even if given just a few lines, like Carmela Marner's smart waitress. Sidney Pollack was a great save when Harvey Keitel, due to scheduling conflicts, was unable to finish out as Victor Ziegler. Todd Field's Nick Nightingale worked beautifully. But the real coup d'etat was Vinessa Shaw's hooker, and walking billboard for the legalization of prostitution, Domino, who stepped out of the film's urbane murk and owned everything. Her scene is my absolute favorite. You don't want to merely bang a lady of such sweet and intelligent self-possession. You want to get her off the street, buy her a drink, and just watch her talk. She has everyone's number. Resistance is futile.We will probably never know what Kubrick (David Lean's evil twin) really wanted to accomplish with Eyes Wide Shut (the title was probably borrowed from dialog in the superlative BBC production of John LeCarre's Smiley's People: Connie Sachs to Smiley during their great scene; Kubrick certainly would have seen it); We do know that it was messed with (Gee, isn't that surprising). Director's Cut, please, asap. I'm just sorry he's gone. We won't get to see him bounce back and pull off something brilliant ever again. What must it have been like to be him and be so burdened by the relentless expectations of so many after the monumental 2001: A Space Odyssey? I think he handled it. If you doubt him, or me, just watch his The Shining then follow it up with the not-bad TV version. There you will have the explicit and implicit difference between art and artifice.",Null,0,0,9 March 2003
