Ford v Ferrari," Wonderful, moving portrayal of a true story
","I'll be honest, I'm rarely emotional watching movies. Somehow this proved to be an excellent, worthwhile exception. You can almost smell the gasoline and burning tire in the race sequences. Matt Damon and Bale outdo themselves bringing the characters to life. The cinematography is marvellous, and low cameras, zoomed in faces and out of focus long shots bring depth and perspective to scenes.A visual tour de force well worth enjoying.",9,1,1,17 April 2020
