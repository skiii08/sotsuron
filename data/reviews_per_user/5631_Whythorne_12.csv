Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unwatchable garbage
","As a big fan of comedic satire, I was looking forward to seeing this film, especially after some of the rave reviews I had heard or read.Instead, I discovered that - evidently - what passes for 'satire' in this film is nothing more than a non-stop barrage of crude vulgarity and raunchy, unclever sexual shtick that can only amuse if you are hopelessly adolescent.Don't get me wrong. I've gotten a big kick out of films like 'Kingpin,' 'There's Something About Mary,' etc. The difference between those films and Borat is that those films maximized the use of outrageous situations and assumed its audience at least had a certain level of sophistication or intelligence. On the other hand, Borat tries to appeal to a much lower level kind of funny-bone tickling, in the same way children try to make each other giggle by repeating 'outrageous' words they just learned like 'caca' over and over again to each other.Borat being a fish out of water is funny by itself only so long, and you would think that after a short while, what is suppose to pass for outrageous sexual comments and potty humor would just get tiresome when there is no clever point behind any of it.And for those who try to convince you that the Borat character (who has sex with his mother- in-law and takes dumps off busy sidewalks) has some kind of innocent or naive charm, don't buy it. Borat is not in the same universe as say, a 'Chauncey Gardener' from the film 'Being There.'Depressingly bad.",1,6,12,10 July 2007
Elf," Funny, enjoyable and...if only!
","One of the best of the more recently-made Christmas movies, 'Elf,' for the most part, impressed me as a throwback to wholesome, quality holiday movies of the past. I say 'most part' because the last fifth of the film suddenly switches gears and turns from being about Elf and his relationship with his dad into the sappy and clich√©d 'do you believe in Santa Claus' routine reminiscent of 'the Polar Express.' Up until that point, though, the film is consistently funny and enjoyable with Will Ferrel playing the title character to innocent and charming perfection. There are lots of funny scenes and bits, following each other one after another. Most of the cast is excellent, especially with James Caan's straightforward, deadpan portrayal as Elf's dad. (The lone exception is Santa played by Ed Asner, who comes off as a grumpy, unappealing curmudgeon.)But-drat! If not for that ending, this is the kind of movie I otherwise would love to have as part of my Christmas DVD collection.",7,1,2,10 January 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," Misdirected comedy
","Unfortunately, a lot of people will watch this movie expecting to see a dramatic, action-spy flick. Instead, what they will get is a comedy about a director trying to make a name for himself who thinks his in-your-face film style is the most important aspect of any film he directs. So he puts his epileptic cameramen on bungee cords while the camera rolls, and what he ends up with is a herky-jerky mess whose style is so distracting and dominating that no one pays any attention to the plot, acting, script, etc. Then one day movie audiences wake up and find out his style is no more cutting edge than a 90s TV melodrama. And that's how the story ends for the wannabe director.Hope that helps.",1,0,3,16 December 2009
The Caine Mutiny," Excellent plot and script crippled by awful soundtrack
","'The Caine Mutiny' is an excellent example of one of those movies that has a lot going for it but is hindered by a few unsuccessful elements.In this case, the biggest culprit is one of the most annoying soundtracks ever composed. The music gives this film a cheap and dated quality. It is brassy, much, MUCH too loud, and occupies far too much time in the film. Further, it continually uses the same obnoxious theme melody throughout, with some excerpts of familiar military themes (marine's hymn, reveille, etc.) thrown in from time to time...all done in an overblown manner. It is an incredible distraction to a film that otherwise would be quite excellent. And because of its invasive, irritating nature, it is impossible to ignore it.The acting is quite good for the most part with a couple of exceptions, most notably the part of Ensign Keith played by Francis. Francis is one of those typical young actors in the mold of a Tab Hunter that seemed to be much sought-after during the fifties. Unfortunately, he was a very poor actor. If this was a minor role, it would not be such a problem. But the Keith character is a central one. In addition to his role aboard the ship, he is utilized for a subplot involving a romantic conflict between his girlfriend and cloying mother. Actually, the film's story would have benefited by the exclusion of this subplot altogether.But the soundtrack is the biggest drawback. It is unfortunate, because the story of a ship's officers growing increasingly disgruntled with their Captain Queeg, their eventual taking control of the ship, and the subsequent court martial trial is actually quite riveting and otherwise worth seeing. It's sort of like watching your favorite team playing in the championship game, while a fan behind you is blowing an airhorn in your ear.",6,2,4,6 January 2008
Before Sunset," A modern romance story
","Yes, a modern romance, and I don't mean that in the best sense. If you like a movie that elevates romance to a higher level, you may want to skip this.Enough has been said by other reviewers about the non-stop dialog, but it was other things that troubled me far more.For a romance story to work, it is essential that you have likable characters that you want to end up together. Depending on where you are coming from philosophically, you may love the Jesse and Celine characters or they may drive you crazy. In my case, it was the latter, as Jesse is like a rudderless smart ass who smugly thinks he is so profound, but Celine is far worse as an annoying, stereotypical liberal flake.The main problem is that the script takes romance and reduces it to a cheap, matter-of-fact mundaneness, especially with the amount of casual droppings of f-bombs to describe the act of love. Maybe it's just me, but I find nothing cute nor attractive about couples in a genre like this talking with a blase vulgarity to one another. Talk about destroying the mystique of romance and reducing it down to things that cats do to each other in the alley.In the prequel, 'Before Sunrise,' there was far less of this, and the characters had a little bit more charm and innocence. But now it's 9 years later: Jesse foolishly married someone he can't stand, and Celine comes off as extremely hard and cynical. If that vulgarity isn't enough to turn you off, there's plenty of politics and anti-Americanism to help you along.It not only undermines the 'magic' that supposedly occurred between them in the first film but will serve to cause a lot of viewers to not give a rip whether they end up together or not...which, of course, is the big question that the whole movie drags its way to answering.Lacking charm, sweetness, innocence, and boiled down to gritty 'naturalism' this film probably appeals to some for those very reasons, but if Jane Austen is your brand of romance, beware...'Pride and Prejudice' this surely ain't!",3,3,10,10 March 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," My vote for most overrated film ever made
","If they ever give out an award for the most overrated film ever made, this would obviously not win it, but in my opinion it should. And 'Gone With the Wind' should place.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy movies that take their time in developing a story, character, mood, etc. I admire intelligent subtlety in a film. But this was like watching paint dry. Or trying to detect the motion of the hour hand on a clock. Which you may find yourself doing several times during this film.I have watched this whole movie once, and tried re-watching it several times to see if I could 'get' what all the accolades are about. I always end up discovering that my first impression was correct. This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. At least 'Gone With the Wind' isn't that.The film begins with Peter O'Toole's character getting killed in a motorcycle accident. I think the film makers chose to begin the movie this way so that they get the only interesting thing that happens in the film out of the way and over with. Then David Lean and company could really settle into and sink their teeth into the tedum of the rest of the film.Anyway, all I can say is that this film deserves to be likened to the parade of the Emperor in the well known fable. Except the emperor isn't only buck naked, he's moving at a snail's pace.",1,38,94,6 November 2007
Where Eagles Dare," I hate it
","I absolutely hate this movie. It fits that the same director did 'Kelly's Heroes,' since both films are equally shallow, lame, and unintelligent. The big difference is that 'Kelly's' doesn't try to take itself so seriously.Richard Burton is just outright obnoxious with his I'm-so-in-control routine which grates from the beginning of the film to the very end. Clint Eastwood is almost equally irritating as the silent heavy. It doesn't help that he looks and acts exactly the same as he did in most every other film he made at this time. The story is unbelievable and predictable bad. Everything goes right for the good guys and nothing goes right for the bad guys. You've seen it all before: the bad guys send hails of bullets at the good guys and miss, but one blind salvo from a good guy and he hits his mark.Or how about the scene where the good guys are making their getaway and destroy every single plane on a German airfield with a snow plow bus. Heck, with that kind of devastation, forget the A-Bomb. The Allies should have just concentrated on driving buses all over enemy territory. What is also laughable is the fact that Burton and his crew have to go through a complicated series of meticulous steps to get their mission to completion, and of course they go through each step like clockwork. It is as if they had the luxury of practicing the mission on location for months ahead of time, and the Nazis were gracious enough to allow them to become familiar with every square inch of the castle they are infiltrating.Scenes that are suppose to be tense end up being laughable in their lack of special effect realism. For example, the scene where Burton is fighting a couple of Nazis atop a cable car would be hard enough to believe anyway, but the dated, obvious use of a studio film backdrop induces more eyerolling than it suspends disbelief.Plot 'twists' are so manipulated they appear to have been tacked on just for the sake of adding twists, and the most ridiculous is saved for the final scene. With everything Burton and crew had to go through, somehow they knew they would end up on a plane at the end with a traitor who would be pointing a generic automatic weapon at them, so, long before they even started the mission they filed the hammer off the gun!Forget the painful absurdity of how they could be assured that that would be the weapon the traitor would use. By this point of the film, there has been such an accumulation of plot 'twists' and lack of realism, Burton and Eastwood could have revealed they were really Martians visiting Earth to save mankind and I would not have been the least surprised to see them turn green and fly away. At any rate, I have no idea how this can be considered a ten by some here.I'm proud to be the first IMDBer to give it a One. Did I mention I hate this movie?",1,34,71,27 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Kids' film is terrifying in its own way
","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is the sort of profound cinematic achievement that prompts the following, agonizing question:Will this series NEVER end?Devotees of the Harry Potter books seem to get a big kick out of these movies, but I am not sure how anybody else can. It is hard to tell one movie from another, as the series is just a prolonged - and extremely tiresome - display of special effects and three boring characters' attempts to look awed at various magical/fantasy events as if they are just encountering the world of magic for the very first time.And that is in spite of the fact that after four years at Hogwarts School of Magic, where one can't even spend time in a bathroom without being pestered by supernatural phenomenon, they must have seen it all by now.What doesn't help this series is that Harry Potter has to be the most trite fictional character to come along since the Hardy Boys.The script leaves no room for a buildup of suspense and action as the plots of these movies are always jam-packed with the same stock elements: <ul><li>a constant parade of uninspired magical effects, made even less interesting by their over-saturation, </li></ul><ul><li>characters you could care less about being introduced by the boat-load (literally), </li></ul><ul><li>Harry's tedious run-ins with student rival Malfoy, </li></ul><ul><li>magic contests and tournaments that in spite of always being life-threatening (if I was one of the kids' parents, it would be a good case for home- schooling) are nevertheless yawn -inducing</li></ul><ul><li>plot 'twists' that have all the unpredictability and impact of a dripping faucet,</li></ul><ul><li>and the evil bad guy that just won't go down, a la Jason or Freddie Krueger (I can't remember the nemesis' name...it's something of a cross between 'Walmart' and 'tort reform').</li></ul>And what a shock it is when Harry emerges victorious! Does anyone watching these movies ever feel like Harry is really in trouble? I mean really? It's like wondering if Austin Powers is going to escape Dr. Evil. (Actually, I take that back...the Austin Powers flicks have much more tension.)New characters are always being introduced as the series progresses, forcing the series' accumulation of cast members into requisite cameo roles that keep getting shorter and shorter. Not that it matters. Even the three main children characters who get plenty of play time have personalities as exciting as damp dish rags and characterizations that are onion-paper thin.One truly entertaining aspect of the film is the fact that the ages of the three main 'children' actors is outpacing the ages of their characters as the series trudges on. As old-looking later teens they hardly look like the cute fourteen year-olds they are suppose to be. And Potter and Weasely, with their ever-lengthening scraggly hairstyles, are beginning to look more like hippies that would appear just as comfortable with a marijuana joint in their hands as a magic wand.For kids only. I give this three stars only in deference to my children. Somehow, the film does manage to keep their attention, which is what terrifies me the most about these HP movies (Sorry, guys...love ya!)",3,3,5,15 April 2006
Stalag 17," Excellent drama that tries too hard to be a comedy
","This is a difficult film to rate because there are equal parts that deserve a ten and those that deserve a one. That's why I rate this a five.The plot elements that focus on the drama and intrigue of an informer in the midst of allied prisoners in a German WWII prison camp are excellent. If the film had focused only on that, along with the addition of the acting and screen presence of William Holden, this would have been a wonderful film. Unfortunately, it is hindered by an overabundance of stupid shenanigans by a few characters who are supposed to be the standard comic relief. I think the intention was to depict these figures as lovable goofballs who are doing what they can to cope with prison life. That intention fails completely, since they never give any indication that life in the POW camp is anything but a time for frivolity and pranks, as if they are just grade school brats away at summer camp.Evidently, the idea was to have a film that was half-comedy and half-drama, but the comedic portions come off as annoying, time-consuming filler until the film can resume the interesting drama - and real story - involving Holden as the self-centered and unpopular fellow prisoner who is singled out as the traitor in the barracks.Actually, the dry, cynical humor from Holden and some others would have provided just the right balance of comic relief. Unfortunately, the scenes in which the Shapiro and 'Animal' characters all-too often dominate are virtually unbearable. Their inane antics are pathetically unfunny. The presence of the 'Animal' in particular is made even more repulsive by the over-the-top attempt to appear grungy-charming while only coming off as a constant, grotesque and distracting irritant to what you really want to see.It really is a shame. You can also take away the guy with the nasally voice who reads announcements. Toss him out with Shapiro, and the 'Animal' and actually you might have a very enjoyable film.",5,21,30,21 February 2008
Beowulf," Woeful Beowulf creepy for wrong reasons
","While one can be impressed with all the gee-whiz technology that went into the making of 'Beowulf,' in the end it gave me the creeps for the wrong reasons.The video game, talking avatar feel of the CG was disturbing in the sense that it made me think of cheesy wax museum figures or department store mannequins coming to life after hours.Another unintended creepiness of the film stemmed from the fact that evidently Zemeckis and company felt that people would be titillated by the gratuitous use of video game-flavored sexual references. Maybe hormone-raging adolescents who enjoy AO-rated Playstation games get a kick out of that sort of thing, but an adult would have to really be in a bad way if digitized breasts and buns turn him or her on.The fact that animated CG is such a planned, thought out, painstaking, technical process further gives the nudity and sexual overtones a rather deliberate, pornographic air that is repulsive.A bad decision from the start, one has to ask, why go the CG route? If the goal is realism, then why not a film with real actors and settings? Instead, one is left with the impression that this was intended to be an exercise in showing off and boasting, 'Hey! Look what we can do now!' Or, in other words, they make a film likes this simply because nowadays they can. And yet, in spite of all the technical sweat and tears, the human characters still end up looking unnatural and unconvincing.In addition, the Grendel character, who looks like a cross between Gollum and the mummy from the Brendan Fraser movies, tears bodies in half and bites off heads, but the video game gore splattered everywhere is also unnatural and not convincing enough to elicit any kind of shock or horror.I also had the impression that the CG technology process overruled the subtle and sensitive nuances that make great films, and watching the special features portion of the DVD confirmed that impression. The actors, out of costume on their virtual, sterile stages, and therefore out of their natural element, appeared to be going through the motions while the director seemed satisfied that one take was good enough, since anything that might be lacking could be added in later by computer artists and technicians.With regard to the script, I am not troubled by the fact that it took liberties with the original myth. What does trouble me is that once again we have an example of a story in which we are suppose to identify with characters simply because they exist, without any substantial character development being breathed into them.Hence, we are to root for Beowulf not for any number of admirable character qualities, but only because the script says he IS the hero of the tale. Or perhaps because he is relatively less repulsive than other characters in the story.A sad waste of expertise, money, technology...this kind of CG may work for 'Shrek' or something like 'The Polar Express' that are intended to be pure, unrealistic fantasy, but it is still not yet ready for subject matter that is intended to be taken seriously. And 'Beowulf' makes me wonder if it ever will be.",1,3,8,27 March 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Inferior 'Supremacy'
","Sequel is far inferior to the first, 'The Bourne Identity', which although bore only a little resemblance to the book by Ludlum, was an excellent, legitimately gripping thriller.The film fails mainly not because of the story but because of Greengrass's frenetic, incompetent direction.Everything that takes place is subordinate to the style of the film, which, for me, continually distracted from plot, action, and dialog. I am referring to the shaky hand-held camera, which by this time is about as cutting-edge as a 1980s Docker's commercial. That, along with spastic editing, are the main culprits. I wish directors would realize that nowadays, a movie shot with the hand-held just gives it (in most cases) a cheesy TV drama feel. Obviously, the intent is to make dialog scenes more interesting and action scenes seem 'confusingly' real.The shaky camera is unrelenting and without respite, even being used during non-action scenes so much that it becomes something worse than a self-conscious, pretentious gimmick...it just becomes an endless irritation.Director Greengrass doesn't seem to get it...the blurry scenes and split-second herky-jerky glimpses we are given are so confusing, and impart such little visual information to the viewer, that it is impossible to tell what is going on and therefore, impossible to get drawn into a scene's tension. So instead of making a scene more exciting, the annoying technique makes it far less so.A perfect example is the fight scene between Bourne and an assassin, which can be compared to Jason's battle in his Paris apartment in the original. In the original movie, that fight scene was tense and exciting. In the sequel, it was like trying to watch two men fighting while lit by a strobe light, from the vantage point of a whizzing, out-of-control merry-go-round.Ditto for the car chase scenes, which may as well have been viewed from the trunk of Jason's car for all we could tell was happening.SPOILER HERE Another big disappointment was the killing off of Franka Potente's character early in the film. She's a fun actress to watch and was a huge part of the first Bourne movie. Further, it has become an all too familiar gimmick in films like this, where the filmmakers are concerned about the hero getting tied up with one woman, in spite of the fact that somehow Ludlum was able to make it work with his books.Disappointing all the way around, even to the redundant and unoriginal use of the same song by Moby for the closing credits that was used in the first film. What, they couldn't find a different Moby song to use?",2,9,18,2 February 2006
V for Vendetta," Contradictory propaganda
","Okay, so it's pretty obvious by now that we have to accept that any movie with a political theme is going to always feature right-wing ideals as evil and left wing ideals as saintly.What is rather hard to understand, is why antiwar 'peaceniks' would rally around a film that advocates violence, murder and terrorism as a solution to a problem. What's most disturbing is that a film like this - with its validation of terrorism - would not only be acceptable to anyone, but would even receive high marks from IMDb reviewers in the post 9/11/2001 world.All I can say is, when you have a film in which terrorists are being portrayed as saintly martyrs, you have provided real-life enemies with quite an inspiring bit of propaganda.The only reason this film deserves a 1 as opposed to a zero (even though I realize that 0 is not even an option here) is that it does serve a useful purpose. It serves as yet another glaring example of the contradictory irrationalism of those with particular political agendas.",1,5,15,1 July 2007
