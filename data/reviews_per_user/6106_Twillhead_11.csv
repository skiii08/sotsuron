Minority Report," Potentially Great Film Falls Flat
","By the end of 'Minority Report,' I felt cheated that a wonderful premise, fraught with social and political ambiguity, and the makings of a potentially great film, so completely, tragically missed its mark. It is difficult for me to believe that this is the film Spielberg wanted to make. It is visually interesting, if self-consciously so, but there is little substance behind the high-tech crap. And moments of 'levity'--inserted, I suppose, to occasionally lighten up the tone of the film--is sophomorically, embarrassingly silly (small SPOILER: like Tom Cruise chasing after his runaway eyeballs). The only aspect that was, for me, mildly engaging was the plight of the 'precogs,' especially Agatha, movingly portrayed by Samantha Morton. The only other performance of note is by the wonderful Tim Blake Nelson (of 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' fame), who certainly knows how to make the most of a small role. The rest, even the great Max von Sydow, cannot rise above the clumsy script and even clumsier direction (sorry, Steven). Dashing Tom Cruise slaps on a face of grim determination and tries to pass it off as acting. Colin Farrell, equally dashing and determined, pulls off a Javert-like performance that is solid, if not illuminating. (One more possible small SPOILER) The happily-ever-after ending was especially annoying to me, and persuaded me from a passive 'oh-well-you-can't-win-'em-all-Steven' attitude to an active dislike for this unbelievably sloppy film. ** out of *****.",5,2,3,23 February 2003
Memento," The Blessings of Continuity . . .
","... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of `Memento', a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film--who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The 'rub' is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: `We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are', says Leonard at the end of the film--but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: `I can't remember to forget you.' `Memento' is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory.  NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end.",8,0,1,9 September 2001
The Others," Intelligently Gothic
","Those who see 'The Others' with the intent to be scared witless by figures leaping suddenly out of dark corners or by axe-wielding maniacs are in for a big disappointment. This film is much smarter than that. It is quietly moody--the anxiety level is almost subliminal, and for that reason all the more compelling. Nicole Kidman, looking eeriely like a reincarnated Grace Kelly, carries the film as the increasingly distraught mother of two precocious but mysteriously odd children, flanked by three kindly but equally unusual servants. The film opens with Kidman awakening early one morning with a blood-curdling scream--a primal scream that seems just barely sustained at the base of her throat for the rest of the film. She is at once icy and nurturing, in a bravura yet understated performance that I can only compare to (and I am honestly sorry to do this) Bruce Willis in 'The Sixth Sense'. Kidman proves, if nothing else, that she is an accomplished actor who is in complete control of her craft. The children are also excellent--the film wouldn't work if they were not. Nevermind if you guess the outcome of the film in advance, as did I--the ending is still fully satisfying and chillingly thought-provoking. Beautifully photographed.",8,0,0,19 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," You'll Either Love It or You'll Hate It ...
","... because I cannot imagine feeling neutral about this film. I happened to love it, although I admit that it took me fifteen to twenty minutes to adjust to its frenetic pacing, its farcical tone, and its fanciful melodramatic presentation. 'Moulin Rouge!' is a film to contend with; its images are sometimes spectacularly beautiful, at other times dark and nightmarish. It looks like one or all of the following could have directed it: Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Orson Welles, and Bob Fosse. Set in 1899 in the Montemarte section of Paris, during the rise of the bohemian movement and awash with colorful characters, savory and unsavory, 'Moulin Rouge!' is the retelling of the famous 'Camille' story (a.k.a. 'La Boheme', a.k.a. 'Rent'). At the heart of the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub is the fabulous Satine, a courtesan of unbelievable beauty and renown, performed with lusty opulence by Nicole Kidman. Satine is being pursued by two men--a rich and worldly Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, who all but twirls his moustache around his finger as evil epitomized; and by Christian, a naÃ¯ve and penniless writer, played in a winning performance by Ewan McGregor, who instantly gains the audience's empathy with his large and expressive, aquatic eyes. Satine needs the financial backing that the Duke can provide to assist her in becoming a real actress, but falls in love with Christian, who captures her heart with his simplicity and his idealized concept of love. Early on the audience learns that Satine is consumptive, thus setting the stage for light farce transfiguring itself into rich tragedy. The costumes are wildly extravagant and gorgeous; the sets sensual and voluptuous--fantastical buildings and exquisite skylines that, at first glance, look as if they were conceived by a psychopathic drag queen on a hit of acid. But the backdrops are in themselves necessary characters to this eye filling production. The songs--most of which will be familiar to the MTV generation--are magnificently arranged and are given new meaning by their context in the movie; you will never hear them quite the same way again. McGregor's surprising vocal talent--at times a soft and delicate delivery, at other times surging and strong--gives new life to Elton John's 'This Is Your Song'. It is a scene as joyful and uplifting as watching Gene Kelly singing and dancing in street puddles in 'Singing in the Rain'. Kidman's voice is a bit thin and breathy, but she more than compensates for it with her astonishing abilities as an actor, and is delightful in the clever combination of 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' and 'A Material Girl'. A Carmenesque, flamenco-stylized version of The Police's 'Roxanne' is dangerous and spine tingling. Perhaps the most outrageous treatment of our recent pop past is of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'; it is reminiscent of the title scene from 'Hello Dolly!', hilariously overblown, complete with dancing and singing waiters. Like I said, this film isn't for everyone. Many will be put off by the apparent overacting of the cast, misunderstanding the intentional quality of melodrama that is inherent in the concept of the overall piece, and by its lavish cacophony which gives the film its carnival-like feel. It is, in the end, a beautifully realized, intentionally bohemian enactment of an oft-told bohemian tale--at its core is the movement's motto: 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love.' Who could ask for anything more?  A triumph.",9,1,2,3 March 2002
Titanic," Ultra-Hollywood Spin on one of the 20th Century's Most Famous Disasters
","Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of 'Titanic', mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. 'Titanic' is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too 'slick' for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In 'Titanic' he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",8,4,5,10 June 1999
A Beautiful Mind," Searing and Splendid
","A Beautiful Mind' is not, in the end, the greatest film ever made, not by a long shot--but it has two incredible assets: director Ron Howard, and, most especially, actor Russell Crowe. Experiencing first hand the exquisite horror of schizophrenia is Mr. Howard's contribution to his audience; embodying its terror, hand-in-hand with the subject's absolute genius, is Mr. Crowe's. The supporting cast is excellent in their own rights, especially Jennifer Connelly as Nash's uniquely supportive wife, and Paul Bettany as Charles, Nash's roommate and friend from his days at Princeton. To comment further on the actual particulars of the film would risk spoiling the action for those who have not yet seen it, so on that point I cease and desist. It is Hollywood's latest `bad boy' upon whom I now focus attention. The role of John Nash is Crowe's apotheosis as an actor: it is a mesmerizing performance, rich with physicality and expertly executed--in Crowe's hands, Nash is awkward and arrogant and tormented, rendered so both by his illness and by his brilliance. And yet he becomes the unlikely hero for whom we cheer. Make no mistake about it--this is Russell Crowe's triumph, a glowing recorded accomplishment that unfortunately might be the yardstick from which he is measured in the future. I say unfortunately' only because it seems a monumental hurdle to overcome--it is The Role of a Lifetime, for which Mr. Crowe, as evinced in previous films, was most assuredly up to the task.",Null,0,1,28 February 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," A Perfect Gem of a Film
","Having just seen this wonderful movie, the question I ask myself is this: why in the world did I wait so long?? Based on a memorable short story by Stephen King, 'Shawshank' is a quietly brilliant parable about hope and perseverance and, yes--as stated in the title--'redemption.' Tim Robbins gives a beautifully understated performance as Andy Dufresne, a well-to-do banker sentenced to two double life terms in prison for a murder he did not commit. At first quiet and introspective, Andy slowly emerges as silently headstrong, resourceful, and filled with a sense of humanity that transforms not only himself, but his fellow inmates as well. Most effected by Andy's presence is his prison friend and ally, 'Red' Redding (played with a superb weathered dignity by Morgan Freeman), who acts not only as the narrator and Greek chorus in the film, but also as the collective conscience of the inmates themselves. Although the 'Mean Warden' might seem a stock character in prison films, Bob Gunton gives the role a new benchmark, oozing evil with every tight-lipped glare and succinctly uttered syllable. Having read the story by King several years ago, I knew the outcome, but, watching the movie, it was no less wonderful and gratifying when it arrived. The 'double ending' of this film--that is to say, what becomes of Andy and Red in turn--leaves the audience trembling with satisfaction and pleasure: redemption only comes with honesty; hope is eternal; and music (be it Mozart or Hank Williams) is magic. For those who have not yet seen it, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a 'must see'--for those who saw it years ago, take another visit. And then, during the closing credits over Thomas Newman's lovely score, do what I did--applaud.",10,0,0,14 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis' BEST Acting Endeavor on Film . . .
",". . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder. If both of these actors are not nominated for Academy Awards (and BOTH in the Best Actor category) then Hollywood is indeed a screwed up town. Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has 'the sixth sense' is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in 'The Miracle Worker'. The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save. I've seen the film twice now--blown away by it the first time, enjoying how well-crafted it is on the second round. The evil-spirited side of me was also looking for some hole, SOMEWHERE, in the film when I saw it again, but if a hole exists, I can't find it. Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.",8,0,0,19 September 1999
Gladiator," 'Gladiator' Is A Perfect Ten
","'Gladiator' is a film that should suit all tastes. It is expertly mounted and an eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and 'Might for Right'. I was reminded of 'Camelot' many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with. My one worry is that this film will reinvent him from 'gifted actor' to the next 'Hollywood Hunk'. I've watched other mercurial, vastly talented actors, like Mel Gilbson and Alec Baldwin, sell out to beefcake roles, and I'm praying Crowe doesn't fall under the same spell. Although his work in 'Gladiator' is a tour de force performance, he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen. It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeded expectations in that regard. My hope is that he continues adding to his extraordinary body of work, rather than 'selling out'. Take my word for it, he'll be the next 'Mel Gibson/Alec Baldwin/'People' Magazine's Sexiest Man on Earth if he isn't careful. Want to take a trip along side a great actor? Watch 'The Sum of Us', or even 'The Insider', and then immediately go out to see 'Gladiator'. In all cases you'll witness a great actor doing his job extremely well.",10,0,0,13 May 2000
Contact," See It! With Some Admonitions (Sorry!)
","'Contact' is arguably a fine film, the real star being the superb photography and special effects, with a jaw-dropping opening sequence that runs 3 and ½ minutes long and astonishingly, magnificently sets the tone for the rest of the picture. I was also intrigued by the film's handling of science and faith (read: NOT 'religion'), and the interesting juxtaposition of both by film's end. The first climax of the film, in which Jodie Foster as the brilliant Ellie Arroway makes an incredible journey, is eerily, achingly beautiful, followed quickly by the second climax of the film, Ellie's disquieting but deeply-felt epiphany. To say any more would ruin the story for those who have yet to see the movie. That said, Foster's performance was uncharacteristically out of focus  she utilized one too many of her stock-in-trade 'pained and confused' facial expressions that read (at least to me) as if the character was constantly vacillating her position inside of her head, an attribute Ellie would decidedly not possess. Her gaze should have been straight-forward, determined, and unwavering. Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss was sincere but a little bit too hunky to be believable. A character bestowed with such a spectacular name would have been much more realistic if he had been played with the plain ambiguity of William H. Macy. Of course that would undermine the obligatory sexual tension and negate the fatuous 'romance,' a plot point that adds absolutely zilch to the story. Since the film indicates from the very start that it is in possession of a serious-minded agenda, I can only guess the producers felt the romance was either necessary to establish the frailty and humanity of Ellie, or, more likely, as a form of selling out, a pandering affect to draw in a larger audience. Stock characters rounding out the film, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, James Woods, David Morse, and William Fichtner (and a teeny-weeny role by Rob Lowe), are solid and well-done. **SMALL SPOILER** The character of S. R. Hadden, played with straight-faced solemnity by John Hurt, might have looked good on paper, but comes off as unintentionally, embarrassingly hilarious. As the obscenely wealthy benefactor who assists Ellie in her quest, he is first seen in his private jet, which he keeps in constant flight, presumably landing only to refuel before soaring off again (okay, I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy that). But when next Hadden contacts Ellie, it is, unbelievably, ridiculously, from aboard the space station Mir -- the gentleman is now apparently cancer-ridden and prolonging his now-tenuous life in outer space. Nothing else in the entire film stretches credulity more than this; it is shocking in its absurdity. **END SPOILER** After all is said and done, I gave 'Contact' 8 out of 10 points. If for no other reason, the film's beginning and ending are worth alone the price of admission (or rental, as it were).",8,1,3,18 October 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Coen Brothers Triumph Again!
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou' is a gleeful retelling of Homer's 'Odyssey', set in 1930s Mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. George Clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. The three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. And what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! Without giving away the ending, I must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'O Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!",10,1,1,2 February 2002
