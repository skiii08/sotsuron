Hereditary," Not what I hoped it would be....
","Bummer movie. Everyone we talked to said this movie was scary. And some said they walked out of the theatre because it was so scary. Not even...Long beginning leading up to a weird ending. Some jumpy\creepy moments, but that was all.",4,1,4,16 September 2018
Dear John," Awesome Movie! It will tug on your heart strings.
","Another awesome Nicolas Sparks movie. Beautiful love story that seemed so real. Loved it. Channing and Amanda were awesome and so good in roles of John and Savannah. The life of a long distant summer love relationship with a soldier. Each time your rooting for Savannah to just stay with John, because they are so perfect together. Life is full of choices, but did Savannah make the right one by letting John go and will they ever get back together.He needs her and she (loves) needs him. John and his dad had such a rough relationship, but in the end that father son bond was always there.No matter where you are in the world, the moon is never bigger than your thumb.-John Tyree",10,0,1,23 July 2015
American Sniper," Loved it. Awesome movie for so many reasons.
","When this movie came out on DVD I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it or not. I'm a 22 year old girl and I have seen many war movies. This movie like many others was based on a true story, which is why I didn't want to watch it. I knew it was going to be sad and probably make me cry a little. But about a month ago I watched it with my dad and it was incredible. Bradley Cooper was so good at portraying the amazing Chris Kyle. With every movie made about our troops, you see how intense it is and how incredibly strong all our soldiers are. So sad what happened to Chris. His story and his determination to protect his country and his family will be carried on and remembered.",10,11,15,3 November 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Nope....
","Terrible movie. Lots of fowl language. When I first saw the commercial for this movie, I was like I want to see that. But instead of renting it, I bought it. Well, lets just say it was the worst like $15 I have ever spent. I like my love stories, but I also like my action movies. This movie was long and the actors I've seen in other movies...Morgan Freeman was annoying and creepy. But Eggsy was cute... that's about it. I was disappointed that Colin Firth & Michael Caine were in it, because usually they are good actors in good movies. Stinks I can't get my money back, because this was no good very bad. 4 out of 10 stars I give this movie for it's lack to entertain this persons love for movies.",4,6,13,20 July 2015
