The Blair Witch Project," most overrated movie of the year
","i have to say, i wasn't scared at all.  i admit, the premise is clever, but there is not much else in the film.  it's repetitive, and even felt long for just 87 minutes.  maybe i would have enjoyed it more if i was dumb enough to think that it was real.",Null,0,0,19 October 1999
