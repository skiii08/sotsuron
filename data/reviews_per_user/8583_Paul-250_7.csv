Casablanca," Overwrought Wartime Romance
","Am I the only person not to like this film, or just the only one (almost) to say so? At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers. But this is not a serious film, whatever Woody Allen may think.",4,18,37,15 May 1999
Chinatown," Film Noir Par Excellence
","Whatever you may think of Nicholson or Polanski as individuals this is great cinema. Even if you don't much like Nicholson as an actor you will have to make an exception in the case of this movie. The plot is constantly developing, with blind alleys and constant twists abounding. Just as you think things are becoming clearer something else happens to make you wonder. The sense of menace is palpable. Just who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? This is also one of the few films that has the power to genuinely shock as the final layers of truth are exposed.",8,0,1,3 May 1999
Citizen Kane," The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time!
","Here goes! Citizen Kane regularly tops the list of American critics' best films of all time lists and runs in the top ten in European critic ratings, despite having been a huge commercial failure at the time of its original release. It is a serious, well-acted and groundbreaking film certainly, but to describe it as the best film ever made is ludicrous; in fact I would rate it the most overrated movie in the history of film. Because I don't like Welles? Not at all. Welles had one of the most original and creative careers in world cinema and Othello (1952) would probably rank in my own top ten list. So why my scepticism? One of the biggest problems I have with the film is that, like Apocalypse Now, it requires a certain political position in order to fully appreciate it. Pauline Kael, the doyenne of American film critics, is on record as saying that the film was an important cultural statement for left-wing Americans at the time, and that is certainly true. But a film which has that kind of appeal usually makes assumptions that are far from universally shared, and often ungenerous ones at that. Hearst was a bete-noir of the American left whose newspapers had decades earlier encouraged a jingoistic war in Cuba. Did that give Welles the right though to dissect his life without even knowing the man (he later met him once in a lift) and, in particular to characterise him as cold an ungiving at a personal level? (It is worth remembering, in this context, that when Hearst later fell on hard times his wife apparently so starved of love sold her jewels and remained with him). The film has too much the feel of a hatchet job. Someone could make a similar movie today about Rupert Murdoch and it might be well-acted and beautifully shot but you see the problem! Welles was only twenty-five when he made this movie and it shows. Certainly he had a right to an opinion and a right to state it, but life is a little more complex than you would know from this movie.Defenders of the movie often point to the originality and quality of its cinematography and the influence it has had on American cinema in particular. This is undoubtedly true. In the same way that Eliot, Joyce and Nabakov changed literature, Welles helped to change cinema. But Picasso was unquestionably the most influential figure on twentieth century art and yet his influence would not necessarily be universally accepted as benign.I am not suggesting that the influence of Citizen Kane was malign, but influence and quality are discrete concepts. As for the cinematography itself is it really as original as many American critics seem to think? What about early Eisenstein or, at the risk of being non-pc, the extraordinary cinematography several years earlier of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph Of The Will? A serious film? Yes! An important film? Unquestionably! The greatest film ever made? Move over! It is simply too cold ever to be that.",5,3,10,9 May 1999
The Elephant Man," A Moving Story
","A very unusual David Lynch movie, this tells the story of the life of a disfigured Victorian man and the doctor who tried to help him. Few American directors have really had a feel for Britain, let alone continental Europe, (Landis (An American Werewolf in London) and Losey (The Go-Between) are exceptions that come to mind) but Lynch's portrait of Victorian society is both powerful and poignant. Similar in concept to Bogdanovich's Mask, the film is profoundly different in execution. Lynch elicits outstanding performances from all the cast and succeeds in producing a deeply humane piece of cinema.",8,10,17,22 May 1999
Amadeus," A Very Entertaining Film
","You do not have to be a lover of Mozart's music to enjoy this film. The circumstances surrounding the composer's death remain a mystery, and it would be a mistake to see the film as a historical account. The achievement of the film lies in the extent to which it enables us to share in the joyful and almost boyish enthusiasm with which Mozart (Tom Hulce) expresses himself through his music, and to marvel at his eternal optimism in the face of constant adversity, much of it caused by his jealous rival Salieri (Murray Abraham). Hulce's performance is wonderfully spontaneous and energetic, with Abraham's appropriately menacing. Not a great film perhaps, but an enormously entertaining one nonetheless.",7,2,5,3 May 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Coppola Breaks New Ground
","I have only ever seen this movie dubbed into Spanish, which, while providing a whole new perspective, makes it difficult for me to attest to the authenticity of Keanu Reeves' and Winona Ryder's English accents. What struck me apart from the sumptuousness of the costumes and sets and the extraordinary energy of the film was the way that Coppola had reinvented the whole Dracula legend while remaining consciously faithful to the Hammer Gothic tradition in terms of composition and style. I found it breathtaking to watch. I don't know about those accents though!",7,0,0,3 May 1999
Ben-Hur," One of the Great Movies of All Time
","As a biblical epic, Ben-Hur is inevitably looked-down on by some of the sniffier critics, but it remains one of the great movies of all time, with the chariot scene, in particular, having long achieved legendary cinematic status. Heston, who was offered the part of Messala but chose to play the eponymous hero instead produces what is probably the most outstanding performance of his career. Beautifully photographed and staged, the film is magnificent in its scope. Look-out for a memorable performance by Jack Hawkins as a Roman General. Heston's decision to play Ben-Hur led directly to an interesting controversy after Gore Vidal claimed recently that Stephen Boyd had played the spear scene opposite Heston as though the two characters had been homosexual lovers. Heston denied it vehemently. Make up your own mind. They don't make films like this any more, so enjoy it!",8,1,3,3 May 1999
