The Ring," Not scary
","This movie is NOT scary.  It has it's creepy moments but that's only because of the creepy visuals which, after you've seen once, you get used to and move on.  I kept waiting to be truly frightened and I wasn't even moderately frightened.The 'creepy son' thing is so overdone too.  It was successful in The Shining and The Sixth Sense, so why do it again?  Even the dark shadows they applied to his eyes didn't do the trick for me.And, lastly, the ending was so very weak.  Why was such a big deal made of this movie?",4,0,1,15 March 2003
