Insidious: Chapter 2," Better than the first.
","First of all, before one watches this movie i strongly suggest watching the first movie, since you need to know the characters and family's background to fully understand this movie. In my opinion this was better than the first movie, which usually never is the case. The movie is jam packed with action and more intense than the first one. Maybe not as many jump scares, but the suspension was there and i could feel it. I love how both movies are kinda jammed together to fully get the small details you couldn't figure out while watching part one. Everyone who is a fan of movies like insidious, the conjuring, sinister etc. should definitely see this one!",8,0,0,2 November 2014
Scarface," Don't get high on your own supply.
","An outstanding drama about a Cuban immigrant Tony Montana, who gets involved in the drug business, but lets his greed destroy him and the people around him.Tony Montana is an extremely interesting character, he shows no emotions, except when it's about the family, that's probably there to show that drug dealers never want to trust anybody and you have to be like that to go far. Al Pacino performance here really can not be explained in words, that is the highest level an actor can reach, no doubt about it, the biggest shock is that Al Pacino didn't even get nominated for an Oscar for this performance, what a shame.Although the movie is 170 minutes long, you never feel bored, it doesn't have a lot of action, most people presume that ''scarface'' is a gangster movie with constant shoot-outs and killings, it is not like that at all, except for the end. It focuses more on showing hardships and problematic situations and playing on emotions. Tony does not really take care of all of these problems very well, thanks to his hot temper, he often gets furious and goes daft, not helping the situation whatsoever, but that was the whole story, if not like that, Tony wouldn't have reached the pinnacle of the drug industry.A classic everybody should watch, movie has some of the greatest conversations ever, by the way.",10,2,4,18 August 2015
Requiem for a Dream," Makes you feel
","The movie isn't really showcasing exceptional plot or film making, here it is all about the emotions and sending a message. Requiem for a dream does a great job with really getting you sucked into the movie and it kind of makes you feel remorse for the characters, despite all of them being stupid drug addicts.The main point was to show how horrible and disgusting is the life of a drug addict, it showed their ''highs'' and their ''lows'', ''highs'' being when they were using the drugs and making some money, or in Harry's moms case just getting slimmer. All the characters ended up having to be alone and miserable, nobody was happy. I liked that the movie showed Harry's mom going insane just because she wanted to be thin, shows that people's lives can go downhill just because of a silly reason like that and without even knowing that they get hooked on dangerous drugs. A good point was the way the guys lost all their money just as fast as they had earned it, that is just how it can be when you get involved in drug dealing, i found that to be the greatest aspect of the movie.Definitely a must watch, don't look for plot in this movie, it is basically non existent, enjoy the emotions and feel for the characters!",9,1,2,23 July 2015
Gravity," Stellar graphics, weak story
","I think it is not a secret, that this film has absolutely 0 plot and it fails to create suspense, since it starts extremely slowly and the weak dialogue just propels the mediocrity of this movie as a story. Of course it extremely unrealistic and most of the actions can be easily debunked, but that is an another story.However nobody can take away the absolutely outstanding achievement in cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound effects, etcetera, that is exactly why this film won 7 Oscars, none of them for good acting or storyline of course, but still the movie has left its mark in film history, for sure. The graphics were truly outstandingly impressive, unfortunately that was the essence of this film, this film could have easily been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made if only it had a better/more interesting story and the dialogue wasn't so dull and pointless.It is worth watching just to enjoy the awesome visual effects, but other than that its plain, good thing it was only 90 minutes long. Has got to be one of the weakest plots ever, sadly. 4/10 for the graphics.",4,2,3,30 December 2015
Se7en," Disappointed about the ending :/
","The movie had a high tension built up towards the grand ending and i thought it was gonna something extravagant and awesome, but it turned out to be quite plain, yes, John Doe was the ''envy'' and by killing Mills's wife and her unborn baby, he carried out his plan, hence Mills shot him as his punishment.That left the last sin - ''wrath'', and Mills was the wrath at the end, since John Doe provoked him to punish him for his envious life by killing him.The idea was great, got super curious about the ending, but the problem was, that it didn't really seem that John Doe wanted to be a normal man, he was not envious of Mills's life, he was just insane. That part made no sense. Really expected the ending to be way more complex and interesting, however the movie was not bad overall and was quite enjoyable.",8,0,2,22 December 2014
The Big Lebowski," Didn't do the trick for me .
","I must say, that i didn't get what i expected to get out of this film. It has a high rating, but i don't think this movie deserves it. It isn't as funny as people claim it is.First of all, the problem for me was the main character itself, ''The Dude'' just wasn't funny, he didn't react to anything and was just chill all the time, on the other hand Walter was an awesome character, quite enjoyed watching him. The movie doesn't really show what happens to any of the characters, the most irrelevant character dies, nobody really cares about that, they got this bowling rivalry going on, but the movie didn't even show a second of the big match. The last half of the film was just plain. Having many unlikable and irrelevant characters just threw me off, if it was not for Walter i would consider this movie thrash.In my opinion, a little over hyped, there wasn't anything that great or unseen in the movie at all.",6,1,3,25 August 2015
Unbreakable," The definition of mediocrity.
","By looking at the rating of 7,2 i expected this movie to be somewhat decent, unfortunately i was wrong. This has got to be one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. The movie starts with an intriguing premise, but sadly it continues on the high note just for a brief moment. The worst thing is the lack of likable characters in the movie, which just helps to create a sense of boredom for most people.Can't say the movie is poorly made, but with this kind of a story it could have really been an astounding movie. Instead, they chose to lead a good start to slump. David only starts to believe his ''powers'' only when the movie is about to end, so they have only 20 minutes to showcase what David is actually capable of. Sadly, even those 20 minutes were not used efficiently as they only showed David strangling a criminal and saving 2 kids. However, he indirectly killed the parents of those 2 kids he saved, since he saw the parents getting killed in hindsight, however, he chose to wait it out and really see if the criminal is going to break into their house and kill them. A real hero, huh?Samuel L. Jackson was just awful, i am sorry, but he was simply unbearably cheesy, making me cringe multiple times throughout the film. Linking his and David's distinctions to comic books, it did not seem relevant to the story in any way. Just a complete fail of a character there for Samuel L. Jackson, at least in my opinion. Also, the ending is just laughable and completely obnoxious, overall a dull movie with no action.",3,6,10,20 August 2015
Fight Club," One of the greatest movies of the 90's.
","The 90's had a bunch of excellent movies, such as, ''The Shawshank redemption'', ''Se7en'', ''Forrest Gump'' and, of course, many other movies, Fight Club being the greatest masterpiece of 1999 to top it all.Fight Club was a unique movie, which in my opinion is the father of the excellent movie ''The Machinist'', because the idea is quite similar, both movies turning out great, of course.Many people know the movie by it's original, at the time, plot twist, where Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters were really one person, Brad Pitt's character being the imaginary friend or the person who Tyler Durdan really wanted to be. The plot twist was interesting and quite shocking, but the greatest aspect of this movie, at least in my opinion, is really finding and doing whatever you really love to do in life. Tyler was a casual office worker, had a great condo, with everything he wanted, but that was a very sad life, he was always depressed, had insomnia, which lead him to join several support groups just to feel better about himself.Tyler Durdan's Fight Club was really a place for him to escape reality, even though not even knowing, that he was the head behind it all, he finally felt good about himself, despite the bad conditions he was living in. The people who joined his Fight Club were just like him, they had many problems and wanted to have some sort of redemption via that.An excellent movie, about one man and his broken mind. Everyone should have seen this movie, though only made in 1999, it has clearly went down in history as a classic. 10/10.",10,0,2,2 January 2015
The Maze Runner," Very illogical and not appealing.
","A bunch of teen boys living in nowhere for years and all they have done was gardening and building a little shelter? really? Nobody ever even thought about building a ladder, to look what is over the walls or to over see the maze? Making a miniature of the whole maze, while it has been shifting? Thomas stings himself on purpose, so he would remember some things, he remembers that he and Theresa are kind of responsible for all of this, since they were working for the corporation, but it doesn't add anything to the movie, he already found a way out before, he and Minho could have gotten out easily the first time they were at the door, but they didn't even try. A girl gets sent to the place, where dozens of boys have been living for years and nobody even says anything, really? That is not how it would be.Yeah, cool, the ending is meant to be a shocker or whatever, but it is just nothing special, they got out of the maze and they are immediately sent off to a destroyed city to start everything over again, the second part is going to come out in 2015, so kind of fast, hopefully it will be way better, which i doubt.The idea itself is not that bad and this idea could make a good movie franchise, but i don't know if people will really want to see the other possible parts, after watching the first one. Action wise it could have been more intense as well, a couple of robot - monsters here and there, nothing too original.",3,2,5,4 December 2014
Memento," Incredible masterpiece.
","Haven't seen anything like this in my life, an insanely complex and breath-taking plot. Every moment of the movie is interesting and you can't stop constantly wondering what is going to happen next. Movie is made out of kinda fast clips, each clip helps to further understand the story and is crucial to fully get everything. The idea about tattoos and the way Leonard uses them is very great and is implemented perfectly into the movie. The beginning might be very misleading and somebody may already dislike the movie just because of its beginning. It all comes together at the end and if you pay close attention to everything you will be shocked and amazed by the depth and creativity of this movie. I love how this movie kinda starts from the end and ends with the beginning, that is something unique and rarely seen in the film industry.The whole part of Leonard coming up with the story about Sammy and his disability just to somehow compensate his own painful life after tragedy, which his wife actually had survived and later on it turns out that he killed his own wife,hence failing her test. Doesn't matter what kind of movies you like, this movie is a must watch for anybody who likes movies that can make you think.",10,0,3,9 November 2014
World War Z," A Classical American zombie film.
","You kind of get what you expected as it is similar to many other movies, this is the kind of movie where as usual 1 American goes through hell, risking his life and at the end saves the whole world by finding a vaccine, that ''camouflages'' people so they don't arise interest of the zombies. Aside from the predictability of this movie it was well filmed, packed with action, very fast paced, of course, had Brad Pitt in the leading role, a classical movie, no big surprises, but it's still enjoyable. Anyone who likes zombie movies or movies about a huge infection spreading through the whole world will surely find this movie great. One thing that stood out was that Brad Pitt actually showed some pain from his injury at the end where he was running around the medical research facility, in most of the movies a metal going through your whole stomach is not a big deal and characters don't usually even feel any pain.",8,1,3,1 December 2014
Insomnia," A different style for Nolan.
","Differs from other movies by Christopher Nolan, he drifts away from his usual complex plot twists and overlapping stories. It is not a bad crime/thriller movie, i just expected something more extravagant here. Insomnia really did not have that huge of an impact on Will Dormer, i expected something crazy here.Nonetheless, the movie is decent, maybe i am just a little disappointed since i love Nolan's complex, mind twisting movies. Could have incorporated something interesting regarding Dormer's insomnia, he just had some mere hallucinations and that is it. But, alright for a crime movie it was decent. Had a great cast, Al Pacino and Robin Williams outstanding as per usual, interesting to see Pacino in a movie like this, a little different for him as well, in my opinion, he played his role masterfully.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is, if you want to see Nolan/Pacino from another perspective, i recommend watching it, you will not be shocked, it is a little intense and some parts are quite interesting.",7,0,2,31 October 2015
Yes Man," Makes you think about yourself.
","The movie itself was fine, had some very funny moments, of course had great actors, especially if you like Jim Carrey. But the thing that really made this movie awesome was the feeling you get afterwards. The whole concept of course was unreal, to say yes to everything, of course in real life that would result in you being in trouble and probably everything would turn worse not better for you. But what you can take away from this movie is the thought of saying ''yes'', when you really don't know what to do, maybe yes or maybe no, made me think about all the opportunities and fun memories i could have had if i said ''yes'' one of those times someone called me or offered me something. How much new people you can meet and how much more new and interesting stuff you can get yourself into if you simply accept the offers you are given. Maybe i should start saying yes more form now on!",8,0,1,19 November 2014
Zodiac," Believable
","Although very slow paced and lenghty, it is an interesting, thought-provoking movie, that seems realistic. Not your typical serial killer thriller, at first we get presented with some homicides, but for the wast majority of the screen time it is just about police going through trial and error to find the Zodiac killer, after they relegate from the task, a cartoonist, who has become obsessed with the case tries to solve the case himself. At least i think, that Robert Graysmith got it right and he found the zodiac killer, all he said was - ''i just need to look him in the eyes and know that is him'', which he approved by meeting Leigh face to face.Sure, this may not be the most interesting and action packed movie you will see, characters come and go, since it is supposed to happen over the course of more than a decade. It's about showing how police can not do anything without genuine evidence leading to them dropping the case off. Also a great point was, when somebody mentioned it was great business for the newspaper, and that is very true, newspaper only cared for a brief moment about the Zodiac killer and they were more than happy for the extra publicity received.Believable, real, nothing too crazy, lenghty, if you are into movies about homicide investigations, you should check this out, since it brings something new to the table and i worth watching after all. Starring great and well known actors as well, so the performance is sharp throughout.",8,1,1,30 August 2015
Dear John," Light and mellow
","very light, calming and romantic movie, it is kind of a classic story, nothing too outrageous, the plot is kind linear and not very interesting, but what i liked about this movie was its easy and romantically calming pace and amazingly beautiful scenery.The acting was up there, since the main characters were played by Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum. If only the plot was little bit more interesting this could have been an outstanding love story, but, of course, it was very predictable, therefore not the greatest thing you will see. But eh... what can you want from a standard romantic drama.The couple of these two actors wasn't the worst out there, although, i didn't feel the chemistry between them a 100%, it was better than many reviewers here have said, i don't think these two actors were particularly bad picks for this film at all.Nothing crazy, very linear, slow paced and calm. Overall it is a decent movie to watch after a hard day of work just to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery this film surely had. Ohh... if only life would be as beautiful.",7,0,0,28 December 2015
Snatch," Comedy/crime masterpiece.
","An exceptional movie, could possibly be one of the best movies ever made, the movie does an incredible job of combining crime and comedy, involves a large amount of interesting characters and is just action/joke packed throughout. 'Snatch' just has everything to it - gangsters, shooting, stealing diamonds, boxing, betting, a lot of killing, cute dog eating diamonds, stupid people doing stupid stuff, etc. Plus it has Brad Pitt in a role of a fighter, which reminds everybody of the fight club, of course. There wasn't a single moment where i felt bored or uninterested in the further development of the plot, it was interesting throughout.Don't have a clue why i held back for so long on watching this movie, it is totally worth the time, everybody should see it, not gonna leave you disappointed for sure!",10,0,2,7 July 2015
Full Metal Jacket," war/army movie classic.
","An awesome movie by Stanley Kubrick, not his best one, but still outstanding. 'Full Metal Jacket' shows the ups and downs of army life, i love how the first half of the movie focuses on how it is to be in marine corps. To be honest, the first part was more action packed than the second part, which was about an actual war, not training.I can't say i was really fascinated about how the war in Vietnam was displayed here, sure, the effects and scenery created was stellar for a movie from 1987, but i didn't feel the intensity i should have felt. They never really directly faced their enemies and didn't show too many fights between them. Yeah there were like 2 small skirmishes and that's about it. In my opinion the ending was kind of lack luster too, i really could not find it enjoyable, this is one of those great movies with a bad ending, unfortunately.If it was only for the marine corps part of the movie it would have definitely been a 10/10, loved their training, struggles, Sergeant Hartman was just an awesome character. Still people, who really enjoy war movies are going to like this and enjoy it throughout. A Recommended watch!",8,1,2,26 October 2015
Pacific Rim," Many flaws, but great entertainment.
","Of course in all movies similar to this there are gonna be many very noticeable flaws, not even worth pointing them out in this movie, since it will just take too much time to count them all, but nonetheless the movie was good entertainment wise and before even starting to watch a movie like this i know what i am going to get. Of course, a movie like Pacific Rim will not have deep plot twists and a great story, it is just made to entertain people and show off the great film making skills nowadays.The small monsters that came out of Kaijus were just so awesome looking, so props for that. The ending battle, where they finally got into the portal and destroyed it was just awesome, although wanted to see some interaction between people and those ''aliens''? who made Kaijus, but maybe that is left for a sequel? I bet Kaijus can magically appear again, even though their ''realm'' was blown up, like in every other Hollywood movie.",7,0,2,5 December 2014
American Sniper," Great old propaganda
","Right... It is very hard to review a movie like this and judge it only by its plot, screenplay, acting, etcetera. This has got to be one of the movies that scream ''murica, hell yeah' in your face the most. The whole ideology of being a 'hero' is just plain wrong in the first place, according to this movie a hero is someone, who goes to a foreign country and kills hundreds of people, who were 'attacking America' .We don't clearly know whether it was a good depiction of how Chris Kyle's war tours really were, i surely think it wasn't like that. But this movie just portrayed a random, dumb guy seeing an ad on TV of American soldiers dying in Iraq, what made him join the navy seals in order to 'protect' his country, just like Americans are taught to believe. There is no reason to go further into the topic of American propaganda, so lets just establish, that you will get a lot of pro American military conversations, scenes and the vibe of the whole thing overall is like that, so just take that into account before watching this.Aside from all the propaganda, everything else was just great, it was intense, made you feel like you are out there on the battlefield yourself. Had awesome scenery and decent acting, Bradley Cooper was outstanding, Oscar nomination well deserved. It would have been one of the best war movies ever made, only if it wasn't so biased, but that doesn't stop us from ignoring all the nonsense to just focus on the good parts, which the movie didn't lack. Chris's mental journey was what i enjoyed the most, his relationships with his wife, in and out of Iraq were interesting and i loved to watch him transform into a different person. I will not rate this 1/10, only because of its massive Hollywood censorship, like most of the reviewers here. This movie deserves more for its great qualities, it was enjoyable, it was beautiful and pleasant to watch. So ignore the flaws and enjoy!",8,1,11,19 December 2015
Léon: The Professional," Excellence.
","Possibly one of the best movies ever made. By reading about the movie, it looks like the movie is just a blatant action movie, where a 12 year old girl gets trained by a professional hit-man and then becomes an extreme war machine, killing everyone on sight. Fortunately, that was not the case with this movie, the movie was exceptionally executed. I can bet nobody expected the movie to go like it did, didn't actually had so many killings as everyone would expect from a movie like this.The ending was not what everybody expected, i expected an insane bloodbath, which it kinda was, but not to the extent it usually goes in action movies. And the thing that the ''bad guy'' actually outsmarted Leon at the end was, of course, unexpected, since that never happens.The movie was something incredibly original, have not ever seen a movie quite like this, little girl Mathilda completely changed the life of cold hearted assassin Leon, who knew only how to kill, she learned him about compassion and friendship. The bond Leon and Mathilda were able to make between them was something special and hard to imagine, where else can you see a 12 year old girl ''loving'' a 40 year old man. Leon didn't express his love until the very end, when they made their separate paths, but i think he felt something special, maybe he finally remembered his old love and the feelings he had and embraced Mathilda as his love.Even though Natalie Portman was only 12 in this movie, her performance was excellent, by watching this movie, everyone can see the reason why she grew up to be such a great actress, obviously had great skills in her youth.",10,2,2,27 December 2014
Oblivion," Tom Cruise was actually great in this one.
","By reading the reviews i only saw some positive opinions about the movie overall, i don't know, if it is only me, but i watched it and didn't feel any emotions or whatever. In my opinion the plot was really dull, for a science fiction movie like this there should be way more action.Morgan Freeman also had a very insignificant role, he literally didn't do anything, despite him being the head of the survivor base, for an actor of his caliber, i was disappointed to see him in a role like that.Despite the movie not being entertaining for me, i really like Tom Cruise's acting in this movie, that and some of the beautiful movie were the 2 aspects, that made me even continue watching it, because at the beginning i was quite bored already and the ending wasn't a shocker at all, as well.Maybe sci-fi fans love this movie, just not really my cup of tea, anyways 6/10.",6,0,0,6 December 2014
The Revenant," Amazing scenery, weak story.
","People have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie and so do i. On one hand it is beautifully made and has absolutely amazing scenery and use of sound, but on the other hand it feels very drawn out and boring at times.This is the kind of movie you will never want to watch twice, the plot is easily remember-able and there is not anything interesting or deep about it, just a guy left for dead surviving the seemingly impossible and seeking revenge right after. You can call this movie visual poetry, since it is really outstanding when it comes to calm, extremely beautiful scenes of nature, also i think Leonardo Di Caprio really deserved his Oscar for this, after waiting for so many years he finally clinged his hands on it with this beautiful performance. Leo was absolutely amazing, even though the plot was bad and the film tried to attract more with its amazing scenery and poetic calming vibe than action or interesting conversations.I was amazed about Tom Hardy receiving an Oscar nomination for his role here, he did an absolutely awful job trying to fake a Texan accent, he was almost inaudible and simply annoying, it was extremely hard to understand what he is saying and it made the conversations even less engaging, as if they already were not in this movie.In my opinion people are giving this film too much negative reviews only because it is quite long and might seem boring for some people, i can agree it is not the most exciting or fun movie to watch, but people have to understand not every movie should be the same action packed thriller people enjoy. I can guarantee there are a bunch of people who absolutely loved it for its outstanding shots of the mountains and nature in general. Not to say it is the greatest film ever, but it certainly does not deserve the 1 out of 10 star ratings, that is just simple hate for something you do not like, some aspects of the film are amazing and that is something i can not take away from it, even though it the plot was kind of shallow.",7,0,0,30 October 2017
American Psycho," When you have it all.
","American Psycho is a unique movie, since it can not be fully explained and understood. Christian Bale is just awesome in this movie as he keeps a cool head for the most of the movie and the his commenting on music is just hilarious. The movie really shows what a person can become when they have it all, Patrick Bateman had it all, a well-paid job, an expensive apartment, a good looking girl, all the drugs he wanted, which eventually led him to being insane, in his insanity he thought he was killing people, that can be understood from the parts where he walks around the town and blows up police cars and still gets completely unnoticed, the incident with a cat just tops it and viewers can sort of understand that none of the killings really took place, since Patrick had gone insane. This was not meant to be a slasher movie by any means, if anyone wants to see dozens of killings this is not really a movie to see then, this movie is more about understanding the story of a crazy psychopath, who has it all, but still is envious of every little thing, somebody else has,which leads to him killing everybody in his mind for his own amusement.",9,0,0,30 November 2014
The Shining," Different, to say at least.
","The Shining is deemed by many to be the greatest psychological horror movie of all time. The movie really tries to create suspense by long, strange sounds, rather than jump scares. Some of the scenes are creepy only because of the ongoing sounds, the sounds go on for so long you can not possibly know when to wait for the scary part, sometimes there is nothing, and the sound completely fools the viewer.I don't know why, but i didn't really see Jack going insane during the movie, i saw him as an insane person right from the get go, the way he answered questions at the interview was rather strange. Jack never really showed any feelings for his family, obviously right from the start something was very wrong with him.Really didn't like the performance of Wendy, Jack's wife, she was the dumbest person ever, she had no self esteem whatsoever, did whatever Jack told her, he told her to screw off several times and she didn't even care. She was about to get murdered and she is not even smart enough to knock out the wooden frame of the window to escape her insane husband...There were scenes in the movie which were incredibly long, that was not that bad, because some of the conversations were just awesome, for example, Jack talking to Delbert Grady in the bathroom, one of the best conversations i have ever seen in any movie.The ending scene, or rather the picture that was shown, was very interesting, that lead viewers to craft several theories over the years, which, of course, is crucial for the longevity of a movie, if the ending is something you need to think about and you can never really find the right answer, it has been a good ending. Personally, i believe that Jack was the ''care taker'' of the hotel and that was a reincarnation of Jack in the 1920's, since he was in the picture shot in 1920's looking exactly the same as he did 60 years later.Danny was very interesting too, i feel that his ''shine'' attracted the dead spirits, but Danny's interaction with the dead was not as strong as Jack's, really i haven't been able to see the correlation between Danny's ''shine'' and Jack's ability to connect with the dead.If you want to fully understand the story, i suppose, reading the book would be very beneficial, since in the book all the characters are explained in details, however the movie is a good horror classic, quite different that other movies, but i just can't agree with ''the best psychological horror movie of all time'' title people have been giving the movie.",8,0,2,4 January 2015
American Beauty," Routine can kill.
","At first glance the movie might seem to be just a plain teen movie about a stupid 40 year old guy, who is tired of his wife and just wants to get together with a young chick. Fortunately, that is nowhere near the truth and American Beauty comes off as one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.The movie just showcases how miserable marriage can sometimes be and what can possibly happen if you don't do anything about it, shows that routine can be one of the most damaging things of ones life. Clearly Lester wasn't living a happy life nor was his wife, Carolyn, but Carolyn didn't really want to change anything about it, because she only thought about succeeding at her job, until the very end, when she actually regretted cheating and not caring about her husband, Lester.Ricky was an extremely interesting and deep character on his own, his life was definitely screwed up, his father was a war veteran, who couldn't really live a normal life and because of that his mother had gone completely mental as well.All the stories just add up so well, into creating this great movie, the acting is exceptional, i especially enjoyed the performances of Kevin Spacey(Lester) and Wes Bentley(Ricky. Without a doubt a must watch movie, 10/10.",9,0,1,6 July 2015
Warrior," Good, but could be better.
","Very intense, interesting and does the trick for building suspense, but, in my opinion, lacks the interaction between main characters. The conversations Tommy has with his dad are not very passionate and the viewer just can not know what to feel.It's hard to choose which brother to cheer for here, both of them have their good sides, i was slightly more inclined towards cheering for Brendan to win the fight. Would have love to seen more personal interactions, yes, in the beginning everything was kind of laid out for the viewer and we got provided with some background information, but i felt it was not quite enough.Sure, it is a great sports drama, if you like movies about fighting this is definitely a decent watch fighting wise. If it was only for the fighting, it would have been a 10/10 movie without a doubt, it is intense and brings just what is needed for a fighting movie. But when compared to a movie like Rocky, which has excellent fighting scenes and outstanding family life scenes, this just can not quite compete. Nonetheless, not bad and worth watching.",8,0,3,8 October 2015
Edward Scissorhands," As simple as possible.
","I feel like it is impossible to objectively judge this movie, just not possible to judge all the dumb colors the houses were, the way Edward was cutting the bushes etc., it is just pure art by Tim Burton. He found the most simple background possible to purely reflect the true nature of a human. Everybody wanted to be friends with Edward at first, just to use his ''scissors'' for free, after things got tough nobody wanted to call Edward their friend, except for Kim.Sure, the movie was very cheesy, the colours and actions were definitely funky to say the least, but it was meant to be that way and everybody should know and respect that, without that this movie would not have turned out as well. Johnny Depp was just flawless here, really got into his character.Not everyone is going to like this movie, just because of the way it is set and maybe some of the actions seem illogical and just completely dumb at times, but it is worth watching it and finding out for yourself!",8,3,4,27 July 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Exceptional acting.
","The plot is quite plain and maybe looks boring, when you hear about it from someone, but oh, Jennifer Lawrence's acting was insanely good, i mean Bradley Cooper was awesome too, but Jennifer was just amazing, i can see why she got all the awards for this movie. Has got to be one of the best characters i have ever seen in a movie.Doesn't matter if the story in this movie seemed kind of boring and not appealing to some people, i loved the movie, because of the great actors and their performances.I loved the idea how Pat and Tiffany were both going through similar problems, what i loved about it the most was their strange conversations and their mood swings. Of course, it was blatant that Tiffany fell in love with Pat right off the bat, Pat's emotions were just funny and entertaining, when he was with Tiffany.",9,0,4,29 December 2014
Dark City," Begins well, but goes down hill.
","The first couple of minutes get you excited, we get presented with this dark mysterious city and a guy who wakes up to find out he doesn't remember anything. Unfortunately throughout the film you lose the excitement as the tension strangely decreases.First of all this film has many big plot holes and flaws, but that is not even worth mentioning, because everything else was kind of mediocre as well. It makes me really sad to see and awesome idea getting executed so poorly, there could have been so many alternate scenes that would have made the movie more appealing. I really didn't like the villains, they are these super intelligent aliens, who can easily control time and people's minds, levitate, change terrain, but still they bring a small knife to fight Murdock? That's like having and ak47, but choosing to fight with bare hands, for Christ's sake.People praise this movie for its originality, alright i will give this movie credit for being original, that is a fact, but other than that it's kind of plain. The acting was quite weak too, to be honest, in some scenes it felt like the actors are not really familiar with the idea of the film. At least Jennifer Connelly made this movie look more appealing with her stunning looks, but it wasn't all about her, so we just have to sit through this sort of boring, illogical movie and try to enjoy all the other mediocre actors here.Some people might say it is insanely complex and thought provoking. No, it is not, apparently they just haven't seen many movies, maybe it somehow could be thought provoking if you really like to dig deep and think about all the little details, but in that case, you can brainstorm after every movie and associate different things to it, so i don't buy this idea. It is dark, flashy, exciting at times, but mostly boring, unfortunately. Die hard sci-fi fans will probably still enjoy this mediocre little flick.",5,3,7,2 December 2015
Now You See Me," The plot twist seemed illogical.
","The whole concept of this movie is great, having people steal money from banks/rich people via ''magic tricks'' is something yet unseen in the movie industry and may be very interesting. I can't buy the plot twist, well come on, it was not very well thought through, if you really think it through, yes, inspector Dylan could have been behind all of the tricks and had secretly given Four horsemen the directions to complete these tricks, but the way he acted through the whole movie..... it just doesn't add up. He was supposedly a dumb inspector, who always screws up, so if he was behind all of the tricks, then the scenes when he fought/ tried to catch the four horsemen were completely irrelevant and no hint was shown regarding him being behind all of it or at least knowing something. Would have loved to see more of the tricks/action instead of the dumb fbi chases like in every other movie. The fact that Morgan Freeman actually got tricked and put in jail by the supposedly dumb inspector was hilarious.",6,0,1,12 November 2014
American History X," Stupidity rhymes with ignorance.
","Most of the story is told in flashbacks from the past, showing the viewer how Derek got to the point he was and how he managed to change his mindset to become a better person. I love the way this movie was made, because it solely focused on showing what lead to Derek killing two people, not just showing how he and his neo-nazi crew demolishes stores and assaults black people.Derek was a normal teenager, but it only took a few minutes worth of lecturing from his father to change his life. He took his father as a role model and became a neo-nazi fanatic, falling into his ignorance and leading others to the same. When Derek's father got killed, his rage towards other races escalated even more, making him angrier than ever. Danny looked up to his older brother and ended up trying to copy him. However, just for a brief moment before Danny got killed Derek managed to change Danny's opinion on life. Just shows how easy it is to influence a life of a person close to you and change for the better.Derek realized, that it doesn't matter what is your skin colour, you can still get along, and freed himself from the ignorance he was living in. He stopped looking at stereotypes and judging everybody before getting to know them, some people really would need to wake up and realize this in order to make a better world.Edward Norton showed everyone once again - he can play a variety of roles, he looked just awesome at the first half of the movie, when he was a neo-nazi fanatic, could not have imagined he that badass look to him. Later on he transitioned to his usual softer, calm style. An awesome actor overall.",9,1,2,24 August 2015
The Conjuring 2," A great start to a downhill spiral.
","The movie begins with another clever marketing pitch by James Wan trying to mix Amityville horror in here just like he did with ''Annabelle'', well not that it is horrible, but still seemed quite irrelevant. The beginning is not horrible, rather fast paced, the viewers got to see paranormal activity quickly, which carried on for a good while.What i found really weird was the movie coming to a massive stall in the middle of everything, i do not think i have experienced something quite like this in a film before. In my opinion it was just another cheap shot at extending the screen time, which panned out to be rather sizeable. The first hour had a couple of interesting and witty jump scares, which were quite original and definitely one of the greatest things about this film. Then after we arrive at around the half way mark everything slows down and it seems as if everything has taken a turn and the premise and fast pace of this film have been discarded, which is a massive flop of course.There is a scene in the film, which is going to make any experienced horror film fan cringe, at this point i had to start heavily re-evaluating my thoughts about the film. There is a scene where a dog transforms into the ''crooked man'', from a kids toy game, the monster was a really poor work of cgi, which did absolutely no justice to the tone and tensity the movie had set prior to the scene, it was really cringy, not scary at all and very childish. However, by far the greatest upset for me was the extremely boring and poorly thought through ending. The insanely powerful demon that can easily do anything it wants, including teleportation, transcending time and destroying everything in its way can be destroyed and sent to hell forever by saying its name 2 times? This had me laughing, such a week ending, well at least it was unpredictable, people like unpredictability when it comes to horror films, right? Overall the film starts out great and slowly goes downhill as it progresses. It escalates from witty, unpredictable jump scares and intense atmosphere to lousy cgi work and laughable kindergarten horror, culminating in one of the worst horror film endings i have ever seen in my life. 5/10 for the great first half of this film.",5,0,0,24 September 2017
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A gem
","This movie is extremely underrated to say the least. It is equal to 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Zombieland' when it comes to the comedy/horror genre. Full of clever jokes, misunderstandings and funny parodies of horror movie clichés.This movie just takes everything we have seen in horror/slasher movies and makes fun of it in an awesome way. The whole plot is a whole misunderstanding which makes it absolutely hilarious. The story is original and never seen before, one you would not expect from a movie like this.People tend to pass watching this movie, because from the looks of it it has a lot of gory scenes, brutal kills, but in reality all deaths are silly, laughable accidents that make fun of horror movies. An absolutely genius horror comedy, doesn't matter if you dislike horror, just watch it for the laughs and this movie surely delivers more than a couple of them.",10,1,1,23 December 2015
Django Unchained," A black man on a horse, eh?
","I found this to be a great comedy/western/adventure movie, i don't know if it was meant to be a comedy, but some of the moments were way more enjoyable then those of a casual modern American comedy. Especially the beginning, when Dr. Schultz used his warrant strategy to do whatever he want and bribe them out of all the sticky situations they got in.Leonardo Di Caprio got a very good role for him in this movie, i feel that he is very well suited for a role like this, portraying himself as a wealthy slave owner.Of course what is a western without some impossible 1v50 shootings were the main character doesn't ever get shot, but instead the ''bad guys'' destroyed all the surrounding terrain, yet can't even shot Django once, that was expected and i can't take anything away from that, was cool anyways.",8,1,4,7 December 2014
Get Out," Surprisingly racist premise turned into an anti-racism story
","For the vast majority of this movie you will feel like - what the hell is this extremely racist crap? Literally every conversation throughout the movie has a classic racist cliché vibe, this movie is extremely derogatory towards black people, i would assume there were many easily triggered people who walked out of the theater on premiere.Apart from the insane display of racism the suspense was pretty decent, not too much violence, just tense atmosphere. Overall, the movie is just fine and has a very original story, have not seen anything quite like this, just the execution could have been much better. The ending is definitely extremely surprising, seeing how racist the whole premise of this movie was. An interesting movie worth watching just because it is different and has an interesting outcome, which was completely anti-cliché.",7,10,18,28 October 2017
Good Will Hunting," Worth seeing.
","A movie with great actors, yet an even greater message.Matt Damon's performance in the movie was excellent, loved his character, Will Hunting was a very unusual guy, gifted with a great mind and memory, but dangerously reckless.The message this movie had is still relevant to this day. Anyone can easily screw up their life by simply not knowing what they really want. Usually, you have to make the decision of what you are going to be, early in your life, you are 16 - 20 years old, many people fail to find their way and end up disappointed and unhappy for the rest of their lives. That was the case with Will as well, he didn't really care about his insane math skills and hanged out with complete idiots.Some people need to have someone show them the way, because on many occasions there are very talented people, who are just wasting time on useless studies/things that they don't need or it is just too easy for them.Not to say, you should do whatever someone else tells you to do, but in Will's case he needed some sort of guidance.",9,2,5,2 January 2015
The Game," Gets you tricked every time
","Literally unbelievable, gets you tricked from start to finish, impossible to expect what is going to happen, extravagant ending! Every scene is important in the the story, no filler shots. Each time you watch it you are going to see something yet unseen, but the movie itself is not worth watching more than once, since when you know the huge surprise effect of the film, it is not going to be exciting for you watching it again.Just when you think you got the plot right it turns around again and you have no clue what is about to happen next, that is the most intriguing part of this movie. Nicholas Van Orton gets a chance to get away from his monotone life, he is extremely wealthy, but never gets to experience anything fun or adventurous, well i would not say i found all the troubles he went through fun, but it is a clever way of showing how being rich is not everything.Great acting, very intense, keeps you on your toes throughout, easy to sit through without getting bored. Definitely worth seeing once!",10,1,2,27 October 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Not as bad as people make it out to be
","This is the faith of all movie franchises, that go on for longer than 2-3 movies, and it is really saddening to see how people hate on movies only because they are already so tired of seeing the same stuff. This movie is getting bad reviews and ratings for no reason whatsoever, people are just tired of seeing Pirates of the Caribbean(i am not).You are going into yet another Pirates of the Caribbean film, yet you people expect deep plot twists and serious drama? This movie is supposed to be hilarious, extra-ordinary and simply impossibly fantastic in all of its aspects, it has been like this since the first release and people absolutely loved it. One might argue that Jack Sparrow was portrayed as ''dumb'' here and he was not as witty and clever as we know him, but in reality his performance was great, yes he was not the main man doing 100% of the work here, but still he was great and we should all appreciate him returning after all these years and blessing us with another movie.Of course like always the special effects, the scenery and i can say the whole setup altogether was simply amazing as expected from a movie of this caliber!Was great seeing all the old characters and remembering all the films again, if you are a fan of the franchise - watch it and you will enjoy it despite all the bad reviews and ratings!",8,1,2,6 October 2017
The Illusionist," Quite predictable, but great anyways.
","I don't get why people try to compare the plot twist of this movie to movies like the prestige or memento, the ending part was, at least for me, predictable and didn't shock me at all. The movie itself was awesome and the story was really interesting, the scenery was great, the places where action took part were really thought through and fit really well into the movie. The thing is, with everything looking so real and fascinating, the movie doesn't really have to have an insanely complicated plot or a superb plot twist at the end, it kind of amuses the viewer just by that. Wouldn't suggest to watch this movie after you have watched a very heavy movie with a very complex plot, this movie will not be as interesting and amusing to you, if you do so.",8,1,1,11 November 2014
Elysium," Amazing visual effects, but lacking a good story.
","I have to give this movie at least 6/10 for the amazing visual effects and the beautiful Elysium. Elysium was really awesome looking, a good idea in that matter, everything looked extremely high-tech and the mansions were awesome, unfortunately the movie didn't get much into showing around Elysium.In my opinion the story was not great, it was kind of dull and 100% predictable, not so much action for a sci-fi movie as well. In a movie like this nobody wants to see an old, scared man fighting for a super wealthy high-tech space city, he seems completely irrelevant and was not needed, they could have substituted him with anything else.What bothers me the most about this movie - They show a torn up Los Angeles, and guess what? 99% of the population is Mexican, really? Really, Hollywood? That is very disrespectful, showing a bunch of poor scum living on a destroyed earth and they are all Mexican? That is racist and i just couldn't get along with this idea. Also, everybody on earth is partying, drinking alcohol like 24/7, very few people work, how the hell can they sustain themselves? Where do they get the alcohol, it falls from the sky? That was very illogical too. About spiders base - Yeah a poor, again, Mexican neighbourhood, yet they have space shuttles, that can easily fly to Elysium without a problem, super advanced computers, etc. Yea it is year 2154, but that doesn't make sense whatsoever.",6,0,0,8 December 2014
Groundhog Day," A clever romantic comedy
","A good mix of comedy and clever plotting. Groundhog day is not your regular romantic comedy, it is on a different level of different, to say the least. Very interesting concept, i think many people have imagined what it could be to live the same day over and over again, erasing all your mistakes.In my opinion, the essence of this film is to show everybody, how to better their own lives, Phil was not happy with his life, so living the Groundhog day over and over again taught him what he really wants and needs. And to achieve what you want, in his case, to be with Rita, you need to improve and grow as a person, find yourself via learning new skills, meeting new people, helping somebody out just for the heck of it. And i think that is the reason Phil finally got out of living the groundhog day.Clever, funny, motivating, exciting, just a decent movie for all tastes!",8,1,2,27 November 2015
Reservoir Dogs," I am amazed by the high rating.
","Looking at the high rating of 8,4 and knowing that this is considered one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies i thought i was about to see a great masterpiece. I was absolutely shocked about how terribly boring this movie was. There is no progression in the plot at all, they didn't even show a second of the robbery the movie was about. For the first 50 minutes of the movie the viewer just sits through completely irrelevant and boring scenes, experiences next to no action and just gets bored, since nobody is presented with who is who in the first half of the film. It is impossible to be compassionate for the characters, since you don't even know who they are and all you see is just a bunch of useless drawn-out conversations, using a lot of useless sentences just to add to the screen time, which is only 99 minutes, by the way. The movie uses a lot of excessively drawn-out conversations, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but here it didn't fit, since the screen time is so short, leading into a very boring plot and irrelevant actions. I don't get what people see in this movie, yea the acting is OK, but otherwise, it is just garbage. Is it only because it is Tarantino? Is that everything people need to hear to give a positive review? I get that many people see this movie as ''different'' just to show others they enjoyed it, it would be awesome if everybody wasn't afraid of expressing their opinion and sticking to it.Overall a terrible movie, don't see that as a classic for sure, would not watch again nor recommend it to anybody else. Short, no action, zero plot progression, drawn-out irrelevant conversations, boring.",3,1,3,26 August 2015
Don't Breathe," Ridiculously hypocritical
","Very shocked of the way this movie was delivered as to say the least. Has got to be one of the most hypocritical stories ever. Three kids break into a wealthy blind man's house attempting to steal his fortune. The premise is - 3 kids = bad, poor old blind man = good, yet it gets turned around completely to manifest into the most hypocritical story line i have ever seen in my life.There are a lot of errors in this movie, the blind man is doing things completely impossible for someone with his disability, he is navigating through obstacles with ease fighting people and shooting guns, seemingly he can easily set up complicated structures/ kidnap people too as revealed later. The premise was cool and they should have gone with it, but they chose to completely derail the plot into this mess. The dog was a cool accomplice to the blind guy, but it had inconsistent appearances, it would just randomly disappear and then appear out of nowhere, when convenient for the plot.Aside from all the massive flaws here, the action was somewhat decent, the only thing ruining the vibe is you not understanding who to root for here, because the spotlights keep changing all the time. Had a couple of good fight scenes, especially the ones involving the dog. The ending was somewhat decent, possibly insinuating a sequel, which would have to be insanely impossible knowing how everything ended and the fact the main guy is blind.Overall nothing special, easily forgettable, because of its massive logical flaws and fails. Another great premise poorly executed, sadly.",4,1,2,15 October 2017
Mystic River," Real.
","The reality aspect of the movie, was what i liked the most about it, but the end kind of killed it, since Jimmy murdered Dave for no reason and police didn't do anything about it, Jimmy only did that based on what Dave's wife had told him.The story was quite good, but it focused way too much on the investigators, without going much into depth of Sean's life, the real killers were barely doing anything during the movie and that made it quite dull, when it was found out that those two little boys committed the crime. The movie managed to build suspense and curiosity, but Dave never really looked like he would have been the killer, it focused way too much on him. When watching a movie like this, where a huge focus should be put on all the little things and putting the story together, some deeper character involvement is necessary, for example, the Savage brothers seamed like a very interesting couple, on whom the movie's plot could have expanded, it would be more complex and interesting. Their background or further involvement could have been a great substitute for some of pointless conversations of the investigators.It is a great crime movie, set in a good place, interesting to watch, if you take out some of the illogical actions and flaws.",7,0,0,2 January 2015
A Beautiful Mind," A realistic movie, makes you think.
","Only very few people can really relate to this movie, but the direction of this movie shows how it is to be mentally ill, makes you feel for the character and makes you believe things he is seeing are actually real and not only his imagination. Although, i would have loved to see more in - depth details about his work and the actual things he is doing research on, not only showing all of his walls of every office being covered in papers and strings. The character of his supervisor and his best friend seemed extremely real and i bet you it is impossible to even imagine that they are his imagination before it gets layed out for you.",9,1,2,22 November 2014
The Witch," Stellar scenery and amazing atmosphere!
","Do not go into this movie expecting horror or gore, this is movie is all about the atmosphere, calm and mellow at times, but surely intense enough throughout. Absolutely stunning imagery and scenery all throughout the film a it is set in a 1630's forest. The movie does not solely revolve around withcraft and magic as the title might lead one to believe, it takes a rather different approach giving us insight into the heavy religious influence in the 17th century. Overall, the movie has a great vibe to it, watching a film like this makes you forget about the usual appeals of horror/thriller movies as you easily get sucked into the atmosphere of this movie even without much crazy and intense action you are feeling the rising tension between the close-knit family as the eldest daugther becomes suspected as a witch. Note that there is an enourmous religious prejudice and bias in this movie as it is all about god worship and being an obedient person living out god's will. If you have a problem with the heavy religious tone this movie has, i would suggest not watching it, because i can understand how redundant that can get at times. A really relaxing, but tense film, that is worth watching for many different reasons, do not expect gore or horror as i have said above, enjoy the sound effects, beautiful imagery and the usage of old english, which is rather rare in movies and art nowadays!",8,4,7,14 July 2018
12 Years a Slave," No action whatsoever
","Alright, by saying this movie has no action, of course, this kinda movie won't really have the same action as a movie about super heroes. But there was literally nothing interesting about this movie, it was very slow paced, with only a couple of good scenes. Although the movie was incredibly well filmed and had great scenery, landscapes and everything from that aspect was very well taken care of. But the story as a whole didn't really seem appealing. The ending was kinda random as well, wanted to see more in-depth background of the slave owners, maybe other slaves, but it was only centered around Solomon, which is fine, but for a movie that long, it gets a little bit too boring and hard to sit-through. The story could have been way more diverse, hence making the movie more complex and so straight forward, after watching it you literally have nothing to think about, just like .. meh, a cool movie.",5,3,6,8 November 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson's best movie.
","One of the few movies everyone should see, an incredible masterpiece. It had some funny moments and some very sad and touching moments as well, the movie succeeded to deliver both fun and sadness.Jack Nicholson showed how great of an actor he is in this movie, this should be a great example for young actors, If you think Jack was amazing in The Shining, his performance here was seriously the best of the best. And not only him, you can see many very talented actors in the movie, Danny DeVito was just awesome, despite it being one of his first big movies.The end was very unexpected, but it is understandable why they needed to that to Murphy, he was being too hard to deal with, so the only thing left for them was to lobotomize Murphy and make him into a vegetable, Chief was feeling sorry for his friend and put him out of his misery at the end, leaving him as the only one who escaped at the end. Murphy almost managed to change Billy's life, it was clear that after having an intercourse with Candy, Billy was feeling way better, that gave him hope, he was not scared like he usually was, but nurse Ratched scared him again, which lead to him committing suicide and Murphy not escaping the hospital. That was a great message, which showed that not always treatment at mental hospitals and just talking to doctors who do not care about is the way out, a guy, who just showed everyone how fun life can be, changed Billy's life for a moment, if only billy had been stronger to surpass the mental barrier nurse Ratched had set up for him.Really, Murphy killed himself for nothing, he was not crazy, OK not for nothing, he changed Chief's mind, which lead to Chief escaping, but other than that, he gave his life for nothing, the hospital got the better of him.",10,2,3,7 January 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise at his best.
","Edge of Tomorrow is original, clever, interesting, funny at times and does not treat you like a dummie, who only wants to see monsters and sci-fi. Tom Cruise was just outstanding here, i do not care what people say about him, he was great here and that is something no one can take away from him.Unlike most sci-fi action movies, Edge of Tomorrow makes you think along and feel the suspense. First part of the film seems to be comic, showing how Cage learns how to use his powers properly, while endlessly surprising people over and over again with knowing exactly what is going to happen. I was surprised about how good this movie actually was, effects were awesome, acting was definitely on point and plot was not as blatant as i expected it to be, a perfect blockbuster movie of 2014.This movie delivered on every aspect - i was entertained, i laughed, i was on ''edge'' a couple of times and overall i just enjoyed it. It is not a coincidence this movie has a rating of 7,9, which is very high for and action movie. Do not pass this one, you will enjoy it!",10,0,2,8 November 2015
Whiplash," Just loved it!
","Could have never thought that a movie about music can be so breath taking and thrilling, throughout the movie i just felt intense, there wasn't a point where it lost its intensity. A fantastic journey of a young and extremely determined drummer who goes through trial and error with his obsessive mentor. The way Fletcher taught his students maybe seems a bit too harsh etc., but that is the journey of being truly the best and the greatest in something, you need to completely devote your life to it. Andrew completely devoted his life to being the best drummer he could be and despite Fletcher treating him like a complete thrash, he went back to being in Fletcher's band and eventually showing him how great he really is.I love how this movie solely focuses on Fletcher and Andrew, it is all about Andrew being the best drummer possible. The viewers do not get distracted with other people's stories and problems. An excellent part of the movie was Andrew's decision to break up with his newly acquired girlfriend Nicole, just to pursue his drumming carrier, many people, especially, feminists are probably going to dislike this, but it was there just for the purpose of showing that you have to sacrifice a lot to get to the highest point, in my opinion, it fitted really well into the movie. For a second, when Andrew started to have interest in this girl, i was worried that the great plot would get over-taken by a laughable and dull relationship, which you can see in every other movie out there. Thank god none of that happened and they didn't spend a lot of the screen time on that.Definitely an awesome watch! I recommend it to everybody, even those like myself who think movies about music are boring, i was wrong in this case for sure!",10,2,4,12 August 2015
Prometheus," Massive plot holes.
","This movie has very many flaws and kind of poorly shows what was really going on. What does the black slime exactly do? Creates lives, destroys DNA? It looks like the writers don't even know what was it supposed to do.How the hell did they find the place so fast? They are on an unknown planet, never been there before, yet they find everything so fast and land incredibly smoothly. They find a huge green gemstone on a platform and nobody even says a word about it? Really? Clearly it was important, since it was on a golden platform. When they land, there is a perfect road in front of them leading right to the huge building, after a brief moment there is a huge storm, so how the hell can a road like that be so clear for 2000 years, if the planet has insane storms all the time, the road would be long gone and not able to see for sure.It looks like the directors nowadays think that having incredible special effects and good looking landscapes can make up for the bad plot holes, on the contrary, more interesting plot is always better than fancy images.The way some of the characters acted was way off too, Weylands daughter was this super important person on the ship, yet she didn't do anything, she didn't have any impact whatsoever, all she did was pointlessly yell, a completely irrelevant character in the movie. Also, Fifield snaps easily after one comment, yet when confronted by a snake - like monster coming out from the black slime, it is all cool and no emotions are shown? Yeah, some of the scenes were good and really sparked the interest a little bit for a while, but with an idea like this for a movie, they could have made it way clearer and more interesting than this.",5,2,4,14 December 2014
Blow," Impressive
","Yes, it is awesome. it is exciting, but most importantly it is real. ''Blow'' is all about George Jung, played by Johnny Depp, a drug dealer, who rises to heights, starting with marijuana and moving on to being one of the greatest cocaine smugglers to ever live. This is one of those movies based on a true story, that is actually really interesting and has you on your toes throughout.The movie does a great job making the viewer feel compassion for a drug dealing criminal, towards the end it gets really emotional and you feel sad for the life George Jung has lead and how he ends up.I love the flow of this movie, the story is unfolding at a steady pace. i fell that the director did a great job of correctly displaying the transformation of George over the years.George got screwed so many times, it's not even funny, all his friends betrayed him, eventually, everyone, literally, everyone he knew left him rotting in prison. Shows how the drug industry is, you are never really friends when it comes to business and huge amounts of money.",9,2,3,7 October 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Just brilliant
","After watching it, i was simply stunned. It is seriously magnificent, this film has so many awesome qualities to it. It is deep, thrilling, full of suspense, has super interesting characters, especially, Hannibal Lecter.Could very well be the best crime/thriller movie ever made, there really are no movies, you could compare it to, it is unique and elegant in a different way. Dr. Lecter(Anthony Hopkins) truly is an unforgettable character and his conversations with inspector Clarice(Jodie Foster) were the best thing in this movie for sure. There is a reason Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, both(!!!) won an Oscar for this film, not to mention The Silence of the Lambs has 5 Oscars to its name altogether, surely the best movie of 1991.Doesn't matter what kind of movies you are into, you will thoroughly enjoy The Silence of the Lambs, it just has too many outstanding qualities, that it should be impossible to dislike this and even if there are any flaws, you will not notice them, since they get overshadowed by the super interesting and suspense storyline.",10,4,8,6 December 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Shallow and empty.
","On of those films that you eagerly sit through waiting for the ''good part'' to start and then it ends and you get nothing, no thrill, no suspense, no emotions. Empty. One of the worst endings i have seen in my life, seriously how did the people behind this movie decide to make the ending that way? This movie was anticipated to be extremely controversial and over the top in many ways, i for one did not witness any of those.The premise was kind of interesting and the first half of the film was not as bad, i was actually thinking - wow, maybe this is not going to be as horrible as almost every reviewer here have deemed, unfortunately they were right and the second part and the ending just affirmed my low expectations for this movie. The biggest problem was that the movie did not ''grow'' as the time passed, it just stayed the same throughout, hence it wasn't enjoyable. Also the songs and soundtracks chosen for various scenes were just horrible and didn't fit at all with what was happening at the time.Some people dislike the movie, because, in their opinion, it is derogatory towards women and since it is a widely known mainstream movie it reaches out to many people, it could harm the relationships of men and women, ehh just some classic feminist ranting, i simply disliked this film, since everything was off as i stated above and i did not find this controversial or shocking in any way. The only emotion i had during this film was boredom, because of its linear plot and slow pace.I only wanted to watch this, because from what i had heard, the over-whelming majority of women really liked it, however the majority of men i know thought it was thrash. In my opinion, this is due to the fact that women really enjoyed seeing a normal woman being put on a ''pedestal'' by a very wealthy and handsome young man, who can give her everything in exchange for sexual pleasure, despite that casual women don't usually like bdsm, they were ready to put that aside just to care for the sad and love seeking woman. Men on the other hand, although, on paper this should be a movie most men would love, disliked it, because it just did not meet their expectations, just like it was in my case. Lets get real for a second. Nobody wants to sit through two hours of nothingness just see a couple of poorly thought through sex scenes, which were promised to be super controversial. Men just rather watch regular porn, i would get if it would have something else to, interesting plot, etc., but unfortunately there was just that.Is worth watching it? No.",2,3,5,22 November 2015
Identity," Clever and mysterious
","Yes, this movie definitely is clever and plays a few tricks on you, but somehow i was able to figure this one out quite a bit before everything was revealed, so i wouldn't say it is extremely unpredictable and complicated. At the end everything gets laid out for the viewer, well at least if you are willing to think for a second. Not saying the blatant layout is labeling this movie as bad, it isn't that horrible and the ending is quite impressive.The whole concept was enjoyable, wasn't a poor slasher movie with gory kills, had great share of suspense and mystery to it. Some likable characters, especially Ed(John Cusack), acting was decent overall. Succeeds to deliver the thrills, makes you brainstorm in midst of the action. Definitely the essence of the film wasn't anything original and never seen before, however the way it got played out was quite unique and i liked it very much.A decent psychological/mystery thriller, fans of the genre will enjoy this, so don't pass this one up!",8,1,1,26 December 2015
Lucy," Good science fiction.
","Oh, the famous - ''people use only 10% of their brain capacity'' hypothesis made into a movie. Expected the movie to be worse than it was, started out as a regular movie about drug trafficking, but soon enough bursted into something else.Of course, the movie can't be bad when you have Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. Scarlett was as great as always and Morgan Freeman again showed up with him being a wise, old man.yeah, of course the movie was incredibly unreal, but it is great to imagine how would it be to be able to use 100% of your brain capacity and this movie does the trick for that. At least they explained what the drug was and how it develops in a human's body. Although, i would have loved to see some deeper inside look of how the drug was made and some more information about Richard and Lucy. It would be great if the movie picked up where it started only 15 minutes after, the audience would be confronted with some background of the characters and the drug itself.",8,4,10,16 December 2014
The Sixth Sense," A powerful movie.
","The last ten minutes really made this movie make sense, before the movie was over, i already jumped to conclusions and thought - oh, this movie seems completely illogical, since nobody ever speaks to Malcolm, Cole's mom didn't even hire him nor there were any conversations between them. Also he never had a conversation with his wife where she really spoke to him. An unusual movie for Bruce Willis, because he was in this movie i was unsure whether i wanted to see this or not, luckily i did and his performance didn't disappoint me, in my opinion, definitely one of his greatest movies. Also for a Kid actor Haley Joel Osment's acting was superb, he was incredibly mature throughout the movie, despite him being so young. It is not really made clear whether Cole knew Malcolm was dead or not, Malcolm was the only ghost Cole wasn't scared of and the only one who could help him. Through helping Cole, Malcolm found his path and accepted his death.",8,0,2,2 December 2014
The Purge," Illogical actions.
","The idea of the movie is awesome and it could be executed in a great way making a really interesting and thrilling movie, but The Purge, unfortunately, doesn't make up for all its flaws by just the great idea behind it. So, why would a blood thirsty gang of youngsters, who have formed a gang especially to break mayhem and kill during The Purge be waiting such a long time outside doing nothing, while, the precious time they have is running out, just to kill one black man who is hiding inside of a secure house? Seems completely stupid and takes a lot of valueable time out of the time and makes it obsolete. Also, they way family acts. Everyone except the father is plainly stupid, they have no common sense whatsoever and they value one random black guys's life more than their family, their expensive house and their own lives.",4,1,1,23 November 2014
The Truman Show," Like no other.
","The Truman Show is an extra ordinary movie, to say the least, it revolves around Truman, who has no clue that all his actions have been recorded since the day he was born. Things start to get out of control for the show, when Truman starts finding out about the reality of his life.Jim Carrey was just perfect in his role, definitely one of his top movies, a shame he didn't end up winning an Oscar for this movie. Apart from that, i found it very interesting how other actors interacted around Truman, it feels as he should have got the hints of his life being a TV show much sooner, but of course it is just a movie.I think that the movie could have been longer and more detailed, it was just an awesome film, but more plot could have made it way better. It's sad that they didn't show Truman after he left the show, but it guess that wasn't possible because they couldn't film him anymore, because he was off the set. I loved the idea, they wanted to create a perfect life for a person, where they don't get to get in trouble and can just live peacefully, if it wasn't for Sylvia, Truman probably wouldn't have escaped the set ever. It almost made me believe by his last line, that Truman knew all along, that it was a show and he is the star of it, or did he know? That's a question i haven't seen explained anywhere.Nonetheless, a great watch, perfect idea, maybe it had some flaws, like almost all the movies do, but still - something different and interesting, that makes you think.",8,0,0,26 July 2015
Looper," Quite enjoyable, but fails at its own logic
","In my opinion if you want to make a brain teaser like this then you have to pay attention to all the smallest details, but unfortunately i do not think writers had that on their menu that day. The movie breaks its own rules when it comes to time travelling, the ending of the movie is completely impossible if we take into consideration their rules for time travelling and what happens when someone dies. When Joe shoots himself at the end, the only thing that happens is his future self disappearing. But according to what we have seen during the film, everything should have changed, if Joe killed himself, that situation out there in the field should have never happened, therefore it could not have affected the Rainmaker kid and his mother, so the grand finale itself is completely irrelevant.Otherwise it was not that bad, was fun and enjoyable at times, acting was fairly decent and it was not boring. Bruce Willis had his classic tough guy role pleasing the viewers with one of his usual rampages 1vs20 wiping everyone out. I thought we are going to see the ''future'' as well and why this whole mafia thing is actually happening, but they did not even bother showing a single glimpse of that by just simply shaking it off as an irrelevant fact at the start of the film.Could have had way more interesting details, a look in the future/mafia actions and so on. Nonetheless for people who like mindfucky films this is something you must watch before you think anything of it, because many people actually do like it and they see nothing wrong with the flaws i mentioned above!",5,1,1,18 October 2016
Annihilation," Logic Non-existant
","I don't usually talk about logic when it comes to sci-fi movies like this, but this was just too stupid. No, don't even start with this movie being deep and thought-provoking or somehow a psychological masterpiece, it is none of that. This movie consists of one completely illogical action after the other. If this was a somewhat real setting all the characters would be dead within 5 minutes of entering the ''shiver''. I simply can't fathom how can you have an amazing premise like this and run it down the drain by an absolutely idiotic and illogical plot. At this point i am starting to think Hollywood is doing this on purpose, there is no other explanation. There's heaps of precedents to learn from, there's an over-whelming amount of knowledge on creating films and writing stories within Hollywood, there's amazing actors like Natalie Portman starring in this movie and still it comes out absolutely horrible, how can this happen? And this is not only the case with this film, almost everything coming out now is an absolute load of bullcrap, as if these movies are getting made for 3 year olds to look at the funky imagery, really disappointed. Yes, you could argue that the scenery was outstanding and beautifully done throughout, i won't deny that, the cinematographers have done their job right, atleast, but by no means does that make up for the enormous plot holes and absolutely non-existant logic in this movie. This movie really reminds me of ''Gravity'', which had the same thing going on, amazing graphics with an extremely weak plot. The only way to enjoy this film is having it play in the background while you are doing something just to catch a glimpse of the funky scenery once in a while, if you are someone who likes to analyze and thoroughly understand movies, this is surely not for you, as soon as you begin watching questions of confusion will arise and they will never stop until the ending, which is really weak too, the ''twist'' if you can even call it that is so pathetic a toddler would laugh at it. 3/10 for the cinematographic achievement.",3,1,3,26 August 2018
The Breakfast Club," All different, yet so similar.
","This movie was a great example of how people can set their differences aside, despite their backgrounds, everyone can find a way to relate to each other in one way or another.The movie depicted 5 very different people with a lot of free time on their hands, that made them interact with each other no matter what. Even the biggest asshole can become your friend at the end, and despite his inappropriate and obnoxious behaviour.A great glimpse of the 80's, nothing too fancy, just a good movie about life and how important it is to be an individual, yet have the ability to express your opinions and feelings to others, maybe people not so close to you, because the people close to you can put too much pressure on you and maybe sometimes it is just easier to share your troubles with strangers, than to keep it to yourself.",7,0,0,23 December 2014
Law Abiding Citizen," Ohh, the ending :/
","Up to the last 10 minutes of the movie i was like - oh, this is definitely a 10/10 movie, builds great suspense, extremely grasping and has you on your toes all the time. But then all of that just had to be wasted at the end. All the suspense built up was just gone.I can safely say this is the greatest movie with a lack luster ending i have ever seen. I was constantly thinking - why does this movie have a rating of 7.4? This is an awesome movie! Now i understand why and agree with the 7.4. Aside from that it is a great movie, a mastermind trapped into a solitary committing terrible killings, constantly tricking everybody, so everything goes just as he had planned. I get why it had to be like that, after all it is a Hollywood movie, it was all about a man fighting against the system alone, nobody is going to condone showing somebody destroy the law system of the USA, let alone if it is done by a single person. They just had to let the dumb cops somehow trick Clyde and give him a dose of his own medicine in the end.Still 8/10, since the majority of the movie was really great, an awesome thriller. Had awesome lines from Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler), an astounding performance here by Gerard Butler.",8,0,0,21 August 2015
V for Vendetta," ''Ideas are bulletproof''
","An amazing movie, a must watch definitely, of course a little bit unreal, but the idea is just awesome. Many people focus more on trying to figure out who V actually was, but that does not matter.V had gone through some incredibly difficult times, he wanted to bring back hope to the people and make so people would be in charge of the government(a.k.a the perfect democracy) and not the other way around as it was in the fascistic England. I think it is a great choice not to reveal V's identity, because it leaves you curious, if they would have shown his face, it would just be flat and dull.Also the movie had a great plot twist, and not your typical end of the movie plot twist, that suddenly changes everything. When Evey was thrown in a cell and treated like crap, she didn't confess and tell anything about V, the way he had set up the environment was awesome, and the letters Evey read in the cell opened up a whole another possible outcome of the movie and made everyone question who V is even more. Then when she finally wasn't afraid and embraced her death sentence, V let her out and completely changed her life with that experience, he wanted to show her what it is like to suffer and be fearless.The movie had some funny moments too, which kinda eased the tension a little bit and it was just what was needed. A great movie, 10/10.",10,1,3,16 December 2014
