Howl's Moving Castle," Excellent Movie
","This movie was a gift for my two children from and Aunt. I have watched it with them twice in the past few days. It is absolutely wonderfully captivating and romantic. I am a grown woman and I fell in love with the character of Howl. There is something about his voice that is every woman's dream---a man that will protect what he loves. Right away you view Sophi, a timid but kindhearted girl working in her family's hat shop, playing it safe and watching her mother hobnob with the rich crowd in town. Suddenly, you are bedazzled as she is swept off her feet by a handsome wizard who protects her from some would-be harmful men. Her life completely changes from there. This movie grabs you and pulls you in!---and I never thought I would be saying that about an anime. Mr. Miyazaki (Director) always seems to outdo himself! I definitely recommend this movie and Spirited Away, too, if you have never seen that.",10,3,5,30 March 2006
