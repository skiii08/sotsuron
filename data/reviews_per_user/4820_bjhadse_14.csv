The King's Speech," An Excellent, If Overrated, Film.
","The film is about the Duke of York (Colin Firth) who, following the death of his father (Michael Gambon) and the abdication of the throne by his elder brother (Guy Pearce), would be king. The problem with Albert (later King George VI), however, is that he has a debilitating stammer that prevents him from fronting the regal presence of his predecessors. After a series of failures with other speech therapists, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) takes him to the controversial Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush): a man who, despite no formal training or credentials, has achieved miraculous results (particularly with shell-shocked veterans of the first world war). Despite fictitious beginnings, the two men grow close as they conquer the soon-to-be King's speech impediment.'The King's Speech' is an exemplary show of acting. Colin Firth rightly deserved his Oscar for Best Actor, given his convincing (yet not overbearing) performance as King George VI. This might sound like a mere compliment, but it is really much more. Sean Penn (in 2001's 'I Am Sam') gave an unbearably over-the-top and unrealistic (if emotionally engaging) performance as an autistic single father. There, the acting was obvious artifice: obtrusive and painful to watch. Colin Firth avoids the pitfalls of portraying an individual with abnormalities while offering a realistic and engaging performance. Sometimes emotional, other times fiercely reserved, Firth never fails to be an entrancing and sympathetic figure.Colin Firth isn't the only outstanding performance in 'The King's Speech.' Geoffrey Rush also adds his entrancing presence to the film, creating the Merlin-esque Lion Logue through his striking minimalistic acting. Michael Gambon (popularly known for his portrayal of Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series) gives two great performances in the film: first, as the regal and dominating King George V (who has grown impatient with his eldest son's moral failings and his youngest son's oratory failings) and second as the infirmed and Alzheimer-ridden King in his later years. Both performances are given with a commendably stark realism. Jack Pearce gives and enchanting performance of the charismatic King Edward VIII: the man who abdicates the throne in order to marry for love. Although generally charming and captivating, in a brief yet memorable scene he darkly mocks his younger brother for his stutter and presumed lust for the throne. Helena Bonham Carter further lends her stoic and refined presence to Queen Elizabeth, the supportive and loving wife of King George VI.At times comic and at others grave, 'The King's Speech' is story not merely of an individual, but of a budding friendship, a sometimes-estranged family and a nation at the brink of war. It goes without saying that speech therapists will love this movie. Fans of historical dramas will also find this a pleasure to watch. While the editing is more slowly paced than I would have preferred and the film considerably overrated, it is nonetheless of exceptional quality.",7,0,0,23 September 2011
Frost_Nixon," A More than Capable Film that Takes a Little Too Long to Get Moving
","In 1972, several staff members of Richard Nixon's campaign are arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Convention's headquarters at the Watergate Office Complex. In 1974, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigned as president. In 1977, British journalist and TV personality David Frost (Michael Sheen) conducts a series of twelve interviews with Richard Nixon concerning his actions as president. Forced to self-finance the $2 million endeavor, Frost and staff members Bob Zelnick (Oiver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) seek to hold Nixon's feet to the fire and give him the trial that the American people were denied by President Ford's pardon.'Frost/Nixon' (2008) is an excellently acted character drama. Frank Langella gives what is easily one of the most convincing performances of the year, deserving of every accolade and scrap of praise that he has earned with it. He gives an exquisite portrayal of the former president, capturing his every nuance and intricacy. Michael Sheen, masked in a shroud of easy charisma, reenacts the personable man-about-town David Frost. While Sheen fails completely transform into Frost in the same way that Langella succeeded as Nixon, he delivers a nonetheless commendable performance.The film takes the same excessive liberties with the facts surrounding the Frost/Nixon interviews that Richard Nixon took with the office of the presidency. In of itself this isn't anything peculiar. The problem arises, however, is Ron Howard's choice to juxtapose the progressing plot of the film with documentary-esque interviews of those involved in the Frost/Nixon interviews. This creates a heightened and unjustified sense of authenticity concerning the depicted events, especially alongside the 'documentation' of the Frost/Nixon interviews themselves. While there is nothing wrong with taking creative license in order to heighten the dramatic qualities of a historical drama, what Ron Howard engages in through these Moore-esque techniques is borders on the unethical.Despite these extreme discrepancies in historic fact, as well as the excessively long buildup to the final interview session (an hour and on half), 'Frost/Nixon' is a well-executed, engaging and ultimately successful film. It grants a degree of closure to an unresolved American trauma. Fans of Nixon-era and post-Nixon era politics, as well as dialog-driven dramas, will enjoy this film.",7,0,0,6 October 2011
The Town," Starts with a Bang, Ends with a Whimper.
","Four childhood friends - Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Dez Elden (Owen Burke) - rob a bank in the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, kidnapping bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) in the process. They release her after the heist (but not before stealing her license and promising that they would rape and kill her if she went to the police). MacRay befriends Claire in an attempt to learn more about the FBI investigation surrounding the robbery, eventually falling in love with her. After a botched armored car robbery in North Boston, MacRay tells his boss - crime lord Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) - that he's retiring to Florida. After making a few not-so-thinly veiled threats, he convinces MacRay to do one last job for him.For the life of me, I can't understand the critical acclaim that this film has acquired (it currently holds a 94% 'certified fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was listed on the AFI's list of the top ten films from 2010). Despite Ben Affleck's surprisingly slick direction and several briskly paced action scenes (each featuring a unique set of disguises), the film is ultimately a victim of its own horrendous writing (proving once and for all how little input Affleck had on 1997's 'Good Will Hunting').The film's greatest writing concern is its inability to reasonably suspend the disbelief in the audience. While it seems reasonable to take a hostage to ensure a safe getaway from a bank heist, I don't believe for a second that anybody - especially one of the abductors - would think it reasonable to date the abductee. As that is seemingly the moral crux of the film (a case for MacRay's changed life-style and ultimate redemption), the entire production collapses at the failure of that premise.The denouement of the film attempts to show Claire betraying MacCray by setting him up to be arrested when he comes to visit her (much in the same tradition as 2009's 'Pubic Enemies'). Unlike its immediate antecedent, however, the supposed betrayal is completely unwarranted by the script. The film opens with MacCray kidnapping her at gunpoint, stealing her driver's license and threatening to rape and kill her if she went to the police. The stress caused by this incident causes her to leave her job. Then her abductor begins a prolonged intimate relationship with her. Her proximity to him so soon after the robbery causes her to become suspect in the FBI's eyes (it's not difficult to imagine her as an inside conspirator for the four actual robbers). The film then has the borderline-offensive audacity to paint her - a genuine victim - as a traitor against the implicitly noble MacRay.Fans of heist films will find this to be a more-or-less worthy addition to the genre. Likewise, those in accordance with the nation's critical heartbeat will find the film more than agreeable. As for the rest, however, this is a tired, clich√©d and thread-bare film unworthy of the acclaim that it has generated.",4,0,3,2 October 2011
The Thing," An Admirable, Yet Generally Average Film.
","R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) is a helicopter pilot stationed at a US research facility in Antarctica along with ten other researchers and staff members. While prepping for a pending snowstorm, the team encounters a group of Norwegans desperately shooting at a lone sled dog. In the ensuing scuffle, the Norwegans both die and the dog is adopted by the Americans. It turns out, however, that the dog was really an alien lifeform capable of disguising itself as any living creature it 'samples' and spread like a virus to other organisms. Now the team is being picked of one by one, and anybody could be a 'Thing.' Despite the familiar and generally worn down plot, 'The Thing' boasts some of the better visual effects ever caught on film. The depiction of 'The Thing,' especially as it mutates from a seemingly mundane source (a dog or a average-looking human) is nothing short of nightmarish. Most times it comes off as a mix between a zombie and a spider, although at others it more ambitiously sports an extensively twisted, tortured-looking face, rows of unnaturally-placed teeth and other Hellish details. The hollow, soulless moans that the transforming Things give out is genuinely unsettling, moreso than any mere scream could achieve.The arctic setting perfectly expresses the sense of isolation and hopelessness that the titular Thing thrives in. Carpenter realizes a near 'Shining' level of isolation through the film's bleak, unending whiteness (sharply juxtaposed against the night sky). Even during brightly lit daytime scenes, Carpenter never fails to create an atmospheric sense of unease.Kurt Russel does a commendable job in the lead role. While nothing exceptional in its own right, it does get the job done here. Keith David is an actor that I'm never disappointed to see. Even if he's not a particularly talented individual, he has a commanding presence on screen that makes him something of a poor man's Samuel L. Jackson.Despite excellent visuals and solid direction, the film never really rises beyond simply being average. It's entertaining more than anything, which can hardly be considered a bad thing. Fans of science fiction or horror alike will enjoy this eery, effects-laden remake of the original 1951 film.",6,5,8,24 September 2011
No Strings Attached," Natalie Portman's (Lack of) Wardrobe is the Only Redeeming Factor to This Overly-Derivative Romantic Comedy.
","This movie follows the sexual trists of Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman). Adam's life is falling apart: his father (Kevin Kline) is dating his ex (Ophelia Lovibond) and his writing career is going nowhere. He hooks up with Emma, who has a phobia of dating and they agree to continue seeing each other in a series of one-night stands. Things get complicated, however, when they begin developing feelings for each other North of their belt-lines.The problem with this movie is its trite treatment of the tired convention of the romantic comedy. In essence, it comes off of a caricature of the genre. It has all the awkwardness of 'Stage Beauty' (2004), but none of its excellence. Jilted, uncomfortable dialog (such as 'Boo! Here comes my dick.') and genuinely off-putting situations (such as the scene in which Adam makes a menstrual-themed mix tape while Emma and her three roommates, one of whom is male, bemoan that their menstrual cycles have synced up).The film's on redeeming factor was that Natalie Portman is hot and barely clothed throughout the 108 minute run time. While this was certainly an engagement of sorts, it's hardly cinematic. Only the most die-hard fan of romantic comedies will enjoy the same thinly-stretched plot-points that they've seen time and time again. For everybody else, however, this derivative and generally unpalatable romantic comedy is an easy pick to pass up.",3,11,14,20 September 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The Chimpshank Redemption
","Gen-Sys is a pharmaceutical company whose star employee, Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco), is developing a cure to Alzheimer's using chimpanzees as the test subjects. When a chimp named Bight Eyes goes on a rampage (and is shot), Rodman's supervisor (David Oyelowo) orders that all the chimps are to be euthanized. Guilted by a coworker, Rodman takes Bright Eyes' baby (Andy Serkis) home, raising him with the help of his Alzheimer's-ridden father (John Lithgow). The chimp, named Caesar, proves to be remarkably intelligent (due to the experimental serum given to his mother during his gestation). After Caesar attacks one of Rodman's neighbors, however, he is detained in an abusive animal sanctuary, where he determines to fight back against his oppressive human jailers.'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' does more than give us another exquisitely rendered Andy Serkis performance dressed up in flawless CG (although that is a major plus for the film). Not since 'Outbreak' (1995) has there been a better apocalyptic virus film that didn't involve zombies or vampires (ie, '28 Days Later' and 'I Am Legend'). The virus' spread is understated (shown briefly during the film before becoming the focus during the en credits). This footnote conveys the narrative necessity to connect 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' with its inevitable slew of sequels while not cramming it needlessly into the body of the film.Had the movie been shot in an ever-so-slightly different way, it would have made an excellent (and likely superior) sci-fi horror movie. It wouldn't have taken all that much extra, either: had they shot some daytime scenes as night scenes (particularly the simian uprising) with heavy low-key lightning, had there been more careful attention to the film's mise-en-scene (such as when Caesar silently watches his former human 'parents' in their sleep), had there been a more carefully built sense of suspense and had they shown more and gorier human deaths (skewered by the simians' 'spears,' bludgeoned with make-shift clubs, decapitated with manhole covers, pummeled by ape fists).That said, the action in the film itself (other than pulling away before nearly every human's death) was excellent. The scene on the Golden Gate Bridge was riveting and well-choreographed, especially as Caesar emerged from the smog on horseback (perhaps the film's most memorable moment). The climactic Ape uprising scene sprawls a great number of San Francisco tourist attractions that anybody even passably knowledgeable about the area would know, notably The Golden Gate Bridge, Twin Peaks, The San Francisco Zoo and Muir Woods. These extraordinary details gives the film a great deal more character than the typical action movie.One extremely enjoyable aspect of the film is the reverence that it plays to previous films in the series. The first hyper-intelligent chimp is named Bright Eyes, a clear homage to Charlton Heston's the ape-given name in the first film. The famous line 'get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty apes' likewise made a cameo appearance in the mouth of Tom Felton. News clips throughout the movie describe a manned flight to Mars aboard The Icarus (the same name as Charlton Heston's ship in the original film) that later disappears (a newspaper shows the headline 'Lost in Space').'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is an excellent action and science fiction film that fans of either genre (or of the original series) should enjoy with gusto. One can only hope that the film's sequels will be equally well-crafted.",7,2,4,26 September 2011
Kick-Ass," An Acceptably Average Action-Comedy.
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) always wanted to be a super hero. For the life of him he couldn't understand why nobody ever tried to be one. A few online purchases (and a whole lot of nerve) later, and he's become 'Kick-Ass.' After a few unsuccessful bouts of crime-fighting, he becomes an internet sensation, inspiring a slew of equally flamboyant superheroes to take to the streets.I neither understand the incredible critical praise nor the stern moral condemnation that this film has received. It struck me as neither good or lewd enough to illicit either response. Yes, the language was very, very foul, yes it glorified violence (especially in pre-teens) and yes it did, at least to some degree, sexualize an eleven year old actress (although it did so more comedically than seriously, given that Hit girl being 'hot' was the punchline of at least one joke). The language was no worse than any number of other movies, only this time they came from a little girl. That too was part of the film, that such vulgarity came from such an unlikely source. As for glorifying violence, it is a super-hero movie, after all. It's simply following genre expectations. While I will admit that it was at times a little extreme (when Big Daddy and Hit girl handcuff a man to a car, put him in a running car compacter), it does so in its capacity as a comedy (presenting a caricature of Batman-esque violence). In short, it doesn't transgress arbitrary moral boundaries any more than any number of other films have already done.As for the praise, I just don't see why. The movie was entertaining, but that was all. The plot, while functional, was more than a little uninspired: Dave and Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) get together because she thinks that he's gay and always wanted a gay best friend. The acting oscillates from perfectly average (mot of the main characters) to completely inept (most of the minor characters). The dialog was jilted and awkward, even by the standard of teen romances; Aaron Johnson and Lyndsy Fonseca have a unique anti-chemistry between them that just doesn't get the job done. These flaws might not sink the film, but it does little more than keep it afloat.For all of its negative qualities, however, it does accurately portray the cult-like fascination modern culture has with superheroes (even the most incompetent of them): meme-like fandom followed by a plethora of imitators. It gives us, if nothing else, a pathetic lens through which we can view what our own dreams of super heroism would look like.The film's apropos use music and genuinely impressive fight choreography are perhaps its most strikingly positive qualities. Their conjunctive use, however, create a lackluster tension between comedy and action. Sadly, the film never really excels in either genre. Fans of most contemporary comedies, superhero culture and perhaps mass communication as well should find 'Kick-Ass' at least passingly enjoyable.",5,1,6,23 September 2011
The Hangover Part II," Pretty Average Comedy (ie, Better Than Expected)
","Despite the shameless recycling of the first movie's plot (concerning a bachelor party gone horribly wrong). The Hangover Part II proved to be just as raucously hilarious and enjoyable. This time around, it's Stew's turn to get married (to Lauren, played by an absolutely gorgeous Jamie Chung). The only thing between him and wedded bliss is an unduly hostile father-in- law, his friends' insistence on throwing him a bachelor party (which clearly worked out so well the first time around) and a sixteen hour flight to Thailand.After a seemingly quiet bachelor party (a six-pack and a a couple bags of marshmallows by a small beach-side bonfire), the Wolfpack (sans Doug, who's brunching at the hotel after leaving the party early in the night) wakes up in sleazy Bangkok hotel. A quick survey of their surroundings shows Stew sporting a facial tattoo, a monkey dressed like a biker, Leslie Chow (the foul-mouthed Chinese criminal from the first movie) and the finger of Stew's future brother-in-law (Teddy). The rest of the movie details finding the rest of Teddy before Stew's wedding.The most enjoyable feature of the movie was Stew himself who, in a manner rare for contemporary non-dramas (and sequels in general), is intelligently wary of bachelor parties with his friends after the events of the first movie. He adamantly declines having a bachelor party, refuses to invite Allen (until he's guilted to by a sympathetic Doug) and even goes so far as to cover his drinks with napkins and refuse to drink from unsealed containers. When Teddy first goes missing, he leads everybody to search the roof (where Doug was found at the end of the first Hangover).Paul Giamatti lends his talents as an undercover Interpol agent and Mike Tyson (who's a less- than-talented vocalist) sings the apropos 'One Night in Bangkok.' Just like Part I, the movie's bisected by Stew ad-libbing a song about the events of the movie (parodying Billy Joel's 'Allen Town').Fans of the first movies should enjoy this outing equally as much while those critical of it will find Part II just as infuriating.",6,0,0,12 September 2011
The Descent," It Had the Makings of an Excellent Psychological Horror Film... And Then the Mole People Attacked.
","The Descent: six women enter, one woman leaves.A year after her husband and daughter die in a traffic accident, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and five of her friends (Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, MylAnna Buring, Saskia Mulder, Nora-Jane No one) meet up in the Appalachian Mountains. After a slumber-party-esque night in a rustic cabin, they go cave-diving. They journey into the cave system only to be caught in a cave-in, blocking off the way that they came. It turns out that this is not the cave system that they thought it was; Juno (Natalie Mendoza) took them to an uncharted cave system so that they could explore it together. That means, however, that nobody will know where they are to rescue them. Their only hope is to find a second entrance (shown in a primitive-looking cave painting) before whoever - or whatever - it is that they hear following them catches up.'The Descent' had the makings for an excellent psychological horror film. The direction was exquisitely claustrophobic, closing the audience into the cramped tunnels along with the protagonists. The general, although not entirely absent, background music engrosses the viewer in every unnatural echo permeating the cave system. Early in the film, the protagonists list off the dangers of prolonged stays underground, among which are visual and auditory hallucinations. Had the movie progressed in the way that it had started - with six strong, yet understandably frightened women, trapped in an uncharted cave-system, suffering from what could only logically be panic-induced hallucinations - the movie would have been an excellent addition to the horror genre. It would be notable if only for its bold decision to include an all-female cast (admirably acted by a more than capable cast).Then the mole people attacked.The fact that there was a monster at all was a massive disappointment, but that they were little more than stereotypical, blind, cannibalistic cave-dwellers was an insult. All of the suspense, all of the psychological tension and interesting character development was destroyed the second that the real antagonist was introduced. It wasn't their paranoia or underlying interpersonal issues that threatened their lives, but mole people.For the life of me I can't understand the positive critical response that it received, given how ultimately disappointing the film ended up being. Fans of suspenseful, psychological horror will enjoy the first half of the film while fans of hack-n-slash monster films will enjoy the second half. Feminists will enjoy the fact that the film has an all female cast, given how male-dominated the industry tends to be. It's hard to imagine an audience for the entire film, as it is never realized as a cohesive whole.",4,3,5,26 September 2011
The Lion King," An Animated Masterpiece,
","'The Lion King' is essentially a retelling of 'Hamlet' set on the Savannah and casted with lions. Simba (Prince Hamlet) is the child of Mufasa (King Hamlet) and Sarabi (Gertrude), the heir apparent of the Savannah. His uncle Scar (Claudius), however, has ambitions for the throne. Aligning himself with a pack of hyenas, Scar succeeds in killing his brother and taking the throne for himself. The Hyenas, unable to kill Simba, chase him into a desert and leave him for dead. He grows up mentored by the meerkat Timon (Rosencrantz) and the warthog Pumba (Guildenstern) until Nala (Ophelia), a childhood friend, finds him and convinces him to return home and take his place as king.Despite abundant opportunities to become a derivative child-friendly adaptation of the Shakespeare play, 'The Lion King' succeeds as a unique and family-friendly experience. It conveys the emotions of tragic loss and unforgivable betrayal that, while devastating and heartbreaking, are still appropriate for the entire family. Even moreso than Bambi's mother's, Mufasa's death is a heartrenching experience (and I am not above admitting that I cried watching Simba search for his father in the deserted gorge in which he died).The animation is easily the most breathtaking of Disney's 2-D features: brilliantly capturing the majesty of the African Savannah. The Pride Lands are bright and crisp while the elephant graveyard is nightmarishly grim. The landscape upon Simba's return is nothing short of haunting.The film demonstrates an elegant mastery of visual symbolism rare in films produced since the early sixties. The song 'Be Prepared' contains evocative visual allusions to the Third Reich, aligning Scar's reign with that of Hitler's. Gothic tradition holds that the natural world is a reflection of the social order; as such, the barren Pride Lands, littered with bones and scorched flora, with bent, stunted trees in the foreground reflects the unnatural ascension of Scar to the throne. In a moment of catharsis etched into every child's memory, the post-battle rain washes away the last remnants of Scar's reign, cleansing the Pride Lands and its inhabitants.A host of prominent actors lend their vocal talents to this film, including the James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg. Elton John rounds out the vocal ensemble, lending his voice to a number of Tim Rice's exceptional musical numbers.This is film is a true classic and easy to for all viewers, young and old, to enjoy together. It is a rare person who will not find something to like in it (genuinely funny quips, thrilling musical numbers, well-crafted script, exceptional voice talents). If you get the slightest opportunity to see this film, I recommend that you take it.",9,3,4,24 September 2011
Carrie," A Faithful but Dated Adaptation.
","Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a hopelessly awkward teenage girl: loathed as a pariah by her classmates and abused by her profoundly Christian mother (Laurie Piper). The only person who shows her the slightest human kindness is her gym teacher (Betty Buckley), who rescues her from the torments of her classmates when she gets her first (incredibly belated) period while showering after gym. Along with her late-coming adolescence, Carrie develops telekinesis, which she hones despite her mother's accusations of witchcraft. Sue Snell (Amy Irving), one of Carrie's tormentors, tries to make up for her actions by convincing her boyfriend (William Katt), who Carrie has a crush on, to take her to the prom. Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), however, despises her punishment for what she did to Carrie and wants to make her pay.'Carrie' (1976) demonstrates an intense level of fidelity with the novel upon which it is based. Brian DePalma demonstrates his technical proficiencies as a director in his realistic (if extreme) treatment of adolescence. The problem arises, however, with entrenched in the decade of its origin the film is. It is hopelessly, infuriatingly, obviously seventies. The decisions to use of kaleidoscope lenses, to rotate the camera opposite the rotation of Tommy Ross' and Carrie White's dancing and the a-typical use of sound after Chris dumps pigs' blood on Carrie - while it certainly conveys its cinematic message with all due clarity - are hopelessly dated techniques that permanently entrench the film in its specific time and place (instead of existing within a sense of timelessness).Fans of Stephen King's novels will find this to be delightfully faithful to his novel (a statement which cannot be said about even some of his best adaptations). Fans of horror films - as well as distinctly seventies films - will likewise find this to be a welcome and fairly-executed inclusion into their folds.",7,1,2,17 October 2011
Blade Runner," A Flawed Classic
","It's easy to see why 'Blade Runner' is considered a classic of the Sci-Fi genre. This highly stylized film sports a pervasively dark and moody atmosphere that's second only to old German Expressionist films and its art direction is absolutely stunning (particularly Tyrell's Egyptian-esque office set above the bleak LA streets). Its influence is plainly evident in nearly any 'Future Noir' film which followed it.The problem with the film (or, at least, with the original theatrical cut) is the snail-paced editing of any non-action scene. I'm prone to agree with one critic who referred to the film as 'Blade Crawler.' Despite an admirable cast, gritty, stylized realism and otherwise admirable direction, the pacing stops the movie dead in its tracks. So many dramatic scenes run overly long (most notably the scene of pseudo-rape between Deckard and Rachael). I'm told that this problem is lessened (some say absent entirely) in later cuts of the movie; maybe I'll find one of those cuts more to my liking (I can only hope), as it's the biggest obstacle between itself and a genuine masterpiece.Mr. Ford evidently shares my opinion on the obtrusive voice-over narration of the film. It really adds nothing to the end product aside from a stylistic nod to Film Noir. The actions described or elaborated on are obvious to an attentive viewer. The most glaring example is the climax of the film, when, after a desperate fight between Roy and Deckard in and on top of the skyscrapers of LA, Roy saves Deckard from falling off the roof before he himself dies. Instead of a terse, contemplative silence that could have added to the prevailing mood of the film, we're subjected to a overly-sappy analysis from Deckard about the value of life.Fans of Science-Fiction will enjoy the film for its bleak view of the future. Fans of Film Noir will enjoy it for the stylistic nods to the genre (strong use of lighting, voice-over, hard-nosed protagonist, moody atmosphere, etc...). Fans of both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford will enjoy it as an early example of both men's careers (it's Scott's third film and one of Ford's first with real dramatic depth).",6,0,3,12 September 2011
The Social Network," 'Wall Street' for a Whole New Generation.
","'The Social Network' depicts the founding of Facebook, THE social experience of the twenty-first century, by the most socially inept person imaginable. Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a Harvard undergrad whose girlfriend (Rooney Mara) just dumped him. In retaliation, Mark hacks the Harvard computer network to create Facemash, a website ranking the attractiveness of Harvard undergrads, which draws the attention of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer). The Winklevosses want to make a social networking site that requires a Harvard email address for membership and they want Mark to program it for them. Never actually working on their website, he instead uses it to gain a 1-month head start on his own similarly-themed website: 'The Facebook.' With the assistance of his friend and newly appointed CFO Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), Mark will turn 'The Facebook' to the international force that it is today.The film is, at its core, the thematic successor to Bennett Miller's 'Capote' (2005): a tale in which creation ('In Cold Blood' / Facebook) leads to the emotional destruction of its creator (Truman Capote / Mark Zuckerberg). The creation of FaceMash (and Mark's subsequent angry-blogging) destroyed his relationship with his ex girlfriend (Rooney Mara); Facebook destroyed Mark's friendship with Eduardo (Mark cut him out of his 1/3 ownership of the company, for which Eduardo sued him for $600 million - only one of two lawsuits Mark was simultaneously involved with). By the film's conclusion, he even grows disillusioned with Sea Parker, who is arrested after snorting cocaine off of underage interns. The film's final scene (where Mark friend-requests his ex, sits back in his chair and continually refreshes the page until the credits) is one of the most heartbreaking in recent memory.The film brilliantly frames the story of Facebook's genesis in Eduardo's lawsuit against Mark. David Fincher successfully negotiates these parallel continuities with perfect clarity, using the descendant timeline (the lawsuit) to elaborate the antecedent timeline (Facebook's creation). Transitioning between these timelines in a complimentary fashion without creating temporal confusion in the viewer is a more than commendable achievement of direction.Necessarily minimalist, though occasionally explosive, Jesse Eisenberg gives one of the year's most intriguing performances as the possible autistic Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield gives a commendable performance himself as the much more personable Eduardo. The chemistry between the two is incredibly tense, perfectly reflecting the strained relationship that they portray on screen.Fans of contemporary dramas or those interested in the origins of the omnipresent Facebook will find 'The Social Network' a worthwhile cinematic experience.",8,1,1,22 September 2011
The Fighter," In the Shadow of Rocky
","Mark Whalberg and Christian Bale both give exceptional performances as half-brother boxers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. Micky is a down-and-out fighter who's become a stepping stone for other fighter's careers; the fact that Dicky (also his trainer) is addicted to cocaine and that his mother-turned-manager (Melissa Leo) only seems interested in promoting Dicky doesn't help matters. Obvious mismanagement, his brother's incarceration and police brutality (they broke Micky's hand when they realized that he was a boxer) causes friction between Micky and his exceptionally large family. Eventually his girlfriend (Amy Adams) convinces him to change managers, which puts him back on an unprecedented winning- streak, leading to a title shot.Important to note is that this film isn't solely about Micky's inspirational comeback (which it very easily could have been). It's about family - Micky, Dicky and their mother. The film brilliantly balances screen-time between the three characters (the two brothers in particular), adding a level of insight and dramatic depth that would never have been possible otherwise (neither Micky nor Dicky would have been nearly as interesting on their own).Like every boxing drama since 'Rocky' (1976), this incredibly well-conceived, well-executed film fails only in one respect: it doesn't compare favorably to its antecedent. The boxing scenes, while they're themselves riveting, don't near 'Rocky''s level until the end of the movie. Charlene (Amy Adams), however, is both better developed and better acted than the sub- standard Adrianne.'The Fighter' is easily the best boxing movie of its decade (better even than the notable 'Cinderella Man' and 'Million Dollar Baby') and the best one since 'Raging Bull' (1980). Fans of Sports Dramas (boxing in particular) or of any of the four chief actors (Whalberg, Bale, Leo, Adams) will find plenty to enjoy.",8,0,0,14 September 2011
