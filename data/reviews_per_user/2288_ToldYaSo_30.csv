Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," When was the last time you waited over fifteen years for something?
","When you're a kid... excuse me, when you're a young person, and tired of being treated like a kid, you find yourself wishing you were older. You can't wait until the day when 'No, you're too young,' will become a poorly used, outdated excuse from your parents worth contesting. This notion can be ingrained in the mind as early as six years of age. It takes thirteen years to transcend the 'minor' label from there. Time seemed to stand still as years dragged on, slowly accumulating on your life span.If you were like me, a 'Star Wars'-loving minor in 1983 when 'Return of the Jedi' finished in theaters, then you've been waiting for 'The Phantom Menace' longer than you've waited to grow up. When you were young, there was no doubt that you were going to get older. But there were no such assurances about 'Episode I' being made, as it's future was written in the sand as an agenda that seemed as far away from realization as the galaxy it chronicles.When I first learned that there were indeed other chapters intended, and I can't remember how long ago that was, my first inkling was that there were bound to be lots of people who weren't going to make it. Their lives would be incomplete, as they might very well die before seeing the final installment. The earliest date for the finale seems to be something along the lines of the year 2014, if the 'three-years-per-picture' rule is adhered to without further delay or sabbatical. He may not remember it, but I seem to recall my father uttering a similar sentiment all those years ago, with a subtle twinge of disapproval mixed with disappointment, but I suspect he's never measured the value of his life by the number of 'Star Wars' films he will get to see.So they finally got down to it and made another one, and a phenomenon of a familiar kind has developed surrounding it's release. Never before in the history of film has a display of immense anticipation ever existed. It seems guaranteed, despite the unfortunate flurry of some negative critics' reviews, to break all sorts of box office records and rest atop the biggest money makers of all time.The film is a special effects masterpiece that is astounding and the battle scenes are simply extraordinary. The 'Star Wars' universe has definitely expanded and will continue to do so for some time to come. The film's few weaknesses lie in some of the characters and the sometimes convoluted plot line lends itself to disinterest for brief periods. But there are equally engaging characters and plot twists to keep your interest, and as mentioned before, the special effects more than make up for any shortcomings. The reaction at the first screening was pretty unanimous; a big hit. But what else would one expect? The excitement building in the room was almost tangible. I believe the theater had to pump up the volume louder than expected as the crowd's cheering was overwhelming dialogue at times, but the serious fans kept them in line soon after.Can we expect the same fervor over 'Episode II'? It's anyone's guess. The mounting curiosity of fifteen years will be gone, and it depends greatly on the success of 'Episode I'. But I fully expect that some of the executives at 20th Century Fox, whose company name will be outdated by then, will be looking to cause lightning to strike twice, doing everything in their power to generate a lightning rod of mythic proportions outside the lobby doors of all theaters showcasing the next development. Outside of theatrical trailers, I haven't seen a single TV ad for 'Phantom Menace', and they know they don't need it. The free publicity is one of the fringe benefits of an iconic release.What I got from Mr. Lucas on May 19, is a chance to be a kid again. Long after I marched into the worldwide age of majority, I learned something. I've realized that the truest sign of maturity, is not wishing you were older, but fondly remembering days when you were younger, and wishing time would drag rather than fly and hope it could stand still again.What Mr. Lucas receives in turn, is our enduring gratitude, for taking us all back to 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away'.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Ba-De-Da, Ba-De-Da-De-Daaaa, Ba-De-Da, Ba-De-Da-De-Da
","If you've seen this movie and heard the score, then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep, but rather the absolutely exhilarating 'Raider's March' which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero, Indiana Jones. If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, 'the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him'. Steven said, 'Wait a minute, we might have something there.'As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad.",10,285,429,27 February 1999
Se7en," The most disturbing film I have ever seen
","I've had this discussion with many friends on what the most disturbing film they've ever seen is, and the results have been fairly consistent.The fact is, that 'Se7en' is the most disturbing film I have ever seen in my 28 years and it will likely have a stronghold grip on that title for some time to come. I say this from a male perspective.And while I can appreciate why some of my female friend's opinions that 'Silence Of The Lambs' holds the 'Most Disturbing' title, I have to say that title was lost when 'Se7en' was released. David Fincher's dark vision is incredibly creative and harrowing and will likely stay with me for years to come. When I first saw this film with my brother, I was blown away. This film taps into the greatest fear of all men, smashing like a sledgehammer into the weakest, most delicate area of the male psyche. I didn't rise from my seat at the theater not because I couldn't wait to see the credits, but rather to let the feeling in my stomach subside, so that I may walk out properly with some semblance of dignity.Being a newly married man, I found the film to be the sheer embodiment of my worst fears which spoiler guidelines prohibit me from elaborating on. 'Silence of the Lambs' may have freaked me out a bit, but it never touched me the way this film did.Coming home, I couldn't decide what to tell my wife about the film. I did enjoy the film. It's a masterful achievement for any filmmaker, and the principal cast was excellent. But I didn't want her to see it, and realize my greatest fear. I told her straight out the reasons why, and I think it scared her off enough. Eventually, I had calmed down, and changed my tune. It was the only time in my life that I have behaved in such a manner.We had another couple over, and my good friend's wife had also not seen the film. We watched the video with due reverence, and at its end had a discussion about it. Both women agreed that they enjoyed it very much, but it didn't have the same effect on them as it did us. The fact that 'Silence of the Lambs' victims were all female may have something to do with our wives' points-of-view. Nevertheless, I can scarcely imagine a film that would tap into my soul and chill it in the same way 'Se7en' has.",10,0,0,24 April 1999
The Big Lebowski," A surreal, wild ride with the Coen Brothers and The Dude
","It's hard to know what kind of people will like this film. It seems to me that some fans of the Coen brothers' work are split on a number of their films, and this is no exception. But 'The Big Lebowski' is a slice of life in L.A. and despite it's surreal surroundings, seems to be all too real.The Coen Brothers have stated that this film is much closer to reality and truth than 'Fargo' ever was. And if you're not already in on the joke, 'Fargo' was stated to be a true story at the beginning, later to be revealed as a fictitious one, for those who stayed for the end credits.'The Big Lebowski' is filled with outrageous characters, memorable dialogue, and a twisting plot, 'lotta ins, lotta outs' as Jeff Bridge's 'Dude' would put it. The only disappointment is we don't get to see more of the flamboyant Quintana 'Jesus' who likes to bowl maybe a bit too much, played by John Turturro, and Steve Buscemi's character 'Donny' who doesn't seem to know what's going on most of the time, which annoys John Goodman's gun-toting 'Walter' perpetually.No one can fairly accuse Joel & Ethan of not trying different things and producing quality work which clearly comes from two men who love film and are dedicated to a vision and then execute it beautifully. I sincerely hope they never lose the desire to keep making films of this calibre.",10,0,1,17 April 1999
Citizen Kane," Widely regarded as the greatest film of all time by film lovers, but not by movie-goers
","The first time I saw 'Citizen Kane' was in a Film Theory class where none of the film's finer points escape the notice of class or teacher. From factors which include history of the period in which the story is told, camera techniques, and most importantly the ground-breaking work done on the film, by then novice filmmaker Orson Welles.With the background story and attention to detail that a film class can illuminate for you, 'Citizen Kane' can be an entertaining film to watch a number of times, as the camera angles and tricks employed are still interesting and appealing. What makes them more intriguing is to find out how unconventional they were at the time, and immediately recognize how truly commonplace they remain over fifty years later. It's hard for someone of my generation to appreciate unaided the finer qualities of this, the most stunning feature debut of all time.It's probably equally difficult for any feature filmmaker to not compare their first work to 'Citizen Kane', and wonder how it measures up. The truth is, most directors can enjoy a far more popular reception of their film quite easily in comparison, as 'Citizen Kane' was not received well due to the glaringly obvious portrayal and insult to media mogul William Randolph Hearst. While widely regarded as the finest film ever made this century, it lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'How Green Was My Valley', which also goes to show how the Academy can often miss the mark completely.The truth is, 'Citizen Kane' is a film lover's film. If you are not impressed by or aware of the technical details like lighting, editing, angles, tricks and bold innovations, you probably won't like it. There are other classic films that are perhaps more simplistic, which require not one iota of background explanation to understand, appreciate and enjoy the film. These are widely regarded as popular classics of a timeless nature, of which 'Kane' doesn't seem to be.In an interesting and ironic twist in reflection of the film today, 'Citizen Kane' will always remain a colourless, unaltered masterpiece much to the chagrin of William Randolph Hearst emulator Ted Turner. Turner's attempts to have it colourized were met with failure as contract specifications as laid out by the late Orson Welles clearly prohibit any such action or tampering with the film. For those of you who feel they will never watch it because it's not in colour, that's fine. We don't need you and you wouldn't like it anyway.",10,3,4,16 July 1999
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam: Visionary - 12 Monkeys: Vision
","I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were 'Awesome. Just awesome.' I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over 'Brazil', Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the 'final cut'. Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called 'The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys'. It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success.",10,175,237,24 April 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Perhaps the greatest black comedy ever made
","Learning of Stanley Kubrick's death on Sunday, March 7, 1999, came late for me. I had missed the news and only found out on Monday. I decided the best way to honour the man, was to watch my favourite film of his, 'Dr. Strangelove'.Some time ago, when I told a friend that I was working on my own black comedy, he said he didn't think there were any black comedies that were successful as they fell flat and did poorly overall. I thought about it for a moment, but couldn't think of anything at the time. I later recalled 'Dr. Strangelove' in the same way you think of the perfect comeback to an insult the day after.When I first saw the film, I was struck by the brilliance of Peter Sellers, playing three roles. I learned later that he was slated for four roles, the fourth being that of Major T.J. 'King' Kong, but due to an injury he wasn't able to do it. But then Slim Pickens might never have hit the world stage in the way that he did.I recently bought the DVD, somewhat reluctantly, as it does not have any special features whatsoever. I have read there's a fantastic alternate ending where a pie fight in the war room ensues, but unfortunately, everyone was cracking up and having a good laugh over it, and ruined the feel that Kubrick was looking for. Wouldn't that be great to see, though? There's a still picture of this scene in a biography of Kubrick by John Baxter.Perhaps in the wake of Stanley's death, we may see some special editions of the film reissued on DVD, which would be a welcome treasure in my opinion. I only wish that all film companies would give the same attention to film's behind the scenes and outtakes that Criterion does. Universal and New Line have gone to great efforts to provide high quality DVDs with plenty of bonus materials.I'll leave you with a quote from Stanley which can best summarize the mood of the film: 'Confront a man in his office with a nuclear alarm, and you have a documentary. If the news reaches him in his living room, you have a drama. If it catches him in the lavatory, the result is comedy.'",10,1,2,10 March 1999
Forrest Gump," What can I say to those who didn't like it?
","'Forrest Gump' is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much praise. As someone who genuinely loves this film, I am dumbfounded by those who hate it. But time after time, when a film receives high praise from a great number of people, it leaves high expectations for those who haven't seen it. The result is often disappointment.Some people object to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the involvement of Forrest in some of America's pivotal moments in history is not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument I've heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of success that Forrest does. They've missed out on a truly charming, endearing fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. And the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. 'Stupid is as stupid does'.Forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. It's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure, and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also.I can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every time. Every single time. I've watched this film more times than I care to count, as I feel as though I should be watching something I've never seen before. But this film just makes me feel good, and I'll no doubt watch it again.Now you see, I can't help but praise this film, and in a way I'm probably ruining it for someone else. My sister blames me for ruining it for her. It's not easy to forget what everyone's said, and the awards it has won. But if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film.",9,1,4,3 June 1999
Fargo," Forgo the truth for 'Fargo'
","My mother loves documentaries and films based on true stories. My brother and I brought home 'Fargo' on VHS the day it came out, and we watched the film as a family, and when the words 'Based on a true story' came up, she declared, 'Oh good!' My brother and I just looked at each other smiling. We knew the truth. this was fiction, but we said nothing. I say this without fear of spoiling it for two reasons. Chances are you already knew it was fictional by now, a certain advantage of commenting on the film years later. Secondly, it really doesn't matter. The film is great, any way you look at it. My mother disagrees, she feels that you shouldn't be able to say it's a true story if it's not. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the film.I support the Coen brothers in their choice to have some fun. More of that can be found if you check the credits carefully, you'll see the symbol for the artist-formerly-known-as-Prince exists as a credit for the rather heavyset driver that is pursued by Peter Stromare. An unlikely match, but amusing considering Prince is from Minnesota, just like the Coen brothers are.What is so effective about 'Fargo' is that despite it's fantastic content, it never loses the air of believability. I think most people forget about the little proclamation at the film's beginning by the time ten minutes have passed. My mother is not one of those people mind you. These brothers excel at story telling, and it's done so convincingly, you don't question it for a minute.Another interesting aspect of 'Fargo' is its wide appeal. I never would've guessed that this would be the breakthrough film for the Coen Brothers. The Hudsucker Proxy was a sheer delight for me, and I consider it one of my favourite films, but it essentially flopped. It is fortunate that things finally turned around for the creative team of Joel and Ethan, with the unanimous success, praise and awards for 'Fargo'. They have a certain independent spirit that doesn't seem easy to crush. They do things just a little differently, and that's why they stand out as not only thoughtful filmmakers, but also somewhat masters of their own destiny. Marching to the beat of their own drum. I applaud them for it, and eagerly await the next demonstration of their commitment to superlative cinema.",9,0,0,24 May 1999
Notting Hill," Not bad for a film I didn't want to go to
","I must say that like most guys with a wife or girlfriend, I live in the fear of the dreaded chick flick. Some women find this distinction of a film insulting, but it's actually something they should be proud of. Some filmmakers have gone to the trouble to make films just for women that will be of no interest whatsoever to men, and therefore providing an appropriate penance to subject their man to if he is in need of discipline or punishment.How does one identify a chick flick on sight? It's very simple for a man to peg one. Perhaps it's an innate ability given to most men at birth. Not unlike the kind that bestows the sole responsibility of killing small insects in the home and lighting the barbecue. A man doesn't need to have it classified for him, and he knows to avoid it at all costs. But a man must also learn to develop something of an immunity to tolerate them in small dosages. One day he may be required to view one, being unable to summon the veto power required to get him out of it. Or perhaps it's simply to negate any comment such as 'We NEVER pick what I want to watch!'Some women gravitate to the chick flick like a boat to a lighthouse beacon in a tempest. 'Oh, that looks good,' she might exclaim. While the man thinks, 'That bloody well sounds like a chick flick, better make myself scarce.' Case in point, a preview for 'Step Mom' manages to pass one minute and thirty seconds without uttering a single word as to what the story is about, and still women flock to it on the strength of the title and actresses alone. Now that's a chick flick if I ever avoided one.The main reason guys avoid chick flicks is it seems that the melodrama is specifically intended to make people cry, which ten times out of ten doesn't work on the fellas. At the very start of the melodrama, we are alerted to a high level reading on the sob-o-meter and tune out immediately. We are wise to their transparent little ploy and none too impressed at their pathetic attempt to win us over.Now why all this grandstanding about chick flicks? Is 'Notting Hill' a chick flick? Sort of. Is it like most films starring Julia Roberts? No, not really. Do we have a full fledged 'Beaches-Alert' warning in effect? Certainly not. The fact is, if you're a man and looking for a date movie with some male appeal, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one that this. It has strong writing, good acting and was executed quite well. The film's female star, Julia Roberts, didn't really have much acting to do as I recall, and now that I think of it, there was absolutely no female nudity or 'splosions of any kind. Can't figure out why I liked it, on second thought.",8,0,0,17 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," An incredibly engaging film that answers the question: 'Who is Keyser Sose?'
","This film has the personal distinction of being the very first DVD I ever owned. The very reason I got a DVD player was for movies like this one. And in this case, it was no disappointment. This is precisely the type of film that you may want to see more than once. Not to mention the interesting audio commentary from the director and writer, certainly two of the easiest guys to listen to, as they point out the errors and short comings in the film which you probably didn't notice because you were enjoying the film so much.The performance by Kevin Spacey is truly Oscar worthy, and it was pleasing to see him receive it. All of the other cast members delivered excellent performances as well.The moment when the audience discovers who Keyser Sose really is at the end, is arguably the best part of the film. It's the sort of resolution that you always hope for and often do not receive, but in the case of 'The Usual Suspects', the ending is a big pay-off. Part of what makes that possible is a captivating story line and excellent acting. I never hesitate to recommend this film to anyone, and I've never had to apologize so far.",9,0,1,6 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," War is hell, and 'Saving Private Ryan' peeks into the gates of Hades
","I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What 'Saving Private Ryan' does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.",9,362,460,16 August 1999
JFK," A complicated conspiracy made riveting in 'JFK'
","I hadn't yet been born when John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. I cannot put the actual event into an emotional context in my life. Further to that, I am Canadian, and could theoretically distance myself from such an ugly piece of American history. Yet I cannot help but be emotionally affected by this film.The unraveling conspiracy in 'JFK' is told with such conviction, it's hard to believe that it's only a culmination of theories and accounts rather than the truth as is known in history books. The length of the film in its DVD format is 206 minutes, a veritable film marathon. Yet with it's richness in information, theories and background, and absolutely beautiful photography by Robert Richardson, the time never passes slowly. And despite having watched it at least twice, I can safely say that the mind boggling conspiracies and facts they throw at you could keep it fresh for a third viewing in the future.The emotional impact of the 8mm Zapruder film which recorded the assassination, is staggering and awe inspiring. The feeling that the American government plotted the death of their own president, illustrates in many ways time and again, as one of the smaller characters reflects, that if they can kill the president, they can kill anyone. They can kill you or I without batting an eye.I can however, despite the seriousness of the subject matter, share a rather amusing anecdote about my first viewing of this film. I hadn't seen it in theaters, and so I rented it on VHS. My mother wanted to watch it with me, and knowing that it was over three hours long, she was eager to begin, complaining that she didn't want to be up until midnight watching it. Popping the microwave popcorn, she warned me she was starting without me if I didn't hurry. When I came in the room it had already begun. 'Jeez, Mom! What'd I miss?', 'Nothing, quiet!' We watched the film together, at times my mother would comment on things that she recalled, and I'd have the occasion to ask her to be quiet. Half an hour went by, with not so much as one credit having shown on the screen, I remarked on it, and my mother concurred that it was odd, but confirmed that I truly hadn't missed anything walking into the film late.Soon we came to the speech given by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in the court room, charging Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw as a conspirator, which is a scene that is quite emotionally stirring and powerful. I thought it was incredible. I had noticed that we'd barely crossed the half way mark of the three hour adventure, and remarked, 'Wow, you know, you could end the film right there, that was pretty powerful.' 'Yes, it was,' my mother agreed. Shortly following that scene came the epilogue statements and end credits. Finally it dawned on me. 'Mom! You put the SECOND tape in FIRST!' She laughed immediately. We both did, but I was pretty upset knowing now that I'd have to start tape one and follow it up with tape two again. She got her wish, she wasn't up until midnight, not feeling the slightest bit compelled to watch the first tape, proclaiming, 'I lived it, I don't need to see it again, good night dear.' Well Mom, you should watch the first part anyway, whether you lived it or not, because it's pretty darn intriguing. Unfortunately, the DVD isn't Mom-proof either, as it is double-sided.",8,1,11,16 May 1999
Schindler's List," A fantastic film that I had to see twice
","I don't have to tell you that 'Schindler's List' is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with 'Jurassic Park' and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of 'Schindler's List' for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out. Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the 'dude' in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of 'Seinfeld' when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.Back to our friend 'Howdy Doody', who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what 'Buckaroo' you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate.",10,30,51,3 August 1999
Pi," Paranoid, mathematical genius tries to unlock the power of Pi. Loses mind. A typical love story.
","I've always been terrible at math. It is easily my weakest suit. I have always suspected it would become one of my greatest downfalls. That is, before I saw this movie. Now I can see that being a mathematical genius isn't what it's cracked up to be. (What with the limousines and paparazzi) It's much better being stupid. But as dense as I am, I'm still fairly adept at using power tools in the fashion recommended by the manufacturer, unlike our so-called genius.This film was a favourite at the Sundance Film Festival, and won the Director's award. It's shot in grainy black and white, on a super low budget in the neighbourhood of $35,000 if I remember correctly. All funds were raised by cast and crew, and the director's mother was part of the catering services. Despite my phobias about math, and therefore an inherent lack of knowledge about it, I still found the film intriguing and innovative. Sometimes the camera angles can create an unpleasant disorienting effect, but not too often, for not too long, and not without good reason.The story's protagonist, Max, is not likely someone you can relate to, but rather empathize with. We all sometimes want to be left alone; Max always wants to be left alone. He is a man without peace, who's being watched and with an obsession of Pi to work out. It is a very dark film, that grows darker with each passing minute. Not for your happy-ending kind of target audience. It should be interesting to see what the makers of 'Pi' do next with the attention they received for this film.",7,3,10,24 May 1999
A Bug's Life," An engaging film for all ages
","You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.Disney continues to firmly hold the title of 'Greatest Animation in the World', with 'A Bug?s Life' standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments being the delightful 'out-takes' added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features 'Gerry?s Game' which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? 'Antz', which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, 'Antz' is largely cast with big name 'movie' stars with a few familiar 'TV' star voices, where 'A Bug?s Life' is just the opposite, loaded with 'TV' stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you. This is the kind of film that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with. Don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though.",10,20,33,24 April 1999
The Graduate," Dee da dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee da dee, Doo da doo doo doo doo doo da doo
","Here's to you Mrs. Robinson. Was it the song by Simon and Garfunkel made popular by the film, or did the film entrench the song into popular culture? Who's to say either way? It's a matter of opinion, and it's irrelevant really. The fact is, it's a great song and a great movie and the two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly, ham and swiss or May and December.This movie is for anyone who's ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who's been in love with someone their parents didn't approve of, or anyone who's had an affair with one of their parent's friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film.The film perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. As reflected on in an interview with Dustin Hoffman on the DVD, 'The Graduate at 25', his life changed after this film, propelling him into something of a superstar status as his incredible talent found wide recognition. When I saw 'Rushmore' I had a similar feeling about young Jason Schwartzman in the lead role. For him, time will tell. Although 'Rushmore' isn't the time tested success that 'The Graduate' is, anyone who enjoyed 'Rushmore' would likely enjoy 'The Graduate' if they haven't already seen it. They are, however, distinctly different films.This comedy is something of a benchmark in many ways. Not many films of a comedic nature are so socially relevant and of such high quality that they make the A.F.I.'s top ten of all time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.It is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time. It has been a long-time favourite of mine, and I can scarcely imagine growing tired of it.",10,160,210,12 September 1999
Singin' in the Rain," The title alone will have you humming the song
","I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, 'Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance.' Or even more ridiculous, 'Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance.' Forget about suspension of disbelief.This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by 'talkies' with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one's caliber to make me sit up and take notice.",9,161,206,24 May 1999
The Legend of 1900," The antidote to all your troubles, '1900' will sweep you away
","It is at a time like this I wish I could expand my vocabulary to better articulate the virtues and qualities of such a fine film. I also find I'm bursting to talk about this film that I regrettably saw alone. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but desperately want to share it with everyone.
The talented star of 'The Legend of 1900', Tim Roth, presented this film along with Clarence Williams III. His encouragement to the audience was that if anyone was the sort who liked to pick apart at films and critique their lack of realism, they should just leave now. He touted this wonderful vision from the director of Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore, and likened the film to a 'dream'. He also said that if anyone had seen his own film, 'The War Zone', that '1900' was the antidote for it. I was slated to see 'The War Zone' the next day, but that was fine by me. I managed by a sheer stroke of luck to get into this Canadian premiere and found it to be absolutely extraordinary and the best film I'd seen so far of the Toronto International Film Festival.It seems as though mere moments after the initial credits, that the wonderful storytelling and incredible music combined with stunning visuals almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be seeing films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly.The story is one of an abandoned baby who is found on a ocean liner by one of the ship's crew. He is unofficially adopted and named '1900' for the year in which he was born. At a very early age the boy demonstrates an extraordinary gift for piano playing which is only strengthened in his passing years. The boy grows up with no official identity, into a man having never taken a step off of the ship onto dry land in his whole life. The young man, played by Tim Roth is encouraged by his dear friend to leave the boat and pursue a life of fame and fortune as the great pianist he has become. 1900 declines, explaining simply that everything he needs is on the boat.Well, that should be enough to intrigue you; there's much more of course, but I've no desire to spoil it for anyone. I must encourage everyone to see this film, I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. It's for music lovers, dreamers, romantics and film buffs everywhere and my greatest hope is that it will be seen by many, many people, especially those I know and love. And after seeing the film, and hearing Tim Roth's words echoing in my mind, he was absolutely right. It is like a dream, a wonderful dream that I wished would never end. And for a future prediction, I see this film as a Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination for 1999.",Null,127,144,20 September 1999
Pulp Fiction," Some films should be seen in a theater, this is one of them.
","If this film isn't making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private, candid conversation, then it's knocking you on your butt, flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic. Unless of course, you're my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching. I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking I'd just seen something amazing and that I'd never seen anything like it before.I still remember the riveting, tense feeling I had when Butch, played by Bruce Willis decides to go back for his father's gold watch at his apartment, certain that gangsters like John Travolta's Vincent Vega are looking for him. The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense, as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death. And then the moment he thinks everything is fine, he decides to toast a pop tart. I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. And later still, when you think everything is fine again, you're floored by another predicament.The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion, is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater. Naturally, the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension, unless of course you suffer from amnesia and don't remember what happens. But what I'm getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video.For me, Pulp Fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment.",10,0,0,6 April 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," It's not _______ meets _______ with an edge. It's better.
","I saw a preview screening of this movie today with my brother and we both enjoyed the film immensely.Being born and raised in Canada, the both of us most likely missed a fair bit of the dialogue due to accents and slang, but from what we did pick up loud and clear, we were grateful for.The film's story is its strength, and colourful characters being its stock in trade. Executed beautifully and edited quite nicely, the film's pace was engaging and flawless.A certain pop singer's cameo appearances actually elicited laughter from the audience, I'm not sure whether that tone was intended or not.There's a certain playful attitude that will require a suspension of disbelief, a certain element of embellishment in story telling is employed and certain characters are larger than life for comic effect.It seems inevitable that some people will compare this film to 'Trainspotting', or even 'Trainspotting' meets 'Rounders' with a hard edge of 'Reservoir Dogs' thrown in for good measure. Now if you've seen those movies and enjoyed them, I'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy this one, but don't be looking for those elements. Just let the movie unfold in it's own, unique style and let it have a life of its own. Maybe a year from now, they'll be comparing some new movie to this one. Who knows?",8,0,0,3 March 1999
Titanic," The most undeserving of praise in the history of film
","What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, 'Phantom Menace', is that it will likely blow 'Titanic' out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare 'Titanic' is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, 'You don't see a lot of movies, do you?' What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than 'Titanic', and for the same price tag.'Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,' as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, 'Phantom Menace' will likely suffer a similar fate. but.James Cameron's 'Titanic' is. a)  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b)  a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c)  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d)  something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e)  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f)  a  robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, 'I wish I could trade places with you.' g)  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h)  thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i)  a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",1,141,396,9 May 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Just try to hold back the waterworks at the end, I dare you
","To my utter dismay and disbelief, I recently discovered that a friend from work hated this movie.This friend, whom we will call 'Jean', says she saw it for the first time recently and absolutely hated it. 'What a crappy movie' or something to that effect.Not that it's important how old Jean is, but let's just say she's had ample opportunities to view the film in previous years, and by her own account she feels her parents had the good taste to protect her from this film.I can only react in shock as one of my most beloved film experiences is torn asunder in such a harsh way. But perhaps I'm blindsided by the tradition of the film, with it being a staple for Christmas fare. Maybe I'm being merely nostalgic. Maybe I can't see it for what it is.I tell you something dear friends, I hated Christmas this year.It seemed to be one obligation after another that nearly stamped out any Christmas cheer I could usually muster with the greatest of ease. My beloved wife and I were busier than ever before and didn't even find the time to put up a Christmas tree, much less enjoy 'It's A Wonderful Life'.You know something, I think it's because we didn't take the time to enjoy the finer points of Christmas, and part of that is Frank Capra's delightful film, which I've just acquired on DVD and plan to watch just as soon as I'm able, despite my hectic schedule.I don't know if Jean will ever give this film another chance or not, I hope she does. Because nothing on film can compare to the touching scene at the end, where George Bailey discovers just what kind of an impact he's had on the lives of the friends around him. Just try to fight those tears, but it won't make you feel any less choked up, no matter how many times you see it, whether you start at the end or not, it doesn't matter. C'mon Jean.",10,1,4,22 February 1999
Jaws," A beautiful story about a boy and his shark.
","Not quite. But when I think of 'Jaws', I think of a film that I can watch over and over again and never grow tired of it. Definitely one of my favourite films.Since seeing 'Jaws' many years ago, I became fascinated with sharks. I saw it around 1981 at the age of 10. I read every book I could get my hands on at my public school library. What I found in the process, is that not only is the ocean filled with a variety of sharks, but lots of other equally deadly creatures. I think that is what freaked me out beyond the film. I have always been afraid of the ocean since. I attribute that to Steven Spielberg.Sometimes when I watch this film, during one of the calmer moments, like Brody and his son at the dinner table, I'm struck by the beauty of the film, in its aesthetics, later I'll be drawn in by the pace, story and suspense of a truly masterful film.I never did get to see the film in the theater. In the early 1980s, we rented a VTR on a monthly basis and would periodically rent movies from the local video store, 'Videoflicks', which was an excursion that was always an exciting treat for my siblings and I.For my birthday party, I wanted to watch 'Jaws' with my friends, and my mother was a little concerned. She was debating whether we should do it or not, worried what the parents of the other kids would say as the film scared her pretty badly too.She was worried about it until my 5 year old brother said, 'Aw mom, it's just a mechanical shark.'Of course, he too is traumatized, as were most of the kids at the party I'm sure.",10,1,2,10 March 1999
Trainspotting," It's not for everyone, and neither is heroin
","'Trainspotting' is one of those markers. The kind of film where you can determine a lot about a person's threshold for the ugly side of humanity, based on how they feel about this film. It is an excellent film, but not the kind you want to take your first date to.The toilet scene, which makes most people squirm, myself included, is a fine example of a surreal moment that will quickly lose the audience member or rivet them. Truly one of the most repulsive sequences ever captured on film, but with a darkly comedic aspect, that you either get, or try to forget.The heroin scenes, which are littered throughout the film in hefty proportions, may not be as objectionable on the surface, but have their moments of unsettling, unnerving consequences that will stay with you for some time to come.I see it is a tightly woven, 'beautifully illustrated' film about redemption. Others may see it as simply a depressing film for those characters that do not redeem themselves or worse. There is nothing glamorous about heroin, and this film makes every effort to demonstrate the harsh, brutal reality of the life of an addict, and in that, its purpose can be drawn. The characters are so vivid and familiar that despite their ugly habit, you can find sympathy and understanding for them. Either that or you'll hate them and the movie and the person who recommended it. So, uh... don't see it.",9,0,0,2 May 1999
The Matrix," Not a bad film, even with the 'Keanu' Factor
","I had a bit of reluctance to see 'The Matrix'. I had figured it for one of those run-of-the-mill stupid sci-fi films without a brain and all special effects and didn't give it much thought after that. The reasons were simple.1.  'Matrix', '13th Floor' and 'Existenz' are all films that play with 'alternate realities' and none of their previews made me want to see them much, with 'The Matrix' perhaps tugging at my wallet just a bit.2.  Lawrence Fishburne pulled me in to 'Event Horizon' which was a pretty bad film that I didn't expect 'Matrix' to be any better than, and I still haven't forgiven him for that.3.  Perhaps the strongest factor of all, Keanu Reeves, not being a bastion of good taste or strong acting ability, whom the public can stand if he simply can manage to not suck too badly. He brings a fairly robotic element to all of his roles that may be appreciated in another century and make him the actor of the millennium.4.  Lots of teenagers were raving about it. The same kind of people whom I suspect are already lined up for the 'Phantom Menace' which is the clearest indication and proof of a loser with time on their hands as could ever be devised. Lawn chairs + Laptops + 6 weeks = Loser.The reason I caved in to see it, however, was based on some positive reviews from some reliable and trustworthy sources, and a good friend whom I don't see much was eager to see it. My good friend Kalev also took the time to relate some of the finer points of the film with great enthusiasm, and so I promptly decided to see it. But most importantly of all, the Wachowski Brothers were behind it, and I thoroughly enjoyed their film 'Bound', so there you have it.The film is a visually stunning, no contest. The acting is passable and the dialogue is just on the edge of being too expository but the story's elements are at times so complex, this measure can be forgiven quickly. This is a film for the Marital Arts fan. The fight scenes are fantastic and executed with originality.The story line owes a great debt to 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', which if you enjoyed the Matrix you should check out one or both of the first two versions only. But as one of my 'computer g_ _ k' friends has informed me, 'The Matrix' writers really did their homework and those aspects held up well. Which is a factor that could easily get past me, but it's always nice to find out that the writers cared enough to do their research. This film almost assuredly will have you trying to figure out the finer points in the parking lot.",7,0,0,24 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Darth Vader nearly made me soil myself - My first film ever, 1977.
","Dad didn't say where we were going. In fact, I don't even remember what he told me, but it was a surprise. As we got closer and closer to the theater, I began to suspect where we were headed. I asked my father if we were going to finally see it, and he casually responded, 'Maybe.' It seems my begging had paid off.My anticipation was growing with intensity. Finally we descended into the theater, through the doors and into the darkness, it felt like a big cave and I was a bit nervous and entirely excitable, feeling as though the previous six years of my life had lead to this moment.The moment that Darth Vader walked on screen, I knew this was a villainous force to be reckoned with. I was terrified.In the years to follow, my father took me to meet R2-D2 at the CN Tower, from whom I received an electric shock, despite the warning, (I just had to touch him) and later Darth Vader at some mall outside the Toronto area.Each person at the mall received an 8x10 glossy black and white photo pre-signed 'Darth Vader'. We were in a line to take turns meeting him, shake his hand and receive our photo. Hundreds of people were there.My father told me to get Darth to turn around so he'd be able to get a picture of us together. As my turn approached, I watched each previous kid take his hand-shake and then fall to their knees. I began to get nervous naturally.Now it was my turn, 'Get Darth to turn around' repeating in my head. I took his hand and began to speak softly and timidly. He then began to squeeze my hand forcefully and push me to the ground. I had no choice but to fall on my knees like all the others. I was speechless from that moment on, took my photo and found my way to the exit line.My Dad was disappointed, having been in position for half an hour or more, and asked me why I didn't get him to turn around?'I was scared, Dad.'I'm not sure if he thought that I was afraid to ask anything of anyone in general, or if I couldn't muster the courage in this one case, but needless to say, Darth Vader has proven to be the greatest villain of all time in the history of cinema.You can probably gather the impact it had on me then, and I can assure you no film has had such an impact since. It remains among my favourite life experiences, and the re-release of the Special Editions was as welcome  news as the 'prequel' Phantom Menace.",9,0,0,27 February 1999
Cube," You ever get stuck in an elevator? Multiply that emotion by 1,000
","Great. Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our 'heroes' from certain death in this arena.'Cube' is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as 'Best First Feature' at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights (or both) in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one, as it just might be too close to home.",8,123,151,17 August 1999
Goodfellas," Telling it like it was in the mafia over 30 years
","Like most of Martin Scorsese's films, 'Goodfellas' is an example of superior film-making. The fact that this film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time is no surprise to me. It's low ranking of 94 is a bit disturbing. It sits as close to the bottom as it should to the top of that list. This film gives you a hard, long, candid look of the life of a gangster spanning three decades, without pulling any punches.It is violent to be sure, but not gratuitous, unnecessary violence. How can you tell a convincing tale of life in the mob without getting violent? The narration by Ray Liotta and the style in which the film is presented gives it a very realistic feel that is not easily achieved on the fantastic subject matter. Based on the novel by Nicholas Pileggi, this is a harrowing true story, and despite its incredible turns, we know in our hearts it's all too real. Many scenes from this film are burned into my mind, and that can be attributed partially to the story, but mostly to the convincing performances by all involved.Joe Pesci received an Oscar for best supporting actor, but I feel Martin was overlooked unjustly. I'm sure he doesn't make films for the sake of awards, that appears to be the case anyway, but I'm sure the recognition wouldn't have embarrassed him either, and it's a shame. I respect the man and his work, and I feel that this film is his greatest so far.",10,0,0,15 April 1999
Jurassic Park," Walking out of the theater shaking like a leaf
","My friend Chris was one of the first people I know to see this film. He told me it was 'scary'.'Scary? It's a kids movie,' I replied in disbelief, certain that I knew what I was talking about based on the previews I had seen and nothing else. At this point, I hadn't even read the book yet.'No way man, it's scary stuff,' he assured me.'OK, well, I'll be seeing it soon anyway,' I told him, thinking that maybe he was too easily frightened or had begun to lose it.My wife and I went within the first week of its release, no one else we knew had seen it aside from Chris. No one else could confirm or deny my expectations. We saw it at the York Theater in Toronto, a fine theater with all the Dolby Digital THX sound that today is far more commonplace. We sat in a packed theater in quite possibly the best seats in the house and prepared ourselves.We couldn't prepare enough.From the first appearance of the menacing T-Rex until the end of the film, I didn't relax for a moment. Not even in the 'calm-down-it's-sleepy-time' part of the film. I was literally on the edge of my seat in sheer terror and awe of the film. It is by all definitions of the word, a thriller.It is with regret and a little shame that I confess that in my raving of the film, I may have spoiled it for others by raising their expectations too high, which is mainly why I like to see some films early on. My expectation was that this film was made for children and would probably be entertaining, but instead it floored me completely. I had difficulty with basic motor skills trying to exit the theater, I had been so tense throughout the entire film I could barely walk away.",8,8,16,24 April 1999
