Skyfall," Best James Bond film by Daniel Craig
","Of the three James Bond movies that Daniel Craig has done, this one is by far the best. The plot is easy to follow, quick paced, and action packed. The cinematography is simply amazing, especially the large cityscape shots. Also, the selection of new actors for the film was extraordinarily well done. Although the movie does seem to drag on for just a bit too long, you'll walk away feeling like it was time well spent. Also, their is a bit of romance in the film as well, which may make it more entertaining for some people. The film is good because it gives a bit of the backstory to why Bond is as he is. A great film to watch on any occasion, whether it be a 'bros night' or a 'date night'!",8,2,6,4 July 2014
American Hustle," Great character development
","To be honest, the movie's plot was not all that great. The entire conflict was not too great, in fact it was very average as movies go. With that said, it is still a great film! Its not the mediocre plot that makes it great, its the characters. The character development in the film is spectacular, by the end of the movie one feels like they can actually relate to the helplessly lost characters from the movie. Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper masterfully act out their individual characters, as do Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. There is quite a lot of arguing and swearing, which makes the movie very intense and in some circumstances difficult to watch. Other than that its wonderful, would not recommend for under 16 year olds though.",7,0,2,2 July 2014
22 Jump Street," So So Funny
","This movie is hilarious. The dynamics between Tatum and Hill are perfect. Its just as good, if not better than the first one! This will be a comedy I can re-watch and re-watch. Every scene provides new entertainment and new things to laugh at, without using clich√©s or being too inappropriate. The directors did really really amazing with this film, and I sincerely hope the continue to make more Jump Street movies! Also, Ice Cube is absolutely fantastic in this film (as always, lets be honest) and provides fresh comedy with every line. After watching this movie, all I want to do is go and watch it again! Seriously, great great movie.",8,2,7,28 June 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Refreshingly New
","Edge of Tomorrow is a concept we have all experienced, but which is completely new to the screen. Just like when playing a video game, Cage (played by Cruise) must play and replay the same day over and over until 'beating' it. The concept is so relatable. Cruise does a wonderful job at displaying the utter frustration of trying a 'level' over and over again but never succeeding. The concept is so relatable, and yet so new to the movie screen, that it felt refreshing. Both Cruise and Blunt do marvelous jobs acting in their respective roles. The director did a wonderful job at replaying the same day over without making it feel monotonous. All in all, the movie was underrated, but is still really great. I highly recommend seeing it!",8,0,2,2 July 2014
Inception," Christopher Nolan at his best.
","This movie is spectacular, but what would we expect from a Christopher Nolan film? Nothing less than amazing, and once again, he's come through. This movie has the best of all elements: it has mystery, it has suspense, it has romance, and it has action. It is definitely a movie that you need to pay close attention to in order to grasp the full meaning, but it is also a movie one can watch over and over and still never understand it all. Leonardo DiCaprio does a phenomenal job acting as Cob, as do the rest of his crew. Joseph Gordon Levitt, a personal favorite, also does an amazing job. The entire concept of 'Inception' is amazing, and if anyone hasn't watched it yet, I highly recommend it!",9,0,1,2 July 2014
Gladiator," A movie I could watch over and over!
","Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job in this movie directed by Ridley Scott. This is a nearly three hour long movie doesn't feel long at all, when its over you just wish it would keep going. The action sequences are incredibly well made and put together. However, it doesn't just feel like an action film. Scott does a great job developing each of the characters through their dialogue and their responses to situations. Crowe does a good job at showing his distress and anger after the murder of his family, and Phoenix does a great job as being a heartless jerk. All in all a great movie that one can watch over and over again. Great for a family that has teenagers.",8,2,4,3 July 2014
