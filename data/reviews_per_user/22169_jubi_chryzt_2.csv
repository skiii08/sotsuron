Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," get a life for those who had been devoted this movie!
","i am helluva fan of these series. don't need to raise up by myself that what I've learn from these all of them. this version is best-est best I've ever seen. every single subtitle of this movie is gruesome. you have to understand what's really going on and you guys must be noted every sequence. but the understanding all of the sequence isn't much bad. but i would must say, bah for the next movie, i believe you guys won't vote it as it getting it like ! poor voting as view of me ! cause it would have get some more vote. every point of these makes us hesitate. i just am when i first watch this movie, i can't stop to see it again, then again and again !",8,0,1,22 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," awesomeness !
","This film was the perfect ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. These movies transcends the 'comic book' genre and make a more realistic and gritty story.The Dark Knight Rises is an emotional and brutal ride. With Bruce Wayne at an all time low and the uprising of the villain Bane and the addition of the elusive Selina Kyle. It drags Batman into a war he may not win.Christopher Nolan and his team have delivered a brilliant story that's Oscar worthy. From the stunning portrayal of Bane by Tom Hardy to the sexy strong Anne Hathaway as an amazing Catwoman/Selina Kyle they are both remarkable in their parts. For me, This was Christian Bales best outing as Batman/Bruce Wayne but the standout performance has to be that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as rookie cop John Blake who reminds me of a younger Gordon from Batman Begins. With the brilliance of the supporting cast. I think this is the movie of the year and a trilogy that will stand the test of time for future generations to enjoy.",8,1,3,24 July 2012
