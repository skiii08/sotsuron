",This movie is nonsense. The circus is scarier than this garbage. Filled with a lot of fat shaming....good job guys.,1,1,3,1 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Silver lining.....

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars is no longer a Special Experience
","Just for reference, I am a huge fan of the original 3 films, having grown up on them. I've seen the prequels once each due to their boring nature and cartoony digital effects. Not. Fan of them by any stretch. Episode 7 was a fun movie that seemed to set the franchise back on its magnificent footing. Only to be completely undone by the awful episode 8. Prequel level awful!!!
This brings us to this movie. It is nowhere near as good as episode 7 and nowhere near as bad as episode 8. Some questions are left unanswered and some are answered extremely shabbily. Fan service helps but unfortunately there was too much of a mess left from episode 8 to try to reform the narrative and save this trilogy.
It is a watchable movie that lightly reminds you of why Star Wars was at one time, a super special theatrical experience. Now it is just merely another movie that comes out and holds your attention for a couple hours. No more, no less.",6,11,27,23 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Don't just like it cause it's Star Wars branded
","So to give you an idea of where I come from: The original trilogy, INCREDIBLE. Star Wars (not a new hope, jeez) 10/10, the Empire Strikes Back (possibly the best movie ever made) 10/10, and Return of the Jedi 10/10, fantastic ending despite the Ewoks. 
The prequel trilogy? AWFUL. I can't even explain the disappointment. Completely geared towards kids. Basically cartoons. 
The Force Awakens? Absolutely loved it! An homage to the OT with new characters that felt like Star Wars worthy. Granted my cinematic idol was killed in it, it was a fantastic beginning to the final 3......until The Last Jedi destroyed all the momentum. I will not get into the details that the other 'fan boys (and girls)' harp on, but I will say this. Luke Skywalker's character was destroyed. We waited two years to see this great Jedi that we glimpsed for 30 seconds in the end of TFA. I'm not so much upset with him being a recluse and a pessimist as I am upset that he was not essential to the story. He trained no one. He fought no one (unless you consider that Skype call with Kylo Ren a fight). Just poor writing and a terrible imagination on that directors part. Leia was also a non factor. Although who knew Jedi's releatives can fly through space? Laughable. And as for Rey, Finn and Poe, why bother expanding on their stories. Who wants to know what Rey's linage really is when we have those little seal/penguin things to laugh at. Oh and sweet casino planet scene......NOT (Borat inflection). 
Overall the move sucks. And sucks badly!! Star Wars in the title makes it money. Call it Battlestar Galactica and it is out of the theater in a week.",1,16,21,6 June 2018
