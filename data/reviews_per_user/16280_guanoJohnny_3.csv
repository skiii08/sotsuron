The Blair Witch Project," Rating it BETTER than awful(1)... how about a 2?
","I love to camp. That said, I was amazed at the amount of fear that the dark instilled in the crowd around me. Or maybe it was just the fear if losing the mall and the cheeseburger.If I hear ONE more person say they're NEVER GOING CAMPING AGAIN, whoops, there goes another one. Argghhhh! Lamers! Melvins.Cheaply made film, works on the great MIDDLE of middle America. I prefer Anne Rice's witches, or the haunting terror and humor of Dr. Strangelove. The last great horror film (for me) was Dawn of the Dead. That said, and did I say, 'I LIKE TO CAMP!'? This film was definitely not destined to work for me. Rated a 2.Now y'all, 'Get out there and sleep in the woods!' Sing me to sleep, crickets and wind...",2,0,2,30 July 1999
The Matrix," Dan Aykroyd meets Columbine
","Early on, Agent Smith does a superb Blues Brothers Dan Aykroyd imitation, as he  threatens Our Hero by intoning these immortal lines, 'It seems that you've been living ... two lives. One life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a RESPECTABLE SOFTWARE COMPANY. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you ... help your landlady CARRY OUT HER GARBAGE.'Imagine Dan drawing out the looong pronunciations in the capitalized words. And now Agent Smith steals the show by cracking his knuckles! Now he cracks his neck bones! Fear This, Keanu!Later, the Trench Coat Mafia enjoys a vicarious Columbine carnage-fest as we are splashed with waves of hot ejected shell casings! Ahhh! More shell casings, please!! What great cinema!! Fill the screen with flying bullets and spent shell casings, oh! Yessss!!!!! Uhnnnnn, OH!! AhhhhhHH!!At the very least, The Matrix is a much better film than Cannibal Holocaust, which I saw for the first time earlier in the day. Achh, the mechanical attack squids are breaking into my computer again!! /%$@# achh!!! $#CRASH!! *&$^#@!!!!",Null,0,0,22 September 1999
Donnie Darko," A Classic Ghost Story: Lynch meets Brady Bunch
","My main take on this gem of a film the whole problem may be that American kids are over medicated. Screw the shrinks and the pills they hawk. Donnie takes his pills and POW  he winds up talking to his low budget rabbit head buddy. The soothing rabbit voice doesn't fit the toothy skull face, and the rest of the outfit is from Cheapsville. It's derivative of Matt Groening's rabbit in his early 'Life in Hell' comic. Poor Donnie lives in an upper class Republican enclave, with a school dress code that reeks. His house has an elegant chandelier in the magnificent stairway, and a Porsche in the garage. It's these kind of top 5% folks that get the tax cuts and will pay shrinks $200 per hour, then think they are doing the right thing by showing their love with pills. When things don'ts seem to be working well, why not double the dose At the end, his Mom and kid sister are on a 747 and it seems to hit a storm, loses it's engine, which falls through a wormhole back in time 28 days to strike the house again, changing the Fabric of Time, so that the plane doesn't crash, right? I am thinking the whole movie is a construct so that Donnie gets to go back, in a parallel universe, to fall in love and get laid, so that he won't feel so ALONE, so he could take down Jim Cunningham, so he could double up on his meds.Back t o the end again, Donnie drives away from home with dead Gretchen, like he knows he will meet the blinding light that will blast him back in the past. Earlier, the rabbit told Donnie the portal is Jim's house, but Donnie drives up into the hills.Donnie puts an axe in the top of the Mong sculpture, but it looks like they could fix it with a bit of bondo. Why does the private school PTA ask for public donations to help fix it? I did like that line, 'Feces are baby mice.' Speaking of sexy smurfs, Drew Barrymore looks great, but acts dumb as a teacher. The new girl is told to pick the boy she thinks is the cutest, and then Drew orders Joanie to surrender her seat. Joanie should have pitched a bitch.Overall, this is film is tremendous. I am only complaining about it because I haven't been taking my meds.",8,0,1,1 January 2006
