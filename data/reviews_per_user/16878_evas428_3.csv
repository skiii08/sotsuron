The Avengers," Great
","The best comic book movie yet. Very well done in linking the single hero story lines together for this ensemble. Even at a run time of over two hours, I felt there was no down time in story progression or action. The characters are well layered and performed, and their interactions are greatly displayed.Robert Downey Jr by far carries this film with great sarcasm and intelligence. His inner conflicts would make him a great anti-hero but the character relies on his logic to see the greater good. One of my favorite events is the death of Agent Coulson. Only because you can feel the loss from all characters, and Nick Fury being the opportunistic leader he is, uses that hurt to motivate a team that might not have exited without the tragedy.Overall, the movie is very well done and lived up to all my expectations.Look forward to the sequel.",9,1,7,23 January 2013
Argo," Nail-biting; Intelligently made
","One of the best movies of 2012.Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of our best directors.The film starts out perfectly with the Iranian Revolution setting the stage for what becomes a nail-biting race against time for the six American hostages to escape.Couple that expense with the dark comic reliefs of the Hollywood types who conspire with the CIA to rescue the hostages, and you have a near perfect blend of a great movie.I'm sure that if we were to investigate historic accuracy we would find errors with this movie, but the point here was to tell a true story in a way that will entertain and captivate the audience. Argo has done that.",9,0,1,23 January 2013
Good Will Hunting," One of the best Independent Films of all time
","Hands down one of my favorite movies of all times. The intelligent writing from Matt and Ben makes this a classic and must have for any library.Matt Damon and Robin Williams were the perfect duo for this film, and probably performed one of their best bodies of work each. This films manages to find emotional breakdown or breakthrough if you will, without losing the tough, sarcastic, street talk and mentality. Although there is an important female character, it does not carry the story or is primarily responsible Matt's character's motivation. Instead, this film is more about ALL aspects of life although Will Hunting does make a crucial final decision based around his girlfriend.Great Movie with classic one-liners.",9,1,3,23 January 2013
