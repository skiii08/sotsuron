Alien 3," New dimension to Alien serial
","As Cameron did it with his sequel to Scott's master-piece, David Fincher gave to this brilliant horror saga new dimension. His Alien is dark and pessimistic psychological thriller with religious subtext and brilliant atmosphere of despair. Few years later, Fincher became, playing on the pretty much same card, the most important movie director in recent decade.",7,0,2,29 June 2002
Mulholland Drive," Terrifying and beautiful at the same time
","Lynch is definitely back in his full power and brilliant madness. Mulholland Drive is terrifying and beautiful at the same time, without some meaning, but just perfect in its visual component. After boring and unnecessary Straight Story, this is director of Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man and Twin Peaks back and, hopefully, here to stay. Fantastic!",9,1,2,3 June 2002
