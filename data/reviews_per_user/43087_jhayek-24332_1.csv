First Man," Decide not to show American Flag on Moon - welcome to the big flop, won't see your movie
","Since you decided that not showing the planting of the American flag on the moon to be politically correct - your movie was a flop. You can think that Americans are'nt patriotic, because those you surround yourselves with are not. Well the proof is at the box office. Maybe overseas you'll get someone to watch an American accomplishment! Ironic huh?",1,10,20,27 October 2018
