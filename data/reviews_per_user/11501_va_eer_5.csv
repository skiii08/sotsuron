The Expendables 2," Ugh! What a waste of time... this movie is a farce using old
","heroes who have been cut more by a plastic surgeon than from actions on the fantastical battle grounds that they poorly occupy. Just looking at Chuck Norris's 'squinty' eye job and Stallone's funky lips augmentation made me laugh... I know many of the scenes are tongue-in-cheek but the lack of acting makes one try to leave the theater sooner than later... FWIW, I went to the movie after a buddy BEGGED me to go... he has offered innumerable apologies since...So, go if you want to see a lot of things blow up and go KABOOM have fun but don't go thinking that this is a version of Band of Brothers... lock this movie up and throw away the key.",3,7,15,23 August 2012
The Prestige," Very predictable... the movie that should have had it's own
","disappearing act.... totally cheesy. Geesh... The plot was interesting at first but became annoying and petty as the two magicians jealously attacked their so-called 'tricks'. It was as if it was expected for me to become OVERWHELMED with emotion as I learned the true magic behind one of the tricks... hell, the 'magic' behind this trick was predicted 30 minutes before it was revealed... my friend and I both fidgeted and just wished that the damn movie would just end sans all the needless drama at the end... BTW, how long does it take to die from a gunshot to the abdomen? Whaaaaah... the pain, the misery, the demise of a wicked magician... Blah, blah, blah... the bottom line... boring, predictable, cheesy.",6,1,7,28 October 2006
District 9," Alian apartheid? I argued with my girlfriend to go see this movie
","in place of seeing 'Time Traveler's Wife'... I do not like chick flicks and argued that District 9 would amuse her... I was WRONG and I have to pay dearly... she hated it and I kinda, sorta liked it...First of all, the graphics were EXCELLENT and they were well integrated with true characters... but did we have to suffer through the obvious apartheid lesson for soooooo long? I lived in South Afica for a bit and hated anything to do with apartheid but the director forces us to re-learn the whole evil lesson... much of the 1st third of the movie could have been deleted / shortened but remain effective with telling the apartheid horrors...So, I still gave it a '6'... the acting was a tad amateurish but that gave the movie a local South African flavor... a little more editing and this movie is much better... again, the graphics were great...",6,0,1,9 September 2009
Bridesmaids," Pulllease... this movie was compared to Hangover and that is
","totally off base... the recent NPR review made such a statement and this was the ONLY way I'd see such a movie with my girlfriend. This movie is a chick flick plain and simple with average acting, predictable and boring story line, and MANY missed opportunities for interesting plot twists... all I can say is this is a RENTAL at best... and only for my girlfriend.So, NPR and other reviewers, stop the subterfuge by comparing a REAL comedy like Hangover with a total chick flick that makes poor attempts at humor... the farting and puke scenes were totally stupid... my girlfriend thinks I'm stupid because I only laugh if a guy pukes or farts... well... maybe guys are better actors (I just dodged a flying object... LOL)...Bottom line.... this is a very average movie that is simply too cute to be good...",2,11,21,28 May 2011
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig makes for an GREAT 007....
","The 007 in Casino Royale is smooth but not a 'pretty boy'... he can get caught off his guard but recovers well... damn! Talk about a hard-body dude... I just wish I had his physique after busting my ass at the gym 4-5 times a week... totally jealous! LOL Thumbs up for a job well done... bravo! The primary critique of the entire movie is the card-playing scene with every token race and sex represented... not that having proper representation is not AOK but it just seemed forced. And, of course, the card game outcome is VERY predictable but with a great twist...I was hoping for a car that could do everything (as an Austin Martin should... LOL) but there were several cool cars just the same...Do you want to see one of the best on-foot chase scenes you'll ever see? I was dizzy at how two 'cats' chased each other all over the place... very nice... super moves, dangerous stunts... wow!!!Overall... this was a fun James Bond movie... not too many techno tricks that seem far-fetched, typical beautiful women, AND NO CAR CHASE SCENES (sorry if that gives anything away but they are sooooo laborious)...",8,2,4,23 November 2006
