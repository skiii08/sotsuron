The Ring," No.
","Okay, did I just watch a different movie than everyone else? I am a horror movie fanatic, and this movie just was not scary. I love to be scared, and it doesnt take much to scare me. If you've seen the sixth sense, stir of echoes, the shinning, then you have pretty much seen this movie before. The twist ending is alright and the movie looks pretty good(David Fincher rip off). But to compare this movie the way they did to some classic real horror movies is just wrong.",Null,0,1,4 March 2003
Halloween," The blackest eyes.
",Michael Jordan. Tiger Woods. Wayne Gretsky. Muhammad Ali. Babe Ruth. The greatest in their respective sports? Probably. Halloween the greatest in its genre? Without question. How can a movie still be scary when you know what is going to happen? I don't know. But it is.,Null,0,1,4 March 2003
