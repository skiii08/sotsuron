Walk the Line," Ray who?
","This movie was everything that Ray could have been. It followed a distinct line of young Cash's life, yet didn't weigh you down to where it became a drudge to watch. For example, his strained relationship with his father. It showed you just enough to let you know it happened. It didn't show you every painful little detail. Also, the death of his brother was shown in tasteful memory with him touching the saw at Folsom Prison. Not the over-dramatic portrayal of Ray Charles feeling water on the floor and a hand grabbing him. Cash's memory of his brother wasn't done in such a over the top manner, making it much more realistic. Phoniex (sp) does a spectacular job, from the stage antics to sounding like Cash enough that this didn't have to be a lip-sync film with two different voices. (Those of the actors and those of the original performers.) I felt Witherspoon was a little more attractive that June Carter, but really captured her voice and mannerisms. If this movie does not win an Oscar, then the Academy really is as rigged as everyone already thinks it is.",9,1,3,25 November 2005
