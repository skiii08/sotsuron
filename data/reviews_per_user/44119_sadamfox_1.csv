Requiem for a Dream," The slowest & the most boring 100 min I have ever experienced in my life
","I don't know what the hell came to me to watch this movie... Probably because the high rating it received and someone commented that the time he spent Watchingit this movie was the hardest time he spent in his life WHAT is the point of the story& what about the plot? A plot should have a rising action which represents the conflict of the story in this case taking drugs. And the plot will also contain a resolution in which in this case it should be trying to overcome the problem of taking drugs and what it did to there lives, NO BUT not in this movie, everyone's life get messed up at the end. The good thing about this movie that it could scare junkies and addicted people from taking drugs... So I recommend this movie to junkies and addicted people, other than that it is a waste of time",3,2,6,12 September 2006
