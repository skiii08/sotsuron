The Lobster," Something here went terribly wrong
","Let's start with positive things. There is a great cast. Rachel Weisz makes a brilliant performance as a woman falling in love and especially the part when she is blinded is so well played.Sadly she didn't get more screen time. Colin Farrell is nearly every cut on screen and the only one who gets space to develop effectively. He makes his job very good as a man trying to fit in the system and searching love but also as someone who isn't able to find it on this way. Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw and Olivia Coleman as well were able to make their less time on screen effective. They all use their limited space of action given by the playbook really great. The biggest surprise for me was Angeliki Papoulia. Only around 20 minutes in the movie, but I don't remember someone being more realistic heartless. Also the work with the camera, especially in the woods, is well done. The colors always seem to be depressive and fixing to the intention of the Lobster. The world is so realistic created that I started feeling uncomfortable while watching it and thinking of what I would do in this world. The fact they didn't use make up also made everything in the presenting very realistic and touching. So what went wrong? Great idea, great cast, great production - but the two hours felt so long. The intention is explained very fast and is repeated and repeated again and again-BORING! The dialogues are most of the time useless and inconsequential. It helped at the beginning to understand the world of being pushed into relationships; to understand the constraint. But after 30 minutes it is clear what they wanted to say so why to continue this? At the end we have a story and idea could easily get around 8 points. We have a crew that could easily get 10 points...but what came out isn't even close being a good movie. The cast saved the Lobster to get an rating as an average movie, but without the movie would be on my list of worst movies 2015- sadly.",5,2,3,13 August 2016
La La Land," Like a wave it hits you and takes it with you-and you will enjoy
","The Atmosphere: They found so many different, inspiring places in Los Angeles-I never really knew that there are so many different forms of atmosphere in this city. They used perfectly colors and lightning to create a nice and sweet area, that really warmed my heart. Make Up and Costumes were very authentically chosen and made me feel like it was REAL. The use of camera and the sound are very good (but average good). Emma Stone: This girl can sing!!! I didn't think after Easy A she can hit a note:D, but she really has a sweet voice and in the right moments it turns out to be very powerful and energetic. She has a perfect and very high range of emotions and can express these very good. This role will push her many steps up on the ladder. Ryan Gosling: He has a great voice too. I like his acting very much and I think he gave his best, but at some parts I believe he was weaker than Emma- but still a magical performance. The Cast: Many talented actors in there, but you don't really recognize them, because the two lead actors are always more or less alone in the focus. They made their job good, but hadn't enough time to develop. The Story: The only weak thing in here is, that you don't really understand how they fall in love (this is too short explained). The rest is awesome. They seem very happy while chasing their dreams and their love and then it turns and they nearly caught their dreams, but these dreams collide with the love. I think, this is a clever story and what you see on screen is perfectly worked out. At the end, when they decided to have own lives without each other to achieve their dreams, and they look at each other and see how their life could have been if they stayed together, I cried so hard. And this is the point. You laugh, you cry, you are happy and you are sad. All this in one package. The Music: I love the songs, they stuck in my head just one second after they finished an they didn't leave. I am not a musician, but I love these arrangements. I will buy these soundtrack!!! Best Scenes: 1) Opening 2) A lovely night 3) Audition (Fools who dream) 4) EpilogueThis is the best musical I ever saw and one of the best movies I ever saw. It deserves every good review and every award. I will be live and see this rule the Oscars!!!",10,4,10,13 January 2017
Am√©lie," If you feel down this Movie will bring you to Heaven
","Let's start with the best: Yann tiersen and his magic music. The mostly piano-based songs are so touching and truly beautiful that you can't watch this movie without loving the music. It is fitting to every single scene of the movie-supporting the feelings that Amelie is having. Audrey Tautou plays the character of Amelie Poulin, a mid-twenty waitress and outsider who is searching for love in her life. Randomly she finds a box in her apartment, hidden by a child many years ago. She tries everything to bring the box and the owner back together and when she does, she realizes that she wants to help people in life and that she wants to punish people who aren't behaving nice (especially to other persons). On this way Tautou plays excellent the role and of the dreamy woman without any plans in life just letting everything go. In the parts Amelie is sad or down Tautou manages great to change from her positive attitude to complete sadness and is the whole movie 100% authentic. When she is seeing smiling or happy it's like a constraint that you have to smile too. The other characters (mostly neighbors) are all clever designed and are able to give their roles some realness that I didn't expect. In these movie every role seems like someone you could see like this the next day on your way to work. It seems like this world created by Jeunet is not from a playbook-it's the real world. The dialogues are matching instantly to this. Very authentic story lines. In a movie based on the theme to find the small things in life that make you happy it is very necessary that the atmosphere is great. Here for example the team completely cleaned every spot in Paris they were using to give the atmosphere more 'magic'. And it works. After this movie I was more able to recognize the beauty in architecture, nature and people all around me in my daily life-just like Amelie is recognizing this.The intention completely works and the message is easily transmitted. And of course the best music every used in a movie. I have nothing bad to say. Great acting with a stunning leading Actress-local and realistic spots- clever story and dialogues.YANN TIERSEN. This is probably the best movie to give you a smile and one of the true masterpieces of this century.",10,0,1,22 June 2016
