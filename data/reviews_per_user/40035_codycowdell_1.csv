It," Comedy movie with very little fright scenes involved
","The trailer made the movie look like it was going to be a horror film when in reality it turned out to be more of a comedy. The cinematography, lighting, and the majority of character actors were well played and this movie is very much an adaptation of Stephen King's Novel IT. When I say adaptation, I mean: line for line, straight out of the book! The movie is filled with humor, potty jokes (that kids should not know), cheesy fight scenes, and a few hilarious punch-lines. You will probably be disappointed if you see this movie while comparing it to the first one, but overall a decent movie if you watch it with a fresh perspective. Cheesy movie that was set-up by amateurs. 5/10",5,25,50,8 September 2017
