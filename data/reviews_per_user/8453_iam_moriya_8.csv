Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Cartoon-Noir
","I'm a sucker for cartoons, and I'm also a sucker for film noir. So when you mix these two genres I can either love it or hate it. In the chase of Roger Rabbit, I love it.In a world where cartoon characters and humans co-exist a man called Marvin Acme is found murdered. Someone dropped a piano on his head. The suspect is a cartoon rabbit, named Roger, who's only hope lies on the human detective Eddy Valiant. There is still one problem, Eddy isn't that found of toons.Blending the darker aspects of film noir with the humor of cartoons isn't an easy task, but this movie succeeds very well. Bob Hoskins does a great job as Eddy Valiant, especially since most of his costars aren't real. And Christopher Lloyd plays one of the most scary villains yet seen in cinema.For old cartoon fans like myself there are a lot to be happy for. A lot of our old favorites shows up. The most hilarious, and in my opinion funniest, part is the piano duel between Donald and Daffy Duck. But other characters will show up their well known faces, too. Even Betty Boop has a small cameo.This is a great movie to watch with your kids a rainy afternoon. And if you don't have any, see it anyway. It's good to laugh after all!",9,2,2,18 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Welcome to the Caribbean!!!
","Pirates. What were they thinking? They're making a film based on a attraction at Disney land. A film based on a roller-coaster!? Are they nuts? No, they're not. Say whatever you want about Bruckheimer but he knows what the audience wants to see. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films so far in late years. Pirates is a perfect movie too watch on a rainy afternoon. Classical Sunday matine. Give me this film, some snacks, candy and a bottle of Cola and I'm satisfied for a couple of hours. It has humor and action, two very important thing nowadays, and it has a quite good story and fantastic characters. You just got to like Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp, being a brilliant actor, gives one of his best performances so far. I don't know how much of Captain Sparrow that comes from Johnny and how much of him that's in the script but ones thing for certain: He is one of the most lovable fictional characters in a long time.But just because Jack is the best character this movie doesn't lack good supporting characters. Elizabeth is a cool chick and I would like to see her use a sword in the next movie. Barbossa is a very good villain and the Thomson & Tompson like pirate duo on Barbossa ship is a funny couple. Sadly enough Will Turner is a very lame character, but he became better in the sequels. Just don't expect to see a realistic movie about piracy. This movie is far from realistic. Like I've said before, it is a classic Sunday matin√©e.So, to wrap things up, what do I think about 'Caribbean'? Well, it's a lovely place. It's a nice vacation for a couple of hour. It has sandy beaches, great pubs and the people are wonderful. Overall, their is only one problem with 'the Caribbean'. For some reason the rome is ALWAYS GONE!",10,0,2,25 July 2005
Batman Returns," Batman Returns
","I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman and ending with Batman & Robin.This movie, Batman Returns, is the second Batman film made by Burton and, this is sad, the last of the old movie to be worth the money. After this there were no good Batman films until Nolan and Goyer decided to make their version of The Dark Knight. With the Joker gone, this film starts to focus on the character it should focus on: Batman. That said, it still gives all the characters a moment to shine. Batman faces two of his deadliest foes: Catwoman and the Penguin, along with the corrupt businessman Max Shreck (named after the guy who played Nosferatu). The cast is great. DeVito was born to play Penguin, Walkens character is the real villain and Michelle Pfeiffer is hot and purrfect as Catwoman (pardon the pun). Once again Burton got the setting right. Gotham during Christmas is a wonderful background to have during this story, that in fact is better then the 89 version. In many things, this is the better Burton film.Then again, on the more important parts, this is the not so good version. Once again Burton got the characters all wrong. Catwoman is, if not true to the original, still good though. She turns into a thief/vigilante after, like the Joker would put it, she had a really bad day. She still is the grey part in Batmans black and white world and she actually makes him love her. So she works and therefor she's okay. The Penguinis was changed radically. He has become a freak who lives in the sewers and is the leader of an ex-circus crew. But, after all, Penguin never was a good villain to begin with. The worst thing is that they took one of the plots, there's more than one, from the old Batman series with Adam West. The Penguin runs for mayor?! WTF is going on? The Penguins other plot is way better but spoiled because of lack of time. That is sad.Still, the ending is great and it is still an enjoyable movie. I'll have it in my collection along with Batman and the new Batman films by Nolan. But Schumachers movies is better of forgotten. 'Merry Christmas, Alfred. Good will towards men... and women.'

Batman Begins," The Dark Knight has returned!
","Batman is one of the coolest superheroes around I must say that this movie is, not only the second best super hero movie, but the best Batman movie so far.Batman has been very humiliated because of the lousy TV-show with Adam West. Come on, that was more like a joke on all what Batman stands for. For me, Batman is a Dark Knight. And thankfully, Batman doesn't make any bad jokes in this movie. He is like I wan't him to be: A serious crime fighter.But this doesn't mean that this film lacks humor. Bruce Wayne has one or two funny one liners and Alfred surely is a good humor relief. Like J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man movies. But back to the D.C hero.This movie has a line of good actors, a really good story and some nice settings. Gotham City really feels like Gotham City. And the places in Asia is also very well done. This is a good version on Batmans beginning and early days. And I can't wait until the continue.Til then I'm very glad to say that we can forget the bad films that Joel did. Now, the Dark Knight has returned.",9,0,1,15 August 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick at his finest
","I'm a guy who like quality before quantity. Less is more if you know what I'm saying. So Stanley Kubrick is for obvious reasons one of my all-time favorite directors. He didn't make many movies, but those he made are excellent works of art. And that brings me to my personal favorite of all his movies: A Clockwork Orange.The film is about a young man named Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). He is a guy who likes music, especially Beethoven, but he is also found of rape and ultra violence.One night however, he get's arrested and goes to jail. In jail he hears about an experiment, were criminals are turned from bad to good. Still, as the priest puts it: 'Goodness is something to be chosen. When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man.' Alex goes through this experiment and returns to society being, as it seems, 'cured' from his criminality. Or is he? A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant piece of film-making, making us ask question. What is good and bad about man? What makes us good or bad? And at the same time this is a very psychological movie questioning our own moral code. Do we have the right to force people into goodness? Okay, some people may not like the film. Either because they can't understand the psychological bit or because they don't like the violence. I took this to school once and there were only me and another one who liked it. This is a very raw film, even with todays standards and it's nothing for the faint of heart. But if you wan't to see an intelligent film about the dark side of man, this is a film for you.'It had been a wonderful evening and what I needed now, to give it the perfect ending, was a little of the Ludwig Van.' - Alex",10,1,2,6 August 2007
Pulp Fiction," One of the best there is
","I don't like John Travolta. Every movie with his name on it works for me as a 'big red signal flag.' It's not that I think he is a bad actor. Not at all. But he does bad movies. In his best times all he did was musicals, and I hate musicals. Nowadays he plays the bad guy in bad movies. But there is no rule without exception. And in Travoltas case that is a huge exception: Pulp Fiction.I hadn't seen this movie but I wanted to when my friend allowed me to lend it from him. I watched it and I really, really enjoyed it.The movie is, like the title says, simply pulp fictions. A lot of stories set in the same universe with lovely characters and, as usual when Quentin is around, great dialog. During this film we get to hear interesting conversations about hamburgers, foot massage, pot belly's and how you can rob a bank with a cell phone. Don't try the last one though since it is in fact, well, illegal.Thanks to this one and Reservoir Dog I consider myself a Quentin Tarantino fan. The man knows how to make smart and entertaining movies by mixing everything that made him want to become a director in the first place. Some would call it original but if you ask me it's simply how the business works. Here's a movie that started a revolution when it came out. If you haven't watched it this should be the #1 on your have to watch list.'Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.' - Vincent Vega",10,0,3,2 July 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," 'It's a deal, it's a steal, it's the best film of the 20th century!!!!
","If I were to chose one, just one, movie of all the ones I've seen and say that this is with no doubt my absolute favorite one I would pick Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Because, in my opinion, it is the best movie ever created.The most important thing for a film is story. And most of the good stories are based around the characters. And Lock, Stock has got some of the best characters around. Barry the Baptist, Ed, Soap, Tommy, Bacon, The Ganja Guys, Rory Breaker, Big Chris & Little Chris, Hatchet Harry, the list goes on and on. And each and every one of them get's their moment to shine.The second most important thing is how you tell the story. In some cases, it is actually more important than the actual story. A person who had actually heard the famous fairy teller H.C. Andersen said that he was popular for his way of telling a his stories. And if anyone can tell a good story it is Guy Ritchie. The way you get the story in Lock, Stock is really, really sweet. Sure, Guy has obviously been inspired by Quentin Tarantino, but he is not the only one. Lock, Stock contains the essence of good film-making from the last centuary and, for example, the movie has also got a lot of references to the works of Sergio Leone.So to me this movie is perfect. The actors, script, characters, dialouge etc. Every single piece. There is a reason this is my favorite movie of all time.Well, I can't talk any more know. Writing this review made me wanna watch Lock, Stock again. And so should you.'There's no money, there's no weed. It's all been replaced by a pile of corpses.' Tom.",10,0,1,6 July 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One flew east, one flew west....
","'One flew over the Cuckoo's nest' is, with no doubt, one of the best movies out there. It is the peak of the New Hollywood era, with The Godfather as it's only equal. At least, thats my humble opinion.The story is about Randall Patrick McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson in one of the best performances of all time. He is a smalltime criminal who is sent to a mental institution. While there he soon turns the place upside down. You see, McMurphy is a free spirit and soon becomes a bitter rival of Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher. The big nurse is nothing short of a tyrant corrupted by power. She rules her patients with an iron hand, that is until Randall enters the place.Both Fletcher and Nicholson got awarded for their roles but in my opinion all the actors are magnificent, even if those two are the ones who shine the brightest.But this movie is not only great because of it's actors. It is a great story worthy of being told about human rights, the importance of freedom and how power corrupts. But that is only the way I see it, you may have a different view. Any way, there is no reason for you not to see this movie. It is a great cinematic tale. And the fact that it has one of the greatest endings scenes of all time doesn't hurt either.'But at least I tried, God dammit. At least I did that' - McMurphy",10,0,2,18 August 2005
