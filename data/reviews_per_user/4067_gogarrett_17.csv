The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It worked for me
","I read all the books and there were changes in the movie, but I think all were good changes. Some less necessary characters are missing and others, like Effie and Snow are expanded upon from what was in the book. The set up appears perfect for what comes next and the sets and action scenes looked really good. I think the slower pacing of the characters is very important in this movie, because of all the changes that are happening with every one of them. I like what this movie did to fill in the gaps of what we could know in the book, because we could only see what Katniss saw in the book. It gives me more to look forward to in each movie. I wonder how much Plutarch will need to change in the last sequel because Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't finish filming his parts before he died? I can't believe we have to wait an entire year to see the final installment!",9,73,156,22 November 2014
Iron Man 3," Great fun if you don't try to think through everything
","I had a great time watching this movie, but even while in the theater kept going, 'now wait a minute!' for this and that. We all talked about things that happened that didn't really make sense and tried to explain it away. When that didn't work, we decided to just let it go and enjoy the overall fun factor of the movie. In truth though, we wished the writers or director had thought about things in the story that viewers would question. I have more than 3 things off the top of my head I questioned, but don't want to include spoilers here. I loved the bad guys. Great job by Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and the rest. If you wait until all those credits roll, you will see more footage at the very end. Not sure it was worth the wait though.",8,1,3,31 May 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Loved the idea of a Star Wars side story, didn't strike all the right chords
","This was a great idea to give us a little Star Wars movie between the big Star Wars movies. Starting out with a family of farmers with secret identities hiding out on a remote planet is pretty standard fare for Star Wars, and all of the other story lines meshed with what we know. The audience is gradually led to see how all the new characters are to fit in, but soon enough figure out how it will all end. That probably didn't help this movie. The characters were likable enough or evil enough but my favorite character was the robot K-2S0, humorously played by Alan Tudyk. I was stunned by the return of Grand Moff Tarkin just as he looked in 1977 Star Wars and thrilled by appearances of four other 1977 Star Wars characters (2 were the original actors). It was amazing special effects. Better than the Terminator reappearances of a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger imo. At the end of this movie we walked out feeling like, okay, so that's what happened. We also thought it causes problems for the story that picks up in Star Wars IV: A New Hope. I would have preferred a more elated or bereaved feeling at the end of a movie like this, and to not have questions about the Star Wars story plausibility. Also, the word Hope in this movie was pretty over used now that I think about it. Still a decent movie which answers a question. A question that could have just remained a mystery.",7,1,4,19 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Does it get any better than this?
","No it does not. This movie had everything anyone could possibly want times mega 3D action to boot. As a long time Trekkie I couldn't be happier with the direction J.J. Abrams is taking the franchise. It is packed with a humorous reverence for all things original Star Trek, but adds so much more to the mix. The crew clicks well together just as the original crew did and the stories are fresh but also familiar. I don't want to spoil anything. This is a movie anyone with a strong heartbeat will enjoy. Check it out! I plan to watch it in the theater again as soon as possible. This time not so close to the screen! The close ups and 3D action are very intense.",10,11,25,18 May 2013
Knives Out," Much better than I expected
","I went to this movie because I love a good mystery. I thought it would be hysterically funny, but it wasn't. The characters were well defined in a brief period of time and every single actor got a juicy part in the story. Almost all of them got to show a bit of humor in their part, which is probably one reason it has comedy in the movie description. I find if I say anything about any one of those characters I MIGHT give too much away. Kudos to writer, director, actors and that wonderful house setting. This is the kind of movie you will want to watch again to see what more you might spot the second time.",8,1,2,25 December 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," What a triumph for Marvel! It just keeps getting better :D
","I never give 10 stars but I can't stop thinking about this movie days after seeing it. All the story lines are brilliantly intertwined for all the varied superheroes and past movies. We were left devastated, but hopeful at the end of this one. 
I had to run out and rent Thor: Ragnorok the next day to help make sense of a few things. Glad I saw most of the others because it makes this film all the richer. I just need to see the Dr. Strange movie to get a totally complete picture, then you can be sure I will be watching Infinity War again! 
This movie pulls on just about every emotion and leaves us craving more story, more answers. Who will return and who will not. This is what it's all about. We are getting attached to every character, love them teaming together in fun, battle and in tragic times. They are each fantastic in their own way. I can't wait until May to see Part 2, and all the Marvel movies that are to come. Final note: Iron Spider MUST LIVE!",10,1,3,1 May 2018
The Theory of Everything," Engrossing look into a park of Hawking's life
","I was spellbound by this portrayal of Hawking and those close to him during a pivotal period of his life I knew nothing about before going to the theater today. I found myself in suspense, saddened, crying, and delighted at different points in the film and continue to think it all over afterward. I am sure someone will get an Academy Award for this movie. I didn't give it 10 stars because I wanted more than awkward stares in certain parts of the movie. But that may have been a good thing. I was also surprised to see the story was written by his wife, Jane, which made it all the more interesting for me. It felt like each part of the story was starkly honest and yet handled in a tasteful, more palatable way than it could have been. Now I am wondering how much was true and how much might have been fictionalized. It was a good movie nonetheless and helped me understand more about Stephen Hawking than I would have otherwise.",9,0,1,1 January 2015
Hidden Figures," Amazing story. Makes me want to read more about the characters
","This was an excellent movie which needed to be made, as these 3 women made a big impact in our history and yet I doubt many of us knew that. I was impressed with the acting, directing and that Pharrell Williams was a big part of this project, which I did not know going in. I also thought the time period was captured pretty well. I just saw the movie and am now dying to know more about the actual characters the movie was based on. The movie just covered enough of what happened and the people involved to make me crave to learn more. Well done!",8,1,7,5 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun movie but The Avengers was better
","From the casting, writing, directing, cgi, sound and adaptation from the comics this was a wonderful movie. It would have been nice to know a bit more about the villains and Nova Corps however. I can't wait to find out more about Star Lord's father and what this new team will be doing next. The jokes made us laugh, the action was intense and satisfying and I think I felt teary once or twice, but no strong emotion left with me from the theater as it did after watching The Avengers; Captain America, the Winter Soldier; and Thor, the Dark World. Well, actually I did have one lasting emotional response, after seeing the scene following the final credits. I felt a resounding 'NOOOOOOOOOO!' in my brain because I saw the first one. Please Marvel - don't go there! Any of us who saw the first one won't even be tempted to view another. July 2016 add: I was referring to a return of 'Howard, the Duck' which I saw in the theater in 1986. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.",8,1,5,4 August 2014
Logan," Major violence, foul language and sadness abounds
","I read a few other reviews and cannot imagine how this movie could be called a beautiful swan song for Logan or Xavier. Logan is a grumpy old alcoholic with lethal tendencies who is soured by the horrors of his life. The story in this movie confirms that he has good reason to be this way. It was not my kind of comic book material. I only give it a 7 because it wasn't horrible as a movie. Just really over the top with swearing and horrific reality-based violence compared with other X- Men movies. I rate it less than other X-Men movies because the mutant powers are not shown as much as I think they could have been, other than the heavy use of claws. For example - Caliban was a pretty important character and I don't feel we really ever knew what his mutant power was. Certainly it wasn't just being sensitive to sunlight.On a side note about Xavier. We saw him die in X-Men: The Last Stand. Then we saw him alive at the end of The Wolverine, at a time Logan was grieving dead Jean Grey. Logan looked surprised at Xavier's appearance but there was no explanation other than 'I have a few tricks up my sleeve'. I am wondering if this was explained in Days of Future Past and I just don't remember it. His death back in The Last Stand really hit hard and he was dead a good 7 years between movies, only to be alive up until the year 2029 and well, you will know when you see the movie.",7,2,6,21 March 2017
Selma," Excellent and moving film
","We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",9,73,103,24 January 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Very nice remake of 1991 animated classic
","The biggest impression from seeing this remake was 'Wow, it's just like the 1991 animated movie!' The biggest changes are that both Beauty and the Beast are given back stories about their parents, you glean more about the enchantress that cast the spell, and there are a few character changes that are very slight, including a Wardrobe with a more amazing singing voice than Jo Ann Worley who has an unlikely hookup with the Cadenza played by-over-the top Stanley Tucci. Most of the music is the same, with different voices of course. It's all very nice, but leaves you yearning for the original singers nonetheless, especially Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts and Jerry Obach as Lumiere. Emma Thompson makes a fine Mrs Potts, but it is hard to replace Angela Lansbury.Kevin Kline inevitably made the part of Maurice, Belle's father, more engaging and memorable. Kudos to Luke Evans Gaston and Josh Gad's LeFou. They really let loose to actually become their animated over-the-top counterparts. The twist on LeFou's character at the end made perfect sense!There are a couple songs I don't remember from the original, perhaps because they are less memorable altogether? At the end is a powerful rendition of 'Evermore' where I was thinking that the Beast, played by Dan Stevens, has a much better singing voice than I thought. Then the credits rolled by and I saw that song was by Josh Grogan. Very, very nice! Go see this movie. Then you will also want to watch the 1991 version again I bet.",8,2,10,17 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Exploration into a myriad of prejudices and discrimination against anyone with differences
","The movie ranked highly for me in being well acted and artistically framed. The message was clear. The movie was set in a time we can safely think we have evolved away from, to more easily show the cruelties of prejudice and discrimination toward job rank and education, people with disabilities, women, people of color, homosexuals, people who believe differently (the Russian scientist) and non-humans. The crazed 'villian' was motivated mostly by his ambition and his extreme limitations as a person, not because he was evil. It was surreal seeing him in his happy 50's or early 60's home environment, as if his family had no clue to who he was. I wished the movie included a truly fleshed out back story for the characters, especially the two lovers. All of the central characters gave us bits and pieces of their backstory, but not enough for me to really latch onto and feel engaged enough to care deeply about them. I think that would have helped me in this story. I do like how the artist friend speaks his assumptions about how it ended for the lovers, however I am not sure that was to be believed. I would not care to watch this movie again. Final opinion of the movie: A message movie which is artistic and sometimes beautiful, yet heavy handed at the same time.",7,2,5,1 May 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Went with no expectations. Very pleased. STAY TO THE END!
","I came to watch another movie and ended up in the Kong theater. The previews I had seen before looked promising; however, I have never liked Kong movies before. This one was very different. I liked the changes and all the surprises in this version, taking place in 1973 after the Vietnam War. Some parts of the film were very intense and violent and parts were sprinkled with welcome humor, mostly because of the character of Hank Marlow, played by John C Reilly. I recommend this movie for adult viewing. The acting, writing, directing, filming, sets and cgi/special effects were all top notch. If you haven't seen the movie yet I have 2 recommendations for you. Watch all the way past the credits for the surprise ending AND keep your eye on the actor Toby Kebbell, who until now I thought just played the part of the soldier, Jack Chapman. I can't say any more without ruining this review with spoilers. Go see the movie.",8,13,25,9 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Best of the 3
","I was pleased with everything Peter Jackson created in this last installment. During the first two movies I was having issues with all the things that were not like the book, especially adding new characters and relationships - but the drama, action and the essential thread of the story was so well created and acted out in this installment that I was able to put all my issues aside and enjoy the ride and all of the characters. It was actually fun to see scenes that did not happen in the book, which helped bring the story full circle into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy filmed a decade earlier. One of the big character changes in all of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies is that the writers always add more female characters. It's a smart move, even though at first I objected to there being a Tauriel elf girl and Legolas present as the son of Thranduil in this version of the Hobbit. It's also great to see the casting people use New Zealand actors in each movie, since that is where the filming happened. It was really fun to see the return of characters from the first 3 movies in this last Hobbit movie, even if they may not all have actually appeared on the pages of the book. I am ready to go see the movie again to pick up on details I missed, including the fact that a familiar actor I watch on the Arrow t.v. series played the leader of the Orc army, Azog. He was totally CGI of course, but now I will be looking for the actor, Manu Bennett, in the CGI version of him, like I was watching for Andy Serkis in the Gollum character from the first movies. I also want to rewatch for the signs of the return of dark times in Mordor in relation to Bilbo's finding and use of the ring. I hope Peter Jackson is able to keep making movies of this caliber. The passion and detail of his work as director, writer, creater of other worlds is quite a gift to all of us.",9,4,8,22 December 2014
Finding Dory," Excellent and enjoyable mix of old and new
","This animated movie was exceptionally made in every way. I can't give it as many stars as Finding Nemo however, because there were some slow scenes and the new characters, with the exception of the octopus Hank and the highly amusing addition of Sigourney in the story, were not as memorable as the many fun characters introduced in the first movie. There were some funny 'walk on' characters that did come back from the first movie, which was nice but they were not part of the main story. It definitely felt more like a Disney movie than Finding Nemo did. The interactions of some of the animated characters were more standard fare than the highly original Pixar used to produce. Overall though, this was a fun movie to watch for an adult. The young children with us lost interest about 3/4 of the way through (during a slow period while Dory was lost) and could not appreciate much of the humor in the movie older viewers could, such as reappearances from Finding Nemo and the ubiquitous presence of Sigourney during the final search.",7,3,11,6 July 2016
Incredibles 2," Fun to see these Supers back again
","I enjoyed the movie. It was nice that 3 of the actors talked to us before the movie began to explain the 14 year gap between the original and it's sequel, which at times I thought was 14 years later for the characters as well, however the kids had not aged, so I guess not? Jack Jack turned out to be a very fun addition to the family with a ridiculous number of super abilities by the end. I guess more than 17? I had trouble watching the crazy fast-paced chasing of the Underminer scene toward the beginning. Too much, too early for me. The humor and animation were the best parts of this movie and Edna was in top form. Loved how she interacted with Jack Jack. It was good all the new supers turned evil for awhile so we could see their abilities were more useful than parlor tricks. Reflux man was particularly gross however!",7,1,2,20 June 2018
