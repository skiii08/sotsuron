Hereditary," Don't Watch This Because This is A Masterpiece!
","Here is this little girl named Charlie (Milly Shapiro) with her cute look. She stays with her mother Annie (Toni Collette), father Steve (Gabriel Byene) and brother Peter, (Alex Wolfe). The film starts with the death of Charlie' grand mother (Annie's mom). So Charlie becomes quiet now, she wonders who's gonna take care of her. She used be close to her grandmother.Now this little girl may have a cute face, but her reactions and looks are really scary. As all horror films Hereditary too have some common things like the sky where is no sun, A non city area, there are no neighbors and the rooms are little dark. But definitely Hereditary is not like other horror films, It get it's own class.One day Peter, Charlies brother is about to go to a party and asking if he can borrow a car, so his mother tell him to take his sister to the party. He doesn't want to though. Neither his sister wants to go the party, But their mother managed it. So they are going now by car, charlie on the back seat making a weird sound with her mouth. Her brother Peter may be her brother but they doesn't talk, Charlie is little bit scary. So then they goes to the party the party goes on. Peter goes to smoke weed requesting Charlie to wait a little bit, Charlie says No but somehow stays. Peter goes upstairs, Charlie stars eating a cake and starts feeling she can't breath, her throat is getting bigger, she goes to her brother can't managed to talk. Peter, scared took her to the car, starts driving, Charlie on the backseat trembling, jumping holding her throat. Peter speed up the car to 80 mph. Charlie opens the window, move her head out side the window to take breath from the open air. Peter running car on 80 mph suddenly sees something like a dog in the middle of the road, he scared, moves the car fast, Charlie's head bashed a poster on 80 mile per hour. And that's that. We don't see what happens, the camera is on the face of peter, we don't see what happened in backseat. Peter, scared like hell isn't looking back, After 5 mins he stars the car again. Reach home and went to his bed. At the morning we see peter is not sleeping and we can hear his yelling and crying mother, and then the camera moves to the area where Charlie's head was smashed, and we can see Charlie's head eating by the ants lying in the field, So her mother cried and yelled looking at her half body in the car.That's it. Now I described the scene because I've never so much scared after watching any movie scenes. From this scene it says that the movie is not for everyone. And I'm sorry but any light heart human body can die after watching this. I'm sorry but it's true. The way Ari Aster (the director) made this scene is beyond explanation. The scene has the ability to make anyone believe that they actually see a cut head.This film got 88 on metacritic, now if you follow metacritic and see their top rated movies (Like Manchester By The Sea, Moonlight, Pan's Labyrinth or Boyhood) you will understand how deep these movies are. These movies are always beyond explanation. When you starts watching these you forget that you are watching movie, it becomes complete real. Now when a horror movie becomes real, then it's Hereditary.Hereditary is so scary and realistic that it can make you feel everything is happening in front of you. So watch a horror movie but not a masterpiece horror movie if your heart is weak.Heart stopping direction, masterclass acting, realistic screenplay, depressing cinematography, disturbing story line, everything combines to a deadliest horrific situation.Though the last 10 minutes of the film makes it feel like what was the importance of the movie. But you will realize that later.Which scene I've described above was just the start of the horrific moments, there are much more. I come to watch this movie because watchmojo put it on the no.1 movie of 2018 where no.2 was Avengers Infinty War. And I want to thank you watchmojo.I cut 3 points because, It's depressing and nobody wants to be depressed, and the ending was not as well satisfying.Above all this is so far the best horror movie of the world that has the ability to kill you, I repeat 'to kill you'.",7,2,4,9 January 2019
The Irishman," Let the door be opened a little
","It's Frank (Robert DeNiro). The whole movie centers around him. From a meat delivery guy to mobster, he have come a long long way. Martin Scorsese's The Irishman gets into the same line with 'No Country For Old Man', 'There Will Be Blood' and 'The Godfather series'. Flawlessly performed and with a masterclass screenplay (that should win the best original screenplay Oscar), The Irishman is one of a highest kind of cinema. Might be long but the minutes are not wasted. The moments are well crafted in the hand of experienced Martin Scorsese. And it seemed like Robert DeNiro didn't even had to memorize the dialogues that how much he is used to Scorsese's characters. Not only just of 2019, it's one of the most impressive movies of this decade and surely gonna be remembered. After all, I personally found The Irishman emotionally drowning and so much humanist till the end. It's not just too much focused in the gore and violence but also takes time to have a look at the real and simple world through the doorway that is slightly opened.",9,2,8,5 December 2019
Gandhi," An Eternal Hope of Living
","At the age of 8 when I first watched the movie, I believed that it was a documentary. Then at the age of 13 when I watched the movie on TV I instantly fell in love with Mahatma. And now watching almost after a several years Gandhi left me with that same feeling of love for him I felt a years ago. Richard Attenborough's Gandhi have all those materials a good film should have. Even though if deeply criticized then the film might not be an eye-catcher for everyone due to the cliche-at-sometime screenplay I find. But Gandhi is not just a movie that makes us believe a person's unique philosophy but a tale that also appreciate the sacrifices of his nearer friends. Also the movie impacts British not as heartless villain but as with true delicacy and perfect human documentary. Never the movie goes too much to make it unbelievable neither it goes too low to feel not much for Bapu.The movie starts with the scene of death of Gandhiji. He is walking down the crowd. Everyone is greeting him. And a guy come to him, touches his feet and shot him getting up. That's the way the film starts. And it goes to the scene where Gandhi, as a young man travelling through the first class of a train and soon kicked out from there. The reason is his skin is brown and he can't be allowed to be travelling at first class. Soon from that day he starts noticing about the fact that how much hate exists in this world between people with different colour, cast and creed.Short, skinny and with no handsome face this man led India to Independence and became a idol of millions. Ben Kingsley's performance is so good that sometimes it's feel like watching a documentary. Tears, anger and emotions all that is showed in a perfect amount by Brilliant Mr.Kingslay. And as about the cinematography and score both are mind blowing. The moment at the Jalianwalabag was a intense piece of film clip. And as about those landscapes of running trains, green crop fields and the sun rays over the lake are amazing to look at not just for the moving camera but also for that amazing piece of soulful music that fulfils the scene with nostalgia.Above all, winner of 8 Oscar and million of people's heart both the movie and Gandhi, as a person leave an impact on my mind that wouldn't easily be forgettable.",10,1,1,2 October 2019
Joker," Joker taught me it's okay to kill people
","It's another busy day in Gotham. And just like other days this guy, as a clown trying to make people laugh in the street. Instead of getting attention he gets insulted, ignored and beaten. He is Arthur Fleck. He wants people to smile but he is always failed. One of his dreams is to go to Murray Franklin's show, one of the biggest TV show hosts in the city who also make people laugh basically. Arthur Fleck has his dreams, a lot of good one but nothing comes true, even something doesn't happen to make that true. His life just goes on this way and at this point, he doesn't even remember if he has ever been happy in his life for a moment at least. This guy still always put on a happy face cause his mother says so.That's what the basic story of Joker is. Joker is a great movie but it reminded me of Into the Wild or Nightcrawler where negativity is been showed positively. Joker, even though he is a villain but everyone claps for him, even that's what Todd Phillips wanted. He made a bad dish look so good that people find it tasty. passively that can not be easily focused. But still, it's not unrealistic, it treats its lead character with true human feelings and emotions. So we can really admit that some guy like Joker can really do exist. That's the best thing about the film. It's true all the way. It's never stupid or dumb or boring. It gifts its fans what they expect. And even more, where Todd Phillips went right is that the film can satisfied non-fanboys as well.The film is so gripping and intense that it reminds me of Hereditary, The Babadook and Get Out. Though I won't say it's disturbing because it was hard to move my eyes from any scene in the film even there was some crispiest one. But all are great. The scene in the train actually starts the creepiness of this film. It tells that we are gonna get some odd ride that would both be disturbing and great. But for people who've seen Raw or The Serbian film will not find anything disturbing but it's truly creepy. Joaquin Phoneix meant to be the Joker. He really could be in the character. The difference between Phoneix and Ledger is that Ledger was Joker but Phoneix is Arthur Fleck.The cinematography in the film is eye-catchy and the score is adrenaline rusher but they are surely not oscar worthy. If the movie gets oscar(s) then it will for the best film or best director or best actor or all three. Gripping, intense, emotional even depressing Joker is the movie that is kind of a mirror to the society but still in a negative way. It could've shown in a much different way that could fully satisfy the critics but it left the audience crazy and unsatisfied telling it's ok to kill people if you are ignored in the society.",7,1,9,8 October 2019
Marriage Story," Marriage Story is one of the most accurately deep and intimate view over a separation.
","I've not waited for this much for any other movie from this year. Marriage Story entertained me in all the way it could. So beautifully and accurately portrayed a separation between two characters (Charlie and Nicole) this movie is going to be staying with me for a very long time. And why this divorce story is titled Marriage Story you need to have a look. From the very beginning seeing the couples have been writing about each other, my eyes got struck. But then it turns out they are on their divorce phrase and they are being told to write about each other in front of a marriage counselor. But Nicole doesn't seem to like what she has just written. So usually she gets angry and gets out of the room.That's how the movie starts. And then it goes deeper through the characters and gives us reasons for the causing and it looks like, that million other divorce cases. 'A Separation', 'Revolutionary Road' or 'Before Midnight' there are a lot of movies made of this same category. But Marriage Story is surely one of the greatest of them. It moves us from the deep inside. It is relatable even if you've never been married but has gone through a breakup. It too looks deep into a couples and their internal issues. The huge fight scene at the end gave me chills just like those fight scenes in Revolutionary Road and Before Midnight.Marriage Story is so well written and personally, I don't want anything more from a movie. I just want a movie that needs to be about people like us and they have to face situations like ours. And Marriage Story is definitely the film to relate our-selves at any phase of our lives. Also, what I want to say is that the screenplay is the most important part of a film and Noah Baumbach did it very well here. The dialogues, they are accurate, like what real people would say. Some moments, so beautifully written to fill our hearts and that's enough for me to give a film full 10 out of 10.The performance from Scarlett Johansson probably is so far the best of her career. And I would definitely say the performance of Adam Driver here is nothing less than Joaquin Phoenix in 'Joker'. Above all, Marriage Story is an emotional journey about two individuals, who were supposed to be together is splitting up. Not just depressing or sad the movie has its moments on comedy too and it's beautiful to look at, nice to listen to and deep to take in.",10,5,7,8 December 2019
