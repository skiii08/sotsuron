The Blair Witch Project," Best Horror Movie in Years - Sequel Please!
","The Blair Witch Project almost defies description, because nothing similar exists to compare it to. Having the actors film themselves was a master stroke. That, combined with the gripping and believable myth behind the plot, make this movie a masterpiece. As a liberal college student, I have much in common with the three characters. I identified totally with them, and felt their pain in the darker moments.The world MUST HAVE a sequel! These film makers need to drop whatever they're doing and start a BWP sequel immediately! : )",10,1,2,8 August 1999
