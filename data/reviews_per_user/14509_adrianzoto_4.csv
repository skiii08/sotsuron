Ford v Ferrari," A car guys MASTERPIECE!
","As a chevorlet fan...this was regardless one of the best movies of all time even though they bashed the corvette. Even if you ARENT into cars this movie was filmed and directed so well. This is in my top 5 movies and i have only seen this movie 2 times in theaters and my top 5 list consists of 1. Shawshank redemption. 2. The Godfather. 3. The Godfather part 2. 4. Scarface. So thats saying something. I highly recommend this movie to everybody reading this dont even think twice about seeing it. Its Matt Damon, Christian Bale, and Jon Bernthal...what more could you ask for. I cant wait to go see it for my 3rd time in theater next weekend with another buddy who hasnt seen it yet.",10,3,6,21 December 2019
Snowden," Fantastic!
",This movie was absolutly excellent! The only people that would rate this movie bad are liberals or anyone that doesnt agree with what he did because they probably work for the shady part of the government. The rubix cube scene was absolutly genius. I have paid to see this movie 3 times when it was in theater all with different people. Amazinf movie!!,10,0,1,4 August 2018
Arrival," Not what i expected or what any of us expected.
","Okay hear me out on this one i dont need anybody going down my throat for this. But this movie was not what ANY OF US expected and you cant even say it was just from the commercials. The commercials from this movie made it seem like an alien invasion/take over the world, almost like a war of the worlds movie with tom cruise. This was far from what it was and i wish the commercials portrayed the actual meaning to this movie. I would have never paid to see this in theater if i knew it was almost a life lesson type of movie. The commercials made this movie seem like an action movie not a personal experience. However, looking past that if you are looking for a movie that is about a life lesson or experience and that was your intention than i could see how people rated this movie so high up. It was just something i was not expecting.",5,1,7,4 August 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Probably my favorite movie of all time.
",If you havent seen this movie you honestly need too. I am 20 Years Old and i just got around to seeing this movie last night. Obviously i was born after this movie was released and i am very sceptical about older movies but i decided to give it a watch....needless to say i will probably rewatch this movie tonight at midnight. This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Everything from the opening scene to the ending scene was incredible. Just another staple and gem to add to the morgan freeman collection. If i could rate this higher than a 10 i most likely would have. This was a fantastic movie,10,0,0,4 August 2018
