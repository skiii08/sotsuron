Moneyball," Its a nice film for sports fans.
","It's one those 'if I'm THAT bored' kind of films after you've watched it once.. or its just a 'OMG ITS BRAD PITT' kind. It is a great film, but it is, unfortunately, about sports. I don't know if anyone has realised that sports films seem to be the weakest of the strong. No matter how amazing this film is, it is about Baseball, so unless you're either a Baseball fan, a film geek or a Brad Pitt groupie, you wont find much interest in this.. Or you just wouldn't give it a chance anyway.Nevertheless, if you are any of the above, you will find this to be a pretty good film, it is chilled so I wouldn't be prepared to be blown away.. But its a good one to watch, maybe whilst lying in bed.Unfortunately, if there are any Jonah Hill fans out there, you won't be too impressed 'cos, well.. It's a serious film. Sure, Jonah Hill still seems to have the same kind of personality, just not as funny or sarcastic.",Null,0,0,24 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Off to a slow finish..?
","Allow me to expand, I found the first Sherlock Holmes an outstanding film, its original but not on the point of experimental. Robert Downey Jr. is a thrill and a laugh to watch in most of his appearances; As Sherlock Holmes though, he was something else, a brilliant mixture of intellect and humour.. Which, in most cases, equals sarcasm on the brink of annoyance. Now, in this one, I think he decided to take the jump, and land straight in the ball-pit we call annoyance.. And the only thing that structures him as a character is maybe being a little bit of a badass, MAYBE. The film start of slow and, yes, ends in a cliff-hanger but getting to the cliff is not a thrilling journey so.. Is it worth it? I've tried to watch the film twice; the first time I managed to get through the first half, the second time I found myself distracting myself during the first half, purely to get to the second. NEVERTHELESS, it is still a movie, a Sherlock Holmes movie too! The picture is great and there are some good action scenes.. But don't expect to be sitting through the credits with a stupid look on your face like 'that was AMAZING' cos its more than likely you're going to be sat there staring at your phone or half-asleep.. or both.",Null,0,0,14 July 2012
