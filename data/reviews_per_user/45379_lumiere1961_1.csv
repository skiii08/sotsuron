Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An awful piece of crap
","Another one of the absolute pieces of crap that has EVER been made and will be forgotten. A majesty of 'toilet' humor that belongs 'straight to video' in this world of quick 'I'd buy that for a dollar' fixes. Please, take the time to enjoy the worth while masterpieces of the early years. In the long run, you will appreciate the 'artsy fartsy' films much more for the rest of your years. You are smart enough and worthy of great art and entertainment! Here are some films for your considatation: Citizen Kane, The third man, The seventh seal, A night at the opera, Casablanca, Rear Window, Psycho, North by Northwest, Vertigo, Dr. Strangelove, Paths of glory, 'M', Metropolis, Touch of Evil, Notorious, Annie Hall, Crimes and misdemeanors, Manhatten, Yojimbo, Dodeska den, Seven samurai, Ran, Horoshima Mon amour, The General, City Lights, Nosferatu, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Night at the opera, A night in casablanca, The seventh seal, It happened one night, Shadow of a doubt, 8 1/2, Les diaboliques, Duck soup, All quiet on the western front, Umberto D, The lady vanishes, The 400 blows, The bicycle thief, The searchers, Chinatown, Paths of glory, Mean streets, Modern times, City lights, Sparticus, La belle a la bette, Bonnie and Clyde. If you take the time and avoid the status quo, I know you will enjoy these! Film is better than digital!",1,77,152,17 November 2006
