The Monuments Men," Art Histroy Entertainment with WWII as the Backdrop
","I heard mixed reviews of this film though my lady and I thought 'let's go' seeing the interesting cast assemblance. What I braced myself for was another World War II gore-ridden film with an art history perspective. Though the story did start a bit slow, it was a good run with the looted art as the primary focus. The slap stick humor shed light in the increasingly deeper and darker tone as the story unfolded and the Monuments Men delved deeper into the war zone. Some scene transitions were a bit jerky but overall a good story line with some great background shoots.A much appreciated aspect is the portrayal of strength of the characters and integrity portrayed during a tumultuous time in world history. The disparity among the characters made for some interesting lines. It was made evident the value of art as a remembrance of where we have come from, a semblance of western values held deep. And the unfolding of the relationships was definitely more akin to the respectful culture of the day more than now. I found it pleasing that when James (Matt Damon) is invited to spend the evening with Claire (Cate Blanchett), James exits her flat with grace sans sex scene not necessary for the focus of this film.Overall well worth seeing, including with the family.",Null,2,3,16 February 2014
