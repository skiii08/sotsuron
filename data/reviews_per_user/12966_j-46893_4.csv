Ford v Ferrari," I was very skeptical when I first want to see this movie, but WOW what a blast !!!
","This movie is not a regular documentary movie. This movie was done soooo good that it was a pure joy throughout the entire movie !!!
With exceptionally great acting by Christian Bale and even Matt Damon.
The production went all the way to really reproduce the look&fill of that time, in every possible aspects.It's a must see !! I warmly recommend you all - Go see it.",10,1,3,28 January 2020
La La Land," A complete waste of time of a complete overrated movie
","After hearing all the praise and glory of this movie on the radio and TV, I've decided to give it a chance and couldn't believe what I've seen. There were terrible numbers, terrible dancers, terrible acting and terrible songs. I could hardly get to the end of this movie as it was a complete torture and pain for my ears and eyes. The main actors can't sing and can't dance, the songs are of the same low-level and it all seemed to me like a low budget movie. Hearing it'd got so many Oscars was no doubt the last nail in the academy's coffin. What were they thinking ? Oscar for what ? Two new actors that bring nothing to the screen ? No feelings no acting no singing and no dancing - nothing ! Look carefully at their dance - they simply can't and don't dance. Hear carefully their singing - they can't don't really sing. Do you remember any tune from the movie (other the one they keep playing on the radio) or any dance ? This was a clearly PR movie full of buzz and empty inside. I highly recommend avoiding this one. Don't see, and don't waste your time on it. If you wan a musical to love - see The Greatest Showman - that's the right way to go..",1,0,2,23 June 2018
The Greatest Showman," The easiest 10 I've ever gave to a movie.
","This IS the real thing ! This is the right way to do a musical nowadays. Look at the cast, look and the acting, enjoy the song and extremity high performance of singing them. The acting was superb, the values in the movie were of great importance: family, honor, friendship, innovation, taking chances and (of-course) acceptance of the other. The film is a modern (high-rate) musical wrapped in a 19th century wrapper, but don't let it fool you, once you've started watching it - you get addicted to the great numbers and songs in it. Until this movie, it was very rare to see a tight singing and acting performance but now - there is a new standard in the market - The 'Greatest Showman' standard, and it'll be very hard to meet. Personally, I was so amazed by several of the songs that I've immediately ordered and bought both the movie and OST which are highly recommended to all family and friends. This one is totally the opposite of the terrible La LA Land movie, and got a straight 10 from me. Enjoy.",10,2,4,23 June 2018
Green Book," A straight 10 movie.
","When I've heard about this movie, I thought 'oh boy.. here is another 'white vs. colored' movie', but boy I was wrong !!
This movie is a real joy, and a breeze of fresh air compared to other movies that addressed this subject.
To take an Italian 'white supremacy' type of guy, and put him with a very gifted 'but black' artist, and make him understand the crime of racial behavior while showing him the other side of...well...everything... while taking us on this trip with them - was a wonderful idea and that's what makes this movie so good !!
I recommend this movie to everyone, it's a must see and of very high quality in all aspects !",10,1,3,23 November 2019
