The Legend of Bagger Vance," confusion
","Will Smith. Matt Damon.  Jack Lemmon.  inspirational film about a heroe who is broken by the war, helped to become great again.  it should have been fantastic. epic. sensational. but somehow it wasnt. and i have no idea why. i remain extremely grateful a film with such ideal elements was made, but go away feeling i didnt quite get it.  anything.maybe it was because the style was comic-strip.  if they'd made it to seem real maybe it would have worked. there was something missing.",Null,0,1,10 May 2002
