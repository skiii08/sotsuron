It," It - A Scary Clown Movie
","Based on the book 'It' by Stephen King, the movie adaptation is one of my favorite horror movies of 2017! This movie is about kids, but it's not for kids. Leave your kids at home! The movie is really scary and full of different terrifying creatures like clowns, evil dads, and demons! It's very frightening, but the story is incredibly entertaining. It's about 7 kids in a group called 'The Losers Club' who need to stop an evil clown. Go see the movie if you like to be scared, it can definitely scare you!",9,0,1,21 June 2019
