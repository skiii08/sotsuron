Catch Me If You Can," Great but a little too long for it's own good.
","Fine comic caper that has a lot of heart, but over stays it's welcome with it's own sentimentality. Leonardo Dicaprio is fine as Frank W Abanale Jr, the young man who manages to become every thing from a lawyer to a pilot in his quest of fun, and Tom Hanks is fine as well as The F.B.I agent dedicated in catching him. The movie easily captures the frizzy fun of movies of a forgotten by gone era, and gives a hype vibe to all the scenes it has. The only problem with it however is the fact that it takes way too long to come to any real conclusion. The story could have been much better if it thirty minutes were taken out of the film, but it's fine for what it is.",7,0,1,5 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fine adaptation of a children's classic.
","The first in the Harry Potter series of movies does the book series justice by not only staying true to the book core but by capturing the book's magic and heart. Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent choice for the role of Harry. He captures the pale innocents of his character with ease. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are just as good as Ron and Hermione, Harry's best friends. They capture their characters essence with a natural ease. Richard Harris is perfect as Dumbledore; He brings a strong center of claim to his character and the movie as well.Chris Columbus does the fans proud by staying true to the roots of the story by not watering down the drama and tension, keeping up with the sprit of JK. Rowling Novels.The series is in good hands.",10,0,1,5 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Another fine adaptation of a children classic, and a improvement over the original.
","The second in the Harry Potter series not only does justice to the source material but managers to better than the first movie in terms of style, acting and substance. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson once again do justice to their characters and manage to bring more to the table this time around in a sense of character study.  The late Richard Harris is fantastic as always as Dumbledore, and it's another great performance in his fine career. This fine actor will be missed, and the series will not be the same with out him.Chris Columbus does justice once again to JK Rowling's original novel, and bring out all the charm, and heart that made it such a beloved classic.
Bring on the next one.",10,0,0,5 June 2003
