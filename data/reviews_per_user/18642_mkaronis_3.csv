First Man," The gloomiest, saddest, darkest movie in a very long time
","Something went very wrong with this movie. Apollo 13 - a grandiose movie about a failed mission, while this one is a failed movie about the most outstanding, successful human mission so far. What a wreck!",4,252,427,12 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Totally boring for me, unfortunately
","Di Caprio's acting, as usual, spotless. Pitt is Pitt, with his usual charisma, thank god I had the worth of my ticket when he took off his shirt. The parts about the-then-Hollywood were long and boring, I sympathised/identified/empathised with none of the characters. The whole movie was sort of a build up to the usual Tarantinesque bloodbath and then nothing. Disappointed.",2,5,13,3 September 2019
Avatar," Unique and sublime
","This movie was a mind blowing experience for me! It marked me for eternity. First I have to say that it is made to be watched in 3D and on a huge screen so the IMAX is just perfect. The explosion of the colors is not affected by the filter of the 3D glasses and the IMAX huge speakers make you feel in the center of this amazing universe and of the action. The pace of the action is correct, the balance between all the elements (love, war) is perfect, you just don't wish for the film to end and I can't say that there is moment when you are bored, 2H40 were not enough for me! And the visual effects! And the colors! And the characters!...A sublime feast for the senses, a unique, outstanding film to create history!",10,7,15,18 December 2009
