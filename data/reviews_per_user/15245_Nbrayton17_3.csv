The Avengers," Almost as good as the Dark Knight
","I admit it's been a while since I have seen this film but I have yet to give a proper review. Hopefully, this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching The Avengers.This is what the Marvel movies have been leading up to, that is, every Marvel movie excluding the Spider-Man trilogy. The amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous; while waiting in line for The Avengers, the usher at the theater tells us that 'this is the best movie I have seen in 5 years'. That being said, it's extremely hard to go into this film without any expectations.So the question then is, was The Avengers good? If I can, I would call it Marvel-ous.Let's start with what I really enjoyed. The two strongest parts of The Avengers are the beginning and the end. When the film opens, we get to see the heros in their respective environments. And the opening scene with Black Widow stands out as one of the best. After Loki threatens Earth, the Avengers team has to assemble. Watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years, is a special moment. Now, the end was good because we finally get to see The Avengers work together as a team. While it took the entire movie for the Marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as a unit than as individuals, it's worth the wait. How the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning. To me, this felt the most like an actual comic book of video game.The humor and writing really stand out as good. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought at this movie (and that works for this film). The Marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times, and the script really made that aspect shine through.The two sides of the Hulk. The hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between Captain America and Iron man (I hope they set up the Civil War story). However, if I had one flaw with The Avengers, it would be Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner . Honestly, I thought both previous actors (Bana and Norton) played the part better.I know there is a ton more content to this film, but I should save that for when I get the film again on Blu Ray and have a fresh viewing.Overall, The Avengers is a superhero film done right. Everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place. However, I am not giving it a 10 just yet, because The Dark Knight Rises is coming out soon and I believe that it will be better than The Avengers.9.0out of 10'Better clench up, Legolas'",9,6,13,15 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great movie that won't stick in our memories
","Is it possible to forgive a man who has now seen the light? That's what I ask of you now. I, your humble reviewer, got a chance to see The Amazing-Spider Man for a second time. Only, this time it was in IMAX 3D and the last time I had been to the IMAX was in 4th grade on a class field trip. I know what you are thinking, 'You mean to tell us you didn't see The Dark Knight or Avatar at the IMAX?!' Well, no. But, I hear you and those are on my list of shame, along with never seeing the Indiana Jones films. Jeez, I heard you gasp through the computer. Now, after basically destroying my reviewing credibility, I will try to redeem myself.The best thing that I overlooked the first time I saw this film was the score. The music in this film takes the audience on such an emotional journey that if you pay attention to it, it will enhance the overall experience. I think the brilliance in the score is that it's very subtle. It's not constantly bashing us with a theme over and over again.One of the things that I believe swayed my first review was my view as Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. For some reason, I could not picture him playing the part and while I am still not completely sold on Garfield for the role of Peter Parker or as the Lizard says with great alliteration, 'Poor Peter Parker', I do believe he is a great Spider-Man. His voice is perfect; he sounds like the Saturday morning cartoon. So, after finally giving Garfield a chance, I will say that he is better than I originally gave him credit for.Since I did see it in IMAX 3D with my great friend over at The Brew (you can check out his review here), I feel an obligation to comment on it even if it's the same story with the 3D. If you are watching an action sequence it's very difficult to follow and often blurry at times. However, when the 3D is used right, for depth and landscapes, it's extremely effective, especially on a screen as large as an IMAX. There are sometimes, though, when Spider-Man looks very glossy. That's not something I noticed in normal 2D.After reading many other reviews that say how poor or cheap the Lizard looks, I'm still not buying it. I think he looks good. The detail on his scales very textured and his facial expressions are priceless. During this second screening, some of the audience was actually chuckling at the Lizard. But, I think it was a good execution.One thing that did bug me was the misleading marketing campaign where the audience was supposed to get the untold story of Spider-Man. That never happened.But overall, after watching The Amazing Spider-Man for a second time at a different venue and with most of my preconceived notions gone, it was an excellent film. I think I knew that all along and just didn't want to say it.So this time I will give it a9.0 out of 10'Crooooooooootch!'O, and Emma Stone is still hot.",8,0,3,14 July 2012
Brave," Not Pixar's Weakest, don't fall victim to the hate
","Pixar really can't do any wrong. Brave marks the 13th time a Pixar film has taken the top spot at the box office. That's everyone one of their films starting with Toy Story.Brave tells the classic story of all teenagers and their relationships with their parents. Merida, a Scottish Princess, wants to be free to choose her suitor, much like in Aladin. Out of frustration, she turns to a witch who promises to change her fate and mother, Queen Elinor, who want's Merida to act more like a princess and spend less time shooting her bow. And everyone knows, you can't trust witches who promise you your greatest desires.Quickly after casting a spell on her mother, Merida regrets her little mistake. However, something good does come out of the spell. Merida and Elinor get to spend quality time together, while actually taking the time the listen to each other under 'unique circumstances'.Brave does a great job of capturing the dynamics of any stereotypical family. It showcases a whiney teenage girls, three reckless and spoiled sons, a controlling mother, and an oblivious father. And that is truly the magic of Pixar. While the movie is entertaining and has good themes for children, anyone can enjoy Brave.After watching all of the trailers and a few TV spots for Brave, I was surprised of some of the plot turns. Now, I can't reveal anything here with out spoiling anything but I will say it was unexpected but like Pixar usually does, they make 'strange' work.Some things to point out:This is the first Pixar film with a female protagonist. I think that's a great step for Pixar industry.I really enjoyed the commination of the great score with the soft-rock singles. It reminded me a little of Tarzan.Merida's hair was amazing.It was way funnier than I thought it was going to be.Overall, Brave was brilliant. Definitely a good time. I can't talk about too much without spoling the movie.It ranks at least in my top 3 Pixar films. Take your family to see it, but be prepared for cuteness overload.9.5 of 10'I don't want to get married, I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.'",9,3,5,14 July 2012
