The Blair Witch Project," very good
","i went seeing this with mixed expectations, but i was impressed.not by the horror of the movie, but perhaps the smartness and how well it was done. i didn't find it that scary, though, especially not as much as the hype around it. the acting is terrific and the fact that they pulled this off is pretty amazing. i really liked it. i heard a lot of people when we were leaving the theatre talking about how bad it sucked, but thats ignorant people for you. they don't like anything different. it didn't have to be scary in my view to be good. i give it 4 stars (out of 4).",10,1,2,6 August 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Ignorance of people outstanding
","people who write reviews like the one i just read, do not have respect for silent films. that is why they dont like them. how can you review something in a category that every single piece you hate (silent films). they are too ignorant too sit and watch and film without words. anyways, i happen to like silent films and d.w. griffith's The Birth of A Nation is masterfully directly for the time period and is a piece of movie past to be treasured for generations to come. today people are not going to like it for the racist implications, but you must understand, it was 1915. the movie is exceptional, despite the fact its glorifying the ku klux klan. it actually manages to arouse some emotion in some of the scenes, and many directors of today could watch and learn. anyways, i loved it. if you have any intelligence and can sit through a silent movie, then you should watch it.",10,7,17,17 July 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Definitetly one of the best movies ever
","This is one of the masterpieces of the silent era. I think anyone who does not appreciate this movie, could not appreciate silent films. This should have made it to the top 10 of AFI's little rankings, but obviously didn't. They just thought 35 was good enough. Anyways, if you haven't seen it you ought. Especially if you enjoy silent films.",10,7,19,25 October 1998
