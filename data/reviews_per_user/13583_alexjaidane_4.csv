Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie is just great, the prequels are Star Wars at it's finest
","This movie is a great adventure and a great addition to Star Wars, this movie made possible everything great from Star Wars, it created magical worlds and a expirience that makes it lovable, it has great characters like Obi Wan, Qui Gon, Palpatine, Nutt Gunrey, even Padme, I understand people not liking Anakin's behavior, but it is better than Rey, and it gave us a great sound track and Darth Maul, some times it can be Slow, but so as a new hope and I don't see anyone complainig",9,5,6,11 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Did you liked The Force Awakens? You probablly will lile this one
","It's just mediocre, it is really really mediocre, after infinity war you wanted to see something epic, that is what Endgame was, but this... this is just crap, they ruined the Skrulls, they ruined the Kree, and they ruined Nick Fury, how could they ruin Sam Jackson? the only good thing is Coulson and he appears like 3 seconds",1,99,180,27 June 2019
