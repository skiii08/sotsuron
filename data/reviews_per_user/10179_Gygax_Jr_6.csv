Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underated due to Overhype. Misunderstood theme.
",Come on people! This film is no where near as bad as some claim. I have a feeling that the extreme overhype before the movies release caused some dissapointment in those expecting this to be the best film of all time. Just because it didnt live up to those unrealistic expectations does not mean that it was the worst movie ever made.I think that when the third movie of the 'new' Star Wars trilogy comes out then people will finally realise the deep underlining theme of this trilogy. The emphasis is not on how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader but more how a wiley and intelligent polititian such as Palpatine can bend the laws to his own ends to make himself Emperor of the universe. This trilogy will turn out to be a  warning to be weary of such men.I thought the film was not all that bad and I loved all the political inuendo (Mind you I am a Political Science major). The kid was only mildly annoying but I agree that Jar Jar Binks should be killed off sooner rather than later.7 out of 10.,Null,0,1,8 January 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Great atmosphere, great movie.
","Sleepy Hollow is one of Tim Burtons best films. The films great story line is accompanied well with a classy lead role performance by the great Johnny Depp (one of his best roles I believe) and he is surrounded by a stella suporting cast of some of my favourite thespiens such as Christina Ricci, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, Jeffrey Jones, Miranda Richardson and Michael Gambon. This film is a good example of how, if minor characters are played well, the movie gains a great sense of atmosphere. Adding to the atmosphere established by the characters is some inspired set designs, which have Tim Burton written all over them, and a roaring score by the great Danny Elfman. Of course, atmosphere alone does not make a great movie, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it goes a long way to helping its appeal.8 out of 10.",8,0,0,22 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Entertaining. The real theme continues. (Spoilers)
","I thought this movie was a slight improvement on 'Phantom Menace', which in itself was not a bad film. This time around, Lucas has decided to go for almost pure entertainment by throwing lots of action at us.(Spiolers ahead). This film has largely been critised for being too confusing. Why is this? I think that perhaps people have been concentraiting too hard on the 'Anikan will become Darth Vader' sub plot rather than the true underlying theme 'the rise of Palpatine'. This theme started in episode 1 and was brilliantly continued in Episode 2. Some viewers were possibly confused because they have yet to realise that Palpatine is actually in comand of both sides. He uses his alter ego Darth Sidious to create the threat led by Count Dooku (the Brilliant Christopher Lee) against the republic. He then uses this threat as an excuse to cement his position of supreme authority as the leader of the republic to oversee this time of crisis - thus eventually allowing him to become the evil emperor of the universe. That is the absolute main theme of this film - and many people miss it (mind you, I am a Political Science major).Overall, the film was not too bad. My only quams are with the extremely chezzy diner scence - possibly the worst idea Lucas has ever had, the CGI was a bit crappy in places (even the pupet Yoda looked more realistic), Bobba Fett was horribly played by a fellow New Zealander (he let the country down) and Jar Jar Binks is still alive.7.5 out of 10.",Null,1,1,8 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," No. 4 best movie of all time, MY ARSE!
","What the hell is going on! There must be a hell of a lot of Tolkein fans with computers out there, because they are no doubt to blame for this movies hugley bloated and overrated ah..rating.Im not saying that this is not a good movie, it was good, what I am saying is that this movie was not as good as many seem to think. It has many flaws, for example, its too long, all the good bits are seperated by long boring bits, and Ian McKellens performance, which was highly praised, wasnt really all that remarkable. Mind you, what do you expect a movie, based on a long, boring and tedious book by an overhyped author (Tolkein) to be like. Jackson and co did what they could with what they had.There are still many good things to come out of this movie however. The cast is superb. Christopher Lee as the bad guy was a stroke of genus. The landscape is amazing (mind you I do live there so I have to say that) and, if you can get past all the long boring bits, you will find the main vein of a good movie. TOP 20 Movies stuff, however, this is not.7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," No better than Attack of the Clones.
","The second installment of the 'Lord of the Rings',Trilogy, the Two Towers, is not a bad movie... but in saying this, its nowhere near as brilliant as some have perported it to be.The cast, the landscape, and the directing are all good (although more Christopher Lee would have been nice). Unfortunitly, the storyline is very slow, and at times, very boring. Peter Jackson has done a great job transforming and tinkering Tolkeins work into something movie viewers can enjoy, but, sad as it may be, even Jackson must have struggled to turn a story so mind numbingly tedious into a screenplay. Dont get me wrong, the main events depicted in the story are interesting - its just that these good bits are intersperced with some very boring and rather unnecissary storytelling. Despite Jacksons best efforts, these bits are evident on the screen and this is why the movie is too long.I have read comments raving about what a great acheivement the battle of Helms Deep was. I dont know where these people have been living, but the Battle of Helms Deep was not as amazing and jaw droping as some say. Infact, it was really just a run of the mill battle sequence which can be seen in many movies to have been released in the last few years- the battle at the end of 'Attack of the Clones' was just as good, and in saying this 'The Two Towers' was no better than the latest Star Wars film.7.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Best of the Indyy Trilogy.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crudsade is a great film. Really, I have nothing but praise for it and it goes down as one of my all time favourite films. Coming off, the dissapointing 'Temple of Doom' Harrison Ford is back at his best as our hero and this time his dad (played by Sean Connery) is along for the ride. These two legendary actors are accompanied by a great supporting cast. John Rhys Davis makes a return to the Indy movies as the the lovable Sala whilst Denholm Elliot is great as the bumbling Markus Brodie. Shakesparian actor Julian Glover is great as the villian. Ive only ever seen him in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and a video production of 'Beowolf' outside of this film and cant fathom why he isnt in more movies. Aside from the great cast, this film has it all, Action, adventure, romance, knights, tanks, castles, the Holy Grail, and Nazis. What more could you want in a film. It also contains John Williams best score since Return of the Jedi.9.5 out of 10.",Null,1,2,20 January 2003
