Miracle," Good hockey, OK movie
","This movie has undoubtedly the best and most authentic looking hockey scenes than any other hockey film. If you watch a film like Youngblood after Miracle, you'll just want to strangle yourself. EX-NHL player Ryan Walter has made a fantastic job in dramatizing the goals and the actual match events that took place. It annoyed me that some other events were changed from what actually happened to boost the American over-patriotism and alleged unity as well as making others, especially the Soviets to look like 'The bad guys.' However that was something to be expected and we see it in pretty much every film, especially war films.To sum it up, the film is not to be taken as a documentary of what happened but rather as good hockey entertainment. Turn off your brains and enjoy the game.",6,0,3,14 March 2005
