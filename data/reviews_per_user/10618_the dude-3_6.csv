Vertigo," If Shakespeare had made films
","(Caution: Spoilers for idiots who've never seen this masterpiece)'Vertigo' more than any other film by Hitchcock reminds me of a Shakespearean play.  Like Shakespeare, Hitchcock organized his films into a form of acts, and it's most notable in this film.  There's the opening scene like Shakespearean prologues in which a single act sets forth all that is to follow.  In the first act the hero becomes part of a sinister plot unwittingly.  He meets a girl, falls in love with her, despite her husband, and vows to always protect her.  In the second act, the plot is acted out at the expense of the hero.  He comes close to finally solving his love's trouble but loses her as she plummets to her death from all things, a bell tower at a cathedral.   In the third act, the secrets behind the crime are revealed and the hero begins to descend toward his final destruction.  It wasn't his love who fell to her death, but the wife of the man who hired him in an elaborate plot to inherit her fortunes.  He finds the woman who he thought was the wife and begins to remake her into what she originally looked like and who he fell in love with.  He, of course, at this point is quite insane.  In the final act everything falls apart for the hero as he finally realizes he was a pawn in the vile scheme.  He leads his love to the place where she first appeared to have died and this time she actually does. Another lovely element Hitchcock utilizes is the presence of mirrors throughout both to forebode and remind us that Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton are the same woman and will suffer the same fate.  Also, the use of the color green as a connection between Stewart and Novak, which disappears as Stewart's love for her becomes unhealthy obsession.Jimmy Stewart's John Ferguson is reminiscent of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' and 'Othello.'  Kim Novak's a modern Ophelia or even Juliet.  Barbara Bel Geddes as the hopelessly tragic Midge Wood is like the countless best friends of the lead characters who are sacrificed.  And lastly Tom Helmore as Gavin Elster reeks of Iago as he has everything planned out for his benefit.If Shakespeare were a filmmaker he couldn't do better than this.  He and Hitchcock were truly two of the best artists to ever emerge from England.",Null,3,5,17 April 2000
Se7en," An Overblown Sermon
","If ever a movie was completely represented in one of its characters, 'Se7en' was it.  (possible spoilers) The two preachers of the film are John Doe, the character portrayed by Kevin Spacey, and the director, David Fincher. Fincher's film has a purpose just like that of John Doe's murders, to shock American into recognition of its major faults: its sins.  Unfortunately Fincher's point is lost in his bombastic and brazen style which dominates all of his films.  Fincher seems to be quite the cynic in his view of the world.  In 'Se7en' there's not a person in the world, or at least NYC, that's not a sinner, and we're living on a veritable hell on earth.  'The Game' presents a paranoid world where no one's life and security are concrete and 'Fight Club' shows us just how superficial of a culture we are. Unfortunately, Fincher also seems to be an optimist at heart, and this is where his films lose their potency.  At the end of each film he tries to give some glimpse of hope.  At the end of 'Se7en' Morgan Freeman quotes Hemingway, saying ''The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.'   At the end of 'The Game' it turns out the paranoia was only part of an intricate joke and 'Fight Club' falls apart on itself when(among other things) it tries to present some sort of solution, which was, best as I could tell, love.  If only Fincher didn't try to provide some sort of happy ending(albeit minimal as in this film) his films could be much more powerful(like Neil Labute's 'In the Company of Men' and 'Your Friends and Neighbors'.)  He makes his point and then unfortunately loses it in an overblown style and ludicrous attempts at happy endings. Compared to the rest of his work though, 'Se7en' is his most effective film to date with fine performances by Freeman and Spacey.",7,0,1,10 April 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence who?
","After finishing this almost 4-hour epic, I wasn't quite sure what I thought of it.  The fact that the main character was never truly fleshed out to a distinct individual bothered me; that many of the things he did weren't really explained.  This faded quickly though as I realized he was more fleshed out than any other character I'd seen before.  He had self-doubts and flaws and was stoic at times and weak at others, hated and loved at times he couldn't explain, just like a normal human being.  My questions of why this is said to be one of the best movies of all time were soon extinguished.  T. E. Lawrence was one of the most defined characters ever brought to film simply because he was also one of the most undefined.",10,0,2,23 June 2000
Rosemary's Baby," Horror, horror everywhere and not a wink to sleep
","I don't think I've ever seen a more unsettling film.  From start to startling finish, Roman Polanski's dark classic gives you that ill feeling in the pit of your stomach.  Everything's off-kilter about the apartment building which unsuspecting Rosemary and her husband Guy rent, from the red wall-lights to the large chest a dying woman somehow managed to move all-by herself in front of a closet which contained only a vacuum cleaner and some sheets. There are so many elements to this film that Roman Polanski uses in presenting the eerie tale that whole books can be (and have been) written about it. One of the most appalling things is Polanski's realistic understanding of motherhood that produces the shocking final turn in Rosemary's trial.  A very unpleasant film to watch, but undeniably great, completely redefining the horror genre and starting horror's reign in the box offices lasting up until the 80's.",10,0,1,19 January 2000
Paths of Glory," A genre unto himself.
","I was originally going to say that a third of Stanley Kubrick's films were about war, but that wouldn't be accurate.  A third of Stanley Kubrick's body of work were anti-war films.  Considering he only made 12 major films (not counting the five theatrically un-released) this is pretty significant.  He practically invented the anti-war genre with this film or at least made the first nationally recognized anti-war film.  His four major anti-war films could even fit the traditional genre cycle model.   'Paths of Glory' being his first anti-war film established the genre and thus was its novelty period.  His next anti-war film was 'Spartacus' and this could be the classic period of the genre.  Next was 'Dr Strangelove or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb' and this could be the revisionist period of the genre in which it takes a comedic turn.  Lastly was 'Full Metal Jacket' which could fulfill the parodic period of the genre as it makes fun of itself.  These 4 films might have better fit the genre cycle if 'Dr. Strangelove' was made after 'Full Metal Jacket' but I'm not sure.  Anyway, it's a very interesting view of the four movies if you compare them. 
One thing that struck me in 'Paths of Glory' was the German woman who sings at the end.  I may be wrong, but she is the only woman in the whole film, and I may again be wrong, but as I recall there was only one woman in 'Dr. Strangelove' and one woman who was a main character in 'Full Metal Jacket' (actually two, the Vietnamese prostitute and the assassin, but they could be considered the same woman).  This is very peculiar and thus very relevant in interpreting some of these films' meanings.  Most importantly, in all three of these films, the woman is something of the 'enemy'(somewhat of a stretch for the woman in 'Dr. Strangelove' but she could be seen as an enemy as she keeps General Turgidson from doing his job and trades information between military officers.)  Also very important in two of the films is that they are the only enemy to be seen close-up.  In 'Paths of Glory' the German singer at the end is the only time in the film the 'enemy' is actually seen and this proves quite effective is demonstrating the absurdity of claiming she's essentially any different than the 'good guys.'  Also, in 'Full Metal Jacket' the only enemy seen close up that's not dead is the assassin at the end who is not only female but a child and this is Kubrick's most wicked ploy as how could this young girl possibly be the enemy?",10,0,1,26 April 2000
Carrie," Ode to Hitchcock falls short
","Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' has been said to be his ode to Hitchcock. Unfortunately such a claim isn't justified.  Brian De Palma imitates much of the master's style, specifically that in 'Psycho' as he uses the same pitching music and a similar mother-offspring scenario.  But, what starts off as a great movie dealing with powerfully emotional issues of social ostracization and physical and emotional maturity turns into a cheap blood and gore fest.  Where Hitchcock triumphed with subtlety and masterful editing De Palma fails with explicit gore and split-screens and that awful jesus-christ pose Carrie's mother is in at the end was so stupid it was funny.  Scariest moments occur in the first half of the film.",7,0,0,21 February 2000
