The Benchwarmers," I can't believe this movie cost me money to see
","After a failed attempt to sneak into an R-rated movie, I landed my self here. 'What is here?' you may ask. To that I would respond the epitome of bad movies. If you were reading this to find out if you should go to see this movie, then read only the next sentence, because the rest will be spoilers for something way past spoiled, past rotten, to an area that is just sad. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. Do not encourage such material to bee made in the future, because this movie was a disgrace to all who are not blind and deaf. I liked Napoleon Dynamite, Tommy Boy, and Rob Schneider's line in The Water Boy, but this movie is not even close to that. These actors are nothing without other people's talents. Half of the plot revolved around eight year olds getting behind some people who could make a stand against bullying; the other half was a nonsensical attempt at comedy for those already in their teens. The people who could find the sexual terms 'homerun, going all the way, and ovulating' funny don't want to hear third graders give commentary to a baseball game. This movie has no target audience: it has an old man in his underwear flicking people off, gay guys, Davie Spade talking about a movie with lesbian sex scenes, Bill Romanowski giving himself a titty twister, a midget with a peanut butter statue, an emotional speech about how bullying was bad, and dozens of third graders. This movie also had its fair amount of mess ups. A kid being called out on a dropped third strike when no one ever got him out at first, the fact that the Benchwarmers would never win a baseball game if the opposing team had intentionally walked Rob Schneider, (who was the only one who could hit the ball on the team). You could tell some part of the movie was voiced over, because the person would say something differently when the camera wasn't on him. And on top of all of that I have never seen worse acting in any movie I paid to see. Adam Sandler had no cameo in this movie, and he was producing it. This film was probably a way of Adam Sandler saying, 'You guys can have your own little film over here, now please don't ask to be in mine.' It was so bad that the critics weren't allowed to see it in advance because they knew how bad it was. As the film's final line goes:'This was a complete waste of time wasn't it?'",1,5,9,29 May 2006
Munich," Munich
","Munich is an intellectual and violent thriller. It explains the events surrounding the 1972 terrorist attack on the Israeli Olympic team. This movie didn't concentrate on just what happened the day of the attacks though. It shows how the Israeli government responded to the attack from the Palestinian terrorists.In the movie a team of five assassins is assembled to take out key Palestinian targets. They are unofficially employed by the Israeli government. To find their targets they use a French informant. This informant gives good information, but puts them in troublesome circumstances. Eventually three of the five team members are killed, and the team returns without completing their mission, but are still regarded as heroes. Munich showed a lot of politics that still pertain to today. It included terrorism from Muslim nations and the ongoing tension between Israel and Palestine. This movie provided an interesting insight to how politics were sometimes run back then. In the movie it even mentioned that the U.S. was funding terrorists, with the agreement that they would be safe. The government had its secret operations that were neither known about nor legal. They gave the assassination team no guidance besides a list of who they wanted dead. The team assembled wasn't even very skilled or qualified for the job.One of the most interesting aspects of the movie was the variety of weapons used in it. Plastic explosives, WWII bombs, sniper rifles, guns, and even a gun in the shape of a tube were all used. This movie was very intriguing in its political aspects. It was interesting in the way that it portrayed how things were run back in the 1970's. It had tons of action and suspense, but managed to keep an interesting plot. Spielberg did a great job of retelling the events proceeding the terrorist attack of the Munich Olympics.",8,0,0,21 March 2006
