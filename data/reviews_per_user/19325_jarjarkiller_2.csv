The Ring," Give them a Break the MOVIE ROCKS!
","Let us never forget that a movie is supposed to entertain peopl.  I'm really tired of people who tend to forget that and make some sort of big fraudian psycho babble thing out of anything.  I bet some people out there probably looked at the Oddysian message of Pokemon the movie.So let's not forget that this movie is a movie...it's not real and its not going to make any significance to the world in any way.  It may just give a bunch of teens that snuck in to watch it the heebee geebees and a fear of televisions for a while.  Man, dont even start thinking about how you'll never look at a closet, tape, or tv the same way again. This movie was that scary!  I believe it actually was a great translation from the original. To be able to make a film that was in another language into one that Americans will actually be talking about for a long time (they will too) is really a hard thing to do.I saw a test screening of it and I believe that they should not change a thing...forget about the negative remarks or any suggestions on changing the ending.  This version is the closest you'll ever get to the utter dread and sheer horror of the japanese original.Watch this movie with someone you love...because they'll be the only one to understand why you're screaming like a newlymade castrato.",Null,0,0,3 October 2002
Silent Hill," Pajiba gets it and they usually don't.
","*WARNING* MIGHT HAVE SPOILERS BUT NOT SURE ---ITS A REVIEWI wanted to put what Pajiba said. And for the first time, a reviewer (good or not good) got this movie right.I Don't Know What That Thing Was, But I Did Just Crap My Pants...Silent Hill / Phillip StephensLink follows: http://www.pajiba.com/silent-hill.htmI don't care if you flame or wot not. But yeah, this movie was good..best adaptation of a game and probably the weirdest thing to come out this decade that doesn't require me to download a .sub file for Japanese or korean.",Null,1,3,27 April 2006
