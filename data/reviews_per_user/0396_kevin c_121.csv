Ford v Ferrari," Cor blimey
","Motor racing films always ooze swagger. I hate motor sport, but the films a la baseball always deliver. James Mangold has a good back catalogue, and i feel he has a decent stab at this.Le Mans '66 is an exploration of this odd-couple relationship, fascinated with ideas of masculinity. And if you can get past Bale's odd 'Brummie' accent it mostly works. The spectre of death lingers in every frame. The racing scenes are anxiety-inducing, with the camera keeping low to the ground bringing smashed-up cars careening into view.Yet the film's greatest trick is saved for the final reel. For much of its running time, you're fooled into thinking Mangold had made a grand sporting ode to the American dream. And then the rug is pulled right out from underneath your feet. Le Mans '66 may revel in the high life, but its finale feels devastatingly hollow.",7,0,0,1 May 2020
The Blair Witch Project," SCARRY MOVIE
","Ignore the internet hype and budget. This is the film that re-injected a much needed fillip to the horror genre. It remembers the important lesson that your mind can create a much greater horror, than any silly gore-fest can. A sophisticated audience can laugh at this film. But turn off the lights and watch this, it really works. A film that is better suited to the small screen.",6,0,1,6 June 2001
Blade Runner 2049," No need for a Director's Cut this time
","I was never a fan of the original, i've tried all the later 'cuts' but it still leaves me cold. So surprisingly this wowed me. This is awe-inspiring film, beautiful; and so enigmatic.On a technical level, it gets Zimmer fresh from his Dunkirk star turn to produce a stunning, intimidating score. And Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning, but it just always is. I love the nods to the original - the Pan Am and Atari street neon in particular. Like the director's recent Arrival, this appeals to our intellect as well as to our sense of adventure. The film deals with love, memory, reality and identity in a probing and though-provoking way.Not everything works. Some of the sci-fi movie seems very clunky and dated, perhaps because so much has imitated it over the years? Harrison Ford's returning Deckard, is a bit too returning Solo. But Gosling gives another soulful and intelligent performance - he's a consistent gem for me.",8,3,5,6 May 2018
First Man," Out of this world
","Movie afternoon with Iris.First Man is all about understated heroism. It's affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Gosling) doesn't feel the continual need to big himself up. This is no Apollo 13, and the study of grief and ongoing loss very affecting.Claire Foy gives an exceptional performance as Armstrong's wife, Janet, the one always left behind and trying to hold the family together. Cliche maybe, but she brings the role to life. The backdrop of Vietnam, Civil Rights and the Cold War are also expertly woven in.The testing phase is exhausting, frustrating and very dangerous. The sound of rattling blots and claustrophobia is terrifying. Music is almost as important to First Man as it was to Chazelle's La La Land. The score is both haunting and majestic.We all know Armstrong made it to the moon, taking 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'. But it still generates buckets of suspense. Chazelle throws in footage of JFK's 'we choose to go to the moon' and like that, this is inspiring intelligent film-making.",9,1,3,21 October 2018
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 90% of the original
","Movie night with Gertie.This is good fun, but not quite on a par with the first outing. Even my 9-year old daughter although entertained, said she preferred the original.",6,3,5,2 April 2018
Requiem for a Dream," THE DRUGS DON'T quite WORK
","Not quite up to the standards of the phenomenal 'Pi', my personal best of 1999; but still an impressive film from one of the best young directors around.It's a powerful tale, that reaches a terrifying climax. Ultimately though, the drug film is one of the most formalised genres. This film doesn't quite escape it, in the way 'Drugstore Cowboy' did for instance.
The score matches 'Pi', and surely Aronofsky must have been a dj in some form or another.",5,4,9,25 January 2001
Ali," HE SHOOK UP THE WORLD
","This is not Mann's best film, but it's still a great film. It shows that Mann is easily the no. 1 auteur in 2002 Hollywood. It is also Smith's best performance since 'Six Degrees Of Seperation', and I'd be happy to see him take the Best Actor Oscar later this month.I feel the critics wanted more Ali humour. Instead you get to see the darker, pensive Ali. You ge a great insight into 1960s USA. The African scenes are spot on, and the closing stadium scene rivals anything in 'Gladiator'.",6,0,1,2 March 2002
Rocketman," Musical over biopic
","Dexter Fletcher's has made a fun musical, but not an insightful biopic. It's not airbrushing his past, but it's skimming the surface.It could have become a weary chronicle of woe. However, the flamboyant noise and humour saves the day. The conclusion is debatable, but this is worth it for the Pinner rock opera opening.",7,1,1,17 November 2019
A Star Is Born," just fine
","Movie night with Iris.I know i'm not the target audience, but i really liked La La Land. So I was willing to give this a fair crack. I was mostly entertained, but massively underwhelmed.The first 20-30 minutes are snappy, but once it left the drag bar it started to drag. An excruciating Grammy's-scene aside, it is mostly sentimental and cliche-ridden.I was also expecting this marvelous Lady Gaga performance, but she just seemed Lady Gaga to me. And I know the reasons for Cooper's gruff voice, but it was incomprehensible and annoying.The Sopranos-lite father (and his friends) provide some amusing distraction. But it was very much colour by numbers. Sure that means Oscars will abound later tonight....",6,0,1,24 February 2019
Erin Brockovich," SODERBERGH HAS BEEN BETTER
","I have an inclination to despise Roberts, and it has served me well in life. Despite Soderbergh being one of my favourite directors and some positive reviews, I missed the cinematic release because of Roberts. I eventually caught it on television recently, and I have to say it wasn't bad. Roberts was obviously annoying, but it does entertain for it's 2 hours. You cannot escape that Soderbergh probably did this to finance 'Traffic', but it's an above-average multiplex effort.",4,3,9,23 October 2001
The Death of Stalin," Joke wears thin
","The film is funny and shocking, but the use of English/American accents made it seem an oddity.It begins with the wonderfully comic, surrealistic Radio Moscow set piece, with a fantastic turn from Considine. The film capture the comedy as well as the paranoia that comes with everyday life under Stalin. The standout's are Isaacs' Yorkshire Field Marshall, and Russell Beale's creepy, comic turn.The jokes, though, begin to seem increasingly incongruous as we realise how many people have actually died and are continuing to die. The rape jokes in particular were inexcusable. It may be historically accurate, but maybe Stalin's terror and its aftermath isn't such a good subject for comedy after all.",4,1,5,28 April 2018
Meet the Parents," BETTER THAN YOU'D THINK
","De Niro isn't a comedian lets face it. However he puts in a decent performance here. The film's strength, is the fact that we've all been there. I didn't really see the need for some of the over-the-top gags, and the FOCKER gag is playground stuff. There's enough material there for a good, tense black comedy. Something Hollywood could never do. Okay, but I'd catch it on rental or cable if I were you.",4,0,0,19 December 2000
Se7en," WHAT'S IN THE BOX ??
","Remember when Spacey was good. Remember when Fincher was a dark genius. Remember when Paltrow was sweet. Remember when Pitt had depth.Caught my Xmas present DVD the other night. Liked it all those years ago, and we're all aware of what it influenced thereafter. A piece of absolute genius and a knock-you-down film.",7,0,2,13 March 2003
Unbreakable," willis CAN act
","I always felt 'The Sixth Sense' to be very much overrated. A non-suspensful horror film saved by it's excellent twist. This film is much better. A really tense suspensful film, that this time is spoilt by it's twist. You're really drawn in and affected by Willis' progress. I didn't see the need for another irritating kid.You always leave such films thinking what a good actor Willis is, and why he bothers with 'Die Hard 27' etc. Jackson on the other hand, seems to be the most over-the-top actor around since his good 'Pulp Fiction' outing.",5,0,0,6 January 2001
Fight Club," HONOURABLE ATTEMPT
","I initially saw this film when it had it's cinematic release, but my viewing was soured by a noisy audience. So I returned to watch it on satellite last night, and i have to say I do stand by my initial judgment.The first half of this film is one of the best films in the past 10 years. It's fresh, cool and perfectly captures the male angst as we enter a new millennium. The second half is more messy in comparison, and so this film has to go down as an honourable attempt.Fincher has showed excellent promise and originality with his first few films. Norton is a good actor, and Pitt can be excellent when he wants to be.",5,0,2,24 June 2001
Memento," NEO-NOIR
","A quality film with a traditional noirish tale. Perhaps the best neo-noir since 'Chinatown'. Pearce shows all the potential from his previous work, and could well develop into the character actor over the next 20 years. The ending is a slight disappointment, perhaps because the twist is fairly easy to establish. Catch this film.",7,0,2,10 November 2000
Captain Marvel," Girl power (finally)
","Movie afternoon with Gertie.Marvel goes Back to the Future-style, with a welcome (and long overdue) feminist slant. The gags mostly land, and the stunts keep pace. Although the plot takes a while to find it's feet.Yes there's a scene-stealing cat, but Larson totally dominates this. In many ways the film itself doesn't glow in the same way as Larson does. Ultimately Captain Marvel is enjoyable enough popcorn entertainment. Larson makes a thoroughly engaging superhero, witty, courageous and with a sensitivity many others of the Marvel stable lack.",6,5,11,20 October 2019
The Impossible," A disaster of 2 halves
","The Impossible vividly re-creates the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. It's difficult to see the CGI stitches in the stunning disaster. With a special nod for the 10 seconds of wind rush immediately before.The eldest boy Lucas played by Tom Holland is superb, and Naomi Watts terrific. I much more enjoyed their first half. McGregor and the second half are a lot weaker. The narrowness of focus looks increasingly awkward as the film goes on. The travel insurance advert at the end, extremely bizarre.",5,1,1,27 August 2018
Bloody Sunday," JUSTICE ??
","This film suffered from the 30 year anniversary. A TV movie was released at the same time, with a more emotional narrative. However this was the more realistic, and perhaps set the background a lot better. I think perhaps that you're still left confused, despite the dreadful wrongs committed on that day.",3,5,14,18 February 2002
Us," Us is better (Get Out of here)
","Movie night with Iris.Whilst i enjoyed Get Out, i felt it had it's faults. So in my usual contrary way, i thought supposedly lighter follow-up to be ore enjoyable. The horror jumps worked, the laughter was funny and it neatly concluded itself. And you have one of the best American female actors throughout.",8,0,3,17 August 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," SOUTH PARK THE MOVIE
","The film can only sustain itself for about 60 minutes, and you are tired with it by the end. However up until then it's extremely amusing, and it's take on censorship shows greater depth than the t.v series ever did. I never thought that I'd enjoy a musical so much. Having said that, it pales into insignificance alongside 'The Simpsons'.",4,0,4,26 April 2001
Knives Out," lockdown blast
","COVID-19 movie night with Iris.Think the murder mystery genre is antiquated, well this provides the thrill of something new. Rian Johnson has fetched the murder mystery out of the loft, blown off the dust and given us an ingeniously constructed film. Funny and filled with so many twists it will make your head spin.And it's refreshing to see a murder mystery actually set in the present day, considering the history of the genre. I love the family argument about Trumpian politics.Daniel Craig is clearly having a blast, and is a reminder that he's capable of much more than looking suave in a 007 suit. The ensemble dazzles, but they all bounce off each other with ease. The characters are stereotypes when there's the opportunity for a good laugh, but deeper and more complicated when you get into the meat of the story.Great fun and perfect for our lockdown times.",8,1,2,11 April 2020
The Irishman," Back to the Future
","This is long, but i had no quibbles - i was captivated from start to finish. Comparisons with Goodfellas or Casino are lazy. This is a different, more reflective movie.Scorsese's signature camerawork is back and sublime. And the screenplay crackles with mobster patter - arguments about fish, time-keeping and business echo 'funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?'.De Niro and Pacino especially have lowered their standards over the past decade, but here they (and Pesci) are recharged. These are stunning performances. De Niro's shifts in mood are barely perceptible, but by the end something profound has changed within him. Pacino, meanwhile, bristles with energy, without edging into his sometimes self-parody. And Pesci perhaps never better - here a quieter man but with just one knowing look can change the entire course of a man's life. And despite the brouhaha over the CGI to de-age its leads, it's only briefly distracting.So a different pace and tone to Scorsese's back catalogue. But man is he still a majestic director.",9,2,10,19 January 2020
Billy Elliot," BEST OF BRITISH ??
","Misunderstood northern boy who finds an outlet in an unlikely subject. Hang on a minute that was done in 'Kes', and better for it too. An unashamed crowd-pleaser, and very much a woman's film. It all resolves itself far too quickly and neatly. Entertaining multiplex fodder, but certainly not as good as it's been painted.",5,1,5,3 October 2000
Finding Nemo," TROUT NOT KIPPERS
","Well obviously this is 'The Searchers' underwater, and has references to 'The Shining', 'Jaws', 'Psycho' and many more. Of more importance 2 year old Iris Mathilda loved it. Mum and Dad were entertained too.It looks beautiful, and should help plasma screen sales in 2004. Not quite a 'Toy Story' but Pixar have struck gold(fish) again.",5,1,3,13 November 2003
The Mummy," YOU DON'T NEED A BRAIN FOR THIS ONE
","There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?",3,5,11,12 April 2001
The Others," DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING
","What spooks you in the horror genre, is very much a personal choice. Some would argue that this is a predictable scare. However for me, it was a good old-fashioned ghost story. In the tradition of Radio 4's Christmas ghost story.Kidman is believable as the mother and holds the film well (as usual). The daughter is very good, especially in the pair's intense scenes. You might guess the film's ending, but it's well worth going on the journey.",4,1,2,6 November 2001
Chicken Run," FOWL PLAY
","This film has it's moments, and despite the Dreamworks cash is still very much a British affair. Sawalha doesn't have the clout to carry a movie, and makes for a limp uninspiring heroine. She was surrounded by better actresses, who were wasted in smaller roles. Whilst some of the movie reference gags are amusing, this format has been done to death now. How about an original, fresh gag?",4,0,4,3 July 2000
Insomnia," PACINO KEEPS QUIET SHOCK
","A solid follow up to the excellent 'Memento' from Nolan. An absorbing thriller, with a beautiful setting. You know where you're going, but there are enough sub-plots to pad out this tale.Good performances from the dependable Pacino, Swank and Donovan. Williams has been praised for a return to form. However I think he's beyond redemption, and was the weakest link in an otherwise good film..",4,1,2,12 October 2002
X-Men," X-People ??
","I'm no comic book nerd, and had no prior knowledge or expectations of the X-Men. This is the most intelligent summer blockbuster of 2000. A film that deals with issues of paranoia and prejudice. A film that delays the action, and respects it's audience to develop plot and character. It also captures the comic book darkness that prevailed in the atomic age/cold war 1950s and 1960s. No need to camp this up or dumb it down. A top cast in a welcome success.",6,0,0,21 August 2000
Thor: Ragnarok," Guardians of the Galaxy 3
",Movie night with Iris.The law of diminishing returns continues. It's fun and amusing. Indeed they're obsessed with making it the next GOTG film. But like most Marvel it lacks a decent baddie and clutters up the screen.,6,0,2,11 March 2018
The Last Song," Smiley Miley
","Movie night with Gertie.Sure the source novel is stronger. Colour by numbers effort to cash in on Miley Cyrus' TV fame. But hey it makes my daughters cry every time, so it must be doing something right.",5,0,0,20 January 2019
Ready Player One," Story guys?
","Movie night with Iris. Spielberg's Ready Player One nerdfest. It is so full of pop culture references, that it does eventually sag under the weight of its own nostalgia. There are some joys - the 80s pop, Atari games, the Iron Giant; and a fairground ride through The Shining.So you have 2-3 breathtaking set pieces, but not a lot to join it all together. The satirical stabs don't really land. Indeed Spielberg pulls his punches whenever the storytelling becomes too disturbing.",5,0,2,9 September 2018
"I, Tonya"," Trailer smash
","This is a fun film. Don't be looking for the historical recreation, this is a sometime hysterical interpretation.It has great fun avoiding sport film cliche's, and has something interesting to say about US snobbery. No redneck was going to win an Olympic gold.",7,1,1,20 May 2018
Snatch," SORTED GEEZER
","Elsewhere you can read my review of 'Lock Stock', which I thought was absolutely awful. So I was pleasantly surprised by 'Snatch'. It was better written, very funny and benefited from a good cast (apart from Jones).However, no more U.K gangster films for a while please. Overkill isn't the word, and they never match up to 'Get Carter'.",5,0,1,24 April 2001
BlacKkKlansman," missed target?
","Movie night with Iris.This is the funny, sometimes chilling true story of Ron Stallworth's infiltration of the KKK.It sometimes doesn't work as Spike Lee mixes a sometimes amusing tale with more preachy, self-reflexive moments. The veiled references to Donald Trump are pretty clunky to. However the incompetence of the Klan members is there for all to see. The sub-plot of the racist cop seemed a more interesting, and threatening story-line to me.Its most despairing moments come with its final reel - newsreel footage of white supremacists in Charlottesville last summer and Trump trying to excuse their murderous excesses.",7,0,2,6 January 2019
The Beach," DAMP SQUIB
","This is a very poor and sometimes nasty little film. The 'beach' cult are all so selfish and wrapped up in themselves. And to be honest Leo is no better. Does he go native because of his guilt (shark victims), or because he's upset that he's going to be excluded? Leo's love interest has one of the lightest roles in recent female cinema history. And the ending where she e-mails the picture. It's as if she's had a lovely little holiday. Why didn't the farmers turn the guns on all of them?",3,0,1,21 February 2000
Begin Again," NY Valentine
","Valentine night movie with da missus.Follow-up to the charming Once. This is a star-driven romantic comedy. Although it's more in love with gentrified New York. This is 100 minutes of relentless optimism, with no darkness or suffering.However, it warms the heart and i liked the ending.",6,0,0,15 February 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," i was wrong Iris
","Movie afternoon with Gertie.I must admit i'd always dismissed and dissed Captain US. However i've come round to him. He's witty, has an emotional arch, and is more than just a shield.So to it's credit CATWS does have a narrative. Like with Superman and Clark Kent, the most distinctive parts of this sequel aren't the action but the moments of character and plot: the Steve Rogers bits rather than the Captain America ones.",6,0,2,26 May 2019
Lost in Translation," EASTERN PROMISE
","A strong candidate for film of 2004. In the 'Brief Encounter' and 'Before Sunrise' mode, it's tale of fleeting glances and unresolved love.
Murray fulfills the potential he's been increasingly showing, and Johansson has a face that can tell a story.My one criticism is the ending. I would have finished with the muffled conversation, and the audience unsure of their future. The fact that they kiss undoes the good work. Sill it's a minor point, in an otherwise solid film.",5,1,3,2 February 2004
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Psycho sequel?
","Movie night with Iris.The In Bruges pedigree, means i was always attracted to this. There are some fantastic performances, and it's very funny for long periods. It perhaps has a few wrong turns that requires a lot of commitment. But i was willing to overlook those, and it rewards.And i like the nods to Psycho, the highway killed that road, a man with a domineering mother complex.",8,0,1,10 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Bendemption and redemption
","Movie afternoon with Iris and Gertie.How do you follow up the film that broke the internet in rage? In many ways you adopt a episode VII tick box exercise to satisfy the fans. Yes there will be arguments, obsessive deconstructions and over-interpretations. But.... at the end of the day this is still a Star Wars film in its very bones, muscle, and sinew. Which still captures magnificently the soul of this series, and i loved it sorry.The Rise of Skywalker is a packed film that barely gives its audience time to breath. So much to rattle through and conclude. This is gleefully chaotic, which brings its own pleasures.I doubt Disney have reached the final hours of the Skywalker saga, but this was a vibrant, heartfelt, ludicrous, and adventurous farewell. It was hard to say goodbye.",7,1,10,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," LUCAS DOES IT AGAIN
","The best review you can give this, is that it is not as bad as 'The Phantom Menace'. Considering that was one of the worst three films of all time, it is not difficult. This isn't as awful, it is just so dull beyond belief.
Should have given up after 'The Empire Strikes Back' Lucas.",1,2,6,7 December 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," AHH!!
","'Shrek' was for adults, there is no doubt. This is closer to 'Toy Story' in feel. It has a warmth and charm at it's core. Having said that, there is plenty for adults to enjoy. The voices are all fine, although it would have been nice for Buscemi to have had more to do. The plot is good, and the duration perfect.",4,2,11,21 February 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," WHERE WERE THE 1471's ??
","Zellwegger continues on from 'Nurse Betty', and is the best thing about the film. The film dispenses with the anguish and insecurity, instead settling for the cheap laughs. Having said that I only get to see a romantic comedy every other year, and it held my attention.Why does Hollywood in 2001 still have to portray London as a Dickensian winter wonderland??",5,0,0,18 April 2001
American Pie," OVERRATED COMEDY
","A film that followed on from 'There's Something About Mary' in a return to the gross-out comedies of the early 1980's.This film totally disregards it's female characters, and has no plot whatsoever. It's just a compilation of situation gags, some better than others. Designed to titillate and amuse 14 year old boys. I prefer my comedy more intelligent.",4,4,9,22 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," CALM DOWN FRODO ANORAKS
","So the normal IMDb discerning voters make this the best film of all time? Well they really need to go and have a lie down in a dark room. How on earth will they be able to cope, because it's 12 months until the next instalment of the Middle Earth adventures.This is not the 'Citizen Kane' or 'Vertigo' of the 21st century. It's a very good adventure film, and an excellent advert for a holiday in New Zealand. To me it's much more of a video game, than a narrative. Unless you've read the books, you learn nothing about any of the characters. Probably better than Potter, but it's not even one of the top 10 films of 2001.",4,1,2,5 January 2002
Armageddon," WILLIS SAVES THE WORLD (AGAIN)
","In many ways this film is awful. Shotguns going off on oil rigs, space shuttles crashing but people survive, moon buggies jumping over canyons etc. Having said that, it's very entertaining. Obviously the talented cast come to the film's rescue. My wife even cried when Willis spoke to Tyler before his death. You know what's coming, but you enjoy it.",4,0,1,2 May 2000
American Psycho," HIP TO BE SQUARE
","The first hour of this film is very good. Bale manages to make Bateman both amusing, repulsive and boring. In steering away from the violence and concentrating on the excesses and faults of the 1980s, therein lies the film's problem. It begins to get a bit repetitive. Notwithstanding it's good in comparison to some of the competition, and the ending perfectly concludes what we've learnt about Bateman.",5,0,1,2 May 2000
North by Northwest," BEST FILM IN THE WORLD (WHEN YOU'RE POORLY)
","There is a tradition in my house that if I'm poorly I always watch this film. It recaptures the spirit of Hitchcock's 1930 British adventures, and is the best adventure tale in cinematic history.  Nobody is cooler on the screen than Grant, and Mason runs him close with a sense of humour to boot.",8,1,2,26 January 2004
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," getting the gang back
","Movie night with Gertie.Spider-Man gets an injection in the veins, with this animated outing. Brimming full of visual flair, humour, music and style. So good it even has the best Nic Cage outing for ten years.Granted, the balance isn't always perfect. Man it's a busy film where each emotion, wonder or depth can be gone in a flash, but it's a thrill to immerse yourself in this world.",8,0,1,13 April 2019
American Beauty," AND THE WINNER IS....
","Recent films such as 'The Ice Storm' and 'Happiness' have dealt with disfunctional families and/or suburbia better. However, in it's context as a major studio 'Hollywood' production, this film is excellent. Regular film goers should already be well aware of Kevin Spacey's class, but it's Annette Bening who really shines. If only to stop anything with Tom Hanks in it, then 'American Beauty' could be that rarity. A decent Oscar winner.",8,0,0,16 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," ORIGINAL
","Although the movie stumbles a little in the 2nd half, it's originality mark it out as a rare gem. So much of what we see is formula and consumer driven. Keener is superb, and Cusack reminds us of his 'Gross Pointe' ability. Don't be put off by people describing this film as 'weird'. It's a modern day fairytale, and one of the must-see films for 2000.",6,1,2,27 March 2000
Spider-Man," DON'T BELIEVE THE SPIN
","Maguire is perfectly cast as Parkey/Spidey, and the first hour of this film are excellent. The college and wrestling scenes are really funny. Dunst is beautiful, and the newspaper editor nearly steals the film.
The 2nd half is a bit of a disappointment. The action is quite flat. The ending (with a 9/11 nod) will make you want to puke. The Green Goblin might be faithful to the comics, but he's a joke. Your foe should either be evil, scary or charismatic.",4,0,0,19 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," ITALIAN JOB 2
","Word reaches me that a re-make of 'The Italian Job' is in the offing. Firstly it would be awful, and secondly do not bother because you've got all the ingredients here.Yes Soderbergh and Clooney have done and will do better. But there's a lot to enjoy here. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the stars seem able to live with each other's company.",4,0,1,30 April 2003
The Usual Suspects," KEYSER SOZE IS....
","Returned to this following a DVD Christmas present. What can you say? Looks excellent, excellent script, excellent cast and one of the top 5 endings ever. Easily one of the best 3 films of the 1990s. You'll remember when Spacey was good, Byrne was a star and Del Toro was a baby.Will enjoy returning to this time after time.",8,0,2,2 January 2003
Yesterday," and Ringo
","I was genuinely shocked when Danny Boyle's name appeared at the end credits. This pleasant, but a flimsy RomCom.It's amiable, not that funny; and like the rail side recording studio goes off the rails. The premise requires a massive pinch of salt, and can you have a hero who is prepared to plagiarise on a massive scale and to steal plaudits that shouldn't be his?",5,0,1,10 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Fitting finale
","Movie night with Iris.The Avengers franchise comes to both a rich and mostly satisfying conclusion. This is complex and emotional stuff, but doesn't take itself too seriously.Despite the running time the action felt paired back, and the intimate scenes given equal billing.The basic plot is pretty clunky, but the Back to the Future gags acknowledge that. The feminist apologies even clunkier, and too late. However the film delivers spectacle, gags and an intelligent, emotional kick.",8,0,6,28 May 2019
Tigerland," YOUNG MEL GIBSON ??
","Schumacher= useless. Anti-Vietnam = been done a 100 times previous. Brother's recommendation = mixed track record at best. As you can see I had little expectations when his was on Sky recently.So what a surprise. Well acted by a relatively unknown cast, you really cared about their fate. a much greater emphasis on their relationships and personalities, than sergeants shouting for 90 minutes. Looks really good as well.",4,1,2,1 February 2003
Toy Story 4," not required
","Movie afternoon with Gertie.Why mess with the perfect trilogy? This doesn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't add anything. It rehashes old separation plots, and didn't make me laugh until the last 10-minutes.It sidelines established characters, and introduces new inferior ones.

","So many of the reviews argue about the merits of Kaufman. But who cares. Is this a good film or not? Yes and no is the answer. It's interesting and the performances are all competent. However you're left with the feeling, that the subject matter is too thin to stretch to a 120 minute movie.",3,3,5,2 February 2002
The Pianist," HE CAN PLAY
","The Cannes winner is always much more interest than the Oscar winner, and 2002 is no exception.The first half recreation of the Nazi horrors in 1940s Warsaw is excellent. You also ignore the 'C' list cast and care about the characters. Brody continues to show promise, and this is a return to form for Polanski.",5,3,7,16 February 2003
The Favourite," Colman, Stone & Weisz should have shared the Oscar
","Movie night with Iris.This is deranged, unsettling stuff, with a strong vein of humour and vulgarity. The script and score are both sensational.Colman is superb, but so are Weisz and Stone. This is revisionist fare with three women at the centre of the film shooting guns, gorging on food and sex; plotting each other's downfall. Bravo.",8,2,5,26 May 2019
City of God," (BAD) BOYS FROM BRAZIL
","This is an awesome film, that has really set the standards for 2003. The samba score sets a tremendous pace, and the film moves at breath-neck speed. The nod to 'Goodfellas' is all too obvious. It's witty, well-written, well-acted, and perhaps not as violent as you'd expect. Two scenes stick in the mind, the decision as to which child to kill and the slow-motion strobe-light execution at the party. Are these kids or gangsters? Excellent, don't miss.",6,2,10,18 January 2003
Avengers: Infinity War," Game of 2 halves
","Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride. For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes.It's very funny, and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain, cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther, bar the fantastic Wakanda battle, Everyone floats away at the end, and it will do likewise in my memory.",6,0,3,6 October 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," ANG LEE DOES IT AGAIN
","Another Ang Lee triumph, that confirms his position as one of the top 3 contemporary directors. Whilst not quite up to 'Ride The High Country', this is a stunning beautiful film. The fights are electric, the photography is rich, and we have a good old-fashioned adventure/romance tale. It calls on so many other genres other than just martial arts. Catch a quality film, or if you're sad go see 'Castaway'.",7,0,1,9 January 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," LA love-in
","A real Marmite movie. One that i liked on first watching, and a day or two later has actually gone up in my estimation. I've found Tarantino's last 10-15 years increasingly awful - long, overblown, questionable and dated. I came to this with lowish expectations and was pretty much blown away.The heartbeat of this movie is the fantastic chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt(Redford). Thrown together maybe, but with a sweet, genuine friendship. Leo studied intensity and Brad easy smiles and laid-back charm. It's an exhilarating pairing.Tarantino sets his film in the months leading up the Manson family murders, letting the tension rise, like storm clouds rolling in to kill off the flower power 60's. Rick and Cliff symbolise the last gasps of classical Hollywood, now threatened by the decade's counterculture.There's no doubt the director feels greatly for Tate and the film's most tender scene sees her slip into a local cinema to watch her latest movie. Robbie comes alive as she giggles and blushes when people applaud, close to tears in the knowledge that she's made an impact (however small) on the world.The ending takes risks that will inevitably divide audiences - i hated it, but now think it's perfect.",8,0,2,25 January 2020
A Quiet Place," Shush
","'Stay silent, stay alive,' is the survival technique in Krasinski's original, ingenious horror film. This relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension; and is all the better for that. And a la Jaws the screeching, rumbling score is dominant in heightening the sense of dread.The silence and use of sign language means you have to put your phone down and concentrate. Refreshing, and how it draws you in. There is a fantastic scene where they hold hands and and say grace.And for once Hitchcock companions are relevant. Krasinski really knows how to put his audience on edge. The danger doesn't come just from the creatures. With a protruding nail on the staircase, very much coming home to roost.The Abbotts have the same problems as any other family. The kids are fantastic, and sibling rivalry never better captured. And a true-life husband and wife that seem like a true couple. We care about this family, which means we are both on the edge of our seats and absorbed in this drama.",8,1,3,5 January 2019
School of Rock," LET US ROCK
","Black has long deserved top billing, and he takes advantage of his opportunity. This is a cliched tale, given fresh injection and an edge by Linklater and Black. The kids don't get on your nerves (too much), and there's a rockin' soundtrack. Black is an undoubted star, but you feel/hope he won't totally sell himself out. A genuine film for 6 year olds to 66 year olds, that doesn't belittle the young or annoy the olduns. Plus it's funny.  The only concern is the obvious sequel, that will fail to match the original. I now await Linklater's rumoured follow-up to 'Before Sunrise'.",4,1,5,4 March 2004
Call Me by Your Name," languid love
","Coming of age film set over a long, lazy Italian summer. It will certainly influence your holiday plans. It builds the 1980s feel and romantic desire neatly. Tiny throwaway incidents (touches, glances) assume great importance. Chalamet is as good as he was in Ladybird.The Sunday supplement travel-brochure approach does start to grate though. Where are the consequences? Is the skin legion a portent of AIDS? The director is happy to show heterosexual oral sex, but pans away during gay lovemaking?As always with this genre, we are always aware that time is passing, that summer will soon end. That the characters will have to move on. This has beautiful moments, but perhaps is a little style over substance.",7,6,13,29 April 2018
Moulin Rouge!," SPECTACLE
","As a man who dislikes musicals, I was surprised to find myself enjoying this film. I was also surprised to find that Kidman and McGregor could sing. Kidman can certainly hold a film these days, and her opening is breathtaking.In many ways this film is just like a West End show. It's all spectacle over content or narrative. Luhrmann's 2 previous efforts had greater substance, but perhaps not this much style.",4,1,2,23 September 2001
Coco," Bueno
","Movie morning with Iris/ Gertie.After a patchy few years, this is a Pixar semi-return to form. And it's themes perfect for our Corona-times.Some will say Disney is obsessed with death, but it's good to get the topic out in the open for children and adults alike. Although it's stronger theme is around the family.The visual detail is astounding at times. The Land Of The Dead is a blingy sugar rush of transportation systems, music venues and cribs. It's funny and although it gets a but maudlin, i resonated to this graceful film.",7,0,0,12 April 2020
1917," Video game that still gets you
","Hot on the heels of (the better) Dunkirk comes 1917.There are two distinct chapters to this film: the first half all mud and macabre; the second despair and hallucinatory. In the first half, we have the brown landscapes of trenches and into No Man's Land. The second an orange bombed-out French town.While the two-take structure works well for ramping up the claustrophobia, it comes close to veering into Indiana Jones territory. What saves things, is that you instantly relate to our two heroes, which brings the pay-off at the finale.",8,0,1,1 February 2020
Mulholland Drive," OVERRATED FARE
","The critics have applauded this early 2002 release, but to be honest I think they've got a little carried away. It certainly looks superb, and has all the right nods to films such as 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Double Indemnity'. It's typical Lynch fare, and the first hour are excellent. However it does deteriorate in the second half, and becomes a bit of a muddled mess. It's also undeniable that it steals many of his previous ideas from 'Twin Peaks'.",3,1,4,14 January 2002
8 Mile," SILLY RABBIT ??
","The track record of rappers-turned-actors, and hip-hop films is not good. So lets get one thing straight, this is not a bad film. Also Eminem is the best thing about it, acting the likes of Basinger off the screen. What lets the film down is the script. It really is 'Rocky' in old-skool sneakers. So it's not a classic, and a disappointment after Hanson's previous work; but it's still a very watchable film.",3,0,2,29 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," GREAT TRACKSUIT
","A film that gives so much respect to the Japanese samurai films and the Leone spaghetti westerns. So I was always going to like it. It's no 'Reservoir dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction', but it's the most energetic output in 2003.Big, bold brash and funny. A funky soundtrack to match, and Thurman lights up the screen.",4,2,4,10 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," BORING BORING ACTION
","Action films are so dull. They've had their day, and that was the 1980s.Added to the tedium, you have some awful acting. Scott is fast becoming one of the worst actors around. It can be no coincidence that he was in the equally awful 'Gregory's Girl 2'. Cruise can, and has done better. Does he really need the cash?",2,2,6,27 February 2002
Cold War," Glorious
","Movie night with Iris.This is glorious stuff that like 'Ida' rekindles the glory days of 60's New Wave cinema.Supposedly inspired by Pawlikowski's own parents, this is shot in gorgeous black and white. Mesmerising is the wonderful fiery, impulsive performance from Kulig. Her relationships are combustible in the extreme. Real can't live without each other, can't live with each other.Without being explicit or epic, the film leaps around the post-war Iron curtain. As the years pass, the two lads continue to crash into one another. The film never loses its intimate, playful and humorous tone. In under 90 minutes we're taken right through the main staging posts in the two lovers' lives. Separation, betrayal, alcoholism, ageing and even imprisonment.",8,0,2,3 February 2019
A Bug's Life," NOT FIT TO LICK 'ANTZ' BOOTS
","The rest of the world sees this as superior to 'Antz'. Why?? 'Antz' is the best Woody Allen film in the past 5 years. 'Antz' created characters that reflected their famous alter-egos. 'A Bug's Life' lacks any originality, intelligence and always goes for the easy visual gag. In comparison with it's 'Toy Story' stablemate, it has none of the creative strengths.",4,0,7,16 December 2000
The Insider," BEST ACTOR
","Although I enjoyed 'Heat', I've always felt it to be an overrated film. However, 'The Insider' is a great film, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Pacino manages to control his shouting, and give his best performance for a long time. Whilst Crowe is simply superb. You get the sense of his character's shyness, anger, tension and loneliness. I wanted Spacey to take the BEST ACTOR, but Crowe deserves it a lot more. A film with no sex, violence, action that will leave you gripped and hooked for every minute.",9,0,0,14 March 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," PALE IMITATION
","If you want a mental ward drama on the big screen, then you really look no further than 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. This is an overlong and uninvolving drama.How Jolie won an Oscar is beyond me. She's merely copying Pitt from '12 Monkeys', and Ryder is much better.",2,13,24,3 January 2002
Midsommar," Scandi Wicker
","Not really a horror film, more a disturbing, psychological insight into grief. Midsommar is the first pagan break-up movie, which has a major nod to The Wicker Man.This film has brutal violence, the deaths are shocking and gruesome. And the orgies are a little awkward. But it isn't a horror film. This is about what happens when you drop a fragile relationship into the most extreme of circumstances.Florence Pugh is fantastic - fact. She is always fantastic - fact. One memorable scene where she collapses on to the floor under the weight of her own anguish, wailing like an animal. But Reynor is also decent, reacting to everything like a deer in headlights. His coping mechanism is to straight out refuse to process anything that's happening to him.The film, which stretches to nearly three hours, is in no rush to reach its horrifying conclusion. It never dragged and you feel like one of the characters, uncertain about the impending situation. This is strange and distressing stuff, punishing at times. But a film filled with ideas, images, and feelings that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",8,9,14,26 January 2020
Toy Story 2," Good (BUT NOT THAT GOOD)
","Yes this film is a lot of fun. Yes the 'Star Wars' and 'Jurassic Park' gags lend it an adult intelligence. However, this film is not a classic as some have made out. It's not even that much of an improvement on the first outing. Enjoy but don't exaggerate.",7,0,1,15 February 2000
The Hurricane," SO IT'S NOT ABOUT ALEX HIGGINS ??
","I thought I was going to be getting more of a boxing film, than a prison film. I was therefore pleasantly surprised. Washington is excellent (as usual), and it is certainly a powerful story. I thought the ending was a little bit too Hollywood, and that they'd nicked a few ideas from 'In The Name Of The Father'. Well worth catching on satellite, or at the video sore.",4,2,4,16 January 2002
A Clockwork Orange," FINALLY GET TO VIDDY THIS
","And so finally I get to see this film on the big screen. Visually it is superb, and the first half contains some of the great cinematic images and/or scenes. Although McDowall is excellent, you cannot say that for the rest of the cast. The film also drags in the 2nd half, and doesn't offer the most earth shattering argument about the state and violence. In many ways it recreates the Burgess novel faithfully. However the book portrays Alex as much more intelligent, and the government therapy is more prolonged and sinister. This is not Kubrick's finest, but it is one of the key films of the 1970s.",6,0,1,20 March 2000
From Hell," WAS IT GULL THOUGH??
","Very loosely based around 'Jack The Ripper', this is really an excuse for Hollywood to recreate Victorian London as depicted in the 1968 'Oliver'.Graham just doesn't cut it as a tart, but Depp and Coltane always perform above the material. Doesn't really matter whether it was Gull, but this is watchable tosh.",Null,1,3,10 February 2004
Groundhog Day," DEJA VU
","Speaking as someone who's experiencing 'Groundhog Day' trying to get his house move done, this is welcome relief for 90 minutes. If this had been made in the 1940s we'd be voting for it in our all-time top 10s.One of the best comedies of the 1990s. Murray has never been funnier or better. Even McDowell doesn't annoy (too much).",6,8,23,28 August 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," VERY POOR
","I missed this at the cinema, but heard many good things from my friends about this. I finally caught it on Sky last Saturday, and what an overrated film I saw. The film didn't contain a decent actor to take the lead, and comprised rejects from 'The Bill', sitcoms and Wimbledon F.C. The film didn't contain an original idea, and stole shamelessly from 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Trainspotting', 'Goodfellas', 'Only Fools & Horses' and 'The Italian Job'. The humour and stereotypes were like a bad episode of 'Minder'. It was shot in a grainy stock to compare with some of the British 70s classics. However this most certainly is not a 'Get Carter' or 'The Long Good Friday'. It was more a wet dream for FHM readers. All stylish clothes and no substance, and where was a female character?",1,12,25,6 March 2000
Titanic," BOTTOM OF THE SEA
","Yes it does entertain, and doesn't feel like 3 hours plus. However this film is pretty poor. Some of the lines like 'that Picasso will never amount to anything', and 'i'm so lucky to be on the Titanic' are crass beyond belief. Billy Zane is like a baddie out of a bad episode of Scooby-Doo. Why didn't the salvage crew tell the old dear to get on with it, and just tell them where the necklace was? Script over special effects please.",4,1,4,21 February 2000

The Matrix Reloaded," SEQUEL STUMBLES
","'The Matrix' was creative, original and stylish. This fails to live up to expectations.Everytime someone (Fishbourne especially) opens their mouth, it's absolute tosh.

Mystic River," GOOD BUT NOT THAT GOOD
","Eastwood is always an interesting director and has made some of my favourite films. And Penn, Roberts, Bacon and Fishbourne are an impressive 2003 cast.
So I have to say I was a little disappointed. I guessed the murderer early on, and the three leads seemed more interested in Oscar nominations than contributing to the cast. Still a lot better than a lot that is around.",4,0,0,25 November 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," THIS IS CHRISTMAS
",The greatest Christmas film ever. It does exactly what it says on the cover. But it also is a film with a dark undertone. Something that Hitchcock would utilise to greater effect from Stewart. So many standout scenes and characters that will go down in cinematic history. The 'Pottersville' scenes are especially good. Brings a tear (or 10) to my wife's eye every December 24th.,8,1,6,25 December 2000
Enemy at the Gates," KEEP DOWN JUDE

Joker," like my Marmite
","The Marmite movie of 2019, i feel is a borderline masterpiece. With massive nods to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, this portraits a future super villain as a troubled young man. Phoenix playing him in a way that makes him seem both sympathetic and extremely creepy.Evoking Chaplin and 1940s musicals, Joker is more Scorsese than comic book universe. The steps scenes are truly beautiful - whether dragging himself up or dancing down in his warpaint. One scene see him reach the summit, with the beautiful Gotham landscape behind him.The tone of this film is darker (yes darker) than Nolan's Batman films. Phoenix's Joker is a more brooding and introspective clown than Ledger's. Action scenes are in relatively short supply. This isn't a superhero movie after all, bar for one brilliantly set piece on the Gotham subway, with two hapless police officers caught in the throng.As viewers, we can't help but root for Arthur. We suffer with him in the excruciating scenes when his comedy fails. It is only natural instinct to want him to succeed, and it's a borderline happy ending when he finally stands up for himself.",9,4,8,1 March 2020
Bring It On," CHEER LEADING (AND THAT'S IT)
","If you and your family are laid low by a tummy bug, then this is perfect fluffy entertainment.

Perhaps more satirical, along the lines of 'Election' or 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'.",2,1,3,7 January 2003

","Netflix stab at peak Woody Allen, and what a rush this film is. Funny, affecting, well-acted; a little gem. Certainly Baumbach's best work since The Squid and the Whale. Johansson and Driver both giving memorably raw and tender performances.Another pleasure lies in three tremendous, supporting performances from lawyers' Dern, Alda and Liotta. A stand out scene is an argument where Johansson and Driver tear strips off one another with an uncomfortable viciousness. This film never loses its sense of humour and absurdity. So, in spite of the millennial bleakness it still feels redemptive at the end.",8,7,10,11 January 2020
Blow," DEPP CAN DO BETTER
","Drugs films are pretty formulaic. You know the score, get high on the early success and then come cashing to earth. Well this film pretty much sticks to the script.

","This film does great service to the excellent Ted Hughes tale. It is one of the most beautiful animations of recent years.

Shrek," NOT QUITE TOY STORY
","Take this film as summer multiplex fare, and it towers over some of it's competitors. It's funny, amusing, stunning and short. However it's not as clever as it thinks it is. Yes 'The Matrix' and Disney gags are funny. However I bet they'll be a Dreamworks theme park in 10 years time. Also, doesn't every Disney theme have a witty sidekick with all the best lines. Ultimately 'Toy Story' and 'Antz' set the standards, and this isn't quite up to it.Can someone also explain why Myers is doing a bad Ewan McGregor impression?

Why does Di Caprio keep attempting poor Irish accents. You kept expecting the Titanic to dock at any moment. You can't really take him as a rival for the butcher, but it's still an engrossing tale.The secondary civil war plot suffers from the cuts, and you feel it's resumption is very rushed.An honourable entertaining effort, but we expected so much more.",4,5,10,23 January 2003
