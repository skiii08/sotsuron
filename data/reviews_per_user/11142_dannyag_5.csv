The Ring," Who said this movie was scarier than the 'Exorcist'?!?!
","Ok.....some of you kiddies who have seen this movie are probably not going to like this but 'The Ring' doesn't hold a CANDLE to 'The Exorcist'. We're not even talking the same sport here, let alone the same ballpark. After all the hype and all the stories going around that this movie is as scary as or scarier than the 'Exorcist, I decided to let my daughter go out an buy it since I'm a BIG horror/Sci-fi fan. I popped in the DVD and we were on our way.  The first scene, poorly acted, by two teenagers was the first omen that I was NOT going to like this movie. I don't mind 'campy' or 'corny' horror movies provided that they're not hailed as 'the horror movie event of the century' or 'The scariest movie ever made'.In any event, After the opening scene, I decided to give it a chance before leaving the room.  Well, I'll tell ya what......when she opened that door with the water leaking out from under it to reveal the TV playing that water well in black and white and the camera RUSHED at her face.....I nearly poopied in my pants!!!   (LOL).
'Ok' , I thought....'you got my attention!!'  That was ONE of the three, maybe four scary scenes throughout the entire movie.  Enter Naomi Watts.......Where did this girl/woman get her license to act!??!?!........In a cracker jack box!??!!?   MY GOD, MAN.....she was absolutely horrible! SO bad, in fact, that she ruined the entire movie in my opinion.  Ok.....so there's more bad acting.  I figure, what the heck, let me finish it because I really have to see what everyone is talking about. And besides, that opening scene was really something.
She watches the tape and blah blah blah.....she tries to figure out what's going on with the death of her niece and more blah blah blah......Then there's a horse that escapes from his container on a ferry boat and jumps in the water and more blah blah blah.....THEN, she finds Brian Cox, who by the way, played in 'Manhunter' aka 'Red Dragon', the first Hannibal Lecter.  He's a GREAT actor and it was a pleasure to watch him. He's no Anthony Hopkins, mind you, but still a great actor.Anyway, moving right along here.......Instead of telling you what happens and giving away scenes, I'll just tell you that, overall, this is a VERY decent thriller despite the horrible acting and slow scenes inbetween the scary ones.  The moments in this movie that are scary, are TRULY HORRIFYING.  I'll give 'em that one!   There's a scene near the mid-end where her ex is watching the TV and Samara starts to emerge from the well. OH MY GOD!   That's All I'm going to say!  If THAT doesn't raise the hair off your skin, nothing will!
It's just a shame that this movie wasn't done a little better. It COULD have easily been as scary as the Exorcist but the poor acting and holes in the plot prevented it.  Again, the foundation is there for a brilliant thriller/horror movie but it just didn't make the grade.  I'll give it 7 out of 10 for the really creepy scenes that were truly horrifying. I just get upset when you have all the makings of a GREAT movie and then poor acting and holes in the plot ruin it.  And as always, I hope I haven't offended anyone.  The younger crowd my absolutely LOVE this movie as my daughter did.",9,1,1,5 March 2003
Se7en," You GOTTA be kiddin' me, right?!?!?!
","'Seven' was one of the best detective thrillers I've seen in years. Fast paced, somewhat realistic despite Pitt's terrible acting ability in almost everything he does.  A notable scene comes to mind with that said.......where he's got the gun pointed at Spacey and screaming when he knows what's in the box........that has got to be some of the WORST acting I've ever seen.  I believe that Keanu Reeves might be able to do a better job, or maybe even Kathy Ireland would have done a better job as well. Anyway, despite all of that, the movie is STILL quite gripping.  And yes, just because someone is a bad actor/actress doesn't mean that the movie they play in can't be great! Seven is one of those examples!  Morgan Freeman, one of the greatest American actors today held that movie together along with Spacey as far as I'm concerned!   Definitely worth a look!",10,0,1,20 February 2003
Pitch Black," What is all the fuss about!?!?!?!?
","I'm STILL trying to figure out what the fuss is all about regarding 'Pitch Black'!  It was recommended to me by a friend who swore up and down that THIS was the movie event for the year.  After viewing it, I wanted to harm him for recommending such a lousy, poorly acted, poorly written film.
What did I miss?!  It seems that my friend wasn't the only one who actually LIKED this movie. I don't get it.....I just don't get it!   And this is coming from someone who is EXTREMELY forgiving when it comes to B movies provided that there is SOME sort of redeeming quality to it.  In my opinion, this flick had NOT A SINGLE ONE!   Sorry folks, but for those of you who haven't seen it, save the cash and wait for it to be broadcast on regular TV......and even then, if you can find something else to do, such as cook or clean the house, then I recommend the latter!",Null,8,16,20 February 2003
Blade Runner," If I were stuck on an island........
","......You know how the rest of this goes.  This would be the movie I'd bring with me if I were allowed only one!   What can I say about Bladerunner that hasn't been said!  It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over and over and over again!  I like the original theatrical release with Deckard telling the story as they do in film noir....but that's just my preference.  From what I hear, there is going to be a new digital transfer DVD becoming available this year sometime with THREE versions on it.  I can't WAIT for that to come out! Hopefully, it will be THX mastered! For any of you who have not seen this movie......all I can say is, GET IT!",10,0,1,20 February 2003
The Deer Hunter," I don't see what the fuss was about.
","Well, this is one of the movies that I missed when I was growing up.  Probably because I was so into Sci-Fi and Horror that this just didn't seem appealing to me at all. About 13 years after it's release, I rented it and fell asleep during it.  I never got a chance to see it all the way thru. I had to have the tape back before I had a chance to finish it.  I recently purchased it on DVD because of what little I remembered of it years ago and because I fell asleep during its first viewing.  I just watched it on DVD..... and again, I almost fell asleep.  DiNiro was great, as usual and so was Streep. I would never say this movie 'sucked' or was bad but I have to say, it seemed SO slow to me.  I mean, an hour of footage at the wedding was just too much.  I really don't see what the fuss was all about.  Maybe if I had viewed it during the year of its release, I may think differently about it now.  But that's just my 2 cents worth.  I hope I haven't offended anyone.",5,1,2,28 February 2003
