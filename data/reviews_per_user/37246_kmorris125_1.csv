The Equalizer," The ultimate action thriller
","Denzel in a word is just brilliant and genuine in every scene. He owns it. This is just an all around edgy feel good thriller. There's the bonus of a good guy having to do some very bad things in the name of justice. He's trying to mind his own business and the cruel world just keeps reeling him in and forcing him to use the skill set that he would rather forget about. I love a good action movie and this delivers.I loved the character development and his relationships with the guy at work and the teen-aged hooker. Loved it so much, I may make it back to the movies again to see it. Will not discuss specific plot and story lines as that have been done repetitively here. Although the villain was great and kept my attention as well. I loved the way he saunters around in his tailored suits and the mind bending exchanges that he and Denzel have with one another.",9,2,9,4 October 2014
