The Incredible Hulk," not a sequel
","when i first heard about The Incredible Hulk coming out again i thought it would be a sequel of the first one with Eric Bana, but when i heard they had brought in Edward Norton i knew then that this is going to be a different type of film and i was right. The Hulk looked a lot more realistic than it did in the first one and instead of having it just about Bruce Banner and how the Hulk was destroying his life, they shown how it effected other characters as well most notably Betty Ross.Overall, all the acting was superb especially Edward Norton (The Hulk), Liv Tyler (Betty Ross), Tim Roth (Emil Blonsky) and William Hurt (General 'Thunderbolt' Ross), the cameo from the original hulk (Lou Ferrigno) brought humour to the film.so my rating of this is a good 9/10",Null,2,4,19 June 2008
