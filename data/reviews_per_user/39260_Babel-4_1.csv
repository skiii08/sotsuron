Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing!
","Wow! The movie was simply incredible. While nothing could possibly ever live up to all the hype that has surronded this movie, it comes quite close. The special effects are, as expected, amazing. The first twenty minutes did drag a little but after that the movie really took off. The final few scenes were really incredible and tied the whole movie together quite nicely. This movie is a little different than the others in the saga thus far, in that the plot is more complex and involved which may turn off some viewers. Overall though it is an excellent first episode and really fits in with what Lucas has already done. I can't wait for the next two parts!",10,0,1,19 May 1999
