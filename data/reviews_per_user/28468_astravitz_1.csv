Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Links to Borat Press Confrence
","Sacha Baron Cohen is not only a comic genius, but is also a marketing genius. Hopefully IMDb will not mind sharing some links related to the movie on external sites with additional deleted scenes and staged press conferences. I think S.B.C.'s either created a new type of comedy genre or reinvented one that is long past.These are all safe to view prior to the movie, but you may want to save them for after.I came across these links on 'The Movie Reporter dot com' site and thought they were worth posting:http://www.themoviereporter.com/newvideo/borat1.wmvhttp://www.themoviereporter.com/newvideo/borat2.wmvhttp://www.themoviereporter.com/newvideo/borat3.wmvThere is also the 'Unofficial Borat Site' with deleted scenes:http://www.boratonline.co.uk/",10,2,13,7 November 2006
