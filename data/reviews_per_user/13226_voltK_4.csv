The Hangover," The end credits are funny - the movie isn't.
","Did you think the scenes in the trailer were funny? Well, they're actually not very funny at all; it's all slick editing. And yes, as expected, these are the only highlights (if they can be called) of the movie. IMDb's top 250? You've got to be kidding me! Remember that old Tom Hanks movie from 1984 called Bachelor Party? Well, the writers tried to put a new spin on the concept of a crazy bachelor party as movie material but with one big difference: they left out the bachelor party! Now, this fact is not concealed in the trailers. It is made very clear that this movie is about a group of buddies trying to piece together what exactly happened the previous night during their wild bachelor party from which they can't recall anything. However, the writers didn't really make that into a particularly funny story.So, here's my spoiler: during the credits, you see photos that were taken during the bachelor party. This is just about the only funny part of the movie. And it makes glaringly clear how the movie would have been so much fun if they had simply made it about the bachelor party. Spoiler over.My advice is to wait until it's out on comedy central. There really isn't much inappropriate material to get cut out for network television anyways.",5,0,1,20 September 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," So Bad, It's .... Bad!
","Oh. My. God. What have they done to this franchise? There isn't a single aspect of the 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' that is an improvement on the 2002 film 'Spider-Man'.The CGI looks really amateurish, the dialog is horrible (hey scriptwriters, that is NOT how people speak to each other), the story is simply uninteresting, there is too much going on and no aspect of the story is really well developed, the villains have no character development at all, and the acting is atrocious (even Jamie Foxx did an awful job). Don't waste your time - don't waste your money. Trust me, you DON'T need to see for yourself just how awful this is.",1,4,30,12 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Space Comedy, just like The Fifth Element
","I'm not a Star Wars-obsessed fanboy. And I'm not some middle-aged guy who watched Star Wars as a little kid and fell in love with it. I also do NOT hate Disney or their films (I actually like a lot of them). I'm simply a reviewer who appreciates good movies and good storytelling.This movie was AWFUL. This story was just stupid.I didn't think The Last Jedi would actually be worse than The Force Awakens, but I was wrong. It's much worse. The Last Jedi is essentially a lighthearted family Disney comedy (i.e. children's movie) done with live action and CGI instead of animation.The story is awful; very poorly written. Probably the worst aspect is the overabundance of corny one-liners and slapstick humor. The comedy diffuses all the tension in every scene so that you never really invest emotionally in the movie.I wasn't even going to see this in the theater, but my family asked me to come along. I wasn't expecting much, but I did see the trailer. I thought for sure the producers would try just a little harder to make a good movie after noticing how many people disliked The Force Awakens. They didn't notice, or just don't care about anything except $$$.It's like they weren't even trying to make a good movie. There were a lot of great actors in this movie, but their talent was wasted because the story/script/screenplay was so bad.Adults: don't waste your money on this garbage.",1,2,3,27 December 2017
Alien: Covenant," Supreme Disappointment
","I loved Prometheus and was very excited about a sequel that would answer some of the unanswered questions from that movie. Unfortunately, Alien: Covenant is garbage. You're basically just watching the crew of the Covenant get picked off one by one by CGI aliens, and there's about 5 minutes or so that answer a few questions about what happened after the end of Prometheus. The plot is like something written by a teenager. The characters are uninteresting and unlikable, and you're really not given any time to get to know them or care about them. It looks like the film didn't earn back what they spent to make it. They deserve to take a loss for releasing such a lame movie like this one.",1,2,3,3 August 2017
