Skyfall," Boring
","Well, Skyfall starts as any Bond movie, following with one of the top 5 songs ever been as Bond song, so I was thrilled. What a waste of time. The story and the plot is great, but what does the director do? I hate when in lack of the abilities all the action is shot in darkness. Note to the director: It is more difficult to shoot action in daylight. Just so boring piece of an Bond movie. Seen better. I think this is the second worse ever made. That's why the two stars. Don't know, seen all the Bond movies and this just makes me vomit? Daniel Craig is as awesome as always, but the film sucks. Sad day to the story of 007. I miss my youth.",2,6,14,8 March 2013
Pitch Perfect," Great and funny
","Well I saw this movie today, and I'll say that Anna Kendeick has still the most beautiful smile that has seen in the movies after Ingrid Bergman. Just the smile... Well, the movie is so predictable all the way, so I think this is not a spoiler. Bit boring occasionally, but I think this is the first movie in a long time where there was no kissing! Kissing makes the movie slow and stupid-musicated, Musicish? Anyway, this is the most enjoyable movie, if you don*t seek any 'artsy' stuff. This is just an entertaining comedy with a flow. Story is predictable, but it is well done. 2 stars gor the smile of Anna Kendrick, one star for the music. 5 stars go to the director for making this movie bit interesting and funny that it is.",8,0,1,27 July 2013
