Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Commercial Menace
","Personally, I went to this movie with hopes higher than the budget of this hollow movie. Seeing it on the opening night at midnight, I sat wondering 'what went wrong?' The movie's got superior special effects to all the 'original' trilogy, and a plot which, unfortunately, does not follow suit. The film is built around George Lucas' love for the hollow world of computer generated imagery, which dazzles us (the podrace sequence) but still left me feeling unfulfilled. If there were as much time dedicated to the human characters (almost none of which I found likeable) as were dedicated to the effects, this movie would be a masterpiece the likes of which we've never seen. However, it falls short in a kick in the stomach kind  of disappointment.",6,0,1,25 August 1999
Aliens," Suspense with character
","This is not only a visually attractive movie, but you're held in place by the characters you could keep watching time and time again. Bill Paxton's Private Hudson is probably the standout in the bunch, Michael Biehn and Sigourney Weaver are great as well though. With all these great characters moving you through the movie, you feel like you almost dont need the suspenseful feeling. The last half hour are exactly as an action movie should be. Truly a great movie.",9,0,0,23 August 1999
Die Hard," The defining action movie
","Having seen this movie millions of times over, I'd say it's an understatement to say that I love it. Bruce Willis, though not the best drama actor I've seen, is great as the every man type John McLane, tough as nails (hence the name Die Hard), yet his strongest and most stubborn opponent seems to be his estranged wife, vie president  of the Nakatomi Corperation, and a New York -LA transport. Truly the secondary menace has to be Hans Gruber (wonderfully played by Alan Rickman), leader of the terrorist group who take over the Nakatomi Building where John has come to meet up with his estranged wife. From the point of the terrorists' appearance on, the movie absolutely does not let up. Catchy one liners, explosions, and actioon packed fire fights inhabit the remainder of the movie that all come together to culminate in an ending which will revive any persons' faith in the action movie.",9,0,0,28 August 1999
Blade Runner," Breathtaking
","Having seen this movie on a small TV, it seems it does the film more justice to say that even in the situation, I was thoroughly blown away. The flying billboards which, you know, if they could, they'd plaster them across the skyline, the constant presecense of rain, all of these set a mood and create an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife. Beyond the special effects...there's not as much as you'd like. Harrison Ford is good as a character you can't feel much for, but he nonetheless does a good job. There's not point in wasting words on giving the plot, there's far too little space to effectively give it away. Points of interest in the movie are the finale (which is like a vivid nightmare), where Rutger Hower truly shines. All and all, an off and on movie which nonetheless keeps you enthralled.",7,2,4,25 August 1999
