The Incredible Hulk," This is Marvel's summer!
","Marvel has done it again for the second time this summer. They've left me heading out of the theaters totally blown away.I haven't really been a follower of the hulk comics, and after seeing Ang Lee's take on the Hulk I wasn't so sure if this would be a good movie. Iron Man was a great movie, but I was felt that the Hulk just wasn't an interesting superhero.I was with some friends today just killing time, and we were at the theaters. They suggested we see the hulk, but I wasn't so sure about it. I argued and told them it was probably going to be a bad movie. After some debating I finally reluctantly went to see the green man.I groaned watching the first few minutes, because they reminded me a little of the 2003 film. However, as the film continued I was mesmerized by the fast paced and interesting story. No scene felt boring, and all of the scenes felt useful in connecting the story.Instead of going deep into the Hulk's origins, like the 2003 film did, this version explored Bruce Banner trying to find a cure and get rid of the hulk. This film's story worked great, and Edward Norton did excellent portraying all the emotions that Bruce Banner went through being the hulk. The anger, the frustration, the disappointment, and the hope were all acted out skillfully by Norton.Norton was helped out by the awesome job done by the supporting cast. William Hurt did awesome as the ruthless general, Liv Tyler was exceptional and really showed Betty Ross's love for Bruce Banner. Tim Roth did alright, I thought he could've been more aggressive though.The first film, I believe, lacked in action, this film doesn't at all lack in action. Norton's great acting made me feel for Banner, and then when the action happened I was on the edge of my seat. The chase scene in this film is one of the greatest chase scenes I've ever seen. Thanks to the wonderful cinematography this film's action truly stand out from the first film.The CGI was alright, but I personally felt they could've made it look better. I wasn't disappointed by the Hulk, but I didn't exactly feel fear when looking at the green man. However, the CGI in the movie was by no means bad. I was amazed by a few scenes in this movie, and I really had fun watching this.The little cameo at the end was really interesting, because it left a lot of options opened for film makers to work with in the Marvel universe.Finally, when I got off my seat 117 minutes later, I can safely say I was wrong and I was completely blown away by this movie. This film delivered, and it delivered beautifully. After releasing a terrible film like Spiderman 3, Marvel has been revived in my eyes.This is definitely Marvel's summer, and with films like Hancock and the dark knight coming up this looks like an awesome year for superhero movies!",8,4,7,16 June 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Great movie with amazing visuals and good acting.
","The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by the late C.S. Lewis.The movie recently came on DVD.I went and purchased it.The first ten minutes were very exciting, and I enjoyed them.After that, the movie started getting really slow, especially when they went into the professors house.When they got into Narnia things changed...The visuals were spectacular, it was amazing how they took the many creatures of Narnia and made them look so realistic.The music was amazing!It was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, the man who's music is in Metal Gear Solid series and also Kingdom of Heaven.The acting was amazing, Skandar Keynes and William Moseley did a great job acting.Overall, the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long, but it was really well-done.I'd definitely recommend you to buy it.",8,0,1,8 April 2006
Spider-Man 3," After the greatness of Spiderman , and the even more spectacular Spiderman 2, Spiderman 3 did not meet expectations.
","Spiderman 2 was one of the greatest superhero movies ever. Sam Raimi did an incredible job with it. Everything, from the story to the action, was balanced perfectly. I remember getting up from my seat and giving it a standing ovation along with probably 50 other people. I was happy for Spiderman 2, but even more excited for Spiderman 3.Being excited for Spiderman 3 was a big mistake. I wish I could've gone back in time and smacked myself in the face for ever thinking it was a great movie. Spiderman 3 killed the franchise, and was by far the worst movie in the trilogy. Sam Raimi had so much going for him, he had a villain already set up from the previous Spiderman movie. He had 58 million dollars more to make Spiderman 3 from, compared to the 200 million dollar budget he had in spiderman 2. He had endless material to work from, and he had great actors lined up.However, even with $258 million dollar budject, Raimi managed to figure out a, no, several ways to mess up this movie. First off, the worst thing in this movie is the writing. The original writers from Spiderman 2 are gone. The writing was horrible, they didn't have much originality in it. There was little character devolopement, all three villains combined didn't have the same emotional depth and personality Doc Ock did. The entire movie felt rushed, and the bad writing just killed it even more.The movie started off with the usual voice-over. The writing in the beginning was great. After a few good scenes, the first fight began with Spiderman against Green Goblin. After just a few minutes of fighting, it ended. Then it suddenly went to another scene with a guy we don't know. Thats another problem with Spiderman 3. THEY HAVE TOO MUCH GOING ON. In case you don't know, Spiderman 3 has 3 villains. The film shows how their created, but it lacks any character devolopement. Raimi could've executed scenes perfectly, but he sped things up.By the middle of the movie, it just doesn't feel right. After all the love talk, and the love they built up between Mary Jane and Peter. It all just seems to end for the dumbest reasons. One scene in a restaurant, which has a nice cameo from Bruce Campbell, made this movie look like a bad Romantic Comedy.After the first hour is over, I felt relieved to see Spiderman in his black suit. I knew this was when the action was really going to kick in. After a minutes of spiderman jumping around in the suit, he goes and fights Sandman. The entire second fight with Sandman is amazing. I loved every second of it. The CGI is great, but then right after Sandman gets beaten bad writing kicks in again, and Spiderman says a very bad, cring-inducing one liner.So, any Spiderman fan is probably thinking Peter Parker becomes a total badass with the costume on. Maybe, but in depends on how you define badass. Sam Raimi's version of badass is emo. Yep, friendly neighborhood Spiderman becomes emo. His hair becomes darker, he starts wearing black, and every single scene is extremely cheesy.So after more terrible scenes, he finally gets the black suit off. Topher Grace who becomes Venom, is in a church. Grace did an exceptional job in this movie. He was one of the great parts about Spiderman 3. I absolutely loved his acting. So, Spiderman loses the black suit in a memorable scene. And you see one of the greatest villains, and my personal favorite villain, Venom be born.After several other cheesy scenes. The final battle occurs, and at this point every line thats said is terrible. My main problem with the final battle is that they kept intrupting it. Raimi's job is to show us the final battle, not have some fake news reporter explain to us what we already know. Both villains are beaten really easily, and what happens after the fight, in my opinion, ruins Spiderman 4. After the events from Spiderman 3, if a Spiderman 4 is ever to come out, it will take a lot to make it work.Spiderman 3 was a disappointing film. The action was hectic, the CGI wasn't that great, and it was like a decent script was an afterthought for Raimi. Unless you like mindless action, don't see this film especially if your a spiderman fan.",1,17,28,7 May 2007
