Hereditary," Horror genre made valid.
","Absolutely brilliant, refreshing drama-horror.If you're into the cheap and unnecessary jump scares of the likes of 'Scream' or the mindless gore of 'Saw', you will be disappointed.Very well written, structured, paced.
Breaks with the traditional, one-dimensional approach of horror storytelling, just like 'Lat den ratte momma in' did.
Scary, suspenseful where it needs to be, shocking where it needs to be, in near-perfect balance.The film makes a decent job of describing family and personal struggles, grief and guilt. The characters' behaviour is exceptionally good.Well done.",9,1,3,5 April 2019
Creed," Wow....
","Any movie making audiences recoil within a minute, might not be worth the struggle of sitting through them.
Script and directing would've held it's ground in the 80's and 90's, but by today's standards is naive at best.
It took me about 13 minutes to give up on the movie - a lot longer than the it took the movie to give up on realism.",3,1,3,27 March 2019
