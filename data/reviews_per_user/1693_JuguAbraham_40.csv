Vertigo," 'I heard voices'--an innocent statement for a great end
","Hitchcock films end with interesting statements. Vertigo ends with a nun blandly stating 'I heard voices.' Then, the bell is tolled. Hitchcock loves to play with words and sounds to stir up the imagination of the viewer. Even when letters are written, Hitchcock, instead of showing the words as a conventional director would, he prefers to let the writer speak out the words that are being written.This is an unusual Hitchcock film where humor is hardly presentinstead the psychological atmosphere of the film is full of regret, gloom and doom, with death lurking everywhere, while the camera captures the opposite feelingsbright sunny exteriors, lush green dresses, green cars, red robes, spotless white coats. The film harks back to Hitchcock's 'Marnie' in subject and treatment as it explores the inherent contradictions in life.Wagner's 'Tristan and Isolde' is adapted by Bernard Herrmann, the music composer, for 'Vertigo' in a very effective score that is not far removed from original piece.I look forward to viewing the film in 70 mm (its new form). This is a fascinating Hitchcock film in lush color with a great ending-but there are equally stunning Hitchcock films that did not rely on color. 'Notorious,' 'Saboteur,' and 'Blackmail' are three Hitchcock films where 'black and white' was equally stunning as the color in 'Vertigo'",7,0,1,3 April 2006
Spartacus," Was it a great film?
","I saw this film on DVD after I saw it on screen some 20 years ago. Twenty years ago the film gripped me because of the performances and the wonderful script of Dalton Trumbo. Even today the film towers over 'Gladiator.'But as a Kubrick fan, I rate this film as one of his weakest films. This film like 'Gandhi' wrenches your heart because of the story, not the filmmaking. The filmmaking minus the grand performances of Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov is no more than good drama portrayed on the technicolor screen. But why on earth did Hollywood run the line..'Characters depicted in the film do not resemble people living or dead..' at the end of the movie? Is someone out there senile? The ghost of Julius Caesar should take someone to court..",6,1,2,6 August 2001
Lifeboat," Surprising Steinbeck reaction to negative evaluation by some critics
",Engaging. Interesting Steinbeck story. Even more interesting to note that Steinbeck dissociated himself from the film when critics were negative about a German portrayed as a somewhat positive individual. This Hitchcock film is important because of its tale as much as its filming.,7,0,0,2 March 2018
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Actor John Hurt, Cinematographer John Toll lift up the film
","The movie is a tolerably good love story to watch. However, John Hurt (Dr Iannis) lifts the film from sinking into mediocrity, even though much of his face is hidden behind a thick moustache. Hurt commands attention with subtle expressions, not overacting as other actors are prone to do.John Toll's camerawork may not match up to his work in 'The Thin Red Line' but his flashes of brilliance are just breathtaking. One shot that bore his stamp was the profile of Cruz and her Greek boyfriend taken with no light falling in them, but with the light in the background. Toll and Sven Nykvist (The Seventh Seal) have much in common. Both are great cinematographers.Irene Papas' character never developed--what a waste of good talent--thanks to the lackluster script.The music is neither bad nor uplifting--one expected much more in a film with a musical instrument in the title.   All in all the movie only proves that John Madden is not a top rung director; yet his choice of actors and crew is commendable.",6,1,3,5 August 2004
Shakespeare in Love," An ordinary above average film
","The film's screenplay is quite remarkable. But for that, I found it a very ordinary film.Any Tom Stoppard play is great stuff. But this film had so many goofs: psychoanalysis in the Elizabethan era, eighteenth century musical instuments on show two centuries before, talk of tobacco gardens in America that did not exist then...I cannot believe this film which has above average performances by Judi Dench and Paltrow, could sweep the Oscars that were denied to 'The Thin Red Line,' a far superior film in so many departments!",6,1,3,18 November 2000
12 Angry Men," When the Oscars went wrong and Berlin got it right
","Second viewing. Another example of a Berlin Golden Bear Winner, nominated for 3 major Oscars and not winning a single one. 'The Thin Red Line,' won the Golden Bear and was nominated for 7 Oscars. It suffered the same fate. History proves the big winners of the big three European film festivals are considered true gems of cinema over time.Just wondered at the parallels between this film and Kurosawa's 'Stray Dog' (1949). The oppressive heat and the eventual rain that affect the characters are the same. Wonder if the screenplay writer had seen the Japanese film made 8 years before the Hollywood classic.Another debut film that proves to be the best work of a director over time.",8,0,1,17 October 2015
The English Patient," Superb in some departments, below average in others
","After viewing a 9 Oscar winner, you begin to wonder how Hollywood thinks and rates a movie. There are some aspects of this film where the Oscar was richly deserving: the intelligent editing, good music, good photography, a rich bouncy performance by Juliet Binoche, who was even better in 'Chocolat.' The opening sequences were absolutely breathtaking--was it a single shot? or beautifully edited to look like a single shot?   How in the world this movie was rated better than 'Fargo' the other film in competition, in other departments, I cannot comprehend. Does 'love' for a woman mean more than giving war secrets to the enemy? Does marital betrayal get condoned? It is amazing that Hollywood sometimes chooses to reward subjects than filmmaking: 'Gandhi' is an example. Here filmmaking gets appreciated but the content is rarely analyzed.As for performances Naveen Andrews as Kip was striking; so was Kristin Scott Thomas (who gave a better performance in Polanski's 'Bitter Moon'). Both never won awards in this film.In short this is a good movie in several departments--with lackluster direction and a not-so-uplifting subject.",7,0,3,14 September 2001
Public Enemies," Mann's magical work on the soundtrack continues
","Mann's choice of music amazes me once again. His re-use of 'Beam' from Malick-Hans Zimmer composition from 'The Thin Red Line' towards the end, with proper credits to the original film. Then there is the talented Elliot Goldenthal who was a shade better in Mann's 'Heat' a work that ought to have won him laurels but didn't.Mann's falling back on actors he trusts is another laudable fact-- Stephen Lang (used first in 'Manhunter,' and now again in the final scene of 'Public Enemies'). That's just one example among many.Mann was much better in 'Heat' his best work, though in 'Public Enemies' he retained the great team of 'Heat' cinematographer Dante Spinotti and composer Goldenthal.The film was entertaining but not as gripping as 'Heat.' I tend to see Mann's films mainly to study his soundtrack management, which is amazing.",7,0,1,12 June 2015
The Irishman," Scorsese's attraction towards anti-heroes is perplexing--revealing more about the director
","Why is Scorsese attracted to tales of anti-heroes? Why make a film on a gangster who 'paints walls with blood' and talks about the importance of family and even prays and confesses to a priest for absolution before dying?Subject-wise and quality-wise Leone's' Once upon a time in America' and Mann's 'Heat' are way superior to this film. DeVito's 'Hoffa' was more interesting in discussing the character of Hoffa.Music-wise the opening song sequence gives you the impression someone is playing a record or singing live in the old age home when that is not the case. Only some three hours later into the film you find out the importance of that song you heard. If one calls that great direction,.....!!In fairness, De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and Paquin were a treat to watch. But is this a great film? No. My best Scorsese is 'Hugo.'",7,1,14,29 November 2019
Billy Elliot," Can it stand up to the best of British cinema of the 60s?
","Stephen Daldry is to be admired. For a first film by a theater director it is a commendable product that brings out fascinating performances that only theatre directors are adept at ensuring. Admirable performances by Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. Add to it clever and tongue-in-cheek editing by John Wilson and imaginative camerawork by Brian Tufano.All this reminded me of three films from Britain made in the sixties: Karel Reiz' 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning', Tony Richardson's 'Loneliness of the long distance runnner', and Lindsay Anderson's 'This sporting life'. These movies captured exactly the same feelings as 'Billy Elliot'--the only difference was Billy is younger. 'Billy Elliot' is in color, while the three brilliant films of the 60s were in black and white. Two of the movies were based on work by the superb writer Alan Sillitoe, who I was lucky to have met in real life, whose middle-class characters wanted to break away and become achievers in their own cosmic world--without the angry tap dances of 'Billy Elliot' to aid them on the technicolor screen. The three movies of the 60s established the careers of the late Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, and the late Lindsay Anderson--another giant I was fortunate to have met and interviewed.'Billy Elliot' touches your heart because it is a great story and has so much of creative talent packed into it. Yet compare this film to the three British films made forty years ago, with older technology, but brimming with a passion that dwarfs 'Billy Elliot' in all its color and technical glory. The politics, the social commentary and human values of the three 60s movies are more gripping than the saccharin sweet 'Billy Elliot' made 40 years later. I do not infer that Stephen Daldry is less talented than Anderson, Richardson or Reisz--only that the movie needs to be compared and evaluated with its true elder cousins.",8,0,0,2 April 2003
The Others," Amenabar and Kidman concoct intelligent, scary entertainment
","This is the most intelligent and scary film since Kubrick made 'The Shining' and Hitchcock made his humorous murder thrillers. Like Hitchcock, Amenabar is able to make you laugh at yourself at the end of the scary film--while Kubrick could only made you sigh with relief at the end of his intelligent work.This is my first Amenabar film. The early scene of Kidman's screaming face switching from the vertical to the horizontal gives you a clue of what will follow--intelligent viewing, constantly requiring the viewer to re-evaluate earlier impressions. This is mature cinema. This is the stuff John Berger would love to include in his 'Ways of Seeing' if he were to re-write the book. It is not without reason that in the DVD interview Amenabar says that he was most impressed by Kidman's eyes. It appears to be a frivolous comment. Yet Kidman's eyes are not only providing the impression of being terrorized or her character's steady descent from normality to lunacy, but they become the central sensory organ to a film in which light and darkness assume unusual importance. Amenabar is the Svengali. For a young director it is impressive to see the director working on his own story and composing his own music, to be able to get such topnotch performances from Kidman, Flanagan, Sykes, and the kids. Watching this film reminds you of Orson Welles' cinema, though Welles would have loved to be in front of the camera as well.The way Amenabar has crafted the story is so intelligent that you cannot help admiring how his story works backwards, with the end providing the pivotal point for the beginning of real entertainment and correct perspective. You begin to love the film after the movie ends--somewhat like the narrative structure of 'The Usual Suspects.' The prologue on the Creation, narrated by Kidman to the kids, would in retrospect be the appropriate epilogue. The film continues to entertain the viewer after the film has ended as the viewer is forced to pick up the clues thrown at the audience as the film progressed on the impending end.This is a European film in style and far removed from Hollywood's predictable approach to mystery, supernatural, aliens, etc. This style is what makes the film outstanding in the genre--it provides entertainment by teasing your senses and perception of what is real. Even when dealing with a supernatural subject it exudes a pristine charm of children and Bible readings. As the film progresses you note that often initial elements of charm hides a not-so-innocent mind (Flanagan's character Bertha Mills, Kidman's character Grace, etc.).Kidman is lovely to look at. Yet she is only truly impressive when a good director is in charge (first Kubrick in 'Eyes Wide Shut', and now Amenabar).The strengths of this film also lie in the art direction, sound editing (superb), and cinematography.The film does leave holes in the story. What happens to the postman? What happens to the first batch of servants that preceded Bertha Mills et al.? Were the children really having a medical problem? What were the pills that Grace was having and what was Bertha giving her that Grace found suspicious? Probably these unanswered questions add to the richness of the film.This is a major film of the decade because of the narrative structure, which would put off conventional viewers of Hollywood products. The special features of the DVD are below average (e.g., interview with cinematographer is in Spanish, some of the English interview snippets are pedantic) while the sound recording is top notch.",8,0,0,27 November 2002
Troy," Will the real Wolfgang Peterson please stand up?
","Even though I am fervent admirer of Wolfgang Peterson's TV film in German 'Black and white like day and night' made in 1978, his later films including his 'Das Boot' and 'In the line of fire' and 'Troy' lack the ingredients of superior cinema. In the 1978 film Peterson came up with a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz that will be etched in the memory of any film-goer, backed up by brilliant indoor shots.If someone thinks Troy is a great effort, they ought to compare the 1956 'Helen of Troy' (directed by Robert Wise) where the late Stanley Baker's Achilles was powerful though not having any penchant for reflection. Baker's Achilles was all brawn. Pitt's Achilles had the brooding hero shifting from the philosophical to the flippant, never letting the character develop to evoke sympathy for his fate, a character who knows his future actions (that he has to kill Hector in only in public and thus gain eternal fame). Pitt's and Peterson's Achilles taunts the gods and kings but is silenced by a woman. Peterson had a great opportunity to develop the contradictions in the character, but chose instead to truncate the useful scene with his mother (Julie Christieshe is good even in such brief appearances) that could have been developed further.I have read that Peter O'Toole did not appreciate Peterson's inputsyet O'Toole is the saving grace of the film (a film where Paris kills Achilles by shooting arrows at his chest rather than his Achilles tendon!). So was Nigel Terry whose stage voice stood out in stark contrast to the other actors. For me, O'Toole, Christie and Terry were the saving graces in an unremarkable filmunless you judge a film solely for its stunts and special effects.Peterson did make a great decision to enhance the appeal of the film by employing the singing talents of Tanja Tzarovska. But why did Peterson and screen-playwright David Benioff tamper with Homer's work to make Achilles one of the Greeks who entered Troy in the belly of the horse? That's totally out of character. Achilles was not a man who would adopt such tactics. In the original epic, Achilles dies outside the ramparts of Troy by an arrow shot at his heel.Even though most of his recent films have been lack-luster, I believe the Peterson who made 'Black and white like day and night' is a talented director. I wish the real Peterson will stand up in the future and not be swayed by big budgets and studio pressures and deliver decent cinema as he used to decades ago.",6,1,4,24 July 2006
Jackie," The sum of all parts makes this film important
","Apart from being a great swansong for John Hurt, the film has a mature script by Noah Oppenheim, a yo-yo performance by Natalie Portman, mature direction by Chilean Pablo Larrain, intelligent editing by Chilean Sebastian Sepulveda (who directed the marvelous film 'The Quispe Girls'), and some amazing shots by French cinematographer Stephane Fontaine aided by the somber music of British Mica Levi. A truly laudable international film when you add the parts.The choice of Richard Burton singing 'Camelot' from his stage appearances added value to the film ( I found myself comparing the singing to Richard Harris in the film version, which was so colorless in comparison!)I am also getting to like Greta Gerwig as a minor actress--she was so good in 'Frances Ha.'Hurt, Sepulveda and Levi ought to have been nominated for the Oscars for their contributions in this film.",8,1,3,1 February 2017
Saving Private Ryan," A very ordinary melodramatic war film
","I guess I am one of the few who do not sing praises about this film. I am a great admirer of Steven Spielberg's early works--especially his small, great film 'Duel'. The later works of Spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences, not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives. It is sad that Terrence Mallick's intelligent film 'The Thin Red Line' on the same war lost out to this melodramatic, ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money. A few shots of the old Spielberg did surface briefly when the film captured the first rain drops and the boots of soldiers getting wet.Hollywood has made better war films than this one. The little known 'Castle Keep' was one such film. Spielberg knows what appeals to the average American mind and makes movies that will be lapped up without giving the average moviegoer any reason to reflect or think. He has begun to play on emotions and is no longer reaching out to thinking viewers. He is aware that this will not make the box-office jingle. Most people do go to movies to relax, not to be wiser. Mallick, on the other hand, makes movies the way he wants them made forcing his viewers to think. Mallick will slowly be recognized as a master filmmaker in the US by adults as time goes by, while Spielberg will continue to appeal to the juvenile minds of adults, who love action and emote easily. The difference was evident, when the Berlin International Film Festival recognized Mallick's film with top honor and the Academy Awards bestowed its top honors on Spielberg in the same year. Viva la difference!",6,1,2,26 November 2001
The Chorus," So charming, but what's new?
","The film is uplifting. A physically unimpressive teacher in a boarding school for poor, vagabond kids spots singing talent and transforms the lives of scores of children through what he knows best--conducting choral music.How much does this film differ from Peter Weir's brilliant 'Dead poet's society' or even the Sidney Poitier film 'To sir, with Love?' Precious little. The director Christophe Barratier likes music and therefore makes a film with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 a rarity among French films unless they want to go very commercial. He even casts his own uncle Jacques Perrin.. The film was showcased at the on-going Dubai International Film Festival.The film has made an indelible impact on those who like music and those who have not been exposed to a wide range of cinema. To them the effort would seem remarkable. To others, the film is merely good clean entertainment, charming and uplifting. But in terms of cinema, what's new?",7,7,16,10 December 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," Who are you, Lawrence?
","It is wonderful to learn from the DVD of the movie that it was David Lean, assuming the voice of the motorcyclist, who shouted across the Suez Canal to Lawrence those significant words 'Who are you?' How appropriate!! The director asking the question to his protagonist. What is fiction, what is history? Watching the movie some 25 years after I saw it the first time, one begins to wonder if the real T E Lawrence will ever stand up. In the movie, in his writings 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom', Lawrence will remain an enigma both to the West and the Arabs.The 'real' David Lean does stand up. He is a great director of epics and Lawrence, Doctor Zhivago, and Ryan's Daughter are his three best films, followed by Bridge on the River Kwai, which unfortunately does not affect you as much as it does on the first viewing on repeated viewings as the other three.Lean, Jarre, and Bolt--what a combination! Hats off to the restorers of this film. The only odd-ball was Anthony Quinn who seemed artificial 25 years ago and even now when we learn his costume was not authentic in color. I always wondered why I S Johar was picked by Lean to play the role of the guy who falls off the camel, is rescued, and is shot later. I have met Johar in real life. He was well read for an actor but I never rated him as a great actor. But for Johar this was the greatest performance of his career. 
All in all a great movie with great performances--each time you watch it you appreciate it better.",9,1,4,26 August 2001
1917," War heroics that will please a viewer seeking entertainment
","Even though the film reminds you of the death and futility of the First World War as Kubrick did in his laudable film 'Paths of Glory,' this Mendes film is reduced to mere war heroics that will please a viewer seeking entertainment without much reflection. The saving grace of this film is that the heroes are the foot soldiers and not the top brass of the military. The music was awful. The script is hilarious (it includes a pail of drinkable milk, with no milkers in sight or likely to be nearby and a single cow (without a calf) grazing--just to prop up the weak plot that allows a soldier to eventually feed milk to a starving infant!",7,7,15,10 January 2020
Mulholland Drive," Interesting for a viewer who loves solving eye-candy puzzles, without any substantial takeaways
","Interesting script and direction. A film about dreams and lives spiraling out of control. Interesting performances. If you like detective films, psychological studies and films like Memento, The Aura (Chile), and Inception this would be in that league of intelligent cinema. But is the film uplifting and a gem, in the league of a Tarkovsky, a Zvyagintsev or a Kieslowski? I think not.But Lynch does have a sensitive ear for sound/music and an eye for color. But color coding was best done by Kieslowski ('Three colors' trilogy).I prefer Malick, any day, to Lynch. Malick goes beyond Lynch's clever and sometimes admirable web of associations. within a person's mind. Malick is interested in forces outside the human mind; Lynch is anchored within the human mind with its dreams as the outermost orbit.",7,0,0,24 August 2016
The Piano," Clever film that makes you wonder...
","I have seen the movie twice. I liked it the first time because it was refreshingly different, restrained in some parts, erotic to an extent, with some brilliant camerawork of Stuart Drybergh and choreography (beach scene with Holly Hunter, Keitel and Paquin, with the overhead shot and the imaginative designs of footprints in the sand).My second viewing had me reassessing if a viewer can be led to like a film without thinking rationally. Take the example of Paquin carrying the piano key with the written message. She takes one path, retraces it and takes another. This crucial action changes the course of the film. Why did she make that choice? Coincidence? If it was deliberate, the relationship between the child and foster father is not adequately developed. The director persuades us to notice this decision with a high angle shot. We in the audience know that Kietel's character is illiterate--but the message is finally read by someone who could read. And so the story gathers momentum.The 'quiet' strength of the film is in the character who chooses to remain mute. A finger is chopped off but there is no howl of pain, only blood, only a resignation to fate.Despite a great performance by Hunter and impressive direction by Campion, I begin to have a nagging doubt if the audience is meant to leave their mind behind and merely indulge their senses, what they see and hear...On second viewing, the script seems more manipulative rather than virtuous. In the epilogue, what are we to make of the metal prosthetic finger--that all is healed? Or was it a convenient way to end the film?",7,5,12,21 April 2002
Cold War," Wonderful Editing
",If there was one aspect that stood out in the film it was its editing. I am surprised that the film was recognized for its direction at Cannes and not for its editing or even its very taut screenplay. Perhaps the jury wanted to honour the film and the Best Director was the nearest to the deserving editing and screenplay writing honours that Cannes does not bestow.,7,4,8,3 December 2018
Silence," A film that makes you want to read the Japanese novel on which the film is based
","The more I reflect on it, the film is important for its subject (read 'the original Japanese novel'), but as cinema it is a recreation of sequences from other important films. This is Scorsese taking a leaf out of Tarantino, who was also a great cineaste.One aspect of the film that I was impressed with was the development character of the Japanese man who constantly betrays his family, priests and friends and yet seeks forgiveness from God.It is not great cinema--but it is a great subject, which could have been developed better. For instance, the Judas-equivalent in the film, betraying time and again and asking forgiveness each time--is a deep subject, which Scorsese merely treats as an appendage.After the movie ends, we are not any wiser of how much was history and how much was fiction. I salute the author Shusako Endo, just as with The Last Temptation of Christ, I salute Nikos Kazantzakis, rather than Scorsese.We cannot compare this film with Bergman's trilogy of Through the Glass Darkly, The Silence and Winter Light, because Bergman wrote the original scripts and never adapted books. Here, Jay Cocks and Scorsese were adapting Endo's novel.The more disturbing fact is that Endo is not a historian but a novelist. One wonders what Cocks and Scorsese added to Endo's tale.",8,0,1,16 February 2017
The Insider," Rich Michael Mann film but not his best
","I consider Mann to be the second most important living director in the US. I became his fan after I watched Violent Streets (released in the US as     ) way back in the Eighties at the Indian International Film Festival in New Delhi. I had then written in the newspaper I was then working for that this director is somebody to watch out for. I am glad that some 20 years later I have been proven right. I consider him next in importance only to Terrence Mallick among living US directors. It is a shame that those associated with American Academy of Motion Pictures constantly bypass great talent on so many occasions. Overlooking the performances in the Insider and bestowing so many awards for American Beauty is crass injustice. The Insider is superior to American Beauty in several respects, acting, direction, music, photography At some stage in the Oscar history, this august body will realize that just as Orson Welles was ignored for his early work, great contributors to American cinema who are being ignored are Mann and Mallick. Both of them are consummate filmmakers: who take great care with story, screenplay, acting, editing, photography, sound and music. Mann, unlike Mallick, approaches less philosophical subjects and is therefore appreciated by a larger slice of the public. 
Why do I find Insider not to be his best work? The Insider's power is essentially in the content. That it is the work of Michael Mann and cinematographer Spinotti only adds flavor to the product. Mann is a director who could make James Caan, an average actor, appear impressive in `Violent Streets'. If he could do that it is not surprising to find superb performances from Crowe and Pacino in `The Insider'. Compare this with `Heat', whose story needed the superb treatment of Mann and Spinotti to come alive. In `The Insider,' the focus is understandably on the male duo and due to the documentary nature of the subject the women are pushed into the background. In `Heat', while the male duo carry the film, the female characters are not wallflowersall three wives/lovers grab your attention. Mann had a `compleat' film in `Heat'. That does not mean `The Insider' was not a great work-it had limitations to develop due to the subject.
Another great trademark of Mann is his opening sequences full of kinetic energy injected through sight and sound. However, the opening shots of `The Insider' reminded you of a Costa Gavras/Gillo Pontecorvo type of Sixties cinema, much less impressive than the powerful opening sequences of `Violent Streets' and `The Last of the Mohicans.'   Mann, Mallick, and Kubrick are directors who use sound and music with great felicity. In `The Insider' the scene of Wygand refusing to be disturbed in the hotel room is an example of this talent in Mann, with beautiful music, camerawork and special effects.Has Mann matured over the years? Definitely. Mann directing `The Insider' is more reflective and offers the viewer options to evaluate Wygand and other characters, which `Heat' did not. You begin to like Wygand as he makes the big decision as he stares out at the waterscape. You begin to doubt, as he cannot defend aspect s of his past. You begin to wonder if Wygand is using circumstances to be hero or if he is a true hero as he hits the golf balls in apparent solitude. In `Heat' there was no such ambiguity. His work is much better in `The Insider' than in `Violent Streets'. Yet `Heat' is in my opinion a more demanding and creative work compared to `The Insider'.",8,0,0,16 August 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," Why I liked this film more than Coppola's 'The Godfather'
","Not many realize that Sergio Leone was offered the chance to direct Puzo's 'The Godfather' but opted to make 'Once upon a time in America.' They say he regretted this decision later in life--but it would be pertinent why someone like Leone would have made such a decision. Any Leone fan would know the importance the director gives to music, structure of the story, the importance of money and how it corrupts many values. All these elements are underlined in this gangster film. In Coppola's work, the story afforded more importance to social details, character details and fabulous camera-work. Both works are monumental--but I preferred Leone's work, truncated to less than 4 hours than his original cut of 6 hours.The music. Leone's favorite Ennio Morricone provided one of the finest film music for this film and he won awards for this film as he had won praise for Leone's 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and a host of other spaghetti westerns by Leone. But the real contributor of music was a Romanian flute player called Georghe Zamfir who plays the brilliant 'Pan's song' just as Zamfir played the same tune equally effectively in Australian Peter Weir's 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' made 9 years before Leone's film. Weir and Leone both know their music and both need to be complimented for picking up this obscure Romanian to enhance their films. Leone's cinema does not limit to brilliance of music--he uses sound to give effects that surpass the camera eye. The ringing telephone--a telephone ring that persists before the number dial moves on the instrument--provided a stamp of Leone that no viewer will easily forget--and no director had accomplished so effectively. Of course, the telephone call was so central to the film's plot. If the telephone was not enough, the sound of the lift moving up (without a passenger) plays another aural reminder of Leone's cleverness behind the camera.The structure. Leone's screenplay of switching from the present to the past and vice versa increases the entertainment value. Coppola's work was linear and less demanding of the viewer. In many ways Leone's work comes very close to the Coppola's third 'Godfather' film--his least appreciated Godfather film, which mixes pathos, irony and closure to intrigues. Leone's film is many ways quite philosophical as was Coppola's 'Godfather III'--far removed from the brutal and power-hungry Godfathers I and II. Leone was able to add a dash of comedy--scenes with antics of the Artful Dodger in Carol Reed's 'Oliver!' are copied in the sequences of the early years. Leone's comedy can span from a simple act of hungry boy eating a cream pastry that he had bought to impress his love interest to a young girl taunting her boy lover that 'his mother is calling' when his male friend whistles. Coppola's cinema rarely dealt with comedy, unless it was a precursor to tragedy. Several sequences where Leone switches time--the eyes of the protagonist changing from the old to the young man, the appearance of the protagonist in the railway station, and the Frisbee hitting the protagonist as he walks the lonely cold street--makes the film more exciting and colorful. The long film is suddenly less boring as it entertains you while unfolding the saga. The switching of the female child with the male, the corruption among the law enforcers, and the obvious dwarfing of the female characters against the male parts for Leone appears more pronounced than in Coppola, because the intent is to underline the weakness of male folly at the height of their power. The film is Leone's essay on American's interest in getting rich and powerful at the cost of simple values of honor and friendship. At the end the director emphasizes the importance of honor and friendship even among gangsters and even women who often ultimately seek the rich guy to live with rather than the true lover. The effect of De Niro's final laugh at the camera can be interpreted in several ways. Who is he laughing at? The camera? The audience? The irony of his life? Is the chase for money worth it? It reminds me of Richard Burton's character, a vicious bank robber in the final shot of the British film 'Villain' (1971) turns around at the camera and shouts 'Who do you think you are looking at?'Leone could not have made 'Godfather I or II', but he could have dealt with 'Godfather III'. And Coppola could never have made 'Once upon a time in America'. Leone's decision to change the name of the film from the novel's name 'The Hoods' gives an indication of where the director is leading the audience.The more you see the film you realize the film is a robust one that will stand the test of time because Leone did not want to merely present an interesting saga on screen but entertain intelligently.",9,11,25,21 February 2006
Victory," A bad copy of a great Hungarian film
","When this film came out everyone I know was showering praises on it. I am a fan of John Huston but my appreciation of this great man plummeted when I saw that there was no mention in the credits of the original work in Hungarian 'Két félidö a pokolban' or 'Two half times in hell.'I was lucky to have been invited to visit Hungary in 1981 as an Indian film critic to interview the director of the Hungarian film, the late Zoltan Fabri, who I had come to adore after viewing his 'The Fifth Seal.' With remorse Fabri had told me that all that he expected was a mention of his work--nothing more--among the credits of Huston's film. Hollywood and John Huston had thrown modern day Intellectual Property Rights to the wind.Huston's film is good, but the Hungarian original is far superior. Fabri was a gentleman and a great director. Huston would have stood taller had he acknowledged the original work of the then unknown Fabri.",6,9,14,4 October 2001
La La Land," Chazelle is getting his due applause one film late
","Damien Chazelle is very talented. The bouquets he is getting for this film ought to have come instead for his previous work 'Whiplash' --a far superior work. 'La la land' will appeal to those who have worked hard to achieve their dreams. 'Whiplash' was more complex with darkness and light (Chazelle's forte) utilized to the hilt. In 'La la land,' it was replaced by lush color, often helped by the clothes worn.It's mushy--the actors look good always. The music appeals to you but is it all that great? No. This is mere escapism. 'Whiplash' on the other hand was real and deserved better.",7,1,6,29 January 2017
The Legend of 1900," A charming fable captured on celluloid
","I love music; I admire the work of Ennio Morricone. I love good cinematography and the Hungarian films of cinematographer Lajos Koltai have long appealed to me. It is perhaps natural that the first film I have seen of Guiseppe Tornatore that involves Morricone and Koltai should appeal to me.But in retrospect, the film grabbed me because the appeal of the film went beyond Morricone and Koltai. The performances of Tim Roth, Vince, Williams and Nunn were arresting. Roth's British accent at the end was annoying (who could have contributed that to 1900 when the character grew up on the ship?) but otherwise both Roth and Vince played very convincing roles. The casting is commendable--especially when some of the players are not very famous.There were certain sequences that Koltai and Tornatore can be truly proud of: playing the rolling piano on a ship swaying to choppy seas and the engine room sequence with Nunn and the child.  Most of all, the marketing of the film as a fable, which it is, has its own charm. I particularly loved the song at the end of the film 'written' by Morricone --or is it wrongly credited?-- and sung by Pink Floyd's ex-lead singer. Don't miss it as it captures the story in the song as the credits roll by. This is a very European film, which is probably the reason it has not been given the recognition that it deserves in the US. I strongly recommend this film to many of my friends who have not seen it. Tornatore, Koltai and Morricone weave magic together.",8,0,1,17 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Essay on Fidelity and Marriage
","I rate this movie as one of two finest films made in the 1990s--alongside Terrence Malik's The Thin Red Line. Both films had the majority of their viewers disliking the films in question and a minority heaping praises on them! I belong to the minority who loved the film.A major problem for most viewers was that most viewers expected a film full of sex and nudity. Sex and nudity serves only as the backdrop of the film.
From the password 'Fidelio' to the fact that two married individuals chose to play the main roles, there are clues that this fascinating film is all about reaffirmation of faith in marriage and trust, on jealousy and redemption of faith in marriage..small but important facets of the cosmic reality of our lives. The trail of thought is connected to several facets philosophical innuendoes provided in '2001'.Pook's minimalist score is another highlight of this great film. Mature performances abound.I saw the film when I was sleepy and five minutes into the film, I was wide awake. It is not a film for the average filmgoer; it is one for those who appreciate cinema, music and philosophy. I loved '2001', but I appreciated 'Eyes wide shut' even better.",10,2,4,5 November 2000
Sicario," Del Toro, Roger Deakins and Johann Johannsson lift up the film's quality
","Sicario would appeal to any ethical and sensitive viewer but falls short of being a masterpiece.Bernicio Del Toro's performance in the movie in the first appearance (shots in the aircraft) was stagey. As the movie progresses, you begin to admire him. It is definitely Del Toro's best role to date.Villeneuve as a director is above average but never raises stuns you. But I will continue to view his films in the firm hope that he will deliver a masterpiece down the line. You admire his ability to use visuals and music to build the mood with a certain maturity that is rarely encountered in Hollywood. But then he is a Canadian filmmaker first--and in Canada they use restraint with music and camera-work. Roger Deakins (cinematographer) and Johann Johannsson (composer of the music) contribute so much to raise the quality of the product.Made in Hollywood, on a US subject, 'Sicario' for me is closer to Canadian cinema in style and production tastes. Cinephiles will note the parallels between this film and a real Canadian film, Larysa Kondracki's 'The Whistleblower' (2010) that exhibit in the screenplay and development of characters.",7,1,2,8 January 2016
Three Colors: Blue," Bluea feature film on an abstract Biblical chapter
","A film on 'I Corinthians Chapter 13', just as Kieslowski's 'Dekalog' was based on 'the Ten Commandments' The later works of Kieslowski never cease to amaze me. Here is a film so spiritual in content with no markings of being a cinematic essay based on an entire abstract chapter in the New Testamenta chapter that could fit into the holy books of any religion and is not strictly limited to Christian theology but universal philosophy that could find equal acceptance by, say, a Sufi scholar or a Hindu mystic. But then Kieslowski made 10 marvelous short films called 'Dekalog' each loosely based on one of the Ten Commandments. But if the viewer is not well versed with theology or philosophy, the film can be viewed as story far removed from such lofty heights. It would be a mere story of grief and reconciliation to loss of kin (but then Ingmar Bergman did a better job of this subject in the little known 1971 film 'The Touch' or 'Beroringen' with Bibi Andersson and Elliot Gould). Kieslowski, was a product of Communist Poland but a Christian in spirit and upbringing. He knew all of us had to make difficult moral choices in life constantly. Interestingly, Ingmar Bergman made another film taking a leaf from the very same Biblical chapter'Through a glass darkly.' In 'Blue,' the moral choice the lead character makes is to love. Love whom, one may ask? Love the boy who makes a great effort to return the stolen necklace with a cross, the husband who cheated on her marriage, the mistress of her husband with his unborn son in her womb, the husband's colleague who seeks fame from adding final touches to another person's unfinished masterpiece, the unfinished musical work that needs a loving inspired end, love the neighbor who is a prostitute, the servants of the house, the mother in the old age home (most of the images are reinforced towards the end of the film, as excerpts from the Biblical chapter are sung). Ms. Binoche was able to allude to a faint smile at the last frame, the actor's contribution to the film after her understanding of the end of Anton Chekov's play 'The seagull.' Kieslowski retained the contribution of the literate and sensitive actor.Blue--one of the three colors of the French flag. It is the color that defines melancholy in the English language. Blue is the 'untrue' reflective color of water in a swimming poola cathartic venue where the lead actor swims to rid her fear of rats, a venue that suggests purging of her past fears and marital shackles, a venue where she curls up like fetus in a womb to be reborn.There were unresolved passages in the filmthe despondent face of the daughter staring out of the car, the lead actor's obsessive interest in her dead husband rather than the loss of the daughter and why the mattress was the only furniture left behind in an otherwise empty house. Wish Kieslowski was alive today to explain these loose ends! The film is a superb example of sound editing, music composition and camera-workeach technical department competing for top honors. 'Blue' was made for Venice Festival just as 'White' was made for Cannes and 'Red' for Berlinthe three top film festivals. Venice Festival loves such subjects as 'Blue' presented'Blue' was designed for it, each shot from the dunking of the sugar cube to epiphany of the street flute player to the laceration of the hand (spiritual reference to shedding of blood?) on the stones in self mortification.In the final evaluation it is product of teamworkmaking a swansong triptych of a talented director who probably knew his time in this world was limited. If I had not seen Bergman's works mentioned earlier, I would have voted this film as the best of the trilogy. My vote therefore is for 'White,' as it is more original in style and more complex of the two. Yet each of the 'three colors' is a work of a master of cinema. I consider it a privilege to have met Kiesolowski briefly and talked to him, through an interpreter, in 1980, much before he had bloomed into a great filmmaker in the early Nineties. At that time he had only made 'Camera Buff' with Jerzy Stuhra film that impressed me but clearly lacked the maturity of his later works. Poland should to be proud of its great son.",8,0,0,17 May 2006
The Untouchables," de Palma at his best
","Brian de Palma was good in his little-known films 'The fury' and 'Carrie.' Here, he proves he that is better than ever as he doffs his cap at the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's 1920's classic 'Battleship Potemkyn' and its incredible Odessa steps sequence with the baby in the pram. This sequence is finely executed and a charming homage to Eisenstein. Hats off to de Palma!The opening crane shot of De Niro (Al Capone) surrounded by manicurists, shoeshiners and journalists sets the mood of what is to follow--cinema for the cinephile. Here is a director's film--the script of David Mamet takes a back seat, the music of Ennio Morricone never overpowers. You are forced to drink in the heady wine from the director.Take the killing of Malone. The camera captures Malone's movements from outside the building--moving as a human being would. Take the killing of Billy Drago (Nitti). The camera deceives Nitti and the viewer as Ness falls off the roof with a cry.If de Palma was at his best he also got three fine performances in the film--one from Sean Connery, one from De Niro, and one from Billy Drago.",7,0,1,24 September 2004
The Good Shepherd," A substantive film from Hollywood, ignored by many
","A very impressive screenplay from Eric Roth plus really good performances from the ensemble cast. Well deserved the Berlin Silver Bear award.Best lines: There is no 'The' before God or CIA: Friends can be enemies and enemies, friends; 'And, yet, a certain word, a glance, a guise, will mirror, never show, reflecting not my gaze, but my uncertain question caught inside a shadow of our shifting eyes.'Problem sequences for me: the easy suicide of the tortured man, the dead finger in a coffee can (referencing 'Godfather' of Coppola).",8,0,1,25 October 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An average film oversold by marketing gimmicks
","Director Inarritu's earlier works 'Biutiful' and 'Babel' were superior to 'Birdman,' if one is not swayed by the special effects used in this recent film. His 'Biutiful' also touched on paranormal gifts but there was some relevance for it in that film's plot. But 'Birdman's' paranormal activity and imagination of flying around like a superhero are examples of playing to the gallery. What did the film offer beyond sex-drenched drivel and the creative world vs. critics battles? Little else. Check out Istvan Szabo's 'Mephisto' (1981) (in Hungarian) which was far superior to 'Birdman,' on the travails of a great actor while dealing with a somewhat similar subject. Ye,s Keaton was good in 'Birdman'; yes Lubeszki was impressive. But as a complete work, 'Birdman' was just an average film.",6,2,6,29 March 2015
Paths of Glory," Rich in content and relevance
","Here's a significant black and white film from that only a small section of Kubrick's fans discuss. Here's is a movie made five decades ago that film goers might find relevant even to this day. It was not a runaway box office success. It's an anti-war film that has a political relevance for any country that pushes its foot soldiers to fight suicidal battles for the glory of politicians and generals. And the most surprising element of the film is that the film loosely describes events that actually transpired in France. Consequently this 1957 film was not shown in France until 1975, and in Spain until 1986.Set in Europe during the First World War, the movie is based on a novel by Henry Cobb. After the book made an impact on film director Stanley Kubrick, the film rights of the book. That act tells you a lot about Kubrick! Cobb's novel describes a historical event that took place because some French generals decided to derive glory for themselves during the war by pushing soldiers in the trenches to attempt a suicidal attack on an enemy position. Once the decision is taken by the generals, the orders are passed down the pecking order, from general to colonel, from colonel to major, from major to corporal. The suicidal strike does take place, some die, and many fall back under the fire from enemy lines.That's only the framework of the story that Kubrick used to build a film that asks inconvenient questions of the viewer. Kubrick and Cobb underline the difference between the generals who are waltzing with their spouses while the poor foot soldier is worried if he will ever see his wife again. Those in power enjoy, while the poor are pawns caught in the games the powerful play to bring glory to themselves.Kubrick's taut screenplay shows interaction between a general and the foot soldiers in the trenches. Three of the soldiers the general chooses to speak to are the very same individuals who are made the scapegoats at the military court and shot to death for no fault of theirs. Are all of us who do not enjoy economic freedom, slaves to a system that is not fair and just? The content of this film somehow anticipates Kubrick's and Kirk Douglas' next project, Spartacus, a film that was not planned at the time Paths of Glory was being made.The film has shades of existential colors. One of the condemned men compares his life and the life of an insect: 'See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive. It'll have more contact with my wife and child than I will. I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive.' At several points in the film, the screenplay underlines the reality that a junior ranking officer can never blow the whistle on a senior officer's misdeeds and get away with it. The ending of the film that Kubrick was toying with was a happy onebut the lead actor Kirk Douglas prevailed and made the ending a philosophical and a tragic one. This is perhaps one of the few examples in cinema history when an actor contributed so positively to a film. The film with a happy ending could have made more money but wouldn't have been comparable in merit and strength as this one.The viewers today can approach the film as an intelligent anti-war film in the league of Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line. Yet, remove the element of war and what happens in Paths of Glory could happen in an office, in a university, or on the playing field.If we study the film closely the film it is basically a story of men. But the men are always thinking about women. And a woman's (a German, a representative of the army they were fighting) song in a dehumanizing situation transforms the leering soldiers into men recalling their wives, mothers and daughters. The dehumanizing situation of the woman is not far removed from those of the three innocent soldiers killed by a firing squad. The lady who sang the song became Mrs. Kubrick.Philosophically the film asks the viewer whether all the various paths of glory in life lead to the grave. And as the Thomas Gray poem that provided the title of the book suggests: death is a great equalizer. The tragic twist at end of the movie underlines this dark facet of life Many critics have praised the performances in this film. Ralph Meeker and Timothy Carey as two of the condemned men and that fascinating actor, Adolph Menjou and George Macready as the Generals provided sterling performances. (Macready's performance in Tora! Tora! Tora! was probably a notch better) Kirk Douglas had a role that any good actor could have taken advantage ofmy guess is that had Richard Burton been finally cast in the role, as Kubrick initially planned, the film would have been richer. But then if Douglas was not there, we might have lost the tragic end of the film. (Douglas' finest acting credentials surfaced in my opinion in the little praised 1969 film of Elia Kazan called The Arrangement.) Paths of Glory is a film that never won an Oscar or a major film festival award. Yet, it marked the beginning of a series of great films by Kubrick. To Kirk Douglas' credit he is quoted as saying, way back in 1969 'There's a picture that will always be good, years from now. I don't have to wait 50 years to know that; I know it now' How true!",8,1,3,3 August 2008
The Deer Hunter," 'One shot' movie
","Viewing the movie after a gap of 15 years, I was disappointed with the film. My favourite Vilmos Zsigmond (photography) was below average and the film limped along because of above average performances from the players and some fine editing. The 'one shot' theme of the film is powerful, 'One-shot' with your fate, your love, your game... but does it make a great movie? You do see the movie go into top gear when you see the silent military man at the wedding. Cimino shows flashes of brilliance but I don't think this movie (forget the subject) is classy at all times. Like Gandhi, most viewers blur their vision between the subject and the cinema. The subject is powerful; the movie above average.",7,1,2,25 November 2000
Rear Window," Precursor to 'Dekalog 6' and 'Cache'
","After my third viewing of the film over a span of 20 odd years, I went beyond appreciating the cinematic challenges that Hitchcock sets for himself to overcome. For instance, I was not appreciating that this film is one of the rare instances in cinema where all the sounds are 'diegetic' recorded on the soundtrack.are sounds from within the visual world captured by the camera. After the earlier viewings, I was no longer intrigued by the amoral perspective of the voyeur, represented by L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), the good, average American bachelor with a robust, modest, creative career and a rich doting girl friend, Lisa, trying to rope him into marriage. No longer was blending of the viewer's perspective and that of Jefferies' perspective a major feat of Hitchcock.My third viewing threw up new perspectives of the film because I had now got to see over 20 Hitchcock films.First, 'Rear window' is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where women emerge smarter and stronger than menthe last scene has the hero with two legs in a cast and his lady love switching reading material to what she prefers to read over what the hero would prefer her to read, even though for the first time she has switched to trousers to humor her future husband's vision of his kind of wife. Similar ends were obvious in 'Family Plot,' 'Spellbound,' 'Rebecca' and, by inference of the final choice, in 'Marnie.' The final shot in 'Rear window' is a sexual reversal of the final shot of 'Mr and Mrs Smith.' Second, 'Rear window' is yet another film on marriagea recurring theme in Hitchcock's films. Jefferies and Lisa do not tie the knot but the end inferred this would eventually happen. But the switching of the reading material gives the viewer a clue who among the duo would rule the marriage. In another perspective on marriage, within the film a husband kills his wife. A wedding ring is stolen of all objects. Other perspectives in the film reflect on the sex in marriage and another looks at a woman dreaming of a virtual husband, a dream to which Jefferies involuntarily raises his own glass! Third, this is a film on photographers, photography and voyeurs. Only the photographer looks out of the window, when all have windows open, except when a dog or housebreak is involved. Many years after Hitchcock made the film, the Polish director Krystof Kiesolwski in his 'Dekalog no. 6' explored the same theme with astonishing results. Recently, Austrian filmmaker Michael Hanneke's 'Cache' presented videos of an anonymous voyeur as the pivotal essay on racial interaction. All the three films infer that the crime is in watching other people commit crime. The watcher and the watched emerge as flip sides of an individual or alter egos.",7,1,3,17 April 2006
Casino," Scorsese's America
","There are different levels to appreciate this work of Scorsese. Pileggi and Scorsese could be presenting an accurate social and political study on the manner in which casinos are run in USA. But it is also a study of how money buys power and success, and corrodes one's humility. It is written in the manner Greek tragedies were written showing the climb to power and the inevitable downfall of the powerful following the state of hubris (here the firing of an incompetent employee with the right connection}. Compare Ace (de Niro's character), thoughtful about mundane details such as alerting a stranger about a good pen that he could well lose at the bar and who winces at Nick's subsequent violent actions, to the later Ace, who is insensitive to violent actions he himself orchestrates. Compare Nick (Pesci), who seeks permission from Ace to live in Las Vegas, to the later Nick, who drunk with power refuses to acknowledge he once asked Ace's permission. In many ways 'Casino' is a director/screenplay writers film than an actors' film. Performances, though commendable, take a back seat. Is it a mere gangster film or is the film using the gangster and hustler backdrop to offer the audience another perspective of America beyond the obvious? The social commentary here is somewhat like Altman's films 'Nashville' or 'A Wedding'.The religious Christian motifs of redemption underlie much of Scorcese's work, unconsciously or consciously, and Casino offers a viewer several perspectives, if you choose to assess his films in that perspective. (Scorsese is an admirer of Terrence Mallick, whose film 'The thin red line', which incidentally also was pregnant with religious motifs--e.g., tattoos of Biblical references).One can also appreciate Casino as an example of good movie craftmanship. Take the sequence of Sharon Stone's introduction in the film, where she is obviously aware that Ace is staring at her. It is so well done that one notices Sharon Stone visage and actions, while the editing and direction are really top notch as well, which contribute to make the sequence superb. Sharon Stone gives a riveting performance, as do De Niro and Pesci. Kudos to Scorsese on the appropriate 70s music at various stages in the film's progress. While I appreciate Scorcese's choice of Ace's voice over commentary, I was surprised at Nick's commentary intertwining the voice-over of Ace. This method does makes sense if both are alive at the end of the film; not otherwise.",8,1,1,17 December 2001
The Thin Red Line," A feast for the senses from the one of the best living US film directors
","I have only seen Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line among Mallick's work but they have left a deep impression on my evaluation of Hollywood cinema. Mallick's film makes the earlier version of the Thin Red Line look pedantic and immature. He transforms the story into a virtual feast for the eyes, ears, and the heart. Nature and allegory play a bewitching spell on a serious filmgoer--take the example of sound of the wind on the grasses (dealt with only by camera in Days of Heaven. The flora and fauna rub shoulders with top actors in attempts to draw the viewer's attention. The storyline in the film does not merely revolve around seemingly disjointed episodes but even on postures of characters (Travolta's walk on the deck of a ship and Nolte's aggressiveness tell you more than what is spoken by them).It is indeed interesting to note that it did not win a single Oscar but won the top Berlin film festival award.Compared to Days of Heaven, this film is a testimony to Mallick's personal growth in the fields of application of sound and music in his cinema. In terms of cinematography, Days of Heaven holds more allure.Here is one filmmaker who needs more recognition within the US. In Hyderabad, where I saw the film the posters mentioned the actors, not Mallick! The marketing of this gem of a film was flawed as the wrong people came to see the film, while those who would have loved to see it missed the opportunity altogether.",10,1,2,25 February 2000
Annihilation," Suicide or self-destruction?
","Is it suicide or self-destruction? The novel and the screenplay are not as convincing as the original screenplay of the director Alex Garland in his earlier work 'Ex Machina.' The strength of the film is limited to its visuals.'Ex Machina' was superior to this film in many respects, including the choice of the cast. A small feather in the cap was the choice of the song 'Helplessly Hoping' by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.",7,0,1,6 February 2019
Saboteur," Hitchcock's homage to film-making
","'Saboteur' will be one of the few films in which the director refers to the film-making process and doffs his hat to cinema.The first reference is during the conversation of how the saboteurs intend to blow up the inauguration of a warship with the aid of a camera and other devices. One of the characters states 'it is a pity that a good camera would be lost.' The second reference is the sequence in a film screening, where the audience is strangely laughing at a grim scene. So enraptured is the audience that they do not realize that armed saboteurs are trying to escape the dragnet of the law until someone among the audience is shot in the process.The two references indicate: 1. The importance he gave to the camera; 2.The ability of cinema to mesmerise audiences; and 3. The possibility that audiences could react in unusual ways to what was presented, depending on how it was presented.Hitchcock relied on good scripts and this one has patches of brilliancethe blind man's hospitality to a stranger and a motley circus crew's reaction to giving a ride to couple on the road. The first sequence mentioned involving Vaughan Glaser is remarkable for the fine words of wisdom and delivery, the second for its humanism seen from the viewpoint of fringes of society. I guess Hitchcock must have seen the 1932 Hollywood film 'Freaks' or, if not, the scriptwriters had seen it, because much of this latter sequence harks back to this film in good measure.What is great about 'Saboteur' that we do not see in other works of Hitchcock? The title sequence with the shadow of a person emerging from a corner of the screen and a few minutes later the dense smoke blacking out the screen are unforgettable in black and white. In color it might not have had the same effect.Hitchcock loved to copy his own earlier work and but improve on them each timemuch of 'The 39 Steps' gets repeated here, handcuffs, chase with a woman across the country, terrorists, etc. And of course what he presents here in 'Saboteur' gets picked up later: Statue of Liberty gets replaced by Mount Rushmore and the impromptu auction in 'North by Northwest' and the telescope of 'Saboteur' is replaced by binoculars of 'Rear Window' and so on.Two major Hitchcock elementssex and humortake a back seat. Sex is inferred by the bearded lady's statements and dark humor is presented when one of the saboteurs refer to his childhood with golden curls. This work of Hitchcock stands out for lovers of the craft of good cinema more than those who look for a good story. The first few frames of the film had me hooked! Then came the script that was superlative in several sections of the uneven film. The film will stand the test of time for serious film viewers. I wish we could see the sections of the film that were deleted!",8,0,1,30 March 2006
Macbeth," An important Shakespeare film
","An important Shakespeare film.My best 'Macbeth' still remains the Orson Welles version, followed by Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood.'Why is director Justin Kurzel's version important? This version's visuals (cinematographer Adam Arkapaw) and music/soundtrack are fascinating (though at a few times in the film, the music goes overboard by increasing its volume). The overhead shots of the kings on the throne, the near final sequences of Macbeth's end in red fire and smoke are Kurzel's masterstrokes. The screenplay's variation of the three witches, complete with the young child, is another first. In fact, all children, specially Fleance, in this version acquire a major space that no other version of Macbeth allowed.Marion Cotillard is amazing always. Fassbender is not the best Macbeth--others have been a lot better. The music of Jed Kurzel is notable, more so the sound management most of the time, though not always. Now, is the music composer Kurzel related to the director Kurzel? Both are Australians with the same surname.The lack of bagpipes in the music was odd. So also the several Christian crosses that one does not often see in Shakespeare, unless it is essential, as in 'Romeo and Juliet.' This Macbeth is different in more ways than obvious. The Special Effects department needs to take a bow as major contributors. Methinks, the Australian element surfaced in this British/US/French production.",8,3,5,26 May 2016
