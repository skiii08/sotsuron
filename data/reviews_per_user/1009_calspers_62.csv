Blade Runner 2049," Aesthetic perfection
","Blade Runner 2049 exhibits the kind of hunt of the perfectionism that is rarely witnessed. And wow, what an effort.From the brilliantly adapted score, lighting and practical visual effects, seeking the perfect is in focus. An example of this is seen in how cinematographer Roger Deakins had a considerable impact on the sets themselves in terms of staging the light as vividly as it was portrayed in the original Blade Runner. Deservedly, he finally won the Oscar for best cinematography for this film.The subtle cues and references to the original film from 1982 assembly subliminal and sublime directional work by Denis Villeneuve.The performances by Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford are simply brilliant and very convincing. As is the score finished off by Hans Zimmer with complex rhythm sections and a clear homage paid to Vangelis.",9,1,8,4 June 2019
Come and See," Eerie masterpiece by Elem Klimov
","'Idi i smotri' directed and co-written by Elem Klimov, in my opinion, portrays the horrors of WWII with more grit, brutality and vulnerability than any other film has done it. The film is littered in atmosphere and claustrophobia.Still, it is magnificent to watch, with beautiful camera work exemplified through creative pans, stunning long takes and tracking shots. Cinematographer Aleksey Rodionov did an absolutely fantastic job, harnessing the potential of the 4:3 aspect ratio.Lead actor Aleksey Kravschenko makes an incredible performance at portraying a boy who finds a rifle and wants to join the Sovjet army.It is a film of great artistic contrast, seeming both spontaneous, organic, and authentic, yet controlled, deliberate, while even displaying numerous beautiful and crushing metaphors to the dehumanization forced upon so many innocents by the Nazis.An incredibly powerful and important statement in human history, as well as a seminal masterpiece in the history of cinema.",9,4,5,11 September 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Signature Spielberg direction
","'Catch Me If You Can' (2002) directed by Steven Spielberg I thought was a great cat-chasing-mouse film.From the opening credits, the film eers with stylistic homogeneity. The excellent writing by Jeff Nathanson, the smooth directional choices by Spielberg, the brilliant score by John Williams, the great cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, although a shame it was shot in 16:9. It all contributes to making this a greatly entertaining film achievement.The most impressive though, to me was the performances by leading Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and by supporting Christopher Walken and especially by Amy Adams and Martin Sheen.One thing I thought a weakness was that is didn't feel timeless - somehow it felt stuck in the beginning of the 00's in its production style.Overall, though, a fine film by Spielberg.",8,1,2,2 October 2019
Iron Man 3," Humerous action from MCU but cheap dialogue and plot
","Although I thought this film to be better than Iron Man 2, I still think it reaches towards the depths of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.As usual, Tony Stark has wit and charm with the great sarcastic lines and nicknames for his victims, but the script is basically week, as is the plot, and the dialogue is filled with cheap punch lines by actors who don't seem to be invested in their roles whatsoever, including Guy Ritchie and Don Cheadle.But Marvel succeeds in its intention: contribute sparsely to phase two of the MCU, and to deliver handsome and prominent action with box office hitting specs. In my view, Iron Man 3 succeeded at both.",6,0,0,23 April 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Technically brilliant and humourous Tarantino film
","'Inglourious Basterds' written and directed by Quentin Tarantino was an interesting experience. But in my eyes one of his least interesting films. When this is said, his filmography is impressive, and a lot of things where done just right in this; brilliant casting all around from multiple continents, impressive set pieces, great signature soundtrack.But naturally, such a brutal fictional tale from Tarantino did not have the same feel-good atmosphere as his more exotic-based locations (e.g. L.A. in Reservoir, Pulp, and Jackie, or Tokyo in Kill Bill).The biggest exaggeration was the amount of scalping heads and brutal violence which was too extreme for me, even as a vendetta film. Here, the violence is not portrayed in the fun and over-the-top way as for instance the Kill Bills.Still, the whole production, direction, writing, cinematography, et cetera has the great Tarantino flare, but particularly Christoph Waltz was beyond outstanding in his Oscar-earning performance.",7,0,2,19 August 2019
Captain Marvel," Decent effort, but cheap as well
","Carol Danvers was well-portrayed by Brie Larson, and her dynamics with Nick Fury A.D. 1995 was interesting. Apart from this, this seemed like a bit of a cheap effort.Decent direction but a somewhat weak screenplay. To me, there seemed to be at least some genre confusion, with crazy sci-fi blending in with usual MCU action and over-the-top production for a quite unimaginative and stale plot.Will not recommend.",5,0,2,30 June 2019
Passengers," Script by Jon Spaihts saves the day
","... or perhaps rather the premise of the filmIn 'Passengers', Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both played their lead parts very well, as did supporting Laurence Fishburne. Lots of CGI. I think the movie would have benefited greatly from the use of practical effects rather than relying heavily on CGI, especially on the robots.Did I find 'Passengers' entertaining? Yes, the interesting premise made sure of that.Was I impressed, surprised, moved, or remotely touched by it? Most certainly not.",6,1,1,2 March 2019
Rang De Basanti," Yet another overrated mess badly skewed by Indian IMDb users
","'Rang De Basanti' directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is about a woman who wants to depict the freedom fighters from 1920's India in a documentary. As a film, it tries to cover important ground from Indian history, but as with the rest of Bollywood productions, it fails miserably in the attempt.Strange pacing from beginning to end, and what could be told in less than 90 minutes took almost 180. Awkward rushed editing in spite, an atrociously cheap score, together with several mediocre performances.To name its few qualities, I thought it did have a slightly interesting developing storyline, as well as decent cinematography and production design with a couple of excellent locations. Aamir Khan brought life to the film with his intuitive wit and impeccable energy as an actor.Other than that, and as usual from the fiercely overrated Bollywood films in this site, it was a big, long, cheasy mess.",3,3,6,6 September 2019
12 Angry Men," A sophisticated study of minority influence
","'12 Angry Men' directed by Sidney Lumet is such an impressive study of minority influence that I will never forget seeing for the first time - 2011 In my social psychology class as an undergrad student.Everything about this film is pure excellence. A genius script by Reginald Rose, fantastic acting - especially by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. It really is the simplicity of the story that makes the film shine.Add to that the theoretical complexities of the subject matter and a great classic is born - and it certainly was in 1957.",9,1,1,19 January 2020
The Irishman," A cynical study in american history, acting, and filmmaking
","'The Irishman' (2019), written for the screen by Steven Zaillian and directed by Martin Scorsese, was an impressive experience to watch.Running at three and a half hours, the film covers the events surrounding the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa, with Scorsese taking his time delivering its story. I found the film to be well-paced in spite of the long runtime.What impressed me the most were the incredible performances from Pesci, Pacino, and especially De Niro, all of whom conveyed the different life periods with great emotional and acting-wise depth.My favorite part of the film by far was its last 30 minutes, where the glory of mobster life was depicted as grueling and worthless. Here, I strongly believe Scorsese delivered his message of the film.While I certainly found 'The Irishman' to be a film of high quality in many respects, such as its production, I did not invest myself as much as in Scorsese's films such as 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas' or 'Silence'. Still I recommend film buffs to see this.",7,2,4,3 January 2020
Yes Man," Excellent direction
","'Yes Man' directed by Peyton Reed was a thrilling experience to see on the big screen when it was originally released. Still 12 years later, I must say I find it to be among the very best of romantic comedies.Filled to the brim with great characteristics, it is wonderfully written by Nicholas Stoller and Jarrad Paul with an original script, which gives the film an interesting premise. This then leads to great direction by Peyton Reed, who filled the film with wonderfully realised characters.On the acting side, excellent performances by Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, and as the brilliant side kick, a big shout out to Rhys Darby as Norman.All in all a wonderful, original and positive film. Highly recommended for a Friday night at home.",8,0,1,13 January 2020
The Prestige," Nolan's perfection in writing and direction
","'The Prestige' (2006) directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan is a must-see - both as a film of great artistic and entertainment value.A very original script, Nolan's signature smooth and yet non-linear direction, and a wonderful cast by Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansson, Hall, and Bowie.See it regardless of, whether your incentive relies on a need for entertainment or to gain insight into the mastercraft of a masterful director - one of the best in the business.",9,0,1,11 February 2020
The Terminator," The dawn of Cameron's perfectionism
","James Cameron's real feature debut. What left is there to be said in this sci-fi epic revolving around artificial intelligence and man's search for efficiency?It is marked by numerous feats as a great film, with interesting characters, beautiful sets and production design, smooth editing, perfect pacing, excellent sci-fi/action premise, Arnold as a machine - brilliant.Gorgious camera-work and absolutely genius and simple midi 80's score. Cameron surely nails just about it all in his big debut feature. Eventually, though, he would go on to make an even more ambitious and masterful film in T2:JD, arguably one of the best sequels in film history.Highly recommended.",9,0,2,16 July 2019
"I, Tonya"," Nice cooperation by Craig Gillespie and Steven Rogers
","'I, Tonya' (2017) is neatly directed and written by Craig Gillespie and Steven Rogers, respectively.The film covers the life of Tonya Harding, a former ice-skating medalist from a lower-class family.Margot Robbie portraying Tonya Harding did an outstanding job, as did Allison Janney who deservedly won best supporting actress for her performance.Other than that, what stood out to me were the interesting directional choices exemplified through creative character breaks, and writing qualities demonstrated through the abundant and self-aware use of tragic-comedy storytelling.A recommendable and decent little biopic.",7,1,1,26 September 2019
Dear John," Very weak soap
","I saw this with my lovely wife, who picked this one up. Lasse Hallström is at it again with 'Dear John' (2010), after the massive success of 'The Notebook' (2004).Where the latter succeeded in its directional choices, storytelling and acting, the former fails. Badly executed acting from Tatum and Seyfried. Only performance I thought was beyond mediocre was the supporting role by Richard Jenkins.Plot inconcistencies are abundant with emphasis on Seyfried, and generally ineffective pacing made this a very poor experience - as anticipated.",3,1,1,11 October 2019
Barry Lyndon," ...Aristocratic perfection by Kubrick - but...
","This film by Stanley Kubrick is perhaps my least favorite of his. It is still an excellent film, which says it all about Kubrick - one of the greatest film making artists to have walked this Earth.A perfect aspect about the film is its script, which I find magnificent as an adapted screenplay by Kubrick. To me this is mere perfection. Incredible linguistic detail, perfectly casted unto almost every actor and actress. An example hereof is the wedding scene (no spoilers).But... the film did not move me much - I simply did not find it touching (albeit technically perfect), and this is my issue with the film. At best, I was close to emotionally engaged in a scene between Lord Bullingdon and Barry Lyndon.Back to its technical merits:
<ul><li>Cinematography is - as always in a Kubrick film - fantastic and astonishing. Here with elaborate use of interesting zoom-outs, wide shots, and tracking shots from the brilliant Kubrick cinematography, revealing the beautiful British landscapes.</li><li>Great score - albeit demanding classical pieces to my ears.</li><li>Inviting narrative style, and an excellent directional choice of my liking.</li></ul>All in all, I believe the life of Barry Lyndon is magnificently portrayed by one of the greatest masters of the art form, but lacking in emotion.",8,3,4,8 February 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDonagh's bright director's mind
","Martin McDonagh nails the extraordinarily difficult of merging the deepest grief with sophisticated black comedy in a mind-blowingly well-crafted original screenplay.Accompanied by excellent and clever direction and great casting, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was in my opinion the strongest film of 2017.Frances McDormand's potrayal of the bad-ass grieving mother is nothing short of excellent, being simultaneously hilarious, natural, and heart-wrenching. The supporting cast of Woody Harrelson and particularly Sam Rockwell I felt was equally strong and convincing.What a film experience.",9,0,1,17 July 2019
Ant-Man," Ant-Man - a brave MCU-move
","What could have been a cheap premise in the form of a literal Ant-Man with a strange superhero name, I actually found to be surprisingly engaging and entertaining.Paul Rudd plays a bad guy which to me, still after seeing the film, seemed counter-intuitive, as Rudd is ultimately a good-guy-purpose character actor.Great casting of Michael Douglas as Hank Pym.Fantastic and mind-bending CGI proving itself useful for once.A brave move from Marvel with what I find to be a somewhat bland comic book superhero, but brought to life in an interesting way. Recommended!",7,0,0,25 April 2019
The Godfather: Part II," All the power on earth can't change destiny
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather: Part II' (1974) is the second installment in the Godfather Saga, masterfully executed as a sequel.In my view, it is the greatest sequel to have ever been conceived. How much pressure Coppola must have felt when embarking on this after the huge success and instant classic that 'The Godfather' (1972) had become. In spite, he must have kept calm in perfecting the work of Part II.The film centres partly on Michael's descent into the downward spiral of the crime world, as well as the history of his late father, Vito Andolini, beautifully portrayed in the original by the screen legend above them all, Marlon Brando.In part II, Vito's life is presented from when he was a young boy in Sicily, and how the tragic events of his childhood shapes him as a person. We also follow him as a growing adult, portrayed by Robert De Niro, who gives a stunning performance, for which he deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. In this period piece part of the film, we see some intriguing character development which contributes to sophisticated storytelling, while simultaneously paying homage to Part I.The character studies of Part II really is what drives the saga's perfection further. Along with a budget twice as large as in Part I, this highly ambitious effort was possible for Coppola to execute to perfection with beautiful shifting set designs and huge staging of the milieus. Naturally, it draws on the same perfect storytelling, direction, cinematography, score and all else that Part I is revered for. But it adds further, with even more intrigue and suspense than what we where exposed to in Part I.A perfect film, and a deeply convincing character study of a man, who has it all but love, and who falls apart from his desires to power and money. Almost on par with Part I, and although some even think this surpasses its perfection, the original remains my favourite film.",10,3,3,4 September 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A polished Hollywood depiction lacking authenticity
","Just to begin with: Bryan Singer's depiction of Freddie Mercury and Queen's concerts are absolutely brilliant in terms of their direction and editing. The cinematography of the film is also excellent and it is overall a very polished effort. As was Rami Malek's performance.What I really and truly missed in this film was authenticity. Especially with regards to the writing which seemed almost superficial and afraid of spoiling a perfect image of a perfect rock band. Perhaps this goes in line with the massive advertisement of the film and that it needs to be politically correct in most ways.To sum up I think the direction is excellent but the tight Hollywood-esque writing really suffers from flaws in terms of conveying true emotion and authenticity.I saw this screening very close to seeing and experiencing Bradley Cooper's 'A Star Is Born', which I hugely preferred due to its down-to-earth direction and writing as well as some very unpolished and vulnerable performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.Nonetheless I can recommend this film to any fan of Queen, as it gives some interesting perspectives on the life of Freddie Mercury.",6,1,4,6 February 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A transporting film with the definitive metaphor for human strength and weakness
","'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001) is such a definitive adventure, perfectly realised through the intention of Peter Jackson.The truly awe-inspiring production design, the perfect casting of everyone from Elijah Wood to Ian McKellen, the haunting score by Howard Shore, the perfect editing (in both versions, in my opinion). It is simply a work of art, and perfectly realised.But what to me is the most beautiful message of Tolkien's masterpiece delivered for the screen by Jackson is the symbolism in the world of Middle Earth. The ring is perhaps the purest ever depiction of the fragility of the human condition. Our search for power, influence and the ego. At the same time, the way in which love is portrayed by Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and perhaps most of all Sam, is daringly beautiful - in fact all Tolkien's caricatures of Christ.A definitive statement - not only for the fantasy genre - but one which has cemented itself in cinema history.",10,1,1,31 March 2020
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The penultimate carefully told tale
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) is the penultimate film in the series, and once again directed convincingly by David Yates. After the death of Professor Dumbledore, circumstances are darker than ever, and so is this film.I actually really like how Dealthy Hallows is divided into two parts, as these are clearly the most slow-paced of all of the films. Part 1 is concerned with horcruxes, and the atmosphere created throughout the film is brilliantly ominous and intricate.One of my favourite films in the series, as Yates is very focused and simultaneously careful and patient in delivering us this film.",7,1,1,28 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Fast-paced creative animation
","Spider-Man can be anyone.I found 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' to be a bag of mixed quality. Let me start with what I found to be its strengths:Amazing animation and production design, and good performances on the voice cast.The faults were clear as well: a bit of a messy script with much focus on aesthetics, very fast pacing and not much investment into the character arcs. Example given: King Pin was never really an unstoppable force, nor very threatening when encountered close-up.All in all a treat and original in its visual style, but fundamentally lacking a mature script, as well as well-developed character arcs.",7,4,6,9 March 2019
Judgment at Nuremberg," Perfection in history and morale
","Amazing sets, fantastic camera work and movement, mind-blowing script, and genuinely beautiful production and direction by Stanley Kramer.The leading performance by Maximilian Schnell which deservedly earned him the best leading actor Academy Award is fantastic, as is the one by Spencer Tracy and the rest of the supporting cast. In the beginning, Tracy is portrayed as an honest and capable judge in subtle hints that perfectly builds his character arc of integrity. Montgomery Clift portays more sadness and regret in his eyes than a whole script could ever pronouce, and his testimonial scene is touching and a significant part in the film.Kramer installed one of the great masterpieces of American cinema.",9,1,2,8 June 2019
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," My favourite Harry Potter film
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) directed by Alfonso Cuarón is my favourite of the entire series - due to its clever plot with time-warping, Cuarón's brilliant direction, and the magic intact from the earlier films. As a note, I am also a fan of the later films, which are more ominous and dark in their atmospheric expression.But here, it is as if the darkness and the light of the earlier years at Hogwarts come together to create something truly magical.",8,2,2,27 March 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Cool, stylish, and cleverly edited, but suffering from a cheap plot
","Ok, so charming Michael Cera nails it in his rom-com role as usual. Nigel Godrich makes an excellent musical score. But the premise of the film did not catch me at all and I was not turned on by its sense of style or humour.To me that movie was dragging on with the same style of autonomous humour, filled to the brim with cheap pop-culture/video game references in a weird manner, considering the ambitious scope of the plot.I can recommend it for easy watching as this is a film which will not challenge your intellect nor your feelings. Then again, it never attempted to in the first place.",5,1,2,26 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great 'Endgame' to MCU but not as strong as 'Infinity War'
","Anthony and Joe Russo have yet again pulled it off in what stands as one of the better pictures we've seen through the franchise.The story takes its time showing the aftermath of 'Avengers: Infinity War', and what a take-off. The directors cleverly spends time developing the humanities of the superheroes, conveyed through the devastating effects of the acts of Thanos.Then the MCU universe creators delve into the usual smooth direction and execution, from a script filled with wit, MCU-law and humour into a grand conclusion to the 22 films that have kept me watching with excitement, and I have deeply enjoyed the franchise.There are two major weaknesses in my opinion:
(1) in 'Infinity War', Thanos, who was idealistic, ambiguous, believable and complex in his philosophy. But in 'Endgame', he was portrayed as much more of a standard sadistic maniac.
(2) the time-travel setup, which did not work convincingly for me, and insignifies many past events in the franchise.But still, I think an excellent conclusion to the Infinity Saga.",7,0,3,27 April 2019
Gone with the Wind," Downfall of the ego...
","'This was the only completely kind person I ever knew'... Rhett Butler told the truth about Melanie Wilkes, the complete antagonist of sociopathic protagonist Scarlett.This film revolves around the downfall of persons loving only themselves and tells an utterly beautiful tale of love through the echoes of the American Civil War.Sublime adapted writing and direction by Sidney Howard and Victor Fleming, and aside from that, excellent in terms of its cinematography, score, and perhaps most of all, character development. Clark Gable, Vivian Leigh and the wonderful supporting cast underline this character-, history-, drama- and romance-driven four-hour film, which I can recommend every lover of films to experience.",9,2,3,2 February 2019
No Country for Old Men," A most thorough portrayal of a clinical psychopath
","To me, 'No Country for Old Men' is one of the best films of the Coen brothers in terms of its direction, writing, acting, cinematography, editing - et cetera.But what truly stands out is the study of the psychopath - acted perfectly by Javier Bardem. The smooth direction hints at this, as several times we don't actually see what happens to the victims of Anton Chigurh, although this is sophistically hinted. The ambiguous clinical psychopathic behavioural traits are all here: impulsivity versus thorough execution, lack of empathy versus sociopathic manipulation, et cetera.Josh Brolin is excellent as anti-hero Llewelyn Moss, Tommy Lee Jones as fantastic as the worn-out lead detective Ed Tom Bell, and nihilistic Woody Harrelson is doing great in the supporting cast department as Carson Wells.The moody and eccentric vibe of this film makes it a wonder that it actually won the best picture award at the 2008 Academy Awards. I believe it is one of the most deserved victories in the entire history of the award ceremony.",9,0,0,5 February 2019
Toy Story 4," Decent 2019 Toy Story follow-up, but not on par with 1995 and 2010
","'Toy Story 4' is out, with our well-known characters and the excellent cast including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.Nice introduction, score, and editing, as suspected from a Pixar high investment animation film.I found the plot to be a bit cheap and bland, as if an excuse to make a fourth installment.The script itself, though, I thought to be charming and with great humourous flair.Recommended - but not exactly a classic.",7,2,5,28 September 2019
Bridesmaids," Brilliant script and direction - hits the spot
","This absolutely nails what it sets out to do.Greatly script, direction, cast, characters, etc.Great lead by Christine Wiig. Supporting Jessica McCarthy nails it as one of the strongest sidekicks in any comedy flick. Greatly comedy, everything comes together for a feel good comedy film better than most.I actually think this could develop cult status at film schools for its technical merits. Highly recommended!",8,2,3,8 March 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Stunning beauty and artful direction
","The film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' follows an interesting plot line set in ancient China of honour, love, and heroism.I find it to be one of the visually most stunning films from the 2000s, with smooth direction, costume design, choreography, and especially the director of photography does a stunning job og conveying the beauty of China through stunning and complex cinematography.I will recommend this in terms of story as well. Also it has some more subtle choices of conveying emotion that I was really fond of. The film provides an in-depth view into the China of the past. But I found the film's biggest strength to be its tale of quiet romance. The heartfelt sophistication of the main characters' love for each other was deeply touching to see unfold.I will highly recommend the film, especially if your local cinema has a viewing of it on the big screen.",9,2,2,28 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Perfect period piece, imperfect plot
","'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt was a thrill and deserves to be seen on the big screen.As expected from Tarantino, the film was marked by perfect direction, cinematography, editing, and in particular; production design. I felt totally immersed into 1969 Los Angeles. In spite of this, I felt the plot was rather less defined up against many of his other films, and especially considering its 161 minute runtime.Both leads nail their respective performances, but in particular Brad Pitt. Margot Robbie to me seemed almost unnecessary and more a great bill promotion rather than an actually adding quality to the film.The film held some plot-wise similarities to 'Inglourious Basterds', but in my view had more charm and feel-good to its execution.To me, it stands as a chill-out film for casual viewing than a grand artistic statement.Highly recommended.",8,0,2,25 August 2019
Aladdin," Another atrocious cash grab from Disney
","In the sign of the times, fewer good screenplays result in bland remakes of classic motion picture gems. Again, Disney have done it with little integrity and shame.I had low expectations for 'Aladdin' (2019) directed by Guy Ritchie. Sadly, these were realised through loads of auto-tuned emotionless musical songs, an abundance of CGI, and a blue, awkward Will Smith casting call.Yes, there were qualities to the film: the re-make boasts a strong production design, leaned on the great original score with creative input (in particular 'Arabian Nights'), and showcased excellent visual effects. Other than that, it merely seemed as a return of investment cash-grab from Disney. In spite of this, I must congratulate them on making yet another billion dollar box office receipt for one of their live-action atrocities - hooray.I do not have much more to add. Not recommended - instead, (re-)watch the formidable classic animated 'Aladdin' (1992).",3,2,4,31 August 2019
The Lion King," A see-through cash grabbing atrocity
","'The Lion King' (2019) 'written' by Jeff Nathanson and 'directed' by Jon Favreau is what it is.I will briefly try and list its apparent strengths: ... well, it is very difficult. But it will appeal to people who come into the cinema with no expectations other than stunning visual effects. Animations in this film do look superb. And that's about it when attempting to highlight the film's strengths.Basically, and as expected from Disney, this film should have never been conceived. It mocks one of the greatest films of cinema history with all the cheap tricks, such as shot-for-shot remade scenes, worse voice acting all across the cast, and a horrendous Elton John song during the end credits to top it all off.Atrocious as an artistic effort, and clearly exposed as what it is: an expensive big guns cash grab from Bob Igor and his board of executives at Disney.Fortunately though, despite Jon Favreau's and Jeff Nathanson's subliminal efforts, this Hollywood disaster cannot stain the enduring legacy of the original masterpiece from 1994, but merely stain the once revered status of Disney.",2,4,4,11 February 2020
The Game," An elaborate noir-inspired game by Fincher
","David Fincher's third feature film 'The Game' (1997), written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is an excellent psychological film exploring risk behavior, Explorers through brilliant direction and writing.We follow Nicholas Van Orton, portrayed by Michael Douglas, a wealthy banker living in San Fransisco, who is given an invitation by his brother to a mysterious company selling a concept referred to as a game.Fincher brilliantly and effectively stages the premise of the film, accompanied by Howard Shore's noir-inspired score as well as flashbacks to his father's suicide from when Orton was a young boy - a striking introduction.Michael Douglas gives a convincing and cynical performance - very fitting to the film's atmosphere.All in all, an interesting and bold thriller.",8,1,2,26 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan's Hollywood perfectionism
","'The Dark Knight' directed by Christopher Nolan and co-written with his brother Jonathan, is the second installment of three in Nolan's Batman adaptation, and revolves around the havoc-wreaking Joker and the chaos he subdues Gotham in. For obvious reasons, it was a big experience for me to watch back in 2008 on the silver screen.Basically, 'The Dark Knight' holds grand cinematic value for numerous reasons. Excellent direction and screenplay the Nolan brothers, sublime performances by Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and in particular Heath Ledger (what left is there to be said), beautiful editing and cinematography, haunting score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard - the list goes on.'The Dark Knight' is both a beautiful, fast-paced, effective action film, and at the same time a film with character depth, serious narratives, and drama. It is a big achievement for Hollywood, and absolutely gorgeous in every aspect, compared with most of what emerges from there.",9,0,2,7 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," David Yates directs the series to a darker atmosphere
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is the first of the last four Harry Potter films to be directed by David Yates. This works well in my opinion, as the atmosphere across the last four films felt highly homogeneous.Number five in the series in one of the darkest, but it works well for the premise of the film adaptations. The simultaneous strength and humility of Harry is brilliantly portrayed by Yates in this.As usual with these films, the technical merits are top notch, with wonderful supporting cast of Gambon, Rickman and Smith, and of course wonderful visuals and music. A magical and dark adventure.",7,0,0,27 March 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," Hilarious British comedic gold
","'This Is Spinal Tap' directed by Rob Reiner and written by Spinal Tap themselves - was an excellent experience.Hilarious, original humour. Great dynamics in the writing and acting conveyed through the band members. Even the songs, apart from their self-aware, atrocious lyrics, are excellent and even performed convincingly by the actors.A true comedic gem, finely paced at 82 minutes for its
original mockumentary premise.Highly recommended for any night of fun.",8,1,1,12 September 2019
Avatar," One of cinema's most visually ambitious efforts
","'Avatar' by James Cameron is arguably a perfect film judging by its methodological approach, and from a technical standpoint it still stands unrivaled as a feat of the vision of a director. Add to that charming characters as well as a touching theme, and a great film is in the mold.The film is a mere spectacle to look at with well-deserved visual effects winning the team an academy award. Cameron did a fantastic job at writing, directing, and editing this film into a smooth script with excellent punchlines. The production design is overwhelming is still to this day practically unparralelled with incredible attention to detail from the sky to little bugs flying around in the evening air. The score by James Horner is nothing short of magnificent and fitting very well with the grand visual scheme of the film.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and others deliver excellent performances, all of which are portrayed in very natural ways in spite of the sci-fi avatar-driven production.Avatar has received a lot of hate for its seemingly adapted screenplay from Pocahontas. Rather than focusing on the plot this is a film which really utilizes the narrative in new, constructive and creative ways. As a statement in cinema history, I believe 'Avatar' is a brilliant example of a director's vision for a film which at the time of its inception molded the state of the art.Highly recommended.",9,4,5,30 July 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The maiden voyage of an incredible adventure
","In 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), directed by Chris Columbus, introduced millions of children to the world of magic.As a disclaimer, I am not a direct fan of the fantasy genre, and have not read J.K Rowling's revered books. However, as a film (and later, film franchise), Harry Potter is brought alive in a wonderful manner.Daniel Radcliffe is completely wonderful as the introvert hero, and when he smiles, all the cruelty of the universe is dimmed. Rupert Grimp and Emma Watson are equally wonderful portraying their characters to near-perfection as the quirky and over-achiever, respectively. Most importantly, the bond of friendship between them is magical.Aside, giant performances, particularly by Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Academy Award winner Maggie Smith, contributes to the spectacle, along with immersive production design and impressive direction by Chris Columbus.For those of you, who have not yet seen it: let the magic begin!",8,0,0,26 March 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The final film infused with the childish nature of the Harry Potter universe
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) directed by Mike Newel is a great film. Not only, as it introduces the embodiment of the great villain, Voldemort in convincing fashion, but because it - as the final film, in my opinion - was able to grasp the childish nature of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.It is very well- directed and well-paced, and contains quite a bit of action compared to many of the other films. I remember being very impressed when I originally watched this film in the theatre.In my opinion, one of the strongest Harry Potter films!",8,0,0,27 March 2020
Three Colors: Blue," A masterful character study in desperate grief
","Krzysztof Kieslowski's first in the 'Three Colors' trilogy, 'Bleu' (1993), is a masterpiece in illustrating the complex aspects of grief, in both visually and tecnically sophisticated ways.Juliette Binoche is nothing short of amazing in her role as the grief-stricken Julie, who in a matter of seconds loses all she loves. The plot of the film revolves around the events following the car crash that killed her husband and daughter.Visually, it is a deeply impressive film, often drawing on storytelling in mere cinematography. The sets are wonderful. The script is convincing. All in all, it is a masterful depiction og grief from the perspective of the Julie, the sole survivor in the family.Highly recommended.",8,1,1,15 November 2019
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The transition of Hogwarts - and voice transition of Daniel Radcliffe
","In 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), directed by Chris Columbus, introduced millions of children to the world of magic. In 2002, he delivered The Chamber of Secrets - a more dark venture into the world of magic.As a disclaimer, I am not a direct fan of the fantasy genre, and have not read J.K Rowling's revered books. However, as a films, I enjoy the universe.Daniel Radcliffe still plays wonderfully, but his boyish charms withered early, as his voice transitioned sardonically with Rupert Grint's. Of course, this is a physiologically natural phenomenon, but I think it attenuates the premise of the universe; that Harry is growing up.Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still wonderful in portraying their characters to near-perfection as the quirky and over-achiever, respectively.A note on Professor Dumbledore, Richard Harris to me is the definitive character embodiment - and better than Michael Gambon who also did a great job. But Harris was far more emphatic, and far less alpha male in his expression in my opinion., Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are still wonderful. The immersive production design from the first one only grew stronger in this, and Chris Columbus once again nails the direction.Recommended!",7,0,0,27 March 2020
Joker," Overrated but brilliant character study portrayed by Phoenix and Phillips
","'Joker' (2019) written and directed by Todd Phillip and staring Joaquin Phoenix was perhaps one of 2019's most anticipated and marketed films. Because of popular culture having spoken of the film, I felt like I consciously had to reset my expectations of the film.Two things stood out to me, both trademarks of perfection in 'Joker'; the first being Phoenix' performance, who delivered an incredible and visceral performance of one of comic history's most revered criminals. The sheer grit and panic that he conveyed to the screen was nothing short of breathtaking to witness.Second, Phillips' direction was supreme. The directional choices I thought were particularly intelligent; from a great alternate beginning in terms of identifying the audience with Arthur Fleck, to its excellent pacing and storytelling ability.Apart from these two obvious qualities, it was indeed a fine film experience. But overrated? In my opinion, definitely so. Worthy of top 25? 50? 100? Not in my book.Highly recommended, nonetheless.",8,2,3,1 January 2020
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'It's a matter of principle' - timeless direction by David Lean
","'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a prinoner-of-war drama at its best, masterfully directed by David Lean.Amazing direction, and the whole approach to making this film is timeless - a study in being ahead of its time. Stunning set pieces and production design - such and effort was put into this. Fantastic cinematography, filled to the brim with pitch-perfect pans, wide-shots, and tracking-shots. Intense and dramatic score, deservedly receiving one of the total of seven Academy Awards. Brilliant cast and in particular Alec Guinness, who perfectly portrays a man of honour.What is a big shame is the way Colonel Philip Toosey - the original colonel, portrayed through Nicholson - was misrepresented, in that he actually acted very differently and much more courageously than in the film.Nonetheless, as a look into the historic event that took place in 1943 Burma, it is absolutely brilliant, and although the film does not carry loads of emotional moments, it is technically excellent, and greatly entertaining.Highly recommended.",8,5,5,9 September 2019
The Lion King," The peak for Disney: perfect writing, direction, score, animation
","Disney truly outdid themselves in 1994. What left is there to be said about 'The Lion King'? So to sum up:This is the perfect story. The journey of a life time for protagonist Simba. The wisdom from Mufasa and Rafiki, the dynamic duo of Timon and Pumba. The perfect directional choices. The strongest score and pacing. Humour, emotion, humanity - in a fable tale depicting the animal kingdom.As a child, this was my first confrontation with death. At present day, it remains one of my few favorite films. It has truly stood the test of time with gorgeous characters, animation style, and all of the above, including frequent rewatchability.Perfection from Disney, and in my opinion their most beautiful film to date.",10,0,0,10 February 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Bad screenwriters can hold Hollywood prisoner, 'Shawshank' can set it free
","Frank Darabont's feature debut film is close to unparalleled, and an achievement in creating a unified Hollywood masterpiece.Much has been said surrounding 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994), based on the short story by Stephen King and written for the screen and directed by the man of Stephen King adaptations and prison-centred movies - Frank Darabont. I fell in love with the film the first time I saw it around the turn of the millennium. After multiple viewings, its quality and rewatch-ability has only grown on me.The film came out in 1994, right around President Clinton completed restrictive laws on penitentiaries and inmates. Perhaps that was why it didn't do well either at the box office or in reviews, as the general opinion opposed 'Shawshank's' humanisation of inmates. Personally, I find Darabont's execution of this particularly touching and brilliant, exempla gratia given through the beautiful character, Brooks.Darabont's feature debut has it all: a touching script, excellent direction, a wonderful leading and supporting cast, a grand and fitting ominous score, smooth editing and pacing, formidable production design - the list goes on - and many have celebrated its revered status as a new Hollywood classic. I personally am very fond of 'The Shawshank Redemption', and although it certainly is not my favourite film, or worthy of the site's top spot in my opinion, I applaud its inception and timelessness.",9,0,0,3 September 2019
Parasite," Brilliantly staged satire by Bong Joon Ho
","'Parasite' directed by Bong Joon Ho is a fine film about one horrible family taking horrendous advantage of the wealthy Park family, and a strong message to our global culture.I was deeply impressed by this gem of a film, which only strengthens the creative vision of Bong, as well as the fascinating cinema of South Korea.Fantastic direction - Bong Joon Ho is a master at building suspense from simple scenes and shots. Formidable cinematography. A sovereign effort in production design. Deliberate and effective pacing throughout. Taking all this together with a very interesting script and characters, and an excellent film is realised.Highly recommendable.",9,1,6,10 September 2019
Platoon," Terrifying Stone invitation into the psychology of warfare
","'Platoon' (1986) directed and written by Oliver Stone treats the malignancy of the Vietnam war with striking authenticity. With its Interesting narrative structure, and ability to build suspense in the subtleties, it excited and frightened me.Excellent writing and direction by Stone, and the fact that he himself is a Vietnam veteran I think comes across in the excellent screenplay. Strong performances by Tom Berenger, Forest Whitaker. The same cannot be said of Charlie Sheen who at times was almost embarrasing. But most of all, I thought Willem Dafoe did a wonderful performance as Elias.As a mid-eighties war film, I cannot help but compare it to its predecessor by one-year, 'Idi i smotri' by Elem Klimov, which is nothing short of magnificent, with beautiful camera work exemplified through creative pans, stunning long takes and tracking shots. Cinematographer Aleksey Rodionov did an absolutely fantastic job, harnessing the potential of the 4:3 aspect ratio. Here, we see a 16:9 format - also brilliantly used by the amazing DP, Robert Richardson.While 'Idi i smotri' is virtually an unparralelled masterpiece as a war film, being spontaneous, organic, and authentic, yet controlled and deliberate, I found 'Platoon' to be poetic and nuanced in its own right. In my opinion it is an anti-war film; an excellent film about the psychological terror and dehumanization of war.",8,1,2,12 September 2019
Marriage Story," A subtle and impressive study in when love comes to an end
","'Marriage Story' (2019) written and directed by Noah Baumbach was a visceral experience. First off, this is a difficult film to master - the premise is incredibly simple, and thus, excellent writing, direction and acting is necessary in order for the film to shine - and it certainly does, in my view.Charlie and Nicole, portrayed by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, respectively, both give the performance of their careers with emotionally complex and very demanding parts that they both mastered in my opinion.The writing is very intelligent, seen in that the couple who are separating still sense the immense connection that their earlier love has established.A fine film that reminded me, just how precious love really is.",9,6,10,31 December 2019
The Iron Giant," Great story, timeless gun control message and beautiful animation
","'The Iron Giant' was very enjoyable for me to watch. Beautiful story, message, animation, world-class voice acting, believable characters, excellent 1950's inspired score and an overall stylistic theme, which gives the film directed by Brad Bird a timeless feel, even more than 20 years after its release.The film was very immersive to me as a consequence of the story of friendship and sacrifice along with the visual and auditive experience, and a lot of examples of quality define a great film about the humane in all of us.Highly recommended.",9,1,2,21 August 2019
Blade Runner," An incredibly immersive achievement by Ridley Scott
","'Blade Runner' directed by Ridley Scott and written for the screen by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples defined generations to come with courageous and experimental approaches to film-making. What left is there to be said about it?Superb immersion through astonishing sets, staging, light choreography, cinematography, music, and of course - impeccable practical effects.My impression is that the US theatrical version has generally received a lot of criticism when compared with Scott's director's cut and especially his very own 'Final Cut', with emphasis on Harrison Ford's very unenthusiastic voice acting on the voice overs.
Although I can relate to this, and although I by far prefer the 'Final Cut', I find the theatrical version to function interestingly on several levels; e.g. as an ode to film noir in the voice overs, contributing to the overall noir-feel to the story.Regardless of version, this film masterpiece is a must to experience.",9,1,3,9 August 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The long awaited showdown
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) is the final film in the series, and once again directed impressively by David Yates. The film was highly satisfying to watch, and is primarily concerned with the final and most important battle between good and evil; Harry and Voldemort.Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue to find the rest of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and as Harry discovers that one is at Hogwarts, they flee there, but Voldemort instantly finds out about their mission. The battle is drawn at Hogwarts as many people fight to protect Harry. As he realises that people are dying for his mistakes, he fights Voldemort for the last time. Along the way, crucial secrets are unravelled, and the mysterious, Deathly Hallows reappear.I actually really like how Dealthy Hallows is divided into two parts, as these are clearly the most slow-paced of all of the films. Where Part 1 is concerned with horcruxes, Part 2 pick off right at the same premise, but with an increased focus on the final battle.It is beautifully shot and overall realised by Yates, the cast, and all involved, and the way in which this film brings it all together in the final conclusion for me was something to behold. Apart from Azkaban, this is my favourite of the films.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Green Book," Excellent screen-writing makes a politically correct buddy film
","This film revolves around the social hierarchy of the 1960s, where we follow protagonist Dr. Shirley played by Mahershala Ali. Viggo Mortensen is his personal driver for his piano tour down south.There is a very well-made screenplay, complemented brilliantly by the excellent performances by Ali and Mortensen. I believe that Mortensen nailed it particularly as the bouncer type, and I would have loved to see him win the academy award for best actor in a leading role rather than seeing Ali win again for supporting.I must say that the script is very PC but it is still a great buddy film that I can highly recommended - a life-affirming film with a great message.",8,1,2,10 March 2019
Aladdin," Absolutely marvelous animation film
","'Aladdin' (1992) to me is one of Disney Motion Pictures' crowning achievements. First of all, the adapted screenplay is well written, and it has absolutely perfect pacing with interesting character introductions and arcs all around.Furthermore, the film looks absolutely gorgeous, filled with vibrant and warm colour palettes, beautiful portrayals of middle eastern culture milieus, and a stunning level of detail from the city of Agrabah.The cast is overall great in terms of voice acting (e.g. Jonathan Freeman's performance of Jafar), but the performance by Robin Williams stands out unparalleled as Genie. Williams' role absolutely dominates the experience as Genie, and his signature sense of impeccable humour is vividly sensed through his animated character. As a note, his Easter egg inclusion of Jack Nicholson hitting on a woman is pure improvisational magic.Overall, an excellent animation film from Disney, and deservedly the biggest film of 1992. Within the Disney Motion Picture range of films before Pixar, I think it is only bested by 1994's 'The Lion King'.",8,0,1,1 September 2019
Incredibles 2," Excellent animation with a predictable script
","I enjoyed watching 'Incredibles 2'.It boasted some of the best animation I have seen. It elegantly re-introduced the recognisable character arcs that we all loved from the first incredibles film.In particular, Jack-Jack and Dash ran away with the comedic gold, and I found the direction of these two characters to be brilliant.But the film lacks in its execution of the script, where the plot is uncomprehendingly predictable. A lot of beautiful effects and voice acting by the cast compensate for this but only to a limited degree.Still, I will recommend others to watch it for a night of fun.",7,2,2,17 March 2019
Goodfellas," A masterclass in nearly every aspect of filmmaking
","'Goodfellas' (1990), masterfully written by Nicholas Pileggi and equally impressively realised and directed by Martin Scorsese, is a definitive statement in filmmaking in terms of covering nearly all aspects of a film with perfection and milimetre precision in terms of its technical merits and exposition.The script is dense, humerous and bold, the direction by Scorsese is highly efficient and intelligent, the cast is absolutely impressive, with Pesci winning the film's only Academy Award for best supporting actor, but perhaps most impressive is the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, which broke new ground in cinema history with incredibly brilliant editing throughout.'Goodfellas' is indeed a timeless masterpiece, portraying the utterly dememted criminal underworld of the Italian mafia.Highly applauded and recommended!",9,0,0,1 December 2019
The Proposal," An excellent rom-com
","'The Proposal' (2009) directed by Anne Fletcher and starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is not my type of film genre. But I have to say, this is a well-crafted one within its genre's limits, such as a predictable plot and a forgiving script in terms of delivering a couple of goofy moments.In spite of all this, I enjoyed the film greatly, viewing it with my wife who wanted me to see it with her. First of, Bullock and Reynolds is a great dynamic duo, and particularly Reynolds was phenomenal in his way of delivering his humour.I thought that the script, albeit predictable, was intelligent and engaging, and the direction was nothing short of excellent for the genre, with great pacing and wonderful sets and production design.All in all, highly recommended for casual viewing.",8,1,2,6 January 2020
Beetlejuice," Life after death
","'Beetlejuice' (1988) directed by Tim Burton is a horror/comedy film about a couple who does in an accident only to find themselves as ghosts. I thought it had lots of charm and that it was a treat to watch as a Halloween special.I found the plot and story funny and entertaining, characters were charming, and the acting is terrific.But what set it apart was the impressive directional vision - the formidable set pieces, and the overall atmosphere created by Burton.Highly recommended for Halloween or a night of simple and excellent entertainment.",7,0,1,31 October 2019
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Joel Cohen's side step
","'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou' (2000) directed by Joel Cohen is visually stunning and boasts an intrestingly realised soundtrack, but ultimately suffers from general flaws and an unnatural script.From the opening credits, the film is clothed in style and colour. Apart from the brilliant cinematography shot by Roger Deakins (in a first for all-digital post-processing), I felt the film lacked in story, direction, and most profoundly, realistic dialogue from the actors, particularly Clooney.Overall, though, I consider it a decent film by general standards, but not by Cohen's usual levels - especially when compared to the masterpiece her created just two years befote - this is by no means among his finest work in my opinion.",6,1,1,20 October 2019
The Godfather," The one film I would bring to a desert island
","A unparalleled statement in cinema on almost all fronts.'The Godfather' (1972) is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written with and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of The Godfather, alias Don Corleone, and originally born Vito Andolini, he is the leader of the Corleone mafia family. As an ageing patriarch, Don Corleone wants his youngest son Michael to take over the family affairs, but he seems uninterested. From then on, the film centres on the increasing tensions between the Corleone and its rival mafia families in the search for power, integrity and honour.I first saw 'The Godfather' when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and that was truly when I fell in love with films. As a young boy, I could not attribute it to anything specific, but as I grew older, I realised that its grandeur was to be attributed to the numerous levels that Francis Ford Coppola excels at making the perfect film. From the formidable screenplay, to the precise direction, beautiful integration of the awesomely impressive cast (will there ever again be so much acting talent in one film), the perfect score by Nino Rota, the masterful cinematography by Gordon Willis, and the flawless editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner.To focus on perhaps the film's most impressive element, Brando. His pure artful talent shines through in an ever-immersive performance, where he inspired all of his juniors, including Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. His performance in 'The Godfather' perfectly exemplifies, why they and so many others of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Martin Sheen, the list goes on) hail Marlon Brando as the greatest in the history of the acting craft. He exemplifies how he was capable at portraying all human emotions with such depth and range, and he contributes to making this perfect film shining even more.The very definition of a seminal work and a masterpiece in cinema!",10,0,0,4 September 2019
