The Avengers," 'That's cool.'
","At the beginning of the film, when the first action scene came out, I was like, 'That's cool.' Then I realized it was the prologue to the film itself and thought, 'HO-LY SH1T! THAT WAS AN AWESOME INTRO!' Seriously guys, if you're thinking of going to see the film, you should slap yourself in the face for being unsure about whether or not you should go. This is hands down one of the best films of the year. If the quality of Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and Captain America had an threesome, this would be the result. I had lock jaw for about 30 minutes afterwards because throughout the whole movie I was in such awe that my mouth literally stayed open, seriously, I couldn't even chew my popcorn after 20 minutes of watching the movie. With that said, make sure you eat your snacks fast, cause after 20 minutes you'll be drooling so much you won't be able to eat.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
