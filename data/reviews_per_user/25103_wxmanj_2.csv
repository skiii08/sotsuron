Blade Runner 2049," Even not taking the original in to account...
","It was pretty but that's about it. Acting was nothing special the the story was week as well. Yes, I see how the tied it in but so what.?I'm actually ok with slow but I agree with others who thought it was too long. I als had periods where I was nodding off and had to struggle to stay awake and ya know that =...a not so great movie.I really hope they don't try to make another one because I just can't see where they would go from here. They shouldn't have done this one!",4,4,8,2 December 2018
Black Panther," It is rare occassion fro me to turn off a Movie
",I am now shocked at all the hype surrounding this movie. I found almost nothing to really like about it. It was also really predictable and tedious so....I turned it off and went to bed early and the next morning dropped it in the outgoing mail unfinished with no feelings of guilt.,3,2,4,21 June 2018
