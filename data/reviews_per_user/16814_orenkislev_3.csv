Hereditary," I think my life was better before watching this movie
","It's obvious that a lot of talent went into the making of this film. Unfortunately, none was spent during the writing of it. The storyline is, in lack of a better word, boring. Just plain awful. The movie is not scary. I wouldn't even consider it a horror film. There is some constant tension going on, which mostly manifests in a close-up of the character slowly turning back towards the camera, with rising violins playing in the soundtrack. And then... nothing happens. This repeats a number of times throughout the film. I was hoping for the first few times that this cinematic device was used that it would go somewhere. But it never did.While the acting is very good, ultimately there are not enough redeeming qualities to justify watching this film. It just doesn't work on any level.",1,2,7,22 July 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," another lame sequel
","sequel season 2003 continues, this time for a movie that was made 10 years ago. the plot remains the same: two 'terminator'-class machines are sent back from the future to the present time. one of them is sent to assassinate, and the other to protect. the targetted individuals again are unaware or do not accept their future importance, and the humor is on the same lines, including a reference to the famous Hasta La Vista from Terminator 2. As expected, the main attractions in this movie are the computer generated effects and the beautiful actresses (this time around the machine-sent terminator takes the form of the sexy Kristanna Loken). Nothing is surprising in this film, it takes the exact same things that made the first 2 movies a hit and jumbles them all back together into this bland product. Special effects are okay, nothing too exciting or innovative, and the plot is just dumb. If you hated the rest of the sequels this season (Matrix 2, Charlie's Angels 2, etc) you'll hate this one as well. don't waste your time/money - don't encourage the studios to make more crap.",6,0,0,9 July 2003
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Smug film with plenty of clever references, but overall not enjoyable
","Quentin Tarantino's style is almost overcrowding this film, which is not an easy task at 2h40m. You have your nod at the kong-fu film industry, Nazi and other post-WW2 film references, and of course plenty of Westerns from the period. There is sex, violence, a bit of comedy, and combinations of all 3.Overall, however, the movie seems like a string of unrelated events, clips and clever nods, without ever summing up to anything meaningful. The two main characters hang out, get drunk, get into a bit of trouble, but that's pretty much it. Maybe this is intentional, because that's how pop films were typically structured in the era? I'm not an expert on trashy 60s films, so I wouldn't know. Me and my friends were bored, and left the movie feeling like we wasted our time watching an episode of 'The way we were' about Hollywood's glorious 60s.If you're a big fan of the period, you might find all the allusions and nods fun to watch. For the average, non-neckbearded viewer, I don't think watching this would be much more than a weird experiment in recreating a dead genre, but with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DeCaprio (along with many other famous actors). Sorry, it's just not that great.",4,3,10,2 August 2019
