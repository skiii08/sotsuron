United 93," A very deceiving movie, trying to attack our feelings and smuggle the truth.
","I was shocked how the movie depict the FAA control rooms as bunch of people that have no clue and the military as bunch of guys that have no authority. In reality - as opposite to the movie - the east coast is guarded and there are all the time fighter jets in air. They not need to be scrambles, they was just routinely redirected each time a malfunction in the communication occur to intercept the plane. There is a known to pilots procedure about it. The fighter jet come up from left (where the first pilot sit) and wave by his wings. The airplane witch radio was given up, has to wave by their wings as well. Then the fighter jet lead it to nearby airport and the plane has to follow. If not, there is warning shots and then direct ones. But all that is unnecessary in Boeing 757 and 767 planes, witch can be remotely controlled by NORAD itself. They can shut off the pilot controls and even with his active resistance fly and land the plane alone. Of course that way omitted. Another problem is, that at 8:13 is the flight 11 known for not responding (flighters should be notified from NORAD to check this one out). At 8:14 the flight 11 goes off course - all red signals go on and fighters should have fly in afterburner now, because this is serious. Transponder of flight 11 stop working in 8:20. Then the plane is shown as red object - it is UFO (unidefined Flight Object) or more like a ENEMY in USA airspace - so one not need to search out all 4200 airplanes air borne to see exactly witch one is now enemy. It should be worth mentioning that no hijacked ever disabled transponder, as that for the military then mean - ENEMY airplane. And the last thing hijacker want is to mess with military armed fighters. There was another lie in the movie that scrambled F16 was unarmed. First at all, a F15 doing the job. And second - they are armed the moment they roll out of hangar. What the hell could be a military plane useful w/o arms...? But back to the time. 8:13 or 8:14 we got a hijacked plane. From 8:20 we got a ENEMY plane over the United States of America. And to the impact at 8:46 is long 26 minutes. Ever if the fighters aren't in air already, they from Otis Airbase can do it to Manhattan in just 7 minutes. Look at small the distance, and F15 can pull Mach 2,5 - do the math. And about the phone calls - mobile phones does not work in airliners. Try for yourself. The setback phones might have better chances, but why would American Airlines in 2004 make such adverts from their new cell stations? If setback or even mobile phones worked so well in 2001, why invest millions in such new technology? http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2004-07-19-aircells_x.htmAnd someone have the balls to his the viewers with such lie - come on, that is not good. I did not knew if I was to laugh or cry - it is a very disturbing how the lie could be presented as truth... Try something of this there: http://911timeline.net/",1,26,65,22 October 2006
The Mission," Simply church propaganda.
","The whole movie plot is about to show us, what good the church do, when it can. In reality, where the church go, there bring chaos, death and degradation of culture. A prime example could be all the crusades against Arabs/Muslims. At that time we should learn from them, rather that convert them to Christianity by sword and fire. These jesuits are presented as heroes, but into reality, they bring the destruction of the Indians by driving them from the jungle to homes, witch can be subject to attack and conquer by the 'settlers'. Back in Europe is was the jesuits, who started the chase on witches. So, given the general reality that any religion is just for control of people, I see these movie as unjust and very unfair church propaganda. Yes, there are individuals that tried to do good. But they can't overstep the shadow of their curse - their religion. Cristian religion (very interestingly founded by jews) is prime example of religion to divide and control the mankind. By proclamation of fake values it turning the real values to dust and bringing the degradation of culture altogether. The fall of Rome is nice example of early christians (jews?!) work. It is good to mention that when Rome fall, the 'holly lands' 'god promised' to jews are then free of Romans and fell into control of jews, so they had the motive too... Anyway, the movie play (mainly DeNiro) is excellent, however that won't overcome the propaganda in the plot...",1,12,50,4 July 2006
