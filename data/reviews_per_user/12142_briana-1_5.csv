United 93," as powerful as living through it was
","My college-age son convinced me to see this - i probably would have missed it otherwise. and this is a movie that should not be missed.it brought me back to sept 11 - with all the confusion & wondering that went on that day. i kept flashing back to when we were watching the events unfold live - one tower hit. 2nd tower hit. multiple planes hijacked? every plane grounded. the movie plays all these out with the same confusion by the 'experts' at the FAA & the military that we all felt.and the passengers. i expected this to be a 'Let's Roll!' series of events, but it was very - well - real. fear. confusion. 'give them what they want & they'll let us go.' calling home (which turned out to be the pivotal event for the passengers as they learned the fate of the WTC towers). then the quiet, can do, must do attitudes of the passengers. just as i would have hoped i would be able to have done.the ending - VERY POWERFUL. i can't stop thinking about it. i still get goosebumps.as they announced & promoted this film i thought - too close, somewhat exploitive, perhaps.boy was i wrong.go see this film.brian",9,0,2,1 May 2006
That Thing You Do!," fun, fun, fun
","this is just a fun movie.  and very well cast.  you find yourself rooting for the band the whole way through.and the soundtrack is EXCELLENT! as you watch it, look for the name of the bass player (the one who joins the marines).  check the credits at the end if you miss it.",9,0,0,31 January 2003
Elf," cute, enjoyable, fun movie for all
","disclaimer:  i love will farrell - and went into the movie w/this bias.Elf reminded me of most of the recent Adam Sandler movies - kinda weird guy, cute girl, silly situation all come together to make the audience laugh and feel good.  Elf does all that - and with the requisite # of memorable lines to be repeated after you're out of the theater (c'mon, don't you want to answer your phone 'Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?'?this is a movie that kids and adults will both love.  nice warm ending with the scene in the park (won't give any spoilers).  nice mix of characters.only bad point - james caan's transformation from the naughty list to the nice list happened too easily.",8,0,1,2 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," this is why i rarely watch movies when i've read the book
","a year ago, i came out of Fellowship desperately wanting more.this week i came out of Two Towers feeling empty.there were just too many changes from the books this time.  not just omissions (like the trip to bree/tom bombadil in Fellowship) or enhancements of character (Arwen in Fellowship), but complete changes of the story. parts were added that i'm sure jackson thought were necessary, but will only serve to alienate the Tolkien loyalists.
***  spoilers follow  ******i know they wanted to play up the arwen/aragorn romance and maybe even upgrade eowyn's crush on aragorn, but why add the scenes where aragon apparently dies?elves at helm's deep?where was the ent council?  as if merry & pippen could really trick the ents into battle.they completely changed the character of faramir and foolishly took frodo, sam & gollum to osgiliath.  faramir was to be the counterbalance to boromir, but looked like he was cut from the same cloth (yeah, i know, they're brothers).  maybe they're setting something up for Return of the King, but Tolkien did just fine with all that.would have preferred they cut the new scenes and taken the movie as far as the 2nd book does - including cirith ungol & shelob and gandalf facing saruman at isengard.  presumably these will be the beginnings of Return of the King.i was also expecting a flashback to lorien and the giving of the gifts by galadriel.********not that this was a BAD movie or anything.  maybe by design it would be the hardest to fall in love with.  Fellowship had the advantage of developing most of the main characters.  Return will have the advantage of the climax(es).  TT was stuck in the middle without either.  Jackson further burdened it with the story changes.i loved gollum (most of the time).  i loved the internal debate between slinker and stinker.  i liked the humor they added with gimli (except the dwarf tossing reference...it worked in Fellowship but seemed forced in TT). the battle scenes were good.  i liked the physical transformation of theoden after grima had been sent away.i gave the movie a 6 because of the changes they made.  maybe not a true rating of the movie itself, but a story this well known must be judged against the book it came from.",6,0,0,23 December 2002
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," too many plots. didn't hang together
","i went in with high hopes - maybe that was the movie's downfall. in a nutshell, the movie had too many plot lines (the best friend plot, the new rival plot, the obnoxious kids plot, the prodigal dad plot,...) and they were not strung together in a sensible way. it seemed like they just jumped from gag to gag. the rivalry with the French Driver ('formula un') was completely unsatisfying. one race, then the crash. then occasional references to 'french can drive' during Ferrel's rehab. This movie would have done better with less going on, but more of it.btw, the movie had several funny bits, but you've seen most of them in the trailers already. but if you do go, stick through the credits for the outtakes, which were pretty good.b",3,16,30,10 August 2006
