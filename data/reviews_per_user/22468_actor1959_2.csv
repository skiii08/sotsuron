The New World," Film as Poetry
","The New World is the closest thing to film as poetry that I have seen in a long time. While some may find the length and lack of traditional dialogue off putting I feel that is what has turned this stunningly photographed motion picture into a visual poem. Malick has fashioned one visual feast after another using the wilds of Virginia and the civilization of England. We see the world through Nothing/Rebecca's eyes, all wondrous and expansive and the greatest gift she gives to Smith is the ability to appreciate the new world in which he has landed. While in the battle between the Native Americans and the English more colonist die than were actually in residence at the time, Malick can be forgiven for this one foray into Hollywood land type film-making. I do think that some judicious cutting might have made the film stronger but with visuals like this the choice of what to cut and what to leave in must have been excruciating.

Brokeback Mountain," Just a Damn Good Movie
","Truly, this is not just a 'gay cowboy film', it is for anyone who had not followed their heart in life. It is a truly thought provoking, allegorical tale.

When I saw the film in suburban Virginia the theatre was packed and not with just a gay friendly audience but with folks of all stripes and it affected everyone that I was sitting near. Ang Lee yet again gives us a film that is thoughtfully made and strikingly told.",10,8,11,1 January 2006
