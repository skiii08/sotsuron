It," More then just a horror movie.
",Every once in a while a horror movie comes out which actually got me more interested and invested in the characters more than the actual horror. Each one of this child predominate cast receives there own show time in this movie so you get more invested and become hooked to what you are watching. Unlike the first IT this movie is graphic and isn't afraid to show kids getting murdered which is kind of refreshing as in most movies they are usually put in a shell made of titanium and nothing can even get close to hurting them. In summary this movie was a masterpiece which will become a classic and deserves it.,10,1,3,4 November 2017
