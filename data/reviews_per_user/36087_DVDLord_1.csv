Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lives Up To The Originals
","I went in with low expectations and I left in complete awe and amazement. This is definitely the movie of the decade. The effects were astounding and the computer generated images were 'appropriate', unlike those in The Special Editions. The Phantom Menace is great and it will blow Titanic out the water (again).",10,0,1,19 May 1999
