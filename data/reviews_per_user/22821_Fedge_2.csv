The Blair Witch Project," This movie is more than a movie, it's an experience.
","I found this 'horror' movie to be more creepy than anything else.  It's all about what you hear but can't quite see, and that's it's power.  It never goes to far to become silly and yet it contains several comedic moments. Moments you almost feel bad about laughing at considering the trauma the cast is going through.  The story is of three students making a documentary of the Blair Witch, who disappear in the woods.  The only evidence of their expedition being video tape and film footage found over a year later.  This is well made one of a kind movie that leaves you talking about it for days. Go see it with several friends.  As I left the theater the only talk from anyone was, 'Was that really real?'",8,1,2,18 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Saving the Movie Industry
","In a summer full of movies based on special effects and not scripts, Saving Private Ryan raises from the ashes to prove that great movies are still being made.  Even if they are few are far between.  Spielberg shows us all that he is still master of his craft.  In a post-Titanic wake, Hollywood was in desperate need of such a film.  Saving Private Ryan is by far the best movie you will see in 1998.",10,0,0,21 September 1998
