Ford v Ferrari," The Winning Race
","This movie was spectacular. I felt every minute of it and every event really matters. It rarely drags but mostly the storytelling is unique and entertaining.
Bale gives a great performance, better than last year in Vice. Damon makes the movie feel real, and the chemistry between them is so brother-like. Jon Bernthal makes a great addition to the cast and makes his scenes quite intense.
The editing and sound are astonishing because it gives us the realistic feeling of racing. Cinematography is life-like and it makes cars easy to follow, I won't even start with the color grading...
I thought that soundtrack could be used better, it didn't hit all the notes for me, but it wasn't bad.If you're a car enthusiast, it's a must watch, if you're an average consumer, it's a great movie to finish a day with, or even a week.",9,3,4,8 December 2019
Knives Out," Smart and Witty
","The film kept on getting more interesting from scene to scene. The tension never dies, but the atmosphere was comedic at the same time. It was a strange combination that worked really well.
The film had one of the best casts of 2019. Everyone was at their best, especially Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas who stood out the most. The music was pretty standard for the 'who done it?' type of film. The sound effects were astonishing and kept me on the edge. The director did a great job at portraying a story that wasn't told before. The cinematography was okey. Most importantly I loved the small hints the film gave us throughout the story and connected the bits by the end.
If you want to be entertained for more than 2 hours... YES, go and see it!",9,1,4,14 December 2019
1917," Epic
","One of the reasons I watched the movie was because of the Golden Globe win and the interesting camera work, but I witnesed something really special.The outstanding cinematography brings to life the WW1 battlefield and it feels so real and 'magical' at the same. The amount of months that were invested in this piece is impressive. The main characters did a great job, the only thing I noticed was that there wasn't much to their background, it was just kind of a mediocre character built honestly. Roger Deakins deserves an Oscar nomination for the camera work and so does Thomas Newman, for the soundtrack. The music is very memorable and melodic. There are scenes conducted by Sam Mendes that make all the film departments work together and those are one of the most satisfying scenes I have seen in a decade.It's a great film to end the year with. If you are intersted in history and love a good piece of drama, then I highly recommend it. The tension is real!",9,0,1,11 January 2020
