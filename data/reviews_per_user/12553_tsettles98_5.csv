Sucker Punch," All beautiful imagery and awesome action!..... Until the ending.
",Anyone can disagree with me on this but here's how the experience was for me in the movie.Beginning to middle was pure beautiful action sequences. Some of the images I saw in these fighting sequences won't be forgotten. Instant classic! And that's just the chicks! The action (fighting) sequences were badass! An awesome scene when Babydoll fights the samurai robots was amazing and is the greatest fight scene I've ever seen!Then the ending came. The entire end sequence from Blue blowing Amber and Blondie's heads off to Sweet Pea getting away while Babydoll gets her lobotomy just made me kinda depressed and freaked out. That whole sequence was somehow disturbing. I don't know how but it just was. Revealing this film to be a dark action film.I loved it!,8,3,11,27 March 2011
The Fast and the Furious," Pure Adrenaline!
","THE best of TFATF movies. As all first-movie-in-a-franchise movies are.This one was the pure adrenaline rush that is Rob Cohen, the director. The first movie of Rob's that I saw was xXx and that was amazing! I loved that movie. Of course I mostly love all brainless high octane action flicks.But, there is something else about this film that makes me love it beyond my own comprehension. Maybe it's the heart and the whole leave-no-man-behind theme that rocks around throughout this film, especially in the last half-hour.Most people only don't like this movie because of it's absence of a plot. I agree. There isn't much of a plot here, and if there was, it's all over the place.But who needs a plot in a movie that is meant to be just a movie to hold your attention. And that's exactly what it does! 8 out of 10.",8,6,7,30 March 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," The most beautiful film ever made... In my opinion.
","The main reason why this is such a great movie is because how far Matt Damon's character is willing to go to be with the love of his life, Emily Blunt's character. The acting in this movie is also amazing. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's chemistry was great and needed to be great to make the film make sense. Terrence Stamp's big monologue scene was awesome and literate, making George Nolfi officially one of my favorite writers of all time (along with Aaron Sorkin and Ehren Kruger and some others). Anthony Mackie needs to be in more movies, proved his acting is great.There's also the cool thing that this movie is the most non-violent thriller film ever made! There are no guns even shown in this film! That is new! The only violent parts that I recall are two punches and one scene where Matt Damon trips violently. That's it! The rest of the movies is just big bad-ass chase sequences.It's a romance movie too that is tied in with an extremely cool and original sci-fi concept written by the greatest sci-fi author of all time in the 50's, Philip K. Dick. I plan to read the short story soon, and from all the bad comments (which amaze me!) must be completely different from this movie. Maybe there's no romance or something. I personally thought that it made the film more intriguing and it fit well. I liked it.This is the date movie of the year! (Avoid Beastly) And, it is a date movie that girls AND guys will like. That almost never happens! The last time I saw that was in The Fountain.Okay, I take back what I said in the summary. The Fountain is the most beautiful film ever made. This holds a close second, though.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The best movie of the year so far!",10,0,2,1 April 2011
Limitless," wow! What a great movie!
","I have wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the first trailer pop up on my home screen for the IMDb app. The trailer made it look amazing and I saw that it was based off of a book. I read the book and absolutely loved it and I decided that the movie was a shoe-in. I saw it on opening day just a few minutes ago and it was just amazing!Basically the movie starts off with our main guy, Eddie (Bradley Cooper), about to jump from the building but chooses not to and goes on to tell us his story. He meets up with an ex-brother-in-law who gives him a small pill that allows him to access the rest of his brain in a matter of minutes. Usually it takes us a while to try to remember something that happened to us twenty years ago. With this pill, he can remember that stuff instantly!But soon his dealer is killed by hit men who wanted the drug (entitled NZT-48). He finds the stash and uses it in the stock market and gets 2 million dollars. This brings in a man named Carl Van Loon who hires Eddie as his associate. It's funny because Robert De Niro's character isn't even the main bad guy. It's some Russian dude who wants Eddie's NZT. But, of course, there are side-effects. After he becomes behind on his dosage, his brain begins to skip time and he can't remember what just happened to him. He later gives a chick a very bad disease that kills her and he hadn't even remembered well enough to tell his very qualified lawyer who was to help him in this case. His stash begins to dwindle so the whole dosage side affect issue becomes a problem, especially with the very dangerous Russian wanting it. He then finds his pills are stolen. He discovers that his lawyer stole them to find out what happened to the chick. We then finally come back to him about to jump. The Russian breaks in and tries to kill him. Although Eddie manages to kill him instead. Earlier, the Russian mentioned to Eddie that he liquefied it so he could shoot it instead. When Eddie kills him, the blood is the only thing he can use to beat the hit men and get out of there. He drinks it and goes to a man who could help him get to the man who took his stash. He gets it.The happy ending is that he used scientists to help him 'tweak' the NZT so that it won't cause side-effects and he won't need to take it so often. This was a great movie that was very fast paced, yet somehow slow paced at the same time, since it had felt much longer than 1hour and 45minutes. The ending was very quick and abrupt making it hard to recall, as were some of the other twists, but I still managed to figure it out by paying close attention. Overall, this is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone but young kids who'd be confused throughout the whole thing. Great movie.5 out of 5. 9 out of 10. See it.",8,0,4,18 March 2011
Fast Five," Summer truly has begun!
","Summer begins April 29.And yes, yes it did.This movie was friggin' awesome! I thought Fast & Furious was the best of the franchise, but Fast Five has completely blown all of its predecessors out of the water! Despite it completely breaking all laws of physics (especially including a scene where a small muscle car manges to trip a bus over) the movie was awesome. This makes a Fast and the Furious movie worth watching! Being a huge fan, I loved this movie to death.Never has a movie made me sweat in the theater seat and pump me full of so much adrenaline that I almost peed my pants.They drive a SAFE through the STREET!The other awesome part of this film is that it's a Fast and the Furious movie with a story and more depth to the characters. The previous movies were meant solely for their action and this one does that, too... Plus some more!I got the honorable pleasure to see this pulse pounding film in IMAX and it was worth every cent. I suggest that, for the full effect, you see it in IMAX as well. This is the pure testosterone of 2011. 2010 had The Expendables and 2008 had Rambo, now Sylvester has met his match, and his name is Justin Lin.",8,0,2,30 April 2011
