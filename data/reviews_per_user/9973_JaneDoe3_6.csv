The Blair Witch Project," Excellent
","The filmmakers painted themselves into an intriguing but quite confining premise, having to abide by certain rules in order to succeed:  The cast must be isolated and not allowed to escape, there must be a reason why these people would continue to record footage even after they've gone insane with fear, and there can't be any definitive resolution with regards to the antagonist. Despite having all these limitations to abide by, the film works.The directors cover their bases with a few obligatory yet adequate explanations. No, it won't 'scare the hell out of you' as some have claimed. The day scenes are basically 'MTV's Real World Gets Lost in the Woods', as we watch our protagonists slowly start to dissolve into panic and then madness. The suspense arrives in the night scenes, where the danger is unknown and unseen.  Watching (or often merely listening to) the events from the actor's POV makes for quite a powerful experience. The grainy, shaky footage adds an important element of mock authenticity. The performances are mostly solid all around, especially from Williams. Donohue does a good job of playing melodramatic during the so-called 'documentary' sequences, making her 'normal' performance seem that much more natural. Very effective.Because this scenario is portrayed so realistically, a large segment of the audience seems to disallow the usual generosity normally given to a film's artistic license.  Bruce Willis would never survive a fall from the top of an exploding skyscraper, of course, but we have to ignore that discrepancy in order to further the experience. It is a movie, after all.  And even though BLAIR WITCH is supposed to be 'real', we have to give it the same amount of latitude.  Sure there are a few holes to contend with (why don't they just go to a stream and follow it?), and there's a little bit of overacting from Donohue towards the end. But the bottom line is that, aside from a few minor flaws, the limited concept could not have been executed any better.",9,1,2,17 August 1999
Fight Club," Disappointing third act
","The first and second acts are amazing. So good, in fact, that they almost make up for the misguided wrong-turn the film takes later on. Go see it and judge for yourself. NOTE: THIS ANALYSIS CONTAINS SPOILERS.The first two thirds of the film are breathtaking - elegantly written voiceover, dark yet hilarious exposition, well-drawn characters, and beautiful directing. Not only does Fincher know how to convey the perfect tone of the film, but also every frame is like a wonderfully crafted piece of art. Why can't all directors be like David Fincher?
You can't fault him with the film's wrong turn. That blame lies with the script. What we have are two separate concepts: 1) Tyler and Jack fight to experience life, prompting a whole group of disenfranchised men to join up with them. Tyler becomes a hero to the men, utilizing them as his personal army of revenge against all that is wrong with society.  But Tyler starts to go too far, and Jack must stop him.2) Jack discovers that 'Tyler' is his other personality. Through 'Tyler' Jack has achieved hero status to practically an entire generation of young men. But the 'Tyler' part of his personality has laid plans for a massive act of destruction, and Jack is unable stop 'himself' from committing this act. Both are great concepts, but they don't work together. The reason other men join the fight club is because they see Tyler and Jack FIGHTING. This is the entire basis of the concept. But Tyler and Jack are the same person, right? So are the men watching Jack beat himself up? Seeing a man punch himself might incite a few laughs, but it would hardly prompt a group of men to join a radical and violent organization and regard this man as their leader. Is this nitpicking? Am I wrong?The film would have been better off keeping the whole Tyler/Jack thing as subtext. Instead we get an ending in which Jack shoots himself in the head, causing 'Tyler''s death. But then Jack survives, and yet 'Tyler' is still dead? Huh? Are we supposed to put any kind of emotional stake in these confusing events? The whole thing ends up ruining what could've been an otherwise near-perfect film.",Null,0,1,20 October 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Don't believe the hype! This film is not for mainstream audiences.
","If you are not a fan of the books or you are not into the whole Dungeons and Dragons fantasy-type genre, then stay away from this movie. While it may be technically stunning, LORD OF THE RINGS is also an overlong and maudlin chore to sit through. Don't succumb to the impression that LORD OF THE RINGS will be similar to STAR WARS. Yes, both films are cornball fantasies. But that is where the parallels end. STAR WARS had fun characters and an entertaining, high-stakes storyline. LORD OF THE RINGS has no character development. Characters come and go with no adequate introduction or indication of significance. The plot is minimal - it's basically a road trip. The protagonist and his cohorts travel from one location to another, all the while being pursued by monsters that get progressively larger. A number of scenes could have been cut entirely, but assumedly exist because of their presence in the book. And while it IS set in a fantasy world, there are still numerous inconsistencies (the biggest one - the entire `plot' is weighted by the fact that if this magical ring gets into the wrong hands, it will destroy mankind. And yet, during the prologue, when the ultimate bad guy has possession of the ring, it doesn't prevent him from being killed. Apparently the ring gives you super powers...but only some of the time.) The filmmakers did as best they could under the circumstances. They had to stay faithful to the book so as not to raise the ire of fans. As such, they produced a 3-hour epic (that's right - 3 hours!) aimed squarely at the Tolkien enthusiasts. Judging from the reviews on this site, they seem to enjoy it. You will not.",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
American Psycho," Pretty much a one-dimensional character study, AMERICAN PSYCHO falters in the third act.
","AMERICAN PSYCHO follows the tale of a psychotic serial killer who tries hard (extremely hard  Bale's performance is near perfection) to succeed in a corporate society. But soon this phony world he despises, and uses merely as a cover to his murderous exploits, begins to envelope Patrick, and he finds himself trapped in a torturous façade of his own creation. Enough to sustain an hour and a half? Nope.PSYCHO presents a unique narrative structure, but it doesn't work. If this were a `Hollywood' movie, the first two acts would be devoted to how and why Bateman entered this cutthroat yuppie world and how he began to succeed, despite his reprehensible motives. But instead, the movie begins with Bateman already a success. We find him nearing the downward slope of his relationship with this phony world. As such, the movie really has nowhere to go and nowhere to take us. The damn thing is over before it begins.By the third act, we're begging for a payoff and nothing substantial arrives. The denouement is too subtle for just having spent an hour and a half invested in this thing. Mary Harron's stylish and confident directing coupled with Bale's exceptional performance provide for a few stimulating scenes, but only goes so far.",Null,0,0,5 October 2000
Velvet Goldmine," Unique style, not much on narrative
","Impressive opening act -  visually stunning with a very unique directing style from Haynes. But these elements can only persist for so long, and about midway the 'Citizen Kane'-type structure begins to wane. There's no predominant narrative driving the film and frankly, it starts to get boring. One could leave after the first half and feel confident they haven't missed anything of substance. It would be interesting to see what Haynes could do with somebody else's script. He certainly knows how to direct; now all he needs is a solid story.McGregor's confident turn as Curt (Iggy Pop) is fantastic.",Null,1,1,13 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Boring, boring, boring
","The only reason people like this film is because of the name 'Kubrick'. If this came from an unknown filmmaker, people would be calling it pretentious, self-indulgent, boring, and pointless. There's no way anyone would get past that ridiculous orgy party without rolling their eyes. But since it's from the untouchable 'Kubrick', it's a work of genius. Well, sure it's boring, but that's Kubrick. Yeah, the pace is mind-numbingly slow but Kubrick can do no wrong!Yes, the film is photographed beautifully. Gorgeous set design. The camerawork is steady. OK...that's all dandy.What about the story? Is that not an intregal part of the movie experience? Who cares, right? For nearly three hours we're treated to Tom Cruise walking around the streets of what's supposed to be New York, encountering all kinds of unrelated people and circumstances. Yawn. Finally there's a lackluster wrap-up at the end which is supposed to explain everything. By that point we're so bored it doesn't even matter.And every scene goes on way too long. There's a scene near the beginning where Kidman and Cruise smoke pot and get in an argument. It takes Kidman about ten minutes to speak three or four sentences. Everything is: 'And...(super dramatic pause)...I had....(longer pause)...a...(pauses, closes her eyes)....dream...' Get to the bloody point, woman! She's the worst offender, but almost every conversation in the movie is like this. And this is for almost three hours! It's very frustrating.What amazed me was the audience reaction to the film. I've heard nothing but praise. (Of course I live in L.A., where every young assistant and gopher is a Kubrick wannabe) Look, Kubrick was a great director. DR. STRANGELOVE, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET are some of my favorite films of all time. But the man is not God. He is not beyond a poor film. And that's what we got with EYES WIDE SHUT.",3,0,2,19 July 1999
