The Blair Witch Project," Potentially scary film ends up annoying viewers, not frightening them
","I did not see the fake documentary on TV that was shown before the movie was exhibited in theaters, so I went on what I had read about it.It seemed to have some real potential, but there was a pitfall built in from the beginning: The reported determination of the producers not to show any monsters or maniacs; nothing that the three students couldn't have filmed themselves. This might have been an interesting concept, but it just does not work in the actual movie. I found it really annoying that not once in the entire film does anyone, either townspeople or students, say anything remotely serious or believable about the alleged Blair Witch. The closest it gets to that is when a man is being interviewed and he recounts the true story of the hermit who had murdered some children right at the start of World War Two. But even this seemingly promising thread goes nowhere, as it's never connected to the Blair Witch. Heather stands before a couple of locations, including a cemetery and Coffin Rock, and makes dramatic pronouncements about what happened at these places,without ever giving us a clue as to what she's referring to.The one eerie part that might have really worked up to a genuinely frightening conclusion was the disappearance of the one student, body parts being found, and terrible screams and then his voice calling to the other two for help. I toyed with the idea that a possible explanation is that he went crazy and ran off, hid out, and then murdered the other two. But we are never given any kind of real explanation for the ending. One can only assume that the remaining two students are about to be killed by someone or something, but we have no idea who or what it might be. The audience needs to be shown something, however small or insignificant it might seem. Val Lewton understood this with his RKO Studios horror pictures of the Forties. He and his crew used sounds and shadows and darkness to scare the audience by suggesting something evil was lurking nearby, or something terrible was about to happen.The Lewton pictures show just enough, without overdoing it. Best example: The Leopard Man, 1943. In a small town where an escaped leopard is prowling, a young girl has to go out alone in the dark of night to the store. She has to pass under a railroad bridge. As she starts forward fearfully into the blackness, two glowing eyes stare at her from high up and then disappear. The audience wonders if we actually saw something. A train suddenly hurtles overhead with a terrifying noise and flash of light. As we recover from this fright, there is a closeup of the roaring panther as it attacks the girl! She runs home screaming and begs to be let in, but her mother refuses to open the door. Terrible growls and screams are heard and then a pool of blood slowly puddles under the door. Now, THAT is scaring the audience with very little! There is more fright in five minutes of that film than all tedious 87 minutes of The Blair Witch Project. If only the producers had put one tenth of the imagination into the actual movie as the marketing campaign, they might have really given us a memorable horror film. As it is, The Blair Witch Project is basically nothing more than a clever idea, badly realized.",3,1,3,22 October 2006
Vertigo," A detective hired to watch over a suicidal woman falls in love with her and gets involved in an eerie, baffling mystery.
","Many viewers consider this film to be Hitchcock's masterpiece. I agree, due to a number of factors. The hypnotic, lush score by Bernard Herrman combines with the superb set design and cinematography to create an unforgettable atmosphere of strangeness and uncanny beauty. The performances are all excellent, with Kim Novak's dual role convincingly creating two completely different characters. The most outstanding,and at the same time most problematic aspect of the story is the character of Scottie. James Stewart is so convincing as the obsessed hero that he actually becomes uncomfortable to watch. His likable, easy-going character at the beginning has become a driven, compulsive,perhaps even seriously disturbed man by the end. He has suffered a mental breakdown and is terribly vulnerable, but our initial sympathy,though still felt for this flawed hero, has become strained and awkward. Stewart's performance is a triumph of screen acting, yet so powerful as to risk overwhelming the audience with conflicting feelings. Any actor who can create such a genuinely disturbing and yet basically appealing character deserves high praise indeed.",10,2,3,15 October 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," Post war courtroom drama still challenging and powerful today
","I've seen this film many times, and it still can affect me powerfully,with small, previously unnoticed details of performances and direction. Spencer Tracy has the job of carrying most of the movie, aided by strong performances from the other actors. Most of the story line is seen through his eyes, with frequent opportunities for ordinary Germans to try to explain that, as Marlene Dietrich's widow tells the judge, ' we are not all monsters.' Judge Haywood studies the writings of defendant Jannings in a serious effort to understand the man on trial, who seems apart from his unrepentant colleagues.Maximilian Schell, as the German advocate for Jannings, gets equal time with the impassioned, righteously angry prosecutor Richard Widmark. It would have been easy to let this character become a one dimensional villain, but Schell achieves the difficult task of showing Herr Rolfe not as a Nazi apologist, but a patriotic German trying to clear his country's name, and doing the best he can in a very difficult position.All of the cast are excellent, with particularly fine performances from Montgomery Clift, Dietrich and Judy Garland. The writing is taut and disturbingly effective, in showing the ruins of a once civilized nation trying to rebuild itself ,while haunted by war guilt and the shame of defeat. The only weakness is an occasional tendency to get a little too preachy, or some scenes perhaps being a little too neatly dramatic, with the result that the movie is a little stagy at times. But its strengths far outweigh any minor faults.Perhaps one sequence might best sum up the historical reality, in a small but brilliant scene. Judge Haywood is shown attempting to maintain order, apply justice fairly, and combat his own prejudices, as well as those of many other Americans. He has befriended the widow of a German general, and they are having a quiet drink in a tavern, when the crowd of revelers breaks into a cheerful old folk song, sung with great gusto by all present. Haywood looks around the room at the merry making Germans and his face tightens into an appraising frown.He clearly is thinking that the people are a little too eager to put the war and its memories behind them. It is an extremely powerful moment in a very dramatic film.Highly recommended as both history and a compelling courtroom drama, with some unforgettable performances by a great cast.",9,6,8,21 December 2006
Twilight," Liked it a lot more than I anticipated
","I am a 55 year old guy without any kids, so my knowledge of what teenagers are reading is pretty limited. I only heard of Twilight a few months ago, and was intrigued, since I've always been a horror movie fan, from my own teenage years.I went without a lot of expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. The two young leads were very believable in their odd romance, and the whole rainy, fog drenched Pacific Coast setting was beautiful to see. I found the pacing and editing good, the effects adequate and the acting pretty good throughout. I especially liked the hyper teen friends and the strong but silent police chief father, who seemed so natural in his interactions with his growing daughter, almost a stranger to him.There are some really great comic moments and funny lines, that I cannot quote without giving away plot points, so all I'll say is to pay attention to the dialog and you'll hear some really unexpectedly hilarious lines. The sequence where a nervous Bella meets Edward's family for the first time is priceless.The movie is highly romantic and should please fans of supernatural love stories. It is first and foremost a love story, not a horror film, and should be seen in that light.Give this movie a chance, and you might be surprised by how entertaining it is.",8,3,10,23 November 2008
Mulholland Drive," Sad, strange mystery about heartbreak and loss
","I have read literally dozens of differing views as to what this story is really about, and the significance of various details. Without recapping the plot at length, it tells the apparently simple story of an eager young aspiring actress arriving in Hollywood, hoping to find stardom, and getting drawn into a baffling and eerie mystery. There are many typically odd David Lynch touches and peculiar characters, events ,the meaning of which is unclear, and dialogue that can best be described as unenlightening. SPOILERS AHEAD: The core of the movie is Naomi Watts' character Betty/Diane, and her performance is simply overwhelming. I have seldom been as moved as during two scenes with her lover Rita/Camilla ,played by the stunning Laura Elena Harring. The first is the tender and sensuous love scene ,that shows the desire, hesitation and hope of someone desperately in love with someone who may not fully return that love. The yearning for love and acceptance is tangible in that scene, and is breathtaking in its simple beauty. The other great scene with the two ill fated lovers is their witnessing of the heartrending solo by the female vocalist at the strange nightclub Silencio. As the two women begin to weep at the impassioned song of sorrow and loss, and the realization that their own doomed relationship is at an end, many viewers will find themselves shedding tears as well. It is an overpowering scene of the pain of lost love, and the end of a dream. It's almost too much for the viewer to bear, so much have we come to care about these two women. It's the spooky visuals and strange, unsettling characters that the movie is best known for, but at the very heart of the movie is this theme of love and loss, and that is what gives it its power to hold the audience in its strange spell.",9,3,5,6 November 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Strange, sad movie about friendship, aging, love and betrayal
","This movie has a haunting quality that makes it literally unforgettable. I've seen it twice now; once several years ago on television in a heavily edited version, and recently in the full director's cut, nearly four hour version.It's a flawed, difficult movie, that's often hard to follow, but it will reward the viewer's patience eventually with a compelling, perhaps even tragic story. It's not quite like any other movie I can recall; certainly not a conventional gangster movie. There's something terribly poignant about seeing Robert DeNiro as the aging gangster who has returned after years in exile to find out what happened to his childhood friends. His performance is beautifully complemented by Ennio Morricone's lovely score. The child actors are very convincing in their roles and the sense of various periods and changing times is well captured by the art direction and cinematography. It is an unusual kind of role for James Woods, whose character remains an enigma to the end.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but those viewers with the patience to stay with it will find it a fascinating experience that lingers long after the end of the film.",6,0,5,25 May 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Mia Farrow is magnificent in unsettling film that mixes comedy and horror
","I was too young to see this movie when it was first shown, and I was not impressed when I finally saw it after a few years had gone by. But having seen it four or five times now, I actually believe it improves with age. It is subtle and low key, and quite slow paced by today's standards. There is far more genuinely horrifying action in Polanski's other Sixties classic Repulsion, which leads me to believe that Rosemary's Baby may actually be viewed better as a black comedy than a true horror film. Many viewers have commented on the light hearted opening, that seems almost like a typical Sixties romantic comedy. The gradual darkening of the story is so subtly done that it's almost imperceptible. A vague feeling of unease, with little in the way of overt violence or horror, starts to permeate the film. There is enough ambiguity in the way events unfold that it's possible to see Rosemary as becoming disconnected from reality and imagining a plot against her. The eccentric neighbors may be no more than a nosy but well meaning old couple, her husband's unexpected success due to the accidental misfortune of a competitor for an important part, the tragic death of a young woman a genuine suicide. Is there any actual proof that these things are more than mere coincidences? Mia Farrow's brilliant performance makes us experience these doubts and fears along with her.The film is very much a product of its time, the late Sixties. It touched on many ideas and events of a world increasingly chaotic and tumultuous, in ways that audiences born since that era could not relate to without direct experience. It was made at a time in which the Vietnam war was starting to become more controversial, the sexual revolution had begun, but the women's movement and legalized abortion were still in the future, along with anti-war riots and the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. It occupies a place in history as a sort of time capsule of the era, just as momentous and overwhelming changes were in the offing. The ' God is dead' controversy that forms much of the background of the story must seem almost quaint to viewers today, but was a major aspect of the film's controversy. Viewers expecting a shocking and horrific experience will probably be disappointed, but those who can appreciate a slow building, quietly unnerving film will find much to enjoy here. Much is left to the imagination, and it requires active involvement on the viewer's part. It may require patience for those accustomed to more visceral and fast paced movies, but it is well worth taking the time to appreciate.",9,1,2,13 February 2008
Halloween," Killer plays deadly tricks on All Hallows Eve
","I saw this movie several months after it had been on its first run in theaters. On the way home, I kept looking back over my shoulder as I walked down a very long, dark street similar to the ones that Michael Myers stalks in the movie. I knew logically that there wouldn't be a maniac in a white mask following me, but the impact of the movie was strong enough to cause that kind of fear, however unrealistic. I think this movie is a modern classic, even if flawed. There are plenty of holes in the plot and unexplained details and down right impossibilities, but I think you have to see it not so literally to enjoy it. I think that Jamie Lee Curtis makes an astonishing debut here, having to carry a great part of the movie. I told friends at the time that it was clear she was a young actress headed for bigger things. There are good, strong performances from Donald Pleasence as the doctor and Charles Cyphers as the sheriff, and the teenage girls and their boyfriends are realistic and appealing. In fact, I think that's a lot of what gives the film its power to terrorize even after repeated viewings: Carpenter makes us care about these young people and get to know them SPOILERS AHEAD: before they are brutally killed, and the powerful sense of loss is overwhelming when Laurie discovers the bodies of all three of her friends displayed as a ghastly Halloween joke. There is a real feeling of the grief and shock felt by Laurie, followed by genuine terror as she realizes the killer is coming after her next. Carpenter is very effective at capturing that feeling of fun and excitement, mixed with the possibility of actual danger, that many of us can recall from our own childhood trick or treating adventures. One of the most unsettling aspects of the movie, that helps to make it really creepy, is the realization that all of his dreadful actions are clearly seen as 'fun' by Michael Myers, including the theft of his sister's gravestone and dressing up in a ghost sheet and his latest victim's eyeglasses before killing his next victim. The fact of his inscrutable silence and that we have little, if any ,clue as to what makes him do what he does is seen as a weakness by many viewers, but others feel that his very inexplicability and apparently random attacks on people he doesn't know is what makes the movie so frightening. Perhaps Dr. Loomis is right when he argues with the nurse at the beginning and she objects to his use of the word ' it' to describe Michael Myers, and when he later tells the sheriff ' This isn't a man.' Who or whatever he may be, Michael Myers occupies a special place in the pantheon of movie villains, and Halloween remains a tight, spooky little thriller that has lost little of its power to scare viewers over the years.",9,1,2,24 October 2006
