Blade Runner 2049," Engage your neuronal connection
","Hard to say a word after such a piece of anthology, moreover completely deserving its precedent of 1982. We take up very quickly with this disastrous universe along with its hunter and the landscape crashes up very fast.In fact, Blade Runner 2049 renews its own kind and realizes an exploit there that we perceive very rarely nowadays, and even in the pseudo cinema 'independent'. Just let us indicate his completely credible futuristic atmosphere.In brief, finally there is an elitist movie non-reserved for the uncultivated negativism of the average moron who goes cheerfully by listening to only what he wants to hear or understand. The best to do is to shut up and thus I keep silent humbly!In my opinion, this full-length film supports hardly the lukewarmth and its new very sensible narrative fetches far its influences - so much moreover in the work of Philip K. Dick that in other much less popular arts.My note is 8/10 because I viewed this movie in the theater [1] of Pathé in the suburb of Paris, France and there was there during the action a violent icy and cold wind as to add to it to the movie realism. Or then maybe it was my memory implant, but it was just a little too much borderline to the side plot.",8,0,5,28 October 2017
Rush," VroooooOOOOOOOOoooooOOOOO
","Finally a men's movie ! I liked it well although I find that a little snivelling at times (while the world of F1 otherwise the motor racing is not at all this way) because sequences on this hero of Niki Lauda are a little supported otherwise accommodating. The leg Ron Howard, doubtless.Fortunately scenes with James Hunt raise the whole of a little hot pepper, and call upon a stalk more respect. I hope at least that the congenital morons'll merge a little less circuit and route... Forgive my broken English but I don't know why I should make a longer commentary, its simply dumb and dumber ! Since when quality equals quantity ? Or maybe the caretakers write the movie reviews (I find out that IMDb has curious manners to consider critics...) So, we could say too that the shortest is the joke is the best of all. You wanna know everything ? Go and see Rush, but don't search for a entire book, it's only entertainment !",Null,1,3,30 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Thank you Starbucks, Sony©, Van Dutch, etc....
","Besides being a good small pupil of the nation, Peter Parker is ugly and sick, and also spell of the jokes which makes you constantly feel to smash him. You know, this kind of 'bling-bling' upstart which annoyed you to the middle school ? It is the same kind, the same order, and only the miserable succeed in arriving at him at the height a little, and as if by chance a black man, the Electro. Well, we are not going to make a clock Swiss but useless to declaim within one hour that this movie is a sacrilege face to face of Spidey and for those ones who read one day in their life a comic. Yuk. Forgive-me Marvel.In brief, I didn't liked it of the whole, and besides even Tobey Maguire gives the impression of being very regretted. From now on we shall cry even the sellers of toys, it is unworthy to release out such a crap without soul and to make a legendary super-hero play to a sandwich man... Here is I finished, CLOSURE OF the STORE.*for those ones who still would persist in spending all the same more than 12 $ in the cinema, thus limit yourselves to the trailer: everything is already said inside, or then get yourselves the cartoon in the mythical musical air. Nanaannaanaaaaa - Nananaaaa - nanannaaaaaaaa!!",1,23,61,10 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," A very new draft of the cult movie of 1979...
","Only for the guilty pleasure to watch Charlize Theron in her own juices, this movie is worth its heavy amount of $. Of course the new Max is a little short of the real watermarked madness of his former actor (Mel Gibson for the total greenhorns) and the orange touch of a film undoubtedly touched again by the digital graphic pallet hurts sometimes its vision, and also, let us say the quite clear, for the continuity of a story somehow complex.Devotee of the very first for a very long time, I have to admit all the same that I was amazed rather by a narrative which stand up straight most of the time, cart about somehow or other towards the number third of the franchise otherwise by being completely for its height, I named 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'. Obviously the end which is tinged with a mormon and puritanism spirit will not please to everybody, but this aftereffect fights well as a new one Ben Hur seen again and corrected, and his savages have at least the advantage to be truer than true.Do not miss the bad appearance of the dictatorial head, Immortan Joe, a very successful miserable just like his harem, and also this decerebrate guitarist beating time measure during the gimmick of this nth epic of Max Rockatansky.Thus let us wish that George Miller soon frees his hero - from a pure entertainment in the shape of blockbuster a little too much bounded to the commercial imperatives - towards a number 5 in which we shall find maybe inside the insane ultraviolence of a very inflexible censorship had condemned formerly for a long time...",8,2,12,14 May 2015
The Martian," On Mars nobody hears you muck around
","Caution because in this movie there is a chap who cultivates turnips, eh no, forgive me, potatoes on Mars on a plain bottom of corny disco music and sometimes while communicating with a pack of stupid and uncultivated morons who leave him on Mars. We would thus imagine in a kind of reality show in a little stranger, seen that the actors seem so half-witted as in a great movie with Leslie Nielsen.It would be the sequel of ' Airplane! ' Reshaped for the space? Not at all, it is so little funny so much it is totally grotesque from the beginning to the end, there is no slightest gram of suspense, and the scientific pledge seems to have been confided to Kanye West. Well why not but when we know the current cost of a movie and the stunning number of script-doctors and specialists of all kinds, working in Hollywood or somewhere else, the set leaves a taste saddening especially when we know that Ridley Scott is the director...Whell,it just goes to show, my friends, and as said Confucius (or maybe someone else, I do not know nothing any more) we are all born from dust of stars and not so much something else for the greater part. So, to all the misled aliens who read to me, I deeply recommend them to wait for the DVD release. Be seeing you !",1,18,40,13 November 2015
