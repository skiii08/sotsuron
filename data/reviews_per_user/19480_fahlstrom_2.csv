Ghost," A touching and entertaining movie on all levels
","Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death.The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too.This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.",10,1,2,2 March 2013
The Insider," Thoroughly well done and gripping.
","This is a film worthy of the great talent used in it. Mann is an outstanding director and this is one of his best. Pacino and Aussie Crowe are both on top of their form as are all the supporting actors and actresses.The story is well paced and deep and you end up really feeling for the central character who is putting everything on the line for the public benefit ...and probably for some measure of getting even after getting canned by his former employer - the Brown & Williamson tobacco company.For those weaned on non stop action flicks with explosions, fights and gun play in virtually every scene, this is not the movie for you. For you cerebral types who enjoy a twisted, deep story with multiple layers, this is one to get your teeth into. Another review compared it to 'All the Presidents Men' and I couldn't agree more.I didn't give it a 10 only because it was a dark story about a truly despondent man who loses everything when he chooses to do the right thing. In that regard it depresses many folks. But, hey, this was a true story that portrays the vaunted CBS 60 Minutes in a very bad light as a gutless TV show managed by gutless producers afraid of being sued for telling the truth. If the truth is more than you can handle, look elsewhere.",9,2,3,6 May 2013
