Scarface," Shocking Score
","Some of the cheesy 80's unlistenable synth music in this film is completely out of place. Can anyone tell me why? It says on the special edition DVD that this movie has a driving musical score, only I have seen this movie 6 times and still haven't heard it; What I have heard is a score more at home in a David Hasselhoff movie! This film is about greed, power, jealousy, confrontation and revenge and deserves to have an evocative, dramatic & memorable score that demonstrates and enhances these themes. Surely DePalma and Bregman could of done better than this; I know Moroder is linked with many quality film scores, but this is absolutely shocking.",Null,0,1,4 June 2004
