First Man," Not the right stuff
","I'm sure many were hoping for the right stuff: another epic celebration of the one of the great victories of the USA, nay, mankind. But this movie puts the story of man going to the moon in another perspective.It's Neil Armstrong's experience of it, not as the flight nut he certainly was, but the father and man that a terrible gauntlet of loss and grief could have made him. And yet he finds catharsis and in a way, it's an important part of the miraculous achievement of these explorers who risked it all.It's Neil that has the right perspective, both of the importance of the mission, as of the dreadful cost to the people involved. Meanwhile, the world isn't exactly waiting breathlessly for the US to pull off its trick - there is opposition, competition and doubt. But when the moment is there, it is transformative. And that is what the movie is about.I'm sure more movies will be made and surely some will sing the heroic praises and spin the drama, like so many seemed to be hoping for. But First Man remains a strong film all the same - though not perfect either, so 8/10 it is.",8,3,5,18 February 2019
Hereditary," Reminds you of the classics...
","And that's a good thing, if you like the classics like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist or The Omen. It has all the modern updates in terms of visuals, sound design and technology, but it uses the latter in moderation, to its credit. But as a story, in its themes and execution, it's timeless and if you loved those three movies, you're likely to think this one is great as well.If, on the other hand, you grew up on a diet of Saw, Ring and Paranormal Activity, it's probably a bad thing. I've read the negative comments and reviews of many viewers that seem to have a problem with its pace, themes and the type of storytelling that dominated horror in the 70's up to the 00's.There's a number of things in this movie that, if you're used to getting everything served in bite-sized chunks (typically literally), may seem out of place or wrong - but they work very well if you accept the movie for what it is.I think it would be hard to make this movie any better, but I'm sticking with 8/10 because the one valid criticism here is that it *has* all been done before - often. The strong suggestion of a psychological history and the suspense of wondering whether it's all in their heads, the flow of time that leaves out all the mundane and only gets you in the main characters' head space, the supernatural tropes (I won't go into, because that's just spoiling and it's obvious when you see it).The story is well-told, I think the acting is on point, at least as I understand the characters and the movie looks and sounds amazing. Recommended for horror fans that don't want to stick with modern tropes alone.",8,0,2,15 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Highly entertaining movie that makes no sense
","There are no spoilers needed to back up the statement that 'Endgame' is the Swiss cheese of the bunch as far as plot holes and internal contradictions are concerned. Emotionally strong and visually impressive, it's one of the most entertaining movies in the MCU and cannot be missed by anyone who watched most of the others.But unless you are already deeply invested in the MCU or simply have to know 'what's next' after the (actually far better) 'Inifity War', or you're just here for the fights, tear jerks and explosions, this movie is entirely missable. You will be passing up the opportunity to endlessly pick it apart with your geek friends though, who will spend the next decade trying to come up with excuses to make this movie work.It *is* after all the culmination of a decade of storytelling and it deserves credit for pulling that off. It's a shame that a movie that does such a good job of connecting everything, making it look so good, with so much star power, ends up being a plot mess and honestly lazy.",6,3,9,2 May 2019
Elysium," Quite frankly, offensively bad
","District 9 was a little rough around the edges, but you were inclined to forgive quite a bit for the original story, the zany acting and the over the top look.However, no such luck for Elysium. It has great Hollywood actors acting like logs, the plot is so full of holes, you can fly the ISS through it and trying to make sense of it assaults your intelligence. Too bad it's not so bad it's funny, like Escape from LA. In the end, Elysium is hopeless and only worth watching for the OK special effects in places. There are a few clever gadget ideas in there as well, if that's your thing. But quite frankly, reading a fan website (if any exist) will probably get you more satisfaction in that department and it won't cost you the hour and a half I wouldn't mind getting back.Neill Blomkamp shouldn't deserve another big budget shot, after this major disappointment, if you ask me.",2,6,13,22 August 2013
The Departed," The movie that will ultimately just be about 'The Elevator Scene'
","This movie is an amazing piece of work, for the first two hours at least.A carefully constructed plot, an amazing cast, a fine host of interesting characters. The movie has an unrivaled pace, which I think is both innovative and so natural that I expect to see it emulated (and possibly improved upon) a lot. Not only are there really high paced scenes, not unlike Requiem for a Dream, but the pace is high all the way through and it gives the movie some serious momentum.Not a typical Scorcese, his craftsmanship still shines through and it makes me wish he would start making more movies that depart from his usual themes. There's some weak bits, like the limp relationship hook between the two main characters and the shrink. Some more Hollywood clich√©s find their way into the movie, but it's never really in the way of a decent picture.But then we come to it: The Elevator Scene.Up to that point, a carefully constructed plot has you in your grips, on a roller-coaster ride with casualties left and right. And then, the worst of the worst: a deus ex machina ending... It's no just bad and easily forgiven. It's horrible.Despite all the good things you can say about this movie, it's about the story and the plot first and foremost. And to destroy it with a completely unpredictable and unrelated character, for no apparent reason other than proving the point that everyone is a rat and the world is going to hell, is weak. Nothing but weak.This one takes the throne. For me personally, it replaces the Dallas 'it's all a dream' scam. The Oscar for 'Best Writing' goes to a flimsy deus ex machina tale... Those golden statues just lost some of their luster.",5,1,2,24 March 2007
Arrival," One for the ages
","I postponed re-watching this movie, as I did not want to ruin the sense of magic and mystery that it had left me with when I first watched it in the theatre.But after seeing Blade Runner 2049 and watching Villeneuve's other earlier work, I figured the movie probably really was as good as I first felt it was and should hold up under repeat viewing.It certainly is a different story, the second time you watch it. The movie doesn't offer exciting twists, so much as requiring you to see the whole thing to fully understand what you have seen. And of course, that understanding brings a different perspective upon second viewing.But it holds up, the aliens are alien, the sound design is otherworldly and the characters give the actors something to do, although I would have preferred a bit more depth from the supporting characters. However, Amy Adams could carry the movie on her performance alone and luckily, she doesn't have to.My one issue with the story-telling is the level of exposure the main character appears to need (and thus the audience along with her) to come to her realisations, but it's not grating and doesn't diminish the experience too much.Don't watch this if you're looking for exciting aliens sci-fi, do watch this if you like a through-provoking piece that doesn't mind following some of the tropes while still telling a wholly original story.",9,0,0,4 February 2019
The Conjuring," Effective and good looking, but nothing new
","The characters are likeable and the movie establishes itself pretty quickly, with some very effective scares and spooks. For anyone who like the typical 'family moves into haunted house' type movie, The Conjuring will be an enjoyable watch.But many movies like it have been made and The Conjuring doesn't add that much we haven't seen before. The one aspect I did like is how the psychics that get involved really get involved and the stakes are raised considerably during the movie.But like others have said, it's set in the 70's to make it work the way it does and this is mainly because horror movie writers and directors will need to get creative to make horror for the current age. Setting it in the 70's allows for all the familiar tropes and makes for a nostalgic horror environment. Asian movies like Ring show that there is room for something new and modern, so I don't agree that setting it in the 80's or 70's is a requirement for the genre.A niggle I had with The Conjuring is that the tone shifts quite a lot. After some considerable buildup, the movie loses a lot of steam and even though it does build up after that, it's a lot slower and I felt it never quite achieved the atmosphere it has about a third in.",7,1,1,7 February 2019
Lucy," Lacks originality and little to redeem itself
","Although the premise is slightly darker (allowing Besson to mix in Asian mob tropes) and the ending certainly better, Lucy is still just another Limitless. But where Limitless at least managed to get a thrill going and didn't dwell too long on the flawed premise of the movie, Lucy gets stuck on it and revels in it.It's never a pain to watch Scarlett Johansson, but this isn't a performance she will be remembered for and the script doesn't give her much to work with either.Some entertaining visuals and certainly decent sound, but even there Besson is like a raving movie fan on your couch, remembering cool stuff from other movies and putting it in, when all you really want to do is turn in and get some sleep. Trying to guess the 'references' could be fun, perhaps.(and no, we really *don't* use only 10% of our brain capacity, this goes in the same bin as ghosts, flying saucers and Bigfoot - that doesn't affect the rating of the movie though)",4,1,6,25 October 2014
