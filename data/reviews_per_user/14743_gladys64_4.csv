Moneyball," Dull dull dull
",Never a fan of Brad Pitt as I find him so dull as an actor as well as a person. This was no different. Watched it because I love sports movies. Triumph over adversity. This was way to long. I didn't like any of the characters apart from possibly Chris Pratt's character. Would have given it a 2 but hubby thought it was watchable if nothing else. Don't bother,4,0,2,8 April 2020
The Hateful Eight," Boring
",Boring as hell. Mind numbingly long. Samuel l Jackson plays Samuel l Jackson. Kurt Russell plays Kurt Russell. Quentin tarentino does what he always does. People say they like it cause they think they should say they like it. Don't waste 3 long hrs.,1,3,8,24 April 2020
Yesterday," Easy watching
",Not great. Not bad. Ed Shearman was annoying and seemed pointless. He can't act. Even when being himself. Rather cringy to watch. Ok storyline and nice ending. Would have given it a 5 but hubby enjoyed it so bumped it by a point.,6,1,2,17 October 2019
The Descent," Don't believe the high ratings
",Terrible acting. Totally unlike able characters. Didn't feel sad at all when they died one by one. Just wish it had happened sooner. Not much more to say other then avoid it. Terrible. Dull ending.,3,1,5,24 January 2020
