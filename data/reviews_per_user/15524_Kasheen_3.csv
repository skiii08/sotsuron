Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ludicrous
","This film was ludicrous.  Jake Llyod, I know he is young but man he was bad. I felt sorry that they let him look so bad. Wasn't anyone trying to help the poor kid.  The actors all seemed bored.  Ewan McGregor seemed to be the only one doing his job.  Natalie Portman was also decent I must say.  I'm sure everyone has heard all of this before.  But I really do want to give Ewan kudos and I hope the next one is better. Maybe he should get naked.  It couldn't hurt.",1,1,2,19 June 2001
Armageddon," Em Right
","This was horrid.  Sexist, right-wing, and evil.  If you see this movie you are encouraging irresponsable behavior and the downfall of our society! Each minute of the movie was a commercial for itself.  Lazy, indulgent, irresponsable, crappy, pure and utter crap, mean, sick, discusting, lousy, lame, assinine, good for the dog from Conan to poop on.  Good for WCW monday night raw types.  Why did I watch this?  My IQ is now lower because of those two excrutiating hours and I will never get them back!  Armageddon I curse you!  Oh the Humanity.",1,2,6,17 May 2000
Moulin Rouge!," It is a step above the rest
","The numerous references to Ewan McGregor's penis size (which you will agree with if you've seen Pillow Book)made me realize how self-conscious this film is.  After realizing that I just loved it all the more.  It is such a culture savy film and it really pushes in your face how insane mass media and pop culture is.  It is a film for people who are influenced by pop culture (just about everyone).  And also people who like to be entertained. Because the film does go over the top, it uses cliches to it's advantage. Unlike pearl harbor for instance in which each cliche was met with a groan and rolling of the eyes. Also after seeing Moulin Rouge everything else seems tired. It must have been quite a task to edit that baby though.  And there is so much foreshadowing. The food even foreshadows events to come. It was sort of shakespeare in love meets rocky horror or something and then take on some more song within a play within a story within a movie.  Which is great because it reinforces the whole theme of a moulin, its circular motion.  My favorite thing is when a film synthesizes its visuals, plot, and sound into a perfect whole.  Since 2001 I haven't seen it done but I think Moulin Rouge does a pretty darn good job.  Plus I was taken by how well the musical aspect worked with the plot.  Using already known songs really only strengthened their meaning because along with them came all of the things that those songs mean to each person individually.  And it also seems that they used the songs in homage and to make a statement, not just to make a profit.  So before you read critic reviews by people that probably didn't have the time to actually assimilate the visually complex film, give it a chance, pay attention and whether you love it or hate it, you can at least appreciate the brightness and unique vision that this film offers.  :)",10,0,1,19 June 2001
