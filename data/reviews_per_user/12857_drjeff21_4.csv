Frost_Nixon," More Liberal Revisionist History
","Good movie, but as stated they took some real license to paint the revisionist liberal narrative of Nixon: 1. The financial deal made for the interviews was agreed to and lucrative for both parties.2. The scene where Nixon storms out of the interview did not happen - Frost stormed out.3. The late-night phone call from Nixon to Frost did not happen.4. The big 'gotcha' moment portrayed near the end of the film did not happen.As I realize that license is often taken in movies regarding historical events, what people will remember of Nixon will not be gleaned from the actual interviews, but from this movie.",6,4,7,22 June 2010
BlacKkKlansman," Slow, Didactic, Inaccurate Film About a Minor Episode
","Described as being based on 'a crazy, outrageous incredible true story' about how a black cop infiltrated the KKK, BlacKkKlansman would be more accurately described as the story of how a black cop in 1970s Colorado Springs spoke to the Klan on the phone. He pretended to be a white supremacist . . . on the phone. That isn't infiltration, that's prank-calling. A poster for the movie shows a black guy wearing a Klan hood. Great starting point for a comedy, but it didn't happen. The cop who actually attended KKK meetings undercover was a white guy (played by Adam Driver). These led . . . well, nowhere in particular. No plot was foiled. Those meetups mainly revealed that Klansmen behave exactly how you'd expect Klansmen to behave.Add in some additional characters who didn't exist and events that did not happen and you finally reach the end of this mess.Of course the movie also bashes you over the head with Lee's typical messages about racism by adding dialog and characters (who the hell was Alec Baldwin portraying?) that really don't have anything to do with the main plot. Oh, and he also has to denigrate President Trump.That this movie was even considered for any Oscars is an insult to real filmmakers.",1,9,16,25 October 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Interesting, but Baffling - Major Possible Spoiler
","Major Spoiler Ahead-I thought the movie was intriguing and well acted but as noted by other viewers there were scenes/actions which really did not make any sense.SPOILER: At first they want you to think that the mysterious, threatening guy who showed up in town was the murderer, and there is still some suspicion even after his alibi was revealed, but he was a distraction. I believe that the murderer was his friend whom he had drinks with in the bar.",7,0,0,21 November 2019
The Hurricane," If This Was Intended To Be a Fictional Story
","Then I could say it was a good movie, but it's presented as factual. A number of other reviewers go through the various lies that Carter has told and other falsehoods in his life story. One that I find particularly amusing however is his military record. In his book you can actually see in his photo that he (or someone) actually drew ribbons and insignia on the photo with a pencil! He was court-martialed four times and thrown out of the army. There is also one additional fact which completely shuts down the cries that he was innocent. Before the second trial in 1976 the prosecutor made an almost unheard of offer to Carter - 'If you pass a lie detector test I will drop the charges'. Carter refused to take the test.",1,1,1,23 May 2019
