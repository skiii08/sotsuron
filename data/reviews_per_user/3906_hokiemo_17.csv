The Blair Witch Project," Old fashioned fright
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  My only complaint is the shaky camera -- I felt like I was car sick from the camera moving up and down quickly (usually when the main characters are running) and I had to look away several times to settle my stomach.  The film has a simple premise of a group of 20 somethings investigating a legendary witch's hangout,  but it is executed divinely.  Viewers who think the film is boring probably like lots of special effects and camera wizardly -- if so, then that is their source of disappointment.  The film could have existed 75 years ago and relies more on scaring viewers with our own imaginations.  So many people told me they had been in woods like the film location and once been scared they'd get lost. You may be spooked to camp outside in the woods again.  I highly recommend this film.",Null,0,1,21 January 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Makes you feel the ecstasy and agony of drug addiction
","This film is an excellent portrayal of how dangerous and powerful drugs are. All of the characters are finely acted, but Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly are stand outs.  Burstyn should have won the Oscar for Best Actress that year.  What Connelly's character does towards the end of the film to get drugs is frighteningly realistic. One of the finest achievements of the film is its ability to get under the viewer's skin and make you feel what the characters are going through, both physically and emotionally. And perhaps most scary is the reminder that drug addiction can happen with legal drugs, as Ellen Burstyn's character demonstrates. You may not usually feel sorry for drug addicts, but these characters force you to feel their desperation and their pain.  Although images from the film may haunt you long afterwards, if those images prevent your own personal demise into drugs, this film is truly superb.",10,0,1,30 December 2003
Casablanca," First Rate in every way
","The film revolves around the lives of WWII refugees who use Casablanca as means of getting out of war torn Europe and into the United States. Humphrey Bogart is excellent as the cafe owner Rick and Ingrid Bergman superb as Ilsa, Rick's old lover who abandoned him in Paris without explanation, and then shows up in Casablanca with her husband. The script is well written and the dialogue flows effortlessly and believably between characters. Ingrid Bergman brings a fantastic amount of complexity to her character's emotions and the mystery surrounding her true feelings for Rick is smartly never fully resolved. Even when Ilsa claims she thought her husband was dead and that's why she had an romance with Rick, I'm not sure I believe her. Ilsa, whether its out of guilt or love, desperately wants to get her husband Victor Laszlo out of Casblanca and on his way to the USA. The Germans are trying to keep Laszlo in Casablanca indefinitely due to his anti-war activities. Claude Rains as Captain Renault is wonderful and leaves a indelible mark in cinema history for his witty retorts throughout the film. The movie was the birth of the often repeated movie lines 'here's looking at you kid' and 'this looks like the start of a beautiful friendship.' I highly recommend this film.",9,0,2,10 July 2006
Monster," Charlize Theron is phenomenal
","I recently watched Monster with high expectations because I already knew that Theron won an oscar for best actress.  Theron did not disappoint.  Her performance is truly spectacular as it doesn't appear that she is acting -- she becomes Aileen in every sense.  The movie moves at a good pace, but I would change the beginning and spend a little more time showing Aileen's upbringing and the fact that her father was a child molester.  It was also rumored that Aileen had an incestuous relationship with her brother and that he was possibly the father of the baby she had when she was just 14.  And Aileen was not just a prostitute. In her real life, she was guilty of numerous solitary crimes including theft and aggravated assault.  I believe that these skipped events set an early stage for Aileen's eventual demise.  Aileen started out troubled and lacking self control and self worth.  It was only a matter of time before she exploded.Although some viewers may criticize the apparently light relationship between Aileen and Selby, I think it was realistic.  Many people say  'I love you' simply because they want real love so badly. 
Overall, this is an excellent film with stellar performances.",Null,0,0,2 August 2004
Grease," That's entertainment!
","'Grease' is a quality musical with a tremendous cast. Danny Zuko (Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) meet at the beach during summer vacation and fall in love. Sandy has to return to Australia, but then her family unexpectedly decides to stay in the USA. She enrolls at Rydell High School having no idea that Danny attends there. When they finally run into each other, Danny acts differently because his friends are watching and he has a tough guy image. Sandy is very upset by Danny's behavior and although she tries to get over him, she can't deny her feelings for him. Danny is a sweet guy at heart and does his best to win Sandy back. The entire cast is well chosen and the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is perfect. The choreography is excellent, especially in Greased Lightning and the dance-off contest. Some viewers have commented that they don't like the fact that Sandy changes her image at the end of the movie. I didn't think this was a big deal, but I guess one could interpret this as a result of peer pressure. I think Sandy was waiting until she was confident enough to deal with the consequences of an adult relationship with Danny. Sandy sings that she's scared and unsure of herself shortly before her transformation. Another viewer comment I read is that the viewer thought it was bad that the Pink Ladies never accept Sandy as one of their own. The Pink Ladies not completely accepting Sandy is extremely realistic of cliques. I think it is positive that Sandy strived for the relationship she wanted with Danny despite the comments and jabs from the Pink Ladies. If we all waited for the acceptance of other people before pursuing something, most of us would still be waiting around 20 years later.I'm glad casting decided to choose 2 leads who can sing instead of picking non-singers to lip sync. The film gives you a good idea of what going to high school in the 1950s is like with the peer pressure, cliques, music, clothes, etc. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.",10,2,4,14 November 2005
Cold Mountain," Worth Watching
","This is a good but not excellent film. To begin, at 152 minutes, the film is too long. I could have easily cut out 30 minutes of the film with none the wiser. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law do well with their scripts, but are they too old for their parts? I haven't read the book 'Cold Mountain' so maybe their characters are suppposed to be in their thirties. I have no problem if the characters are supposed to be in their thirties, but it would have been interesting if this had brought out more in the film as people used to get married much younger.Further, I think parts showing Ada messing up domestic chores should have been included, a bit like Scarlett O'Hara in 'Gone with the Wind'. Ada Monroe mentions her naivity in farm and house work, but adding some humorous learning experiences for Ada to a somewhat sad film could have added more realism to her transition from fair haired maiden to skilled markswoman.Also, I'm not a prude, but the sex scene between Ada and Inman in my opinion is softly p*rnographic and unnecessary. I think more awkwardness would have occurred between Ada and Inman for their first time yet Ada appears to be a skilled and unhibited lover. I think less should have been shown and more imagined by the audience.Renee Zellweger is excellent as Ruby and most believable as her character. Lesser known actor Brendon Gleeson as Ruby's father also does a fantastic job in his role.The film's cinematography is excellent and the scenery gorgeous. Overall, a good film worth watching, but it could use some improvements.",7,1,2,23 August 2004
Dirty Dancing," Enjoyable and Nostalgic
","Baby Houseman, her parents, and sister take a summer vacation at a fictional place called Kellerman's Resort in New York. Baby quickly grows up when she falls in love with a dancer at the hotel named Johnny. Baby helps other at the resort face their fears such as the female dancer Penny who decides to end an unwanted pregnancy. Baby disappoints her doctor father by the type of people she befriends at the resort, but he fails to realize until the end of the movie that she is having a positive effect on these people rather than them having a negative effect on her. Each time I watch this movie I honestly have a hard time believing Johnny falls in love with Baby because Baby looks so young and naive. However, the casting really is well done because one of the movies themes is you sometimes have to take risks to find true happiness.The movie is enjoyable with the well choreographed dancing scenes and also nostalgic because many people today are glued to their television screens and computers and don't enjoy old fashioned fun anymore. 'Dirty Dancing' was filmed about 10 miles away from Virginia Tech at Mountain Lake Hotel in Pembroke Virginia. This is a beautiful hotel that I recommend to everyone visiting Southwest Virginia. Some of the movie was also filmed in Lake Lure, North Carolina and this is also a gorgeous place well worth a visit.",8,0,0,19 October 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Excellent Performances
","'Million Dollar Baby' is perfectly cast --- the actors take on their parts and make them their own. The story is about a white trash girl, Maggie, who wants to make something of herself and believes that boxing is her calling. She seeks out Frankie to train her at the gym, but he refuses to take her on at first. At first you think Frankie's sexist, but his character is not that simple. The story builds steadily and you later realize Frankie has many good reasons not to train Maggie, but her spirit and dedication win him over eventually. Frankie ties himself emotionally to each person he trains and tries his best to make them champions. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Scrap the gym's custodian and his intelligence and ability to decipher Frankie even surprises Frankie. Scrap reminds me of a man I met one time at my company who earned a purple heart in the Vietnam War, but spent his days sorting mail in the mail room. Surely, this veteran had more to offer the world or maybe I just didn't understand that he had experienced and accomplished more than most people do in a lifetime. I think the situation is the same with Scrap -- being at the gym doing whatever is still immensely satisfying to him. How many people can say they'd want to live at their place of work like Scrap?! Hillary Swank is wonderful as Maggie and Clint Eastwood... well what's not to like? The man is brilliant in every way -- acting, directing, writing, and so soft spoken in real life that you love and respect him even more.I also was immensely impressed by the minor players in the film, especially the actor who plays Maggie's mother, Margo Martindale. She is just excellent in her supporting role. Lucia Rijker is also fantastic as 'Billie the Blue Bear'. She is one tough lady! It wasn't until I watched the behind the scenes footage that I saw how pretty she is off screen.One minor problem I can see with the film is the diction and audibility -- I couldn't understand everything Scrap said and had to use the subtitles feature on the DVD player. I understood all of his narration, but not some of his lines when he appeared on film. My complaint sounds like nitpicking and that's not my intention.Finally, it is great to finally see a major film about women's boxing. I didn't know the women's version is just as violent as the men's. I am quite surprised boxing headgear is not worn in women's or men's boxing. Boxing with your bare head makes no sense when you see how many injuries are sustained such as concussions, broken eardrums, detached retinas, and such. The sport makes complaining about a broken nose sound like you're complaining about a broken finger nail. I've heard some of Muhammad Ali's present health condition is attributed to numerous blows to his head during his boxing years.Overall this is an excellent film and well worth the time viewing.",8,3,4,1 August 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Original love story
","I was pleasantly surprised at the depth and poignancy of this movie. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fantastic! Their acting brings much more to the movie than just dialogue. Although they wanted their memories erased at first, it was only because they loved each other so much. This love causes them to constantly bicker and disagree, but they didn't realize how lucky they were to have each other until they almost lost each other forever. Really there are very few people in life worth erasing forever. I actually can think of 2 people I'd gladly erase from my life. The only reason I might not erase them is because I learned a lot from the experiences and I do not want to make those same mistakes again. Joel and Clementine have something so special that when they meet a second time as strangers, they still find a connection! It does seem that they are soul mates. They realize that they want the same things in life, but not necessarily in the same order. They must agree to disagree and not take every discussion as a personal attack. This movie makes you think so much about your own love life and friends that it's frightening! This is one of the few movies that you will continue to think about long after you've seen it.Winslet and Carrey definitely deserved their Golden Globe nominations. This movie is a must see!",10,0,1,17 January 2005
Psycho," Timeless Thriller
",Psycho is an excellent thriller no horror fan should miss. Alfred Hitchcock knows how to create chills without gore. The film being in black and white also adds to the spooky mystique. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast. Leigh's character makes you sympathetic for her despite her criminal intentions and Perkins' portrayal of a serial killer ensnaring his prey is brilliant. I can't imagine why this film was remade in the 1990's --- the 1960 version is just so perfect that I wouldn't change a thing.Overall I recommend this film. It's so good you'll want to watch it twice in a row.,Null,4,7,1 November 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Overrated silliness
","Judging from most IMDb comments, I am one of the few viewers who does not like this movie. I did not find it scary at all -- I found it quite dumb. And the ending was the most disappointing of all. The only person worth watching is Ruth Gordon. She is a terrific actress. Rosemary's husband Guy Woodhouse is goofy and Rosemary herself is overly dramatic. It would have been interesting to have Rosemary's husband act more like a con man telling how beautiful and wonderful she is. The sex scene with the devil is silly. A remake of this film could be much creepier and the ending in my opinion should be modified slightly. I think Rosemary should have tried to kill the baby once she found out it was the devil's. This would have been the one excitement in the whole film, especially if the baby killed her instead. I was so glad when I finished watching the film, but I felt I had to view a movie considered to be such a classic.",4,21,39,2 June 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," One of Will Ferrell's best movies
","Very funny portrayal of a self-consumed anchorman, Ron Burgundy, who thinks he's God's gift to the women. Everything is going super in Burgundy's life until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) shows up, knocks him off his feet romantically, and then threatens his position and status at the station. Ferrell's experience on Saturday Night Live shines through as he's able to make the most out of just about every joke. Steve Carell is fantastic as the retarded weatherman. Even his simplest lines or facial expressions made us crack up hysterically. Applegate also does well and her controlled portrayal of Veronica plays very well against Ferrell's zaniness.",Null,0,1,3 October 2005
The Green Mile," Deeply moving film worth watching
","This movie makes you wonder how many innocent people have been executed.  I found strong religious symbolism in John Coffey to Jesus Christ in that Jesus performed miracles and he too was put to death despite his peaceful and innocent nature.  I do believe images from the movie will stay with you long after, but not in a bad way.  I didn't think the movie pushed a viewpoint regarding death row convictions in one direction or the other, but just made you think about the judicial system.  Maybe DNA testing would have freed John Coffey if the year was 2004, but I think he would have been implicated in some way, maybe as an accomplice, since people judge each other based on appearances.  There was one very nasty character in the movie who most people would agree deserved death row. But of course, is the satisfaction of putting down the vile murderers of the world worth the life of even 1 innocent person?  What if that innocent person was you?",Null,1,2,18 March 2004
Halloween," Excellent Halloween Fright
","I rent this movie on Halloween every couple years and it never disappoints. Your attention is hooked from the opening scene to the last frame of the movie. The entire cast is well chosen. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as studious babysitter Laurie Strode. Her ability to fend off psycho Michael Myers is believable. Also, I can't imagine anybody else but Donald Pleasance in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Pleasance's delivery of his lines sends chills up your spine. Truly, director John Carpenter understands what it takes to develop a scary story. There isn't one scene in the movie that I would delete. The actors who are Laurie's girl friends in the movie also act very well in the movie (Nancy Kyes and PJ Soles). They deliver their lines so naturally they remind you of your own high school classmates. I like the little boy in the film also, actor Brian Andrews, who plays Tommy Doyle. I enjoyed his sweet and shy character and he and Jamie Lee Curtis interact great. Lastly, I like that John Carpenter doesn't fill up the film with gore. He briefly shows Mike Myers stabbing his victims and quickly moves to the next scene. Carpenter lets us imagine the worst by not showing everything. Overall, this movie is a classic film worth watching.",Null,0,1,2 November 2004
Identity," Keeps your attention
","This would be a good movie to watch on Halloween night.  The dialog wasn't great, but the quality actors overcome that weakness.  One criticism is that Amanda Peet's character did not look trashy enough for her role as a hooker. I see many girls today dress trashier than Amanda's character and they're not hookers!  John Cusack did an okay job acting, but it was not one of his better parts.  My biggest criticism is the ending flashback of the killer commiting various murders -- I found it had a certain silliness which was certainly not the intended effect.  The film has a certain low budget feel, but it's not a terrible thing.  However, despite some flaws, I still recommend this film for its originality, suspense and clever plot twists.",Null,0,0,5 April 2004
The Birds," Eery and Satisfying Hitchcock Film
","The film starts out interestingly enough with Mitch Brenner checking out Annie Hayworth in a bird store, claiming he would like to purchase a pair of love birds. Annie and Mitch end up knowing each other from a some sort of court dispute. Mitch needles Annie much to her disliking and promptly leaves the store. Annie manages to get his license plate number and decides to buy him some love birds, perhaps feeling she's misunderstood and this is a way to win him over. She drives the birds to the address she tracks down from his plate and drops off the birds. Mitch sees her and promptly catches up to her, asking her to stay for dinner. The birds in the area start to act a little aggressive and increasing in numbers. As usual, no one in the beginning believes the situation will get out of hand. I actually liked Jessica Tandy's character as Mitch's mother Lydia more often than I liked Mitch. Mitch convinces everyone to stay at the house and wait the attack out. Every good film has an antagonist and there are several in this film. The plot could have been developed more as far as how Annie and Mitch work out their differences. Lydia leaves the house one morning and we could swear Annie and Mitch hit the sheets during her absence, though nothing is shown except how affectionate and close they are when Lydia returns.One minor note is that Mitch's younger sister looks more like she could be his daughter, but this doesn't detract from the film. I enjoyed Suzanne Pleshette's teacher character and found her to be the most engaging character in the whole film.Overall, a good film with excellent directing, cinematography and film editing. The plot of how birds can increase in numbers and attack people is believable in my opinion, especially with today's bird flu epidemics and such. If you've ever eaten food on an East coast beach, some birds will swoop down at you with a few getting a little too close. I wasn't disappointed with the ending -- it leaves the idea of what happens next to both imagination and a possible sequence.",Null,0,1,21 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Two Thumbs Up
","I highly recommend this movie. This movie may be somewhat overrated by now.If you didn't like it, you may have been expecting too much by the time you saw it. I think it's best to see a movie before the hype. This happened with the movie 'The Full Monty'. A lot of people saw it after all the media attention and then wondered what all the fuss was about.I agree with other IMDb comments that Tim Blake Nelson is a standout, though George Clooney does a great job. The soundtrack with its bluegrass flavor is fabulous too. The movie has a fairly simple plot about the trials and tribulations of 3 convicts who escape a chain gang. Although they're minor criminals, they're very likable and you find yourself routing for their freedom and happiness. Some characters could have had bigger parts such as Holly Hunter's role. I liked the symbolism employed in the movie, especially the reference to the 'Wizard of Oz' in the KK*K scene. The 3 convicts attack 3 clan members and steal their outfits to sneak into to a ceremony and save a friend of theirs just like the lion, tin man, and scarecrow did to 3 guardsmen when they broke into the castle to save Dorthy. The ending scene is fantastic and not at all expected. Overall, see this film and enjoy the interesting characters.",Null,0,1,13 September 2004
