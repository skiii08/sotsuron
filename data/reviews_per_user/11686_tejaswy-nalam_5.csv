Black Swan," Black What?
","A certain someone watched this movie and recommended it to me highly. Since our tastes match I decided to give the movie a go.If it weren't for the stunning Mila Kunis, it would have been worse off.Though it should not be the case, I started off watching the movie with very very high expectations (V for Vendetta high). After the first 15 mins I thought I was doing something wrong and readjusted my expectations to Zero.From there on the movie kept going downhill. If there was a more deplorable movie, barring very very very (yes, three verys) few late night, made for TV movies, I could not think of one.The movie lacked any sense and for the longest time, I was wondering if I was watching the right movie. Every scene was very very predictable and the moment you are three quarters of the way through, if you are an avid movie watches, you will know EXACTLY where it ends.That there were Oscars for this pile further lessens my opinion of the movie world's supposedly greatest award.Such a darned waste of everything (including the Oscars).Save this time for a tooth extraction without anaesthesia and you will be better off.",2,3,6,25 March 2011
The Intouchables," Aujourd'hui plus qu'hier et bien moins que demain.
","A touching version of a true story that could have only been made by the French combined with a sweetness that only celluloid can deliver! I chanced upon this movie on a Saturday evening, and having loved the language all my life, I decided to give it a go. And, over a period of two hours, my life, my world view, my sensibilities went, for the lack of a better word, *boom* The performances were not good, they were subtle, understated, deep, and so incroyably French! While most say - and, I agree - the movie rides on Omar Sy's very capable shoulders, the music is the Horse that Omar Sy rides on.Ludovico Einaudi could not have done a better job if he had the invisible hand helping him.If you want a deeply moving movie that makes you laugh out loud, helped along by a background of soulful classical music that gently intertwines with funk, or if you want a movie that pokes fun at art while being deeply reverent of it all at the same time, or if you just want a movie that simply ticks all the boxes and then creates some new ones - this will be it.And to the French sensibilities, I once again take my hat off!",10,2,5,7 May 2016
District 9," I just watched Avatar and yet...
","I have just watched Avatar yesterday and it completely blew my mind. The visuals were stunning and I thought it was one of the greatest movies to have been ever made.I am still in the Avatar euphoria, yet, yet, YET, this movie re-composed my mind, only to blow it away yet again. The only difference is that it blew it away more absolutely than Avatar did.If you are not into the Alien, Science Fiction, Creature, Documentary stuff the off chance is that you might not like it. I say off chance because so far there is only two people who I think will not care for it much - my father and my sister, but all the others, the movie will make converts of.This is how direction should be. This is how pacing should be. This is how humor should be woven into drama. This is how the sound track should be. This is Science Fiction at its best yet! Come to think of it, I have been visiting IMDb even since it came on, and this movie actually made me register and write a review.By Zarquon, this is the proverbial it.",10,37,67,24 December 2009
The Grand Budapest Hotel," What a tale!
","A simple, straightforward story of people with very human failings of love, greed, compassion, and desire so beautifully told.A peaceful, lilting tale of colour, laughter, and more than a hint of nostalgia. This movie is most definitely worth a watch no matter what genre you are a fan of.Some might feel that a 10 on 10 is overkill, but as the end credits were rolling, I felt a sense of fulfillment, of happiness, and a bittersweet feeling. All marks of a movie that is beautifully made.To use the most routine of phrases, like Moonrise Kingdon (another of my favourites) this is Wes Anderson crafting a movie with love. If you did like Moonrise Kingdon, you will definitely love this one.",10,4,7,27 July 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Jabberwockingly impossible to review!
","*Situation Alert:I watched it in 3D on am IMAX screen*The first scene ripped my eyeballs off from their sockets and plastered them to the screen, and there they stayed, resolutely, unwaveringly.Meanwhile, somewhere else in the upper cranial regions, my mind was being pounded into synaesthetic pulp at what was a surreal, visceral, sensory orgasm of a movie.I have never watched a single Mad Max movie. I have never seen a single trailer or a promo photo of this movie. I just went in, and at the end of the movie, I stayed back to collect the atomised remains of my mind before I could walk out.Had I walked out earlier, I would have been a gawping, drooling retard trying to find the meaning of what movie making is, only to return once more to the screening.If a picture speaks a thousand words, an movie speaks a million; MadMax with its barely-a-legal-sheet-full dialogue mashes the dictionary into pulp and writes a whole new one.If there is one movie you could watch this entire year, this should probably be it.To the makers of the movie, I take my hat off. What a ride it was. What a lovely day!",9,3,8,18 May 2015
