Marie Antoinette," very intrigued, but haven't seen it yet
","I am looking forward to seeing this movie but I need to know: Is there any nudity (at all) in it? I need to know this information before I decide whether or not to bring younger siblings/cousins/friends.Thanks - sorry for the completely uninteresting thread topic :)what is with this ten line limit? jeez Louise...or should I say Louis XVI!!ha ha i kill mek thanks again BYEAlso, in regards to comments about MA's accent (or lack thereof) - I think it's silly to get so hung up on that one detail. With so much history to discuss, why worry about one detail?",5,2,12,8 October 2006
