The Rock," An action movie with everything.
","I have simply not seen a bad Sean Connery movie. There was Entrapment... but his acting wasn't bad in that movie either.Well in The Rock, Sean Connery does well again, and this time the movie supports his role very well. There's action, good humor, some thought inspiration, and even a little bit of suspense.The plot is pretty solid and believable, which only adds to the movie. Each of the main characters are played well by their respective actors too. The humor is mixed in evenly and keeps the movie from getting anything but dull.This movie is one of my most favorite action flicks of all time.",9,1,1,27 May 2000
The 13th Warrior," Don't go looking for problems.
","This movie pulled in some strongly negative criticism and I can't understand why.Indeed, it has plot holes but those aren't as glaringly apparent as some would like to portray them. You really have to think about it to find the problems in the storyline. Of course, there lies the solution to the problem. This movie wasn't made to be scrutinized.As for the good points... It was humorous at times, featured some exciting battle scenes, and even gave a bit of philosophy. It's just simply an entertaining movie.",9,0,0,3 July 2000
Spice World," Watch it for the movie, not the actresses.
","Ok, so maybe Spice World features the Spice Girls. I'm not a fan but I saw this movie anyway.Well it was hilariously funny. The Spice Girls are obviously good natured enough (either that or very very greedy) that they would make a movie that pokes so much fun at themselves.The story line actually made a little bit of sense too. Well it wasn't logical, but it was cohesive enough that you wouldn't get lost.So in the end, it was very funny; which gives it high marks. After all, it is a comedy. Go in ready to watch, quit complaining about the stars, and just enjoy the show.",7,1,2,28 May 2000
Scream," What is it trying to be?
","After everybody else on the planet had seen this movie, I felt I should give it a try too. My decision came too late and I had to rent it on tape.Well the experience at the theaters would probably have been the same. There were a few parts where I jumped but aside from that, nothing really stood out about this movie.Scream tried to be a mystery in a way since the villain was never revealed to the audience until the very end. In most horror movies, the audience gets a third person perspective that's privy to almost everything. So Scream doesn't do that and therefore, it's a bit like a mystery. But the storyline never gave the audience enough information. When the movie finally reveals the killer, I got the feeling I was cheated since I probably would have been able to figure it out had the movie given more info. The motive the killer gave really sounded tacked on too.Scream also tried to be a horror movie but it got its' thrills through cheap ways (like loud and sudden noises). Nothing about the movie itself was really scary. There was gore, but that's not scary. Scream's stuff doesn't make you spooked from bumps in the night.So Scream isn't a horror movie, and it's not a mystery movie. I think it's more a drama but the vague character development (everything we learned about the main character's past was pretty much from the last 15 mins of the movie in the killer's big ending speech) doesn't qualify it for that. This movie gets low marks in my opinion.",5,1,3,27 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," Thought provoking movie on a thought provoking subject.
","This movie was great. It will change the way you think about life after death.Well... Maybe not. But it certainly raises some good points. In the least bit, you'll get a kick out of the ending.And if you don't, it's because you didn't pay enough attention.Respect this movie and you'll enjoy it.",10,0,0,26 May 2000
