Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Satire in One of Its Finest Cinematic Moments: In Short, FUNNY!
","I'd been waiting to see this movie for a long time, and I was not disappointed. From the very beginning, to the very end, the movie will make you laugh. Cohen (Borat) is brilliant, as is the material. The key lies in a hilarious blend of Borat's innocence, naivet√©, preoccupation with everything sexual, and Borat's fear of Jewish people. In addition to the material, the film is also hilarious because of Cohen's ability to play the straight man with such conviction, in the presence of complete strangers (usually). Cohen's character pushes the boundaries of nearly every politically incorrect subject, and while this in itself is not funny, the fact that Cohen is making fun of people who are really racist or sexist or bigots in real life IS what's funny. This is what people don't understand. In fact, 5 minutes into the movie, a couple sitting next to me in the theater actually got up and left the theater. This movie, this actor, the character he created (Ali G is equally funny), and the material IS NOT being insensitive or racist or xenophobic or politically incorrect. What this movie is doing is actually making fun of people who are really like this; that's why it's called satire. Cohen is turning the mirror unto the face of the real enemy, ignorance, while simultaneously advertising the scary reality: that there are people in this world who hate others because the color of their skin, or their sexual orientation, or the higher power they worship differs from what they are used to. These people are everywhere; maybe it's your next door neighbor, maybe it's you. So, if you see Borat and find it disturbing, it's either because 1) you don't appreciate the satirical quality of this film; and/or, 2) you are one of these people that the film is making fun of, and don't appreciate the kind of inequality or unfair treatment with which your perspective is being dealt.",9,4,14,5 November 2006
The Ring," Sophisticated horror
","The PG-13 rating got me thinking the film was going to be another awful teen slasher flick, and for the first 30 mins. that's what I though I was in for. However, after the first time the audience sees what 'The Ring' (i.e.video) can do, my expectations were raised, as was my attention. The editing is wonderful; fast-paced, cutting, almost violent. The film relies on this among other excellent methods of filmmaking. The film's use of dak color allows for a macabre, creepy, morose, and unsettling feel. The fluidity of motion sustains the high level suspense. What you think is just another ferry ride turns into a first rate chase scene featuring a horse gone mad from an unknown, but malevolent force. This is why the filmmakers could get away with a PG-13 rating. The film is sophistcated; a cut above the rest of other low-grade horror movies because it doesn't need obligatory, bloody, body gashing scenes to provide the audience with a scare factor. The 'video tape' is itself a wonderful example of filmmaking. It has an edgy, artsy feel to it. In fact, some of the images in the video aren't fully explained. Some of the images are simply weird and disturbing, but because the images are so striking, they deny need for full explantion. There are a few aspects of The Ring that aren't explained at all, but because they are so visually appealing and shocking, the need for detailed explanation is often not necessary. What I thought was most powerful about the film was the antagonist. It is truly evil, and evil for so many reasons including the fact that the evil is almost omnipotent in nature. It knows where to get you. Victims are killed mercilessly not because they are torn apart or cut in half by some hockey mask wearing man, but because death is the only thing that's certain when the onslaught of The Ring's power is unleashed. The victim is faced with a raw, merciless, and ugly death. And because the origin of the evil is not explained, this adds to the omnious enviroment the film is saturated with. This film is disturbing, and that is where the film's power comes from. Watch The Ring for the adrenalin rush; don't try to make sense out of it. Let it take you where it will, and you will enjoy it much more. The Ring stirs the senses, making us supremely aware of all the things in our world we can't explain. And what we have no explantion for, we are often at the mercy of.",8,0,0,14 November 2002
Alien," Vagina Dentata
","This film preys on mankind's fears of the omnipotent female presence. There are queens, vaginal alien devices,the central computer is called 'Mother,' and the thought of involuntary impregnation (face huggers), are all metaphorical vehicles on which the notion of power and death rely. This film is poetic, powerful and cinematic. Some feminists may disagree with me and say that my assessment is wrong, but what Scott is doing with all the female metaphors is simply re-instating the ultimate power of the life-giving (the queen laying eggs), life-sustaining (the drones impregnating their human hosts with their own alien species), and equally life-taking (they kill the host body they have used in order to lay their eggs), presence of the mother figure. Women are powerful. We have the capacity to give life or kill it, and this movie is an over simplification of this fact. Is this good? That depends on your point of view.",9,1,3,2 February 2007
The Village," Major Tease
","M. Night Shylayman breaks a very important rule in the realm of storytelling: never film-flam your audience. This is not to say that a director should not invite twists in the plot; but, the way he attempted to make you believe the setting was back in the 1800's, when it was really present day, but he didn't tell you this til the end was wrong. I felt insulted and cheated and let down. It was a cheap and dirty trick in the name of retaining audience attention and awe. Instead of thrilling us, all he managed to do was scam a good paying audience.Other than the end, the film is actually decent, the premise is scary and disturbing, and the acting is very good. In fact, Bryce Dallas Howard, is the movie's one bright spot.This movie has gotten mixed reviews, so the best thing to do is to watch the movie yourself.",7,0,0,4 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," Plot Problems
","WARNING: SPOILER!
My review of X Men 2 is that it was OK. 7 stars out of 10. I was anxious to see the film, even waited in line for it, but as the credits began to roll, I was filled with more questions than with a satisfied feeling. There are lots of holes in the plot, too many questions left unanswered. If this were intentional because XMen fans would 'know', it's unfair and sloppy to the rest of us who are not pros.Though the film does pick up where it left off, and highlights from the first film, like Logan's sense of humor  (though it is not as apparent in X2 because he doesn't have Cyclops to play off of) are present,there are too many problems with the flow of the film in regardso logic.Here are the findings I could list; I'm only allowed 1,000 words:1) early on, we are introduced to a cool, silvery fellow whose body richoets bullets. We see him briefly, he offers to help Wolverine, then he disappea rs into a chamber in the school with the other students. And that's it. We never see him again. X3?2)the secret serum Stiker uses is not explained at all. Where did it come from? How does it work? Why does it work? Singer may have given the rest of us who are not XMen pros too much credit to figure it out on our own.3) Night Crawler opens the film. Great action sequence, but if he is such a noble and humble and spirtual creature, why would he antagonize the President? Was he given Striker's serum? We assume so. In the church scene, Storm finds the tell-tale sign Striker's serum leaves on the nape of his victim's neck: a mark like that of a burn. But this is never reaized on film.4)It does not make sense for the XMen to trust Magneto and Mystique so quickly.5) Jason 134's presence should be more clear; his relationship to Striker and to the movie's central plot to those of us who are not XMen2 pro's. This shadiness skews the film somewhat if you do not follow the film closely because it is the film's pivotal angle. You have to understand Jason's role clearly, otherwise, the film loses clarity.6)Cyclops' being under the influence of Striker's serum should also be explained. We hardly see him at all in the film, then when we do in the middle, he attacks Jean. We don't see him being given the serum, but apparently he is.7) Jean Gray dying in the flood is not necessary and avoidable. After she can't hold the water anymore, Night Crawler could have transported to her, retrieved her, then she could have been revived. But they leave her there! The explanation? 'She made a choice'.8)Singer teases the audience with the truth about Logan's past. Logan has a few flashbacks in the tank chamber, but maybe there could be more to appease us?9)I wanted to see more of the other XMen; Wolverine, Storm, Mystique, Magento, Jean Gray, and Striker were the majority of the film.10) And for those of you who like flubs............When they are at Bobby's house (Iceman), Logan goes outside on the backyard patio, look for about 1/4 of a camera, and a wire, in the upper right hand side of the screen. It's reflected in the sliding glass door behind him.11)Pyro's desire to team up with Magento is simplistically realized. His roguish nature and refusal to follow the rules are obligatory and obviously leading up to a departure from the 'those who follow the rules' (ie the Xmen).12) Why don't the Xmen show more emotion when they realize Magento turns on them after they foolishly trust him in the first place?All in all, it is a okay movie, but problems with logic prevent it from being any better",7,0,0,5 May 2003
