Hereditary," Ari Aster has a beautifully twisted talent!
",This is by far one of my favorite'horror' movies ever!!! With essentially no jump scares this film still shocked and scared the hell out of me. You will go through the tensest 1:45 minutes of film to get to (In my opinion) the most disturbing 20 minutes of film I've ever seen. My mouth was literally on the ground. You know it's coming.... And the payoff is absolutely shocking! Aster's films (for me) are a beautiful new 'horror' genre. A MASTERPIECE!,10,1,4,23 December 2019
Us," It had potential √∞≈∏Àú‚Äô
",While I enjoyed certain parts and what Peele was going for but it just didn't come together for me. Major disappointment after Get Out.,5,1,1,30 November 2019
Climax," Is this even a movie?
",This isn't a movie or film. It's a experience! I I recommended watching at night on a HD TV. Don't watch this on a phone or tablet and expect the same experience. Also make sure you commit to watching it without interruptions. It requires that for the full effect. Super 'arthouse' but Gaspar Noe's films aren't exactly your typical walk in the park.,9,2,4,23 December 2019
Get Out," Didn't see that plot twist coming!
",One of the best horror movies in recent years IMO. Now a days almost everything has that ' been done before' feel. I definitely didn't think the plot twist would go as far as it did üëåüèª,8,0,4,30 November 2019
