The Rock," GREAT FILM
","This movie had it all.Comedy,Action,Great story,Plot,Characters.it was just a great overall film with terrific performances by Harris and Cage as well as Connery for his age.I was mightly impressed by this film and i hope there isn't a sequel because i am not a fan of sequels and maybe that would just ruin a terrific movie.",10,1,1,1 March 2001
The Sixth Sense," what a twist!!!!!!
","Wow what a twist at the end. I never saw that coming at all,its funny at that point i was like how is this going to end? I never thought that would happen.M.Night Shyamalan is an absolute genius in creating this film.",10,2,3,2 March 2001
The Godfather," THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
","If there is a movie better than this then I have yet to see it.There isn't really a word to describe how good this movie actually is!! from start to finish this movie has you staring at the screen in amazement.No actor in this film lets it down and was shown by the academy awards when the best actor category was filled with actors from the godfather,never in history has that happened.",10,0,2,22 February 2001
