The Blair Witch Project," wooow
","This is by far the best horror movie I have ever seen. It's very original, and everything looks REAL. That's what makes it so great.This is the perfect proof that you can really create some scary sh*t even without special effects, or clever camera work, or hideous monsters.
Three students go deep in the woods to make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. They disappeared... and the footage was found a year later. The movie is actually a documentary-style presentation of what the kids have filmed during their quest.So... everything's filmed on 16 mm, with cameras held by the actors. First, they interview some people in the village next to the forest the Witch is supposed to be in. And then they go deep in the forest. Only to get lost.
So. There are NO effects. No monsters. No witches, or killings, or horrifying images. There are 2 handy cams, held by the actors, and nothing else.Still, throughout the whole movie, your heart beats like crazy.
What makes this so scary? Maybe just the fact that it DOESN'T have effects. So it all looks real. Or the documentary-style. The noises in the night. Their discoveries. When they get lost, the forest looks haunting. And - honestly - whenever there was night, I kept hoping dawn will kick in soon.
This is an amazing movie. Vote: 10 out of 10.",10,2,3,29 December 2002
Meet the Parents," 2 fabulous actors
","When you mix 2 great actors like Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller, and a good well written script, the result could only be a good movie.Meet the Parents is the story of a guy, Ben Stiller, who wants to marry his girlfriend, Teri Polo, but before that has to meet her parents. And when the girl's dad, Robert de Niro, is an ex-CIA agent, the things can only get complicated.Robert de Niro is absolutely great, and after the funny Analyze This, he shows again that he can be a great comedian. Ben Stiller is the same really funny guy, playing a character with a name that needs no further explaining: Gaylord Focker. The movie is good, full of interesting scenes, funny gags and smart dialogue. Still it's a simple comedy with a normal ending. Vote: 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,10 January 2001
Unbreakable," I'm still under shock
","Wooow wotta great and unexpected ending :) Don't worry, you can keep on reading this comment, i will not spoil it for you... 'Unbreakable' is a very good film. M Night Shyamalan proves to every one of us that the great 'Sixth Sense' was not just an accident, and that his talent is huge.Unbreakable is an impressive story about life, but, more importantly, about heroes. When David (Bruce Willis) survives a train crash in which 131 people die, Elijah (Samuel L Jackson) comes up with an incredible explenation: that Bruce might be a hero. The exact opposite of Elijah, who has a bad bone disease.That's all i'm going to say about the subject. Bruce Willis does a very good job in, probably, his third great role ever, after 12 Monkeys and Sixth Sense. He gives a certain depth and believability to his character, a possible hero, in Elijah's opinion. Samuel L Jackson is, as usual, awesome. He is definetely one of the best actors in Hollywood nowadays. The psychological conflict is strong, giving birth to some great scenes. And, as i said, the ending is very surprising - i never expected that.Maybe the best thing about Unbreakable is that Shyamalan doesn't fall in the 'action' trap that many people thought he would. He makes a film about heroes and bad guys without any action sequences. Well, only one, even that one short and realistic. Good job.All in all, a great film, a great start for a year that hopefully will be better than 2000.Vote: 8 out of 10.PS Please stop comparing this movie with The Sixth Sense. They have nothing in common one with the other, except for the director and Willis. I read in a magazine, in an article about this film: 'Unbreakable: the sequel of The Sixth Sense'. They couldn't have been more wrong! The 2 films are totally different, and both are great. I love The Sixth Sense more, though...",8,0,0,6 March 2001
Shakespeare in Love," totally deserves the Oscars
","The movie is the story of young William Shakespeare in a lack of inspiration and with no money. He meets Viola, a beautiful girl who steals his heart, who changes his whole destiny.The idea, fictious, is great. Many funny gags and interesting situations, and probably one of the few original films of the last years.
Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Lady Viola, and she deserves her Oscar completely. I feel sorry that Joseph Fiennes was left out, cause he was really good too.Fill in a great soundtrack, and a dog, and you have a terrific movie.",8,1,3,31 May 2001
Ed Wood," HUUUUGE surprise...
","I didn't know anything about this movie until i saw it. All i knew was that it's an autobiographical film about an old bad director.I was surprised to see a great film, and the shock came from the first seconds when i saw that it's black and white. A sign of originality.Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, a stupid movie director from a long time ago, desperately fighting with all his critics and with his financiary problems to see his dreams come true. Never give up. That's the best line for this film. No matter what, never give up in trying to accomplish your dream. Ed Wood, although it's obviuos that he's really bad, has one huge quality, that every filmmaker wannabe should have: the perseverence. He keeps trying and trying and with the help of old Dracula, Bela Lugosi, he succeeds in one of his films.
Johnny Depp is great as Ed Wood and manages to play another brilliant role to add to his long list. Also good points for Landau and Sarah Jessica Parker.All in all, very good and nice to watch. Do yourselves a favor and don't miss this one. You'll be surprised, just like i was.",7,2,2,7 January 2001
Romeo + Juliet," amazing
","This is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. The story of Romeo and Juliet, set in the modern age, with guns, drugs and fast cars, but still maintaining the rhymes and texts of the initial Shakesperean story. Bazz Luhrmann's brave concept is surprisingly good. It doesn't fall in  the mistakes made by most classic stories adapted to the modern age. Di Caprio and Danes are perfect together, the filming and editing is also better than in most movies nowadays. Luhrmann has created a masterpiece. Vote: 9.5 out of 10.",9,1,2,29 July 2002
BASEketball," and i laughed, and i laughed...
","BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy.The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors in this film, play very good, surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time i see them as actors. The movie oftenly reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows.

The Patriot," Oscar material
","The Patriot is a great movie that definitely deserves to be at least considered in the race for the Oscars. I think it could have won also the Golden Globes. Don't get me wrong, i liked Gladiator very much, but this one is at least as good as Crowe's film.I think it's useless for me to tell you the story: you probably already know it. Just let me tell you that i was totally sursrised by the touching way this movie was done. It's awesome, it doesn't even allow you to blink, it makes you cry, smile, but most of all admire everything on screen.Mel Gibson plays great a difficult role. He is just like he has to be, and - my opinion - better than in Braveheart. But the huge surprise comes from Ronald Emerich. A director that started with normal SciFi's, then he specialised in destroying american cities (Washington in Independence Day, LA in Godzilla), now with The Patriot, he enters in the category of really great directors. He created a surprisingly touching and sensitive film, also spectacular and entertaining.This is definetely one of the best movies of 2000, if not the best one.

Being John Malkovich," brilliant
","This is a brilliant movie. It brings up so many questions about who we actually are, what makes us tick, what makes us say what we say and do what we do. Spike Jonze amazes with this film - a total unexpected surprise.

Dark City," fabulous
","Dark City is simply great. A great film that i recommend to all movie lovers out there, whether they like or don't like SF's.Dark City is a complex thriller - fiction title that has many new things and a great story. A place where people have no past, no memories, nothing true to relate them to their real lives. A place where people are subjects to an alien experiment about their souls, about what makes them human.The story, as i said, is really complex, original and well built. There are, still, moments when this movie reminds me of Matrix, especially in the beginning, when Sutherland contacts Sewell and tells him that he is the one, and people are after him right as they speak.Except for the great plot and story, once you see this title, you will not be able to forget the great atmosphere. The city where there is no sun is greatly built. There's a touch of the 40s and 50s, with the rooms and buildings and also the hats people wear. There is also  a powerful sense of 12 Monkeys, well not actually 12 Monkeys, but of Terry Gilliam.The directing is good, the acting also, maybe except for William Hurt's. A guy that never manages to escape from his low style of playing.All in all, Dark City is a 'must'. Go see it, you won't be sorry. Vote: 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,5 April 2001
Pearl Harbor," good and bad
","This movie has two distinct parts:-- The love story, which is awfully cheesy and full of cliches, with not a single trace of originality;-- The attack at Pearl Harbor, probably the best, most impressive action scene ever shot in a movie.

The Usual Suspects," Can't get any better than this
","Wow... The Usual Suspects is definetely the best crime/police movie ever. It's absolutely brilliant, as plot, acting, directing, editing... everything. But the best of all is the fabulous Kevin Spacey, an actor that never ceases to amaze me. He plays superbly the role of Verbal Kint, one of the 5 guys. The movie is awesome, and the way the story is told reminds me a little bit of Tarantino. This is definetely a must for everyone. Still doesn't have the originality to deserve a 10. So my vote: 9.",9,0,1,26 December 2000
Remember the Titans," surprisingly good
","When i saw on the screen 'Walt Disney Entertainment', i thought it would be a weak movie that i would not like. Well i was wrong. Remember the Titans is a great film, raising important issues like racism in the 60s, years of great changes concerning the black people. The football is actually in the second place, cause this movie isn't mainly about football, but about freindship no matter what is your skin colour.Denzel Washington plays brilliantly again, just like he always does. But every single actor in this movie did well and kept up with the great pace that Denzel brings.There still is a bad point: it's way too predictable. You can figure out the ending after you have seen 10-15 mins of the film.But that isn't so important. All it matters is that you will not regret watching this one. Vote: 7.5 out of 10.",8,2,5,5 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wow! Flying men!
","This is probably the WORST movie that was ever nominated for the Oscars. A complete failure, from all points of view, that somehow turned upside down the heads of all americans (including the critics).Okay, i must admit, it is not really that incredibly bad. But considering that it's been nominated and even won some Golden Globes and Oscars make it look like something really great, which is not.Why, you ask? Well let me tell you.First, the plot. Yes, it's intriguing and complex, but it has absolutely nothing special in it. A plot concerning a stolen sword, the attempts to recover it, everything mixed in with a love story between a girl about to marry someone she didn't love and a crook determined to change.As you can see, nothing special. Then , the dialogues. Some of them are really stupid and unappropriate (maybe it's because of the doubling in English), some normal and only a few really good. The characters: except for the girl, played beautifully by Michelle Yeoh, they are all pretty un-interesting. Okay... then open the book with all the cliches in the american films, and you'll see that most of them are in this one. It's full of them, sometimes i even had the urge of leaving the theater, but the only thing that kept me in was the laziness and sleeping feeling that i had because of the movie. Example of a cliche? The almost ending scene, in which Jade Fox is about to be killed and, just like in all the cheap B-type action flicks, she confesses everything, what she wanted to do and why, because the movie was unable to make you understand these things by yourself.At least the ending was a bit better and saved the general poor aspect of definetely the most overrated movie of all times. But even in the ending, and although i watched the movie carefully, the dramatic scenes never made me sorry, not even one bit. Although in many movies i am touched if the ending is dramatic. Here, i didn't feel sorry at all, maybe because that Ang Lee didn't manage to make you really feel for the characters.Oh, and another thing... the action scenes, although some of them really well made, are so ridiculous sometimes... when there were the flying scenes, with these men travelling like UFO's from tree to tree, laughter raised from the whole theater. And for a good reason.All in all, if you haven't seen this one, don't let yourself be fooled by most opinions in here. This is just another low class asian movie, only with a bigger budget that made it have the door opened in Hollywood.Vote: 4 out of 10.",4,1,2,31 May 2001
Men in Black II," this is not the exception....
","Sequels are never good movies. And MIB 2 is not the exception. When the producer/writer/director cares only about money, and how to make more of them, it can never end up good. After the huge commercial success of the first part, i expected a sequel. But how can you make a good movie, when the most important part is missing, originality? And how can you make a good movie, when the only goal is to get as many people in theaters as possible?MIB2 is just 90 mins of exageration. More aliens, more bugs, better special effects. Still the movie fails to deliver what fans expected. The gags are so much worse than on the first part, the plot is simply childish, and all you're left with after you leave the theater is the strange feeling in your mouth, that you have watched something weird. A movie with huge investments, talented actors, that is far inferior to most low-budget movies out there. Because, after all, movies are not all about special effects, but about story, plot, characters, actors etc. And MIB 2 suffers in all these categories.Doesn't deserve more than 4 out of 10.And i don't know why, but i have a feeling: MIB3 will be worse than this.",4,0,0,6 August 2002
Dumb and Dumber," plain old cr*p
","I never was a fan of Jim Carrey. To me he's not more than a stupid actor who has no idea how to play his roles and to get out of this monotony he keeps making faces all movie-long. This is why, of course, i did not like this movie at all. It's plain old stupid, and i can't believe the rating is of 6.2!! This proves the low intelligence of most of the users in here... This movie is really bad. Actually it's normal, it's a Jim Carrey movie. Full of stupidity, stupid people and stupid situations. It didn't make me laugh at all, i just smiled a couple of times at some good gags. Gags that were good not because of Carrey, but because of the ideas of the screenwriter.

It's the life story of David Helfgott, a pianist, how he becomes famous and then how he suffers a breakdown.

Pulp Fiction," probably the best movie ever
","It all began with RESERVOIR DOGS. An unbelievebly real movie that got a new name in the minds of all movie lovers acrossed the world: QUENTIN TARANTINO. PULP FICTION continues what Reservoir Dogs started, and proves that Quentin is indeed one of the best and most original directors ever. Who else could write three attractive totally different stories, and get them together into a thrilling 3 hour movie that will not even allow you to breathe? And probably the best part about the movie is the dialogue: fast, ingenious, exciting. Perfect. Two guys, John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson, almost screw up a job they have to take care of. A boxer, Bruce Willis, just before a fight in which he's asked to lose. Two thieves, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deciding to rob a restaurant. Take these three stories, put them together in a bowl, and shake as much as you can. Result: a brilliant film. A big-size puzzle that will make you think. I know that it's one of the most known movies in the world. But if by any chance you have done the stupid thing of not seing it, then hurry up. Cause Quentin's not wasting time: new masterpieces are coming up soon.Vote: 10 (out of 10",10,2,6,7 November 2000

Scream 2," this should've been the last
","After the huge success with the best horror of all time, Scream, Wes Craven comes back with the sequel: Scream 2. Unlike most of the sequels, this one does not suck. Actually it's a very good movie. But not as good as the original. 2 years after the events in the first film, the terror starts again for Sidney. A killer copycats the murders from Woodsboro, exactly in the week of the premiere of Stab, movie made after the events in the first part.Scream 2 does a very good job with the story and the action scenes: very well done and some of them very tensed. Still the phone-terror used in the first part is not that developed and scary. Except for this element, Wes keeps everything that goes well in the original. Including the very clever dialogue that worked so good in Scream.After a surprising success (nobody expected Scream 2 to be a good movie, after the fabulous first part), Wes Craven should've stopped while he was on top. But he didn't. He chose more money in stead of being the undisputed God of horror films. And so Scream 3 was born: much much weaker and stupider than the first 2. Scream 2 was very good and if you're a fan of horrors go watch it. You'll like it. Vote: 8 out of 10.Oh, one more thing. 'What's your favourite scary movie?' 'Showgirls.

Die Hard with a Vengeance," who said sequels always s*ck?
","I watched Die Hard 3 for the first time about 2 years ago and i totally loved it. I am not a huge action movie fan, i always loved more the movies that actually use your brain at least a little bit, but i have to say that this film is probably one of the best action movies i have ever seen. I saw it again last night and, again, i liked it a lot.It's maybe one of the very few cases in which the sequel is better than the original. Cause Die Hard 3 is better, more spectacular and more thrilling than both DH1 and DH2. This time, Bruce Willis (John McClane) has to deal with the brother of the terrorist he killed in the first part - role played very well by Jeremy Irons. Simon (that's his name) puts Bruce to a series of games, riddles and puzzles, decided to revenge for what Bruce did to his brother.Well in this movie Bruce is not alone fighting the bad guys. He has a new 'best friend' - a black racist played absolutely superbly by one of my all time fav actors, Samuel L Jackson. They are brilliant together, with very funny one liners and a perfect chemistry. (They both have played in another movie - Pulp Fiction - but in that film they actually never had not even one scene together).The movie kicks off very good, with Simon (Jeremy Irons) putting the duo to a series of mind games, with the threat of blowing up high quality bombs in public places. The first part of the film is thrilling and exciting - that's what i call a perfect action movie. You just can't get your eyes off the screen. The second part is a bit different though. The action loses from imagination and thrill once we get to the point where we find out what Simon really wants. From this moment, the film becomes a classic action, with no difference from all the action movies out there.In conclusion, an enjoyable film, that you definetely should watch. I think the only action movie better than this one is Speed. Vote: 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,7 December 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," brilliant
","Last night i saw this movie for the second time and i enjoyed it as much as the first, it is definetely one of my favorites.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongly accused for the murder of his wife and her lover, and sentenced to 2 life-time penalties in jail. After some difficult years, he gets used with his inmate life, but doesn't give up the hope of being free again. All this with the help of his best friend, Red (Morgan Freeman).The movie is brilliantly directed, brilliantly written and brilliantly played. Darabont makes a great debut as director with a movie of a quality that he probably will not be able to equal in the rest of his career. And when you think that the writing credits belong to the master of horror himself, Stephen King, you definetely can be only surprised. Stephen managed to write something else than his fabulous horrors. A touching sensitive drama about friendship, honesty, injustice, and more than everything else, about hope.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great in their roles. They manage to bring a certain depth to their characters, and these aren't easy roles at all. But they come to the end with success and they deserve all the praises in the world for their performances.All in all this movie is a must for all the movie fans out there.

Any Given Sunday," another masterpiece
","'Any Given Sunday' keeps the unmistakable style of Oliver Stone, especially seen in Natural Born Killers, transporting it this time in the new, agitated, full of events world of american football.Al Pacino is the coach of a football team, owned by the greedy Cameron Diaz, team that passes through difficult times, after 4 consecutive defeats and the injury of the best 2 quarterbacks. In this moment enters Beaman (Foxx), the 'always substitute', and he doesn't miss the unexpected chance awarded by the coach. By his style of play, spectacular, but not caring about the tactics and the schemes, he wins the heart of the fans, but enters in the disgrace of the coach.The world of football is an eternal source of  stories or problems that can be used in a movie. After he showed us wars, from many points of view, the murder of JFK, the agitated history of The Doors, or the satire against the media in Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone enters on an unused territory so far. And he does it in style, with an exceptional movie.One thing must be clear: this is not a movie only for football fans, but for everybody. Because it's not a movie necessarily about football, but about team spirit, about friendships, joys or troubles, a film with strong characters played by really special actors. A film that will keep your interest at high levels, despite its long runtime, by the fabulous style of Stone, but also by the story, full of events dictated by interests or the rush for money, that many times dims freindships or any bit of morality.During the movie, you are taken through the backstage of american football. You will discover a dirty world, full of interests and passions, far of the beauty observed from outside. Al Pacino is a character caught between the desire of winning  every match no matter what and the friendship that ties him with 'old' Rooney, who injures himself at the beginning. Beaman is a young football player, selfish, insensitive, but with an extraordinary talent. Many times, the sudden pass from anonymity in the spotlights can bring with it major changes in the character's personality, changes that can only be bad. That's what happends to Beaman. The selfishness, the interest only for himself, bring major misunderstandings between him and his teammates or his coach. Al Pacino has the tough mission of bringing the team to the desired levels, calming down the spirits and also making the difficult decision concerning the quarterback: Beaman or Rooney. New or old. Talent or team player.Although the script is very good, the film wouldn't have had the same value without Oliver Stone on board. He shows us again, one more time, his great talent. By his awesome way of filming, that reminds us of NBK, the fast paced, incredibly real dialogues, or last, but not least, the full of significance 'inserts' with what he feasted our eyes and mind also in NBK, you actually feel that you are a part of this world, that you are really inside it. You can't even blink without being sorry. Again, the camera moves very quickly, this agressive style, of fast filming, 'short' editing, strange angles or permenent camera movement, being a characteristic of many Stone movies. And the 'inserts' have a special meaning again, especially in the scene of the dialogue between Foxx and Pacino, maybe the best and most significant of the whole movie.All in all, another success for Oliver Stone. A movie added to his impressive collection of masterpieces, of the most varied and original director of our times.",9,1,2,29 January 2001
Space Jam," pleasant watch
","Space Jam is a good entertaining movie. I am a huge basketball fan so there was no way i could have missed this film. Still i expected much more from it. The story is probably known by everyone who got to read this. Bugs, Daffy and the other Looney Tunes, together with Michael Jordan, have to play a match against some aliens that steal the talent of 5 NBA players.It's funny many times, and the idea of mixing real-life and cartoons is very good. If you start watching this, you won't quit til the end, that's for sure. The presence of so many NBA stars is welcomed and adored by all NBA fans out there. Michael is good for his first role and i am convinced that with a little bit of work he could easily become a professional actor. The other NBA stars used in the film are funny, especially Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley, after they lose their talent. Also you'll get to see plaing themselves other stars like Mugsey Bogues, Larry Bird, Bill Murray (funny as he always is - definetely one of my fav comedians nowadays). The soundtrack is also great, especially R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Amazing song.Well these are the good parts. What went wrong with the movie? Some of the scenes are just not funny. I was convinced i'll laugh alot, but i didn't, just because some gags don't work. They're either weak or they have been seen again. The voices of some cartoon characters are not the real ones, which is bad for the movie. And after all it's just a simple comedy.Definetely worth to watch, still can't give it more than a 6 out of 10.",6,2,2,3 January 2001

From this point starts the quest for knowledge, an impressive tale that will keep you watching until the end, although its pretty long runtime (more than 2 1/2 hours).Jodie Foster is brilliant as Ellie, she manages a great performance, alongside Matthew Mc Connaghuey and an also surprisingly good Tom Skeritt.Zemeckis shows the whole story with an extra touch of feeling, and during the film you get connected with the characters, you get to care about them or you get to hate them. But there are no 'bad guys', no character to totally hate. Each one has good points and does good deeds. But they also screw up from time to time.This film is very good so i recommend it to everyone - you won't feel sorry. Vote : 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,2,17 April 2001
