The Expendables 2," Translating Bulgarian to English.
","The scenes with Bulgarians speaking ware not translated correctly. To be clear, they ware translated completely wrong. The sentences ware completely different. For example at one scene the man was saying: 'Stay. at least we are together.' and the translation was: 'Be brave, we'll be home soon.'. Another example can be found here: 'And who are you? Go light candles!' was translated like: 'Where the hell are they, Priest ? Stay out of the way. 'Other than that, it was a good movie. It is a good movie to kill some time, but far from a masterpiece. If you like guns, guns and guns, go watch it.",7,1,1,26 December 2012
