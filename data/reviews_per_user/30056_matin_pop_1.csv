Come and See," one of the best war movies
","when i saw this movie, i thought to myself why they put such a title as 'come and see', and my response was that it was trying to say come and see for yourselves what really happened. in the movie it shows some horrific scenes and some of which you wont believe ever happened, even though it did. its hard to believe that all this occurred. i really liked the ending. some scenes were very surprising to me, i was really startled by some of them and how they were shot. it is one of the best war movies I've seen so far because it did not have special effects and it all seemed very real as if i was there myself. this is not your typical war movie where you know what will happen in the end. the soundtrack was very well picked. some of the shots/scenes were amazing. it was upsetting but this all really happened at some point in history and i believe that everyone should watch and see for themselves the truth and what really went on. this movie is a really good depiction of Hitler's regime and what they did, but also at the same time what the people did to survive.",9,1,1,15 June 2009
