First Man," The Life Journey of the First Man on the Moon
","This is a masterpiece of a movie. It is both visceral and deeply emotional. It is as much about the first American mission that put the first man on the Moon as it is about family, the tensions arising from the given circumstances and love. Everyone who worked on this should be extremely proud because the result is fabulous: the acting is fantastic to say the least, the script is so well judged and carries the story flawlessly, the way it is shot transports you directly in the middle of the action and puts you literally on the Moon, the music, the editing, everything...this has Oscars and Globes and what have you written all over it. Must be seen on a big screen!",10,0,1,28 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Needs a second viewing to be appreciated
","This movie had a phenomenal task. It had to conclude a story 42 years in the making. We can watch it and criticize it by pointing out the plot holes (of which there are many) or the 'insufficiently powerful' story and so on, or we can just sit back, enjoy it, and appreciate the enormous effort and attention to detail that was poured into telling a story about family, friends and choices that we all make in life, regardless of us being on this planet or in a galaxy far, far away. Seeing it for the first time is much like a first date that you've been looking forward to for far too long: there is tension, expectations are high, not everything goes as smoothly as you've hoped and you can even get a bit disappointed. But then...you decide to go on a second date only to discover that you want to be with that person more and more. The acting is solid, Daisy Ridley knocks it out of the park, the entire dynamic between Rey and Kylo/Ben is one of the movie's strongest points, without question. The whole Palpatine thing was the weakest aspect of the movie, but hearing the great Ian McDiarmid was enjoyable nonetheless, he can play the phonebook if he wanted to. Yes, it's a roller coaster ride, a lot of characters, not enough time to establish things, but somehow it all comes together. Best of all, a lot of heart was poured in this movie, so it deserves at least 'a second date'.",6,0,2,28 December 2019
