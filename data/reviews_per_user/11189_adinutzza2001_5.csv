Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A striking example of how humour can manipulate
","I won't pretend that this movie wasn't humorous and I think few people would. This actor can be truly funny, the problem is that when this type of humour is repeated and taken too far you get the feeling something is wrong and start feeling uncomfortable. I think there's a limit between being humorous and disgusting, between being critical and offensive... and this movie crossed this line in the most evident way.OK, so during the first part of the movie I must admit having a really good laugh at some of the jokes. Although already faced with a few sexual and 'toilet' jokes that were out of place, I could still rate the movie as entertaining. That until the naked scene, which left me with my stomach turned and staring at the ceiling...One of the most vulgar and disgusting scenes I've ever seen. What was the need of including something like that and at such a lengtht??And practically what does this film base its humour on? Revealing the worst in people without their consent and have the others laughing in shock at their narrowmindness and stupidity? On depicting men as being led by disgusting instincts in everything they do, showing practically no respect for any human value? On how far you can go shocking people with your triviality: the recipe 'Shock with grossfulness and you'll make people laugh'. Was it trying to ironise people's hidden faults and thoughts? If so the manner is simply terrible and disgusting. Social satire is one thing, while vulgar, mean spirited and deceptive pranks are not showing any true insight into the human condition.What intrigues me most is how this movie is so manipulative, not only with the people starring in it, but also towards the viewers. I was shocked to see how over 50% of the voters gave this a 10. I believe it proves how humour can be manipulative, as under the euphoria of some good jokes people tend to accept all the others as good entertainment. I wonder how many would still find the naked scenes and the toilet jokes funny if being faced ONLY with them. I believe (and hope) that much fewer. I only found out it was interdicted to under 18s when the movie started. That alone should have been a signal to document about the movie a bit before, but unfortunately even the trailer doesn't really predict the vulgarity of the movie, including only the most humorous scenes. Coming out of the cinema I could only think how suggestive the title of the movie was...In Romanian 'Borat' resembles extremely well with the word 'puke'.",1,9,19,7 December 2006
The Notebook," Simply beautiful
","Such a simple story, but told in such a brilliant way! Unsophisticated and emotional, yet permanently keeping you wanting to see more, every time the old lady is asking 'And what happened next?' I think the beauty of this movie can't thoroughly be expressed in words. The recurring image of the lake filled with swans is perhaps defining for the magic of this film. As the story unfolds, the beauty of the scenery mingles with the beauty of the feelings and of the characters. The film makes one start caring for the two from the very first moment we see Noah and Allie in the park and wraps us up with melancholy as the past and present scenes alternate. The acting is at its best and moves a string of emotion in one's heart at most of the times. Allie's exuberance and passion, the quiet yet burning look in Noah's eyes, the old lady's lost and fearful look, old Noah's endless devotion and hope.If you haven't seen this movie, I think you should give it a try and expect more than from a typical romantic story. Romantic or not, I believe this film will wake up emotions in anyone's heart.",10,0,1,22 December 2006
Forrest Gump," why such a low rating???
","What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that 'if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death.' I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding.",10,456,590,14 February 2005
Before Sunset," How close can you get to perfection?
","I found this movie on IMDb during the times it was much higher in ranking...and watched it before the Â‚Sunrise'. However, even with doing so, to me the movie didn't feel it lacked anything. I felt it was perfect in every way.I don't remember how many times I've seen this movie by now but I find myself totally drawn into it each time. It's just that every line, every face expression seem incredibly real and the chemistry between the two is wonderful.In a nutshell, Before Sunset is about Jesse and Celine meeting again 9 years after their one night in Vienna and talking their hearts out on the streets of Paris. However , somehow , none of their words sounds boring. This is a movie with not much going on at the surface but so much hidden on an emotional level. The outcome is an 80 minute journey through the most intimate thoughts of two people, disappointed and matured by life, only through plain dialog and close camera shots.What I love about this movie is how it manages to make everything feel so real, natural and unpretentious. The long camera shots work wonders in creating this feeling of shear reality, simply caught on tape by someone passing by. Just real life, bittersweet and intimate,folding out in front of you. Simple and brilliant, I think these two adjectives perfectly describe its acting, its dialogs, its manner of filming. As actors, Ethan and Julie must be one of the most honest on screen couples I know. The way Jesse looks at Celine, their face expression, their words, it all seems incredibly true and natural. I think the fact both actors participated in the writing of the script made it possible to create a feeling of authenticity rarely seen before. There are so many scenes I love in this movie...basically all are special in their own way, as each gradually reveals one more bit of the characters, their past, their frustrations, their regrets, their real thoughts and feelings for each other.One of the strongest and most emotional scenes for me is their talk in the car, when they finally unburden themselves and reveal how each other's memory has haunted their lives. The way in which touching perfection for one moment in time can make you permanently long for another glimpse of it in everything around you but won't ever be found the same in somebody else.Finally, my favorite scene, Julie's expression while singing the waltz...so painful and moving. And then denying everything: 'So do you plug in this name for each guy that comes by?' 'Yes, of course... what do you think, are you nuts?'The ending is intriguing but one of the best it could have been, leaving so many questions to be answered. Will it be possible that they stay together? Is it possible to find that perfection again after all the time lost? Maybe like Jesse said at the beginning in the library, it all depends if you're an optimist or a pessimist...",10,1,2,23 October 2007
300," Movie or video game??
","I'm not exactly a fan of action movies, but I am not against violent scenes and fights as long as there is a good plot with them. That's what I was expecting from this movie: an interesting storyline together with great film graphics. I only got the second part: the ultimate movie graphics of gratuitous violence, which in itself can't really make a movie worth watching for me.During the whole movie I felt that everything was overly dramatized and over the top, which actually prevented one from caring for those characters. No character depth, all was black or white, the handsome brave Spartans and the evil Persian monsters. No real history reference to make the movie the least realistic: good and evil were simply hyperbolised up to the point the scenes became comic or grotesque. The movie had a great potential to build a good story over the historical background of the Spartans, but ended up totally predictable and with basically no plot. From the very start when including those monsters, it seemed this movie wasn't trying to portray any historical or human reality, but just shock and impress through its graphics. And apparently most of the people fell for it. Just as much a video game could do, but this is not what I am expecting from a movie.Not to mention the sexual scenes (since this sells best and is in line with the good plot), the first one ridiculous in slow motion, the one with the hunchback simply gross. Then the very witty ending, when all 298 die (since basically we had only seen one dying through the whole slaughter until then, while another is gone to let spartans know the tragedy).This film leaves one so totally numb to all the human suffering and so distant to the historical reality and the characters, that it equals playing a video game. If this is what people want to see: men slaughtered, blood and flesh to exclaim after it 'That was really cool', why bother and make a film of it and not the ultimate playstation game?",3,3,6,14 April 2007
