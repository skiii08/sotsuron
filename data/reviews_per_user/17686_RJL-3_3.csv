The Blair Witch Project," Don't Read the Reviews
",To much hype.  Maybe if I wasn't aware that this was a fictional production or maybe if I ever really got lost in the woods I would have reacted differently.  Some great acting - my 19 year old daughter claims it was the most frightening thing she has ever seen.  Go figure! Definitely do a matinee - you don't want these kids getting so rich they do a sequel.,7,0,0,4 August 1999
The Mummy," Not for anyone over the age of 12.
",They tried to give this movie an 'Indiana Jones' feel and didn't succeed. Had to keep my two guests restrained to keep them from getting up to leave in the middle of this 'horror' of a movie. Really hoped this would be a remake of the original.  'Claris' scared the life out of me as a child.,2,1,2,1 June 1999
The Bourne Identity," It would have been nice for someone to read the book!
","The closest resemblance to the Ludlum novel was in title only.  It could have been called the 'Jones' Identity and they would not have had to pay the author a penny. I'm still trying to figure out if this movie had a plot.  It slammed covert ops, portrayed politicians as naive and dishonest(some element of truth), Jason Bourne as invincible, and the French police as bumbling idiots (another element of truth).  Someday a screenwriter will read more, tamper less, and enjoy greater success.  Save your money - enjoy the book.",4,1,2,23 June 2002
