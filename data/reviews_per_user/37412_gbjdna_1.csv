","Not as great as everyone says it is. But it's still pretty good. Bogart and Bergman ere nice. The writing is OK. Maybe I would've liked it more if not many people spoke so highly of it. Same goes for The Shawshank Redemption. Or Die Hard. Or Forrest Gump. People talk so much much about those movies and praise it to such a degree that anyone ho hasn't seen them gets these expectations to see one of the greatest movie of all time. I wouldn't call it one of the greatest, but I will say that it is required viewing for anyone who is interested in cinema. Just one of those movies that you need to watch, but no guarantee that you'll like. That kinda goes for every movie ever made. But hat can I say?",5,2,3,16 December 2015
