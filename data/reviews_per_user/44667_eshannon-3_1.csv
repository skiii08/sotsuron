Hereditary," Shockingly awful
","The worst, hands down movie I've ever seen. I was expecting so much and was left absolutely gobsmacked. Gabriel Byrne was wooden throughout, as if he knew the minute the cameras started rolling that he had made a terrible mistake. Tonight colette was hysterical throughout... and not in a good way. The movie just meanders through the disaster that befalls the family unit. It makes no logical sense. There is no menace at all but a distinct feeling halfway through that the directors have lost their way. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful.... it's just tedious and confusing. Scary movies have failed in later years to impress and this does not disappointed. .. it fails miserably.",1,2,6,16 June 2018
