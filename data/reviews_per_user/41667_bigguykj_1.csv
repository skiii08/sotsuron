The Expendables 2," Threadbare plot holding together overblown action sequences
","This is my first review, I felt I had to ask the voters who gave this such a high rating if they watched the same movie that I did. This is probably the most 'cringeworthy' movie I have watched in recent memory. The over-the-hill gang rides again, and it's not pretty. Literally. As in facial surgery gone bad not pretty. Shooting up from a downwards angle, Stallone's tucked up eyebags make him look Asian. VanDamme really needed to keep his sunglasses on to hide a face that looks like Joan Rivers in the morning. And like most movies centered around the action, the thin plot exists just to string the over-the-top action scenes together. These guys shoot more automatic fire than all the A-Team episodes combined, with only slightly better results. If you want to see action done the right way, watch any of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, not this overblown nightmare. And the dialog? Jokes about the stars' action hero characters fall flatter than week-old soda, why couldn't they hire better writers? Was all the budget spent on ammunition? Score this one a big miss.",2,1,4,4 November 2012
