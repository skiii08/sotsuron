Mission: Impossible III," meh nothing special
","I must say that I had never been much of a mission impossible fan but I saw the first 2 because I have much respect for Tom Cruise even though he's a little nutty. The first one was so so and the second was horrendous. I wasn't going to see 3 because I hated 2 so much but I m a huge J.J. Abrams fan so I saw 3 and I am a little disappointed. The movie has to much action and not nearly enough focus on the plot and especially lame twists, witch made mission impossible 1 enjoyable. Not the best trilogy out their but if you enjoy gun fights and big explosions then you will probably enjoy this. Not my type of movie though.",Null,0,1,11 May 2006
Nacho Libre," Very disappointing, but still has it's moments
","OK let me start off by saying I was pretty much going into this movie expecting Napolian Dynamite 2 but way funnier because.....Jack Black. How wrong I was. First off in my personal opinion the movie never should have been done by Nickalodian (I think I'm spelling that right). I guess Mr. Hess just wanted to aim this movie more towards younger audiences. It really is to bad, with someone like the talent that Jarred Hess has this movie really went to waste. This movie also shows that how much more of a budget increase will have on a motion picture. Fortunatley Nacho did have some humorous moments that did take me back to Napolian. I will not say a word because I don't want to spoil anything. Anyways I give Nacho Libre a 4/10 for sheer disappointment but still being enjoyable for much younger viewers.",Null,0,3,20 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Peter Jackson has captured Fanasty exactley as it should be.
","The thing about Lord Of The rings and why it is so brilliant is because it is probably one of the only motion picture trilogy's that is really unlike any other. How so you may ask?? Well the whole trilogy of Lord Of The Rings is technically one story that takes place in matter of weeks unlike Star Wars or the Godfather which takes place over numbers of years and decades. The reason why the Fellowship Of The Ring is so magnificent is because Peter Jackson has really just made the best Fantasy movie ever created, the dialogue, acting, special effects, and above all else the story is just plain mind boggling. Anyways The Fellowship Of The Ring deserves a 10/10 simple.",Null,1,2,26 June 2006
Spider-Man," Astonishing but has some minor errors
","Spiderman was a great flick that would appeal to most people and most ages. It was fun original and stayed almost as closely accurate to a comic then most superhero movies do. The film had enormous hype and it lived up to most of it's expectations. Their were however a few things that ticked me off. I for one am a huge fan of spiderman and I remember very well the comics I have read. The whole movie I was waiting for spidey to say 'my spidey sense is tingling'. That didn't happen kind of a bummer but not a big deal. The second thing that ticked me off is they didn't use his spidey sense to the full potential. Example- Spidey is fighting Goblin> Spidey shouts something at Jonah Jameson> Goblin puts out spidey in a matter of seconds with some kind of drug that makes him Drowsy. For one Spiderman's spider sense is supposibly able to detect anything minutes or even hours before it happens that's the whole point of his spidey sense. Anyways besides those 2 things the movie is great Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, know one could have played him better. His acting was phenomenal as it is always. Will Dafoe was also great as The Green Goblin and the dialog, script, and special effects were fantastic. Spiderman deserves a 9/10 for being a truly great superhero and staying as true to the comic as most of these superhero movies do. Despite my few problems with the flick I really enjoyed the movie and I suggest everyone to see it.",Null,0,1,29 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Harry Potter that laid the foundation for the rest of the series.
",I recently got a chance to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban for a second time since I had seen it in the theaters almost four years ago. The one thing I can remember when I saw it in the cinema was that I very much disappointed when the credit's rolled. I'm quite certain that over time and the process of maturity my understanding of movies grew and now four years later I have a much much much better and appreciation and understanding for this particular film and why it was done the way it was done. Why Alfonso Cuaron is brilliant is because he showed us you could take a popular kids franchise such as Harry Potter and turn it into a franchise that is a just as popular for adults. I also admire the way Alfonso approached this film as if he was not doing just another movie to fit in with the rest of the series but to approach this film as if he was creating his own personal work of art with his own personal style. All in all Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is fantastic movie with plenty of laughs and thrills. Don't watch this movie expecting to find the same Chris Columbus feel that has now diminished. I am writing this review just over a month before the the sixth harry potter film is released and so far I can definitely say that this adult mood Alfonso created in this movie has continued into the next two and will stay until the end of the series I'm sure.,Null,0,1,31 May 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Mediocre movie that had it's moments but needed a better director.
","Before you read this be warned it does contain MAJOR spoilers so read at your own will! I grew up with the Saturday morning x men cartoons and comics and of all the x men movies I will say that the whole trilogy could have been better. X men 3 was an interesting film, for one they finally released the true Wolverine from the comics but unfortunately didn't have much time to focus on many other characters. For one what an unfortunate waste of some characters Angel being #1 and Juggernaught. I will not even explain how they messed up Jean Grey's role but her death could have been avoided. Probably in the whole movie the only thing that really ticked me off and I mean really was the death of cyclops 30 minutes in. Cyclops is a very important character being that he is supposed to be head of the Mutant school after Xavier. Killing him off is one thing but in my opinion his death was meaningless in the movie and nobody gave a damm. Please forgive me if If I am being to overly critical with his death but I felt he was one the most important x men more so then Wolveine. Unfortunately the killing of much needed characters didn't stop their but probably should have. Anyways I won't spoil anything else go see the movie for yourself and judge. I give X men 3 The Last Stand a 7 out of 10 for being probably the best in the trilogy for it's good acting, great special effects and an all round good story. It just needed a Director and screenwriter who knew X Men a bit better.",Null,1,2,27 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," One of the greatest movies ever made but the best of the Lord Of The Rings.
","The Two Towers is an interesting film. It dosen't have a beginning and it doesn't have an end it's just their keeping 1 and 3 together. Gollum was a breakthrough in CGI and filmaking. After I saw the Two Towers I said to myself 'CGI can do anything now.' Besides the way he looked Andy Serkis was great as the voice of Gollum. I personally thought he deserved a nomination for best supporting actor. Their two things that ticked me off a little though, one was how Gandalf was not in the movie nearly as much as he should have been. He kinda just came and left. I read the books and I was hoping that Gandalf would be shown gathering the Rohirrim riders. Also something else that confused me in the movies is that, at the battle of Helm's deep elves show up?? That never happened in the book either but I guess their are things that are needed to be changed for a movie. Anyways besides those two things the movie was phenomenal. Peter Jackson did the best job anybody could do on a movie like this and it defiantly deserved it's nomination for best picture. The battle for Helm's deep was truly breathtaking to watch. When they defend the keep that exact moment was taken right out of the book and exactly how I pictured it. Well done Mrs. Walsh and Mr. Jackson you have done an amazing job on the script and movie.",Null,2,5,1 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Superb, Ron Howard at his best!
","I just came back from the theatres from seeing the DA vinci code and I will say that I was completely blown away. Unfortunatlley I was one of the few people who didn't get a chance to read the book so their is not much I can say. I thought Hanks did a great job acting as usual and although in some of his films I feel Sir Ian Mckellin over acts, I really enjoyed him in this. I thought he was perfect for the roll. I was very fascinated by the story and it really had me thinking for a while after the movie. I can't for the life of me understand why it's getting such bad reviews, but once again I didn't read the book so I technically can't say much. As usual movies tend to leave out lots of information that the books have but that is to be expected. No matter what, any book is always better then the movie. Anyways I give The Da Vinci Code an 8 out of ten.",Null,3,6,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Potter films are getting better each time but still needs some improvements.
",I am a big fan of the harry potter books and have read all the books at least twice as well I have been following the movies. Anyways Chris Columbus did a mediocre job with the first 2 that would appeal to all ages but mainly kids under 15. When I saw the Prizoner of Azkaban I was more impressed with the movie itself but less impressed with how accuratley Alfonso followed the book. Nevertheless the acting and even the the whole tone of the movie was darker this darkness in TPOA was passed on to the Goblet of Fire. I personally was very impressed with this movie and felt it had a much better flow then movie number 3. Unfortunately the Goblet of fire was my favourite book and I was looking forward to seeing some of my most anticipated parts from the book. For people who have read the book I think that most people who would agree with me that it was vital for the movie to show the scene in the book in the Hospital wing with Cornelius Fudge deniying that Voldemort is back considering that is so important in book number 5 god knows how they'll play that one out. Also many people I talked to were mad about not putting the house elves in but I disagree. If winkee cast the dark mark in the movie it would ruin the whole darkness theme. What I thought was more important was not putting the Dursley's in or not showing Harry giving his Triwizard winnings to Fred and George to start their joke shop. Anyways I've said enough about the book. The movie was great otherwise all the kids have vastly improved in their acting we finally got to see the Ron is not just a comical character and Dan's acting in the graveyard was fantastic. Like most people I agree that Allen Rickman is Proffeser Snape exactley. I just don't quite agree with giving Michael Gambon the part for Albus Dumbledore. He just dosen't have the Dumbledore touch that Richard Harris had. Anyways I give Harry Potter and the goblet of fire 8/10.,Null,0,1,19 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'we come to it at last, the greatest film of our time'
",I have never in my entire life seen a film that literally took my breath away and defined the exact definition of excellent film making. It's been almost 3 years since the Return Of The King made it's debut in theatres I try to watch the DVD's I buy at least 2 or 3 times a year to get more of understanding of them. I of course end up watching trilogy's like star wars and Lord Of The Rings more. This movie is excellent in every single way. Peter Jackson has given us a trilogy we will never forget. TROTK has probably the most amazing battle of all time ever done on screen. From the siege of gondor to the battle of pelenor fields I then realized that we have reached a new stage in film. If you watch the extended version's especially you can feel that these movies are literally amazing and capture truly Tolkiens world of middle earth exactly the way it should be. From the shire to the crack of mount doom Frodo's journey will never be forgotten and I am sure that this trilogy will never be forgotten.,Null,3,6,4 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best film of all time
","The original Star Wars is the greatest motion picture ever done in cinematic history. The first ten minutes of the film has been and will always be the most enjoyable moment in cinematic history for me. George Lucas has changed special effects for every filmmaker out their. The original Star Wars trilogy itself has not only changed the way I looked at movies but changed me as a person. I know that sounds a little fruity but it really has. Even though I am not a fan of the prequel movies I will say that the story of the whole saga is simply genius. If you watch each movie carefully you will notice has much it pays tribute to every aspect of pop culture and history. I will end off by saying that George Lucas is a master story teller and probably one of the most,if not the most genius of all.",Null,0,1,26 June 2006
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta
","2005 was a fantastic year for movies that we have had in a long time. It's almost hard to think that just when the year of fabulous entertainment is over, The Wochowski brothers release a film that I would consider a piece of art and 2006's best so far. Natalie Portman's performance is stunning and although Hugo Weaving is not seen his voice is perfect for the mask that will haunt us in our dreams. V for vendetta is a must see for anybody who enjoy's a good time at the theatres. Do not go expecting another matrix the Wochowski brothers and James McTeigue have cooked up something different for us this year with a solid good plot and lots of twists.",Null,6,11,3 April 2006
