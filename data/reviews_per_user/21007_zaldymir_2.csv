Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great addition to the Star Wars legacy
","After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas's story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the 'Phantom Menace' referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!",9,63,95,26 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Quite literally the best film I have ever seen
","Only the Star Wars films could give me even half the amount of giddy anticipation I had for seeing Fellowship. As a longtime Tolkien fan I was counting the minutes until I could walk in, sit down and see if Peter Jackson had the capability to translate Tolkien's epic to the big screen. Well, not only was I so impressed I was left speechless, but I found myself thinking, for the first time, three hours is not enough. This movie left me so hungry for more that the wait for The Two Towers will be the longest of my entire life. I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Everything, EVERYTHING is so masterfully done that even those who know nothing of Tolkien and care nothing for fantasy will be impressed. I always knew Jackson was a good director (The Frighteners is one of my favorite movies), but here he has outdone not only himself but every director in the biz. Even Spielberg can't hold a candle to him. The production design was mind-blowing, and the CG characters SO realistic they put all other CG characters in all other movies to great shame. The actors were all beyond awesome, especially Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee. Elijah Wood makes the BEST Frodo any Tolkien fan could ever ask for. Liv Tyler surprised me; she was excellent as Arwen. The action in this movie was awe-inspiring. I went in knowing exactly how the story progressed, yet sequences like the trek through the Mines of Moria still scared the crap out of me, they were so well done. And the Balrog -- words do no justice! It truly has to be seen to be believed, and it will be believed! And we get to see just enough of Gollum to get an idea what he looks like... scary little creature, my precious! Everything about this movie is true magic. TRUE MAGIC. Never has a film captured me so completely before. I didn't want to leave the theater. I'm going to see it again tonight. I'll see it as many times as I can manage. If you haven't seen it yet, you honestly don't know what you're missing. I could pour my heart and soul out, and it would still pale in comparison to how much this movie blew me away. Do I sound like I'm exaggerating? I'm not. It's that good. This movie deserves a 10 out of 10, though I would have voted 11 were I so allowed. Go see it. Even if you don't like fantasy (and how could you not after seeing this), go see it. This is Tolkien done right.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
