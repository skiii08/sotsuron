Casablanca," Just as good as they say
","Casablanca is one of the classic films that I was always told that I must watch at some point. At first I could not understand why some odd romance film was so important but after watching it now I see. Part of it is writing, the excellent dialogue that ranges from somber and disheartening to clever hilariousness. Another piece of it is the beauty of a story that always keeps you guessing right up to to end with twists. Last is the top notch acting, this is the film that made Bogart's career and it is easy to see why. Realizing now the significance of WHEN this film was released in relation to its content makes me understand how valid the social commentary was.",10,1,3,14 March 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Tragically real
","The Grapes of Wrath is the film adaptation of the book which covers the story of an Oklahoma family living in the dust bowl during the Great Depression. This film plays no games when it comes to realism and does its best to render the heart wrenching plight of the Oakies as they suffered while traveling to California for work. The film is gritty and keeps to the reality of the tale as much as possible. The saddest thing though was the way that for all Tom's attempts at good, to reform, to help those in need, he is the one who causes the family to struggle the most as his very presence is a source of constant problem. This movie serves as a reminder of the struggles faced by farmed during the Great Depression and the challenge of how anyone let alone this family could possibly survive through it.",Null,0,1,14 March 2013
Annie Hall," Woodie Allen love him or hate him
","I think I understand why people tend to either really love or really hate Woodie Allen and this film is probably the best example. Its filled with quips, many of them brilliant, but they require a little history to understand. Personally I found the film pretty hilarious throughout, though its easy for me to understand why anyone would not. If you don't get the humor you're going to hate this movie. That said I found there to be little in this movie beyond its humor. Yes its a love story, but what it boils down to is Woodie Allen talking about himself, which is great since nobody hates a Jew quite like the Jews, and Allen is his greatest critic. If you like Allen you will love this, if not I would turn away now.",Null,0,0,10 May 2013
The Graduate," Uncertainty abounds
","The graduate is honestly a film I can relate to. Straight out of school Ben (Hoffman) is trying to figure out what to do with his life. He just wants to have a future that avoids the humdrum life of his parents,and forge his own path. Of course he is immediately led astray by the devious Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), and this leads to a number of poor choices but Ben is able to free himself and does make his own way. Imagery throughout the film is amazing, perfectly depicting the summer at the end of school (did you decide what you're going to do with your life yet) and beautifully demonstrating the divide between the generations. The ending leaves us with nothing, just the two of them awkwardly glancing with uncertainty ahead. And thats a feeling I can relate to. Would recommend to anyone of college age.",Null,0,0,10 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Beautiful Music
","Honestly this was one of the most beautiful musicals I have ever seen. I would not consider myself a real musical fan but this was a very enjoyable movie. The colors and the imagery were brilliant, particularly one section had these amazing colors, as some sort of technicolor extravaganza that i thought had made a great scene. The acting is also top notch, with characters really coming to life. The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the plot was so ironically asinine it hurt. Now certainly in some ways it was a dig at the film industry but for the most part the plot of this movie was basically just designed to have a musical. Its a musical about being in a musical. Thats about as bad as it gets.",Null,0,2,9 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," Perfection
","Pulp Fiction is easily one of Tarentino's best films and will live on forever. This movie has spawned more quotes than I can name, and every scene is memorable. Camera work is perfect as to be expected and the film looks beautiful. Tarentino uses violence as an art form. The acting is pretty amazing with an all star cast that really brings everything together. Jackson in particular is really intense, but that's his style. Travolta does an excellent job as very human hit-man Vincent Vega, bringing politeness and a little silliness to his profession. The dialogue is by far the best part of the film though. Vince and Jules's back and forth on subjects from the mundane to the existential are smart and hilarious. Pulp Fiction is also famous for its chronology, which throws most people off the first time they see it. The film asks you to think a little and that's a good thing in my opinion.",Null,1,3,10 May 2013
Psycho," A shocking classic
","Its tough to review one of the greatest movies of all time, just because of how over reviewed it is. Psycho is a classic tale of suspense that I had heard of as a kid, but only now go to experience for myself. And what an experience it was. Every shot of this movie is brilliant, it leads your eye and your mind, constantly keeping you on edge, but not with horror like modern films. I did not find Psycho 'scary' in a typical sense. It was suspenseful, but it rarely scared or startled me, and that is part of what makes it great. Its a murder movie with no blood essentially, and of course it features the most violent stabbing with no actual stabbing I have ever witnessed. Overall a great story of suspense, one that continues to thrill all ages.",Null,0,0,9 May 2013
