United 93," Sympathy and regret from the UK.
","What can you write/type or say about 9/11 that hasn't been said? The film I'm my humble opinion was well portrayed and showed every qualities of the human spirit.From over here in the U.K and we watched the drama unfold that Tues morning we looked on in awe and shock and respect and reverence and wondered what was going through peoples minds that day on those flights and on the grounds.I hoped that Flight 93 gave some of us an insight into this and I thought that every thing was portrayed with sympathy,humility,courage and hope.To us here in the U.K we will stand by your side in the fight against terrorism,as we are use to fighting the oppressors on a daily basis.God Bless the USKeep the faith",8,2,5,1 May 2006
