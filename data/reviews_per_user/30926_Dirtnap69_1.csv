Iron Man 3," Save your money
","Lets start by describing this flick with one word... an absolute DISAPPOINTMENT. The movie stayed true to its origin with strong action scenes and special effects with peppered in comic relief, although, it came off more as a comedy than an action film. Kids will love this movie none the less, but anyone over the age of 10 who has any taste in good movies will agree this movie was a let down to the series and marvel especially. The story line was terrible, and in no way stays true to the comic series involving the Mandarin. This movie had all the potential in the world and fell short in every category. My suggestion is save your money, and if you enjoyed 1 & 2 as much as I did avoid ruining the entire franchise by not watching this movie.",4,3,6,3 May 2013
