The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hope you weren't expecting to SEE anything actually happen...
","This is like an audio book on a movie screen. You have a few cursory effects here and there but for the most part you have to use your imagination. Imagine The Avengers except instead of seeing the Hulk smash things you just watch Robert Downy Jr. tell you about it for 90 minutes. So now, imagine that the bad guys in the capital are flying down to bomb district 13! Sounds exciting right? NOW, imagine everyone runs and hides in a bomb shelter, and all you see is a few blips on a radar screen and some dust falling from the ceiling. Yes, they literally show nothing of the bombing, not even a plane flying overhead! BUT, they all crawl out of the hole and find the bombed district, they don't walk around it, they just stand in a crater and look dumbfounded. Look, my girlfriend fell asleep and asked me what she missed when we drove home, i said 'nothing'... no seriously, nothing happened... 'stop being an ass' she says. No, really, they lived, peta tried to strangle her, it was stupid the end.SERIOUSLY THATS IT.THE END.",2,26,38,27 November 2014
The Expendables 2," Sloppy, formulaic, uninspired
","Grotesque metaphors involving Asian women and pornography, incomprehensible choreography of fight scenes, boring rehashes of a million clich√©s, this movie just doesn't excel in any way. It was boring, it was B movie quality most of the time and it felt like most of the people involved weren't all that interested in being involved. The one actor that I thought put a little extra into his performance was Jean Claude Van Damme, the fact alone should scare you. Stallone is washed up, Arnold is washed up, Bruce Willis is still OK, but, he clearly doesn't really care and plays this role more cheesy than straight up. It's just a corn ball movie featuring washed up old actors on steroids milking their past even as they're being escorted to the retirement home.",4,2,5,28 May 2013
Gone Girl," Basically one really long joke about marriage
","There's really very little to like about this movie unless you are new to movies and haven't seen directors work a camera before... Like all of David Fincher's movies there is a decided like of real substance. He tells stories with visual and auditory gadgetry. Some people are probably wowed when the director calls attention to himself with an endless array of moving shots, weird angles, and quick cuts, that end up basically turning a movie into a long commercial spot. While it doesn't quite go on forever, it does seem long when sitting in the theater, and that is because honestly, not a whole lot happens in this movie. They get a horse to run (OMG she's a crazy b*** of a wife!!) and then they kick it and beat it to death... So... Fincher starts off the movie by constantly swinging the camera around, and of course, while keeping everything perfectly framed, he IS a master at this you know! (And don't you ever forget it!)Yeah, yeah David, congrats, you've mastered film school 101. Good for you.The whole movie is predictable, absurd, and comes across as some sort of listless metaphorical commentary on marriage. Oh, that IS literally what it is. The idea that in marrying someone you are destroying yourself. And that you have to go through a variety of spiritual convulsions before you finally understand what it is you want in life. I GET THAT! Why that needs to be told amongst scenes of wine bottle self rape, or ejaculation while throat slitting, or any of the other absurdities presented to the viewers in Gone Girl is a mystery that only lasts as long as it takes to tally up the $$$.Here's a metaphor from the movie: WOOD STOVE = HOT VAGINA. She puts her DIARY in her WOOD STOVE and BURNS IT. But NOT completely, just singes the edges. AND everything in the diary is a lie. GET IT?!?!!?Anyway, have fun watching David Fincher's latest self-commercial!",3,80,156,10 October 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," So bad I wanted to walk out half way through
","This movie was flat out boring and kinda stupid. It was just bad, so bad in fact, I felt embarrassed to be in the theater. The fighting in these movies has worn very thin. It's terrible stylistically. There's no artfulness to what is going on, it's just half second cuts of different characters punching the same bad guy (ultron clones) over and over again. As to the story, there was no story. There is a bad robot, it wants to make itself super powerful, but in the end, the good guys win. I don't know what the point of it all was. Are they trying to say something through a psychobabbling evil robot? Is there some reason in the overarching universe of comics for all of this to be happening? Not that I could tell. Again, a bad robot came, it fought the avengers, the avengers won, hooray. Seriously, save your money, unless you were born yesterday...",3,15,36,3 May 2015
The Happening," An amazing film
","Is it a scary movie? I don't know. I don't care. I wasn't scared at all watching this film, I was intrigued. I found the whole film fascinating for a variety of reasons. It was in a sense a parody of itself and yet not. Perhaps it is a good parody of a bad 70's b-movie. Something about this movie is lovely to me, maybe it's the luscious camera work, or the easy pacing, I don't know. It has space, it relishes in itself and its absurdity, and yet, it believes every word of what its saying, or does it? There are few movies that can span the chasm between belief and disbelief whether by accident or intent, this one does so quite seamlessly.",9,0,2,5 October 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Predictable.
","I am disappointed. There's no surprises here, there's no information here, it's a big uninteresting nothing. Do you watch the news? The news is more entertaining that this. Watching idiots punch each other in the head on youtube is more entertaining than this.The next thing to realize is that this movie has no logic behind it. It's just a procession of events that bear no logical connection to each other except perhaps that these events having occurred in the scope of the flick do effectively mark the passing of time. Yes, time. I became very aware of time watching this movie. Watching the characters act, watching them pretend made me so aware of that time slipping away. Time is precious, and honestly, shouldn't be wasted on this nonsense.It's a movie that proves I think, that this event in our history is a fabrication, and that our awareness of it is false. Because what you see here lacks the sting of truth, no, it's much more of a wet noodle, uninteresting, limp, and bland.Thx.",2,2,6,23 May 2013
