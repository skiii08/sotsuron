Black Swan," fine line between genius and insanity.
","Since the Black Swan is the most talk about movie among dancers, I finally watched it last night. Perhaps I had such a high expectation of the movie, I can't help but say that I'm somewhat disappointed. I like and dislike it a the same time. It is a good movie, the story line is clean and focused. The dance costumes and makeups are perfect for the show. I loved Natalie Portman's performance in it. However, Mila, in my opinion, cant act. She is not doing nothing but reading a script. With such limited dialog of hers, she simply just can't act, or she had not act with heart yet. The coach looks like a real coach. I found the movie hit too close to home, the drama that happened in the dance community, the pressure, the competition, the obsession, the hunger for perfection. I agree with most people that it is an intense movie. However, i was disappointed in a sense that the movie is so predictable. I think it is more of a girls' movies than guys. Because a lot of us can, in some way, relate to Nina. All of us want to be the swan queen and we all believe or want to think that we have talents, 'we' can be the one, the talented chosen one. But you have to be so naive to actually believe that you can be the one. The truth is, there are so many talented people out there, what makes you different?The coach says, ' the only person standing between you is you.' Is competition really not about beating others, but how one can push their own limit? Nina's first assignment to ' go home and start touching yourself'. That just sounds so familiar, doesn't it, my fellow dancers. :)After watching the movie, i found that it just increased my doubts even more about continuing to dance. Because i know i can never be. I can be good, but i cannot be great. 99% of us cant be great either. There are many good artists in this world, but only few can be great. Because only a crazy soul can express emotion in such a pure form that is selfless. You can let yourself go, but you wont know what it means to truly lose yourself. History proved it to be a fact. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. That's the law of nature. A great comedian is a great entertainer on stage, but a sad soul at heart. The price that every great artist paid. The movie sent a clear message, however, these are things that i already know. I am disappointed because I didn't learn anything new. It just emphasized that my belief is correct, or rather, the writer shared my same point of view, which is kind of upsetting, because sometimes, I'd rather be wrong.",7,1,4,30 December 2010
