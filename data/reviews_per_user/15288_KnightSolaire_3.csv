Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Superb action scenes and performances make this one a killer.
","Going in knowing nothing about the flick except it was called, well... you know what, and that it was based on a novel of the same name, I expected no more than some cheesy CGI mediocrity.Boy, was I wrong.Let's start with the best thing about the movie: the action scenes. Timur Bekmambetov executes the action in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' with stunning and extremely satisfying flourish, akin to Zack Snyder's '300' from 2006. Slow-mo shots aplenty, and vampire blood flowing across the screen, the action never lets up in its excitement or pace throughout the whole film. What really surprised me was the extreme effectiveness of the film as a historical drama, with great performances put in by all the lead roles. While at first I was a bit skeptical as Benjamin Walker looked a bit like the poor man's Benedict Cumberbatch, but I was blown away how Walker simply became Abraham Lincoln. Both the actor and the make-up department deserve special credit for bringing the 16th president to the big screen. Dominic Cooper was also very memorable in his role as the 'trainer' of Honest Abe, and was always a pleasure to watch on-screen.The movie's pace is always consistent, and always generates excitement, be it through the simply outstanding action scenes, or the more dramatic ones. Originally, I thought a more humorous tongue-in-cheek would be appropriate for a movie like this, but I definitely would agree that the serious tone that the film employed definitely worked to its advantage by so seamlessly interweaving real-life history with the vampire mythos. All in all, the movie blew away my expectations. If you're in for some simply awesome vampire-slaying action, or even if you're into the historical aspect of Abraham Lincoln, the film delivers on every level. Definitely do not miss up on one of the best summer flicks of 2012.",10,9,14,26 June 2012
Star Trek," A Thrilling and Entertaining Prequel
","Wanting to escape from the hypnotic boredom from watching Star Trek: the Motion Picture, I went to see the new one on the same day with my friend. And boy, did it deliver! The effects were very nice, even better than those in Star Wars: Episode III. Story was quite good, very interesting compared to Star Trek: the Motion Picture. It was very fast- paced, unlike the slow-paced series. Simon Pegg boosted this movie very highly with his lively performance. It was a pleasure to see Leonard Nimoy as Old Spock.All in all, great film, highly recommend to Trekkies but it might give old Trekkies heart attacks.",9,2,10,10 May 2009
Watchmen," An amazing and stunning story
","Many people commented that to understand the movie you have to read the book first. So I bought Watchmen, and read it in 5 days. And what can I say... It was the best story I've ever read. Period. Then I became obsessive over the movie and I kept begging my poor father to take me to the theater since I am underage. Not going into details, I saw the movie. And I have to say, that Zak Snyder adapted the comic beautifully into film. Unlike his last film, '300', Watchmen has great acting and excellent atmosphere. Rorschach will always be the most bad-ass and kick-ass hero of all time. The ending... While the ending was changed a bit in the movie, the ending in the novel paralyzed me. It was an ending that I never heard of. So if you love the novel, or you just love this dark setting of New York with all these bad-ass vigilantes, then... I'm sure your thoughts won't be that much different than mine. 10/10",10,6,12,25 March 2009
