Hereditary," Yeah it was good but.....
",In all honesty I was expecting to watch the scariest film of 2018 as that's what all the hype was. I did not find it all scary until the end which was a little jumpy. BUT the end was a dissapointed it left me baffled so confused I didn't understand the ending as it felt so rushed. All in all it kept me hooked it was a good film but I won't be watching again.,6,0,1,24 August 2018
