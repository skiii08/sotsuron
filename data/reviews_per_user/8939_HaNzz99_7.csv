It," A great coming of age story.. that happens to be scary
","A surprisingly entertaining coming of age story that's multi layered, dramatic, comedic, and endearing, 'It' is easily one of 2017's best films to date. The film presents a very well constructed analysis and exploration on the topic of fear and the importance of overcoming it when growing up, all the while presenting a very hopeful message about the power of friendship against even the harshest of adversities. All of these topics are also present in the original novel, making this newest adaptation stand out among the rest of its kind as one of the most faithful ever produced (and it only told half of the full story!).The film is elevated by an extraordinary cast of actors, all of which deliver spot on performances, especially the kids. The Loser's Club is easily the best aspect of the entire thing. Every single member is given some time to develop and stand out, and no actor feels tacked on or delivers an out of place performance. Stand outs are Wolfhard and Lillis. All of these kids have a promising future ahead of them. Technicalities are all spot on and expertly directed and brought together by Andy Muschietti. Visuals effects are superb, cinematography looks beautiful, soundtrack has an adventurous yet perilous vibe to it that suits the film's mood perfectly, and the pacing is consistent throughout the picture. The movie never drags or rushes with unnecessary information or scenes. It maintains a steady pace and never feels boring. This is one 135 minute movie that feels like 90 minutes, and leaves you drooling for more... oh, I forgot. It also has some horror elements to it. The film does deliver on some extremely disturbing imagery, psychological terror, and some visceral and grotesque moments that leaves you wondering how did a big studio like WB allowed these to be shown to the masses. The film truly earns its R-rating and uses it to its advantage, delivering one of the most surreal, uncomfortable, uncompromising, and, most importantly, scary horror experiences of the year. Bill Skarsgard may not be an actor in the same caliber as Tim Curry, and it that sense some may argue the latter delivers the best performance. However, when it comes to the character of Pennywise himself, Bill's version exceeds on the miniseries' in every other front. This is one scary looking, physically imposing, unpredictable, sinister monster with one twisted personality and a dark sense of humor. He steals every scene he's in, and proves to be such an interesting character, by the time the film's over, you're left wanting to learn more about him. His role as an antagonist serves the movie's thematic purpose and is essential to the film's ultimate message, making him one of the most endearingly despicable (if that makes any sense) villains in modern cinema history. All in all, IT is one of the best movies of 2017 thus far. It delivers an amazing coming of age story that's endearing, funny and compelling, with a message that's as timeless as the titular monster itself, all the while still working as one of the better horror movies of the past decade. This is one great movie, period, and one that film buffs should not hesitate in checking out ASAP.",9,4,8,17 September 2017
Troy," They don't make movies like this anymore..
","So, recently I checked out the film again on bluray after a very long while because I just felt like it. I do remember watching the film in theaters back when I was like, 6 years old. It was the first time in my life I went to see a movie that wasn't an animated one, so in a way this film is special for me. I remember enjoying it then, but after re-watching it again last night (the longer director's cut, that is) I found myself appreciating the film even more. They truly don't make films like this anymore. First and foremost, I don't really care if this was loyal or not to Homer's texts. I'm judging it as a movie. One of the aspects that stands up noticeably after 13 years of being released is the scale of it all. The action in this movie is insanely brutal, realistic, engaging, and exhilarating, and most of it is due to its practicality. Real stunts, real people are fighting 'real' wars, and the film allows you to see this in many close-up shots, making you feel part of the action and truly selling the epicness of it all. I highlight the practical aspect of the film because nowadays, most war films heavily rely on CGI armies performing CGI battles, and it just.. it doesn't feel the same when you make the comparison. Films like Seventh Son, The Legend of Hercules, The Hobbit, Warcraft, among many others forget the importance of practical effects and the assemblance of lots of extras, in costume, performing actual stunts in front of our very eyes. This things help make the film feel more grounded, and you get to develop higher empathy for every soldier, raising the stakes and making you feel you're part of the action. CGI done wrong can work in detriment of the film, making the action feel bland and repetitive instead. The film doesn't only offer epic war sequences, though. The romantic side of the film is also skillfully realized, and all of the main characters have their time to shine and showcase some necessary emotional bits. Brad Pitt as Achilees is perfect casting, and he embodies the imposing physicality and agility of the character quite nicely. Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom are also given substantial roles and they both have great chemistry with each other. The supporting cast is also pretty good, with the talents of Diane Kruger as Helen, Brian Cox as Agamemnom, Sean Bean as Odysseus, among others giving their all whenever they show up. Cinematography is, indeed, spectacular, and some of the shots I could consider iconic at this point (the upper shot showcasing the Greek boats heading towards Troy, Achilles standing in front of the soldiers, panoramic shots of armies clashing into each other, just to name a few). Soundtrack is equally amazing, the chorus in particular is entrancing, and allows the emotions to hit home whenever they must. As for flaws, there are a few for me. Some characters are somewhat annoying and you sometimes have the urge to punch in the face, in spite of understanding their role in the film. The pacing can sometimes alter, in particular during the first act. We start with a brief action scene, and then it takes a while before it, once again, gets going. You could easily cut some shots or scenes that I felt were unneeded during the first half and the main narrative wouldn't have been affected in the slightest. Also, while I did mention that the romantic aspect of the film is well realized, sometimes it can come off as excessively melodramatic. Not necessarily cheesy, but heading towards there. 'Troy' is really something to behold. It is an achievement in filmmaking that does stand the test of time. Easily one of the better sword and sandal epics ever produced (not quite as great as Lord of The Rings, but great nevertheless) and still a clear example of how to make an epic movie properly. Here's hoping future directors realize what makes films like these work and click with audiences, and borrow an element or two from Wolfang Petersen's picture.",8,0,0,17 September 2017
Justice League," Not perfect, but still a great time
","I liked Justice League. Some may still be sorry Snyder's cut won't be seen anytime soon, but I think most of his ideas did end up in the final product, along with some tweaks to make the film a little more accessible to general audiences. I don't necessarily agree with some of those choices but I understand why the folks at WB did what they did. For all the drama surrounding the film's production, it ended up feeling surprisingly very consistent in tone, well-paced and structured. It felt like a standalone movie that wasn't concerned with setting up future installments except through some very subtle easter eggs, unlike other films like Age of Ultron or BvS for instance (even the UC, which I loved).Cyborg, Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman were the best characters since they got the better arcs. Cyborg's was surprisingly touching and the Trinity's were already set up in the previous films, so here we do get a sense of completion for their characters. Aquaman felt a little sidelined, but what we did get to see from him left me excited for his solo movie. Flash was the comic relief character and, as such, stole the show every time he was on screen. He wasn't as fleshed out nor as developed as one would've hoped, but he still delivered. Steppenwolf as the villain is nothing special. He's basically a less intimidating, interesting, and compelling General Zod that's 100% CGI and wanted to take over the world because that's what he does. He wasn't terrible, and had some standout moments and lines. He was just serviceable to the story and nothing else. Cinematography and action choreography are still on par woth what we've come to expect from a visual director like Snyder, which is a good thing. Elfman's score was mixed. There are some tracks I loved and others I can't remember anymore. His decision to reuse some of the classic themes for Batman, Flash and Superman in a Justice League movie felt like a nice way of tributing superhero movies of old, but at the same time it felt out of place, given that those scores suit different interpretations of the characters we're currently seeing. The CGI can also be unexcusably bad, but there are other times where it would just look beautiful. As with every DCEU film before it, there's a lot of memorable shots and scenes to take away from JL, and the joy I felt as a fan for finally seeing these icons share the screen together for the first time in live action is just priceless. Even with some technical issues, though, and its short runntime, JL still delivered on what it was supposed to do. It was an entertaining and heroic superhero film that introduces new likeable characters, brings some completion to the previous installments in a satisfactory manner, and opens the door for an exciting and promising future for the DC universe. A fun time at the movies.",8,1,2,26 January 2018
Transformers," Cinematic escapism that still holds up
","The level of anticipation I had as a kid for Michael Bay's first live action Transformers movie is yet to be rivaled. Ever since the first trailer dropped, the first poster, the first images, all that went through my little head was a feeling of wondrous excitement 'it just looks sooo real'. By the time the film came out, you bet whatever you want that I went to see it immediately. Coming out of it, I thought I'd just experienced the best film ever made, no joking. Oh, the times. Over time, the way we regard and evaluate summer blockbusters has evolved. We started to get more critical, and with the subsequent boom of the online community, it was easier for us to manifest our likes and dislikes with each film through various debates and exchanges with other film buffs. Critics' opinions also became more popular. All of these changes were for the best, as suddenly we started to get higher quality pictures that delighted, wowed, and enchanted moviegoers in far more ways than just cinematic escapism.Transformers was a product of a far simpler time. By the time it came out, audiences only cared about the action, the spectacle, the visual splendor of it all. People never experienced such levels of high octane action and explosive set pieces before, and Michael Bay sure had a hit in his hands. The visual effects were revolutionary for the time (and still hold up after a decade), the soundtrack by Linkin Park was, and still is, iconic, and even though the story itself was convoluted, the acting ranging from alright to downright cheesy, and the product placement being everything-but-subtle, it was all forgiven because of the undeniable and irresistible sense of fun the movie had to offer. Seeing fan favorite characters like Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Ironhide, Megatron, Starscream, among others, engage in battle while buildings are being destroyed, and the ground cracking wide open with explosions, was a novelty, and a dream come true for fans of the original animated series. Michael Bay has a very skilled eye when it comes to visuals, and this movie is a prime example of that. Every time a Transformer appears on screen, it feels grandiose, cinematography is breathtaking and feels involving, soundtrack, as already stated, is iconic and even the musical score was outstanding. However, when judging in terms of storytelling, editing, and narrative flow, the film shows its true fallacies. The amount of subplots is unnecessarily big. We have Sam dealing with college, him trying to impress Mickeyla, the Autobot vs Decepticon war, the Cube, the government conspiracies, the hackers.. there's a lot to cover, and thus the film comes off as sloppy. Shia LaBeouf is fine, Megan Fox may not be a 'good' actress, but she's far better here than she is in most recent productions she starred in (TMNT). John Turturro is hit or miss as the comic relief character, and the least said about Sam's parents the better. The real standouts are the voice acting talents, most notably Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. His voice is now a trademark of the character, that's how good he is. 'Transformers' is a good example of pure cinematic escapism done properly. The film may not be perfect, with some average acting, product-placement galore, and over complicated narrative threads, but it is all compensated by the film's sense of wonder. The movie knows its dumb, and isn't ashamed in celebrating how dumb it is. The result? An entertainingly dumb summer blockbuster that knows how to have fun. If the film is able to embrace its cheesiness and deliver some glorious spectacle along the way, why should I be ashamed to admit I love the film (flaws and all)?",7,0,0,18 September 2017
Saw," An Overlooked Modern Horror Classic
","A psychological thriller unlike any you've seen before, Saw makes full use of its limited budget to deliver a gripping, original, intense, and bloody film that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with compelling lead characters and a thought-provoking villain that's as mysterious as he's methodical, twisted and brilliant. The film focuses on building tension with every scene, without ever allowing its audience to breathe, leading up to a final twist that'll go down as one of the best game-changing endings in recent memory.The only minor gripes I have involve moments of bad acting and some questionable editing choices, particularly during a car chase sequence near the end, but those can be attributed to the limited budget and can be easily overlooked. Highly recommended.",9,1,5,3 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," An under-appreciated superhero film
","*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made.",9,270,347,17 September 2017
300," What it lacks in depth, it compensates with creativity in spades
","300 is a unique film. When it first came out, it was met with a very polarizing reception. Some claimed it was a masterpiece, others claim it was an overrated pile of trash. This would latter prove to become a tentpole in Snyder's filmography. The visuals were hailed as majestic, the dialogue catchy and quotable, the action and violence exhilarating, relentless, and spectacular, Gerard Butler as King Leonidas one of the next big icons in cinema history. Others, on the other hand, found it to be exhausting visual noise with little to no depth or purpose to any of its stylistic action montages. In my honest opinion, I think both sides are right. If you love the movie, I can totally see why. If you hated it, I can also see why. I guess your level of enjoyment with this film will depend mostly on two factors: your personal taste in movies, and your expectations when approaching this one. Let's get out of the way the obvious points. The acting from everyone involved is great, with Butler being the obvious standout. Everyone looks believable as Spartan soldiers and truly help sell the epicness of the action (which is expertly choreographed, I should say). Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes is both entrancing and downright evil, which is totally appropriate and fits the nature of this godlike character. Some of the best moments in the film are when both Leonidas and Xerxes are having an interchange, maybe because they are both truly mesmerizing actors, and moments like these allow their characters' personalities to shine for once. Visually, this film is glorious, and it still holds up a decade after the film's initial release. Backgrounds, armies, cinematography, the color palette, the settings, the creatures, make up effects, and the carnage (oh god, the carnage) are all exquisitely made. The movie's visual aesthetic is worth the price of admission alone. It helps the film stand out as one of the most entertainingly brutal and creative war movies of recent times. The super-imposition chroma key filming technique is also admirable, as it allows Frank Miller's panels to come to life on the big screen. However, and now we turn to the negative side of the film, when it comes to the story itself.. there's very little substance to match up with the insanity that is the stylistic nature of this movie. Basically the plot revolves around Leonidas gathering a group of 300 warriors to stop the Persians and prevent Sparta to fall under Xerxes' tyranny. That's it. There's no real plot twist nor inventiveness to it. Its just people fighting after people fighting after people fighting. Now, one can defend this by saying the film is not interested in an innovative or a thought provoking story, but instead uses a relatively simple story as connective tissue for the action sequences, which are the real standouts. It was that way in the graphic novel, though in a way, the film's very loyal to its source material. I understand this, and if it wasn't obvious already (I gave the film an 8/10 after all) this bothers me little to nothing. That being said, when judging the film objectively, its lacking in the narrative department is something that needs to be addressed, and depending on whether you care for a well thought out story to accompany your action, as good as it may be, this will come through as a significant flaw for you, and a deal breaker before deciding if seeing the film or not. 300 is, once again, a unique film, and its definitely not for everybody. It is one perfect example of a film that's style over substance, and that may irritate the most demanding viewers. This is no Gladiator, no Braveheart, no troy nor LOTR. However, what it lacks in narrative depth more than compensates with amazing to behold action sequences, and a mesmerizing work in the visual department. Its story is more than enough to move the film forward, and the result is an engaging, entertaining, brutal, surreal and bloody war film that never gets boring, and eventually wins you over with the way everything comes together. In spite of its divisive nature, I do suggest that film buffs check this film at least once. Who knows, maybe at its worst it can come off as a guilty pleasure. As for myself, I do stand with my take on it as one of the most purely entertaining action films I've ever witnessed.",8,0,3,25 September 2017
