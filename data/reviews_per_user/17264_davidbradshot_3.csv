Gremlins," So good, and yet not!
","I love this movie...i mean love it. But I watched it again at Christmas and i'm thinking it's partly because of nostalgia... it's not that great a movie...Although I can see it was great for it's time, I'm just not sure it really stands up anymore. Sad to say, and you can't really fault the movie for that, but I felt a little sad at the end.But then they don't make movies like this anymore, i'm not sure the kids would get it.But if you haven't seen it, I hope you do and love it as much as I do...",8,0,1,15 February 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The perfect movie
","Every shot, every line, every beat of this movie is just perfection.I've watched this hundreds of times and I honestly think it gets better every time.It has everything you'd want from a film, and it's layers are endless.The CGI, startling back in 92, still work today and are completely believable. It almost makes me sad that they can't achieve this level of storytelling these days, where you can have a balance of action and real characters that you care about, and have scenes with emotional depth.I'm obviously now at the age to say 'they don't make em like that anymore'.",10,0,3,16 February 2019
Die Hard," The perfect Christmas movie!
","And it IS a Christmas movie. Everything about it is Christmas. I sometimes feel like Bruce Willis does at the end of the movie by the time Christmas is over!It's a brilliantly executed, well paced, jam packed movie that has taken the time to grow the characters and let us in to their lives. And throughout the movie, not just at the beginning before you get to the explosions.This is a movie that will be watched for another 30 years as THE go to Christmas movie. That and Scrooged....",10,0,0,15 February 2019
