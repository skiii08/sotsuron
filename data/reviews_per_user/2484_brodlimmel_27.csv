3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Awesome
","Wow is this film amazing I've never seen something like this in a long time for westerns. Now I like westerns haven't seen too many but this is my favorite of them all it just does everything you want to see from a action packed western.It starts out with Dan Evans (Christian Bale) being a poor rancher and owing money to the rail road company so they stay away from his land. Then they show you Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) being this bad-ass outlaw that is robbing a armed wagon. Well when these two characters paths meet that is when the story goes from OK to just amazing that is in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But the main plot is a group of people a bounty hunter, rancher, doctor, and a guy who owns the rail road and his lackey are having to take Ben Wade to a prison jail called the Yuma.Acting wise everyone does great my personal favorite was Ben Foster who played Russell Crowe's right hand man.Overall this is almost a perfect movie but it is the reason I love film. Honestly I never saw the original but if it is half as good as this remake then you got one hell of a film. I give this a BUY you will want to watch this again.",10,3,5,20 August 2011
Source Code," Source Awesome
","This is most likely my favorite Sci-fi movie of 2011. This is phenomenal honestly I was thinking oh I hope Jake Gyllenhaal was gonna screw it up but he was really good one of my favorite characters. If I can give this movie props it has a original story like no other a Army pilot goes back in time to find the bomber of a train but he can only go back for eight minutes at a time before he has to restart the whole thing over again.This plot keeps you guessing the entire time on what has happened to Colter Stevens (Jake), and what is the bombers plan and why. Now you can probably guess who the bomber is in the first five minutes just by film cliché but that is not really the true mystery the mystery is where is Stevens and how can he go back in time. His love interest in this film is Michelle Monaghan and she is hot plus they really seem to have chemistry together. This is an exciting story from the begging to the end. Now saying that the ending does have the sappy ending but honestly you do just want to see this character be happy.The motto of this film is 'Make every second count' and that is what they did in this film it is truly a must see. I can put it on my top ten of 2011 I even go to say buy this on DVD because you will want to watch it again.",Null,0,2,18 August 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Damn!!!!
","I'm a really big zombie horror fan if it has zombies then there is a good chance I'll like it. But I don't like this movie I love it this is my favorite zombie film out there yes it has bad acting and most the characters are unlikable even the writing is bad. What this does right zombies these monstrous cannibal's I love them. Now to be fair I never saw the original but Zach Snyders version is great.Now there is really no reason for me to describe the plot because it is always the same small town, people get sick, zombies happen same thing each and every movie. But this one has survivors trapped in a mall and you get to see a zombie give birth one of the most disturbing scenes ever that gave me nightmares when I was younger.The music that this movie does play is interesting that is the best way to put it not bad but has you thinking huh. If you watch all the way to the end of this movie it does something no other zombie film does I can't spoil anything for the 8 of you who haven't seen it but it has you thinking oh s***. Overall rent this film I can't say buy unless you are a true zombie lover.",Null,1,4,15 August 2011
Iron Man 2," Still better then the first
",Well this movie just starts out strong it pulls you in and you will enjoy the ride. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal this guy is right for the part. This movie will make you laugh and you will get to see some cool explosions. But then the movie slows down in the middle almost to a stop. It almost makes you mad because you were loving this movie then all a sudden it comes to this screeching halt. The movie will pick up towards the end but if you're like me and like the main hero take on the main villain fights that they have in every other superhero movie then the end fight will make you just be annoyed with this film and leave you with this 'wow that was lame' feeling. If you like movies with fights and explosions then sure see it. If you are a comic nerd then at all cost avoid this movie.,6,1,2,28 April 2011
Troy," For Troy!
","Let it burn let Troy burn! This movie is good but not even close to great. I will say it didn't seem to cliché at all. This of course is based on the story of how Troy fell and the heroes that fought in it, and of course the giant horse that everyone knows of. I have no clue how accurate this movie is but they sure make it look cool.The plot is of course the fall of Troy, so how does this movie sell the audience on a movie they already know the ending to? Well they add some bad-ass fight scenes with Brad Pitt, men getting slaughtered by swords, arrows, and in one case a giant hammer. I find this movie is very interesting to watch, but thats it.The biggest problem I see with this movie is all the characters are flat, Brad Pitt play Achillies the warrior with a heart. Then you have Eric Bana who plays Hector the family man and the only character I even gave a damn about. Last of the big ones Orlando Bloom who is Paris the whiniest person in the whole damn film and yet he still has his bow and arrow from The Lord of the Rings. It would've been epic if he was Legolas that could've made this movie a master piece instead of a rental worthy movie. In the end with all the characters with them being so flat when they die you don't care you just think OK next fight scene.The dialog isn't bad but could be a helluva lot better. All the characters will have at least one line of really cheesy dialog that seems like George Lucas wrote it.Now the music score is fantastic I applaud the composer. In certain scenes the score just pulls you in and you become immersed.Overall low rental for those who like the Greek tales or guys slicing each other up into little bits. For everyone else who might be curious See It On Cable there just isn't anything to recommend for you to spend any money on.",Null,0,1,3 October 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hell yes
","Yeah boy it's Hellboy. I thought the first Hellboy was a boring waste of time. This new one is bad-ass not once was I bored and can I say they make elf's look like the badess of asses I've ever seen elf's. I never read the Hellboy comics so I have no clue how close to the material it is but as a movie I really dug it.The plot is this Elf Prince is tired of humanities greed and he needs collect three pieces of this crown to raise the Golden Army and destroy all humans. Yeah it doesn't sound like the most original piece of art but it plays out extremely well. The only plot problems I had with this was the love angles Hellboy and his problems and Abe who just randomly falls in love with the Elf Princess. But the action oh damn that cool and you get to see Hellboy use a sword and that was just cool all on its own.The characters are kind of weak but this is a pure action movie if you start looking into the characters you find out stuff like Hellboy really only cares about himself, and Liz. The creature design is so original Guillermo del Toro is a genius at creatures and making some cool ass action monster films.The acting everyone did great with there role Ron Perlman is great and has some funny sarcastic lines. My personal favorite was the Elf Prince played by Luke Goss he was a great villain, plus he played one of my favorite villains from Blade 2 Nomak.Overall if you haven't seen this or you hated the original Hellboy or even liked it I still high recommend this movie. This is such an improvement that I say buy only because at this point it is cheap and I see this movie as one of those movies you'll wanna watch later down the road.",Null,0,2,6 October 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Americaaaaaaa!
",First off this review may be bias because I am a Captain America fan and this movie is great. Now if you know nothing about the character then you may not like it as much but that is with any type of comic adaptation. So lets start from the beginning it starts with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) being this small weak guy who just wants to serve his country but he can't due to his physical stature. Now thats great because it shows how this character is full of heart and it really makes him respect his power when he gets it. The middle after he becomes the captain is great he doesn't go straight to war he is selling war bonds and introduces his yes ridiculous costume. Now the villain the Red Skull is not that interesting he is just evil Nazi guy in short terms the actor who plays him does great but his story was just boring. This movie excels at all the little hints and easter eggs it does for the comic fans like having Dumb Dumb Dugan and the original Captain America costume. The end with no spoilers this ending is great the end fight with Captain America and the Red Skull is great. Now sadly no this isn't the best comic movie but it is so worth the ticket price and later even a DVD purchase this movie is just a lot of fun and you will love the ride it takes you on.,8,0,4,7 August 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," A great end to a trilogy
","This movie ends the Bourne series like no other. I was a real big fan of the first two and this one ties it up real nice and there are no loose ends. Jason Bourne is a bad-ass every time I watch one of these you think damn I wish I was that guy being able to beat up four guys at once. So the story starts out pretty close to the end of the second one and of course Jason Bourne is still being hunted by the government who is just trying to tie up loose ends by killing a reporter and Jason Bourne needs that reporter to find out who made him and why. That is the most interesting part of the plot who made Jason Bourne and why did he become this government assassin. But this movie is a true summer blockbuster you can never be bored there is action everywhere in this foot chases, roof chases, car chases, the some of the coolest fight scenes ever. Now I know Jason Bourne is a beast and can't be stopped but this guy is immortal he can get shot fall off building, jumps through glass, gets in these car crashes he is invincible. Now I hear they are making a fourth Bourne movie called The Bourne Legacy and that is one of those wait and see movies I hope that is good because I do love this series. So overall if you haven't seen The Bourne Ultimatum and you have seen the first two see this movie but if you haven't seen the first two see those first because that is the only way I think you can understand the entire story and care about the characters.",Null,0,1,14 August 2011
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monsters vs Awesome
",Honestly I thought this movie was going to be like a lot of other Dreamworks movies a bunch of pop songs and Mike Meyers but instead this movie is hilarious and not filled with a bunch of pop culture references. I have to add this is a pretty original premise the story is kind of predictable but it is a kids movie so I am not looking for too much depth.The story starts with a meteor landing on this girl named Susan (Reese Witherspoon)on her wedding day because of this she gets the power to grow really big and she can't get smaller so the government captures her and throws her in this secret facility with the other monsters. You can tell they are all buffoons but funny ones. Well honestly the aliens attack the government can't beat them so they send monsters it is that simple of a story but it is a fun one at that.The voice acting is phenomenal Reese Witherspoon is OK she is the level headed I just want my old life back girl. Then you got Seth Rogan is perfect as a voice actor I liked him in Paul and I like him in this Seth do voice acting I hate your stoner comedies. His character is a blob named Bob and this guy is so retarded it is funny not slapstick retarded but just stupid funny. Hugh Laurie play a cockroach named Dr.Cockroach and he is great as the mad scientist his evil laugh got me every time. Will Arnett was good his character didn't have any memorable lines but he was still good. The villain Gallaxhar had his moments of hilarity but nothing special.So overall this has a kind of a weak but interesting plot great voice acting and wonderful writing with jokes that keep you constantly laughing. I can only give this movie a Buy if you have kids if not a strong very strong rental.,Null,1,3,17 September 2011
Being John Malkovich," What the was this
",In all reality this is just one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. Yes there is weirder out there but this one makes no sense. In the beginning you see John Cusack as a puppeteer and well no one cares that he is doing it or people hate him for it. Then he applies at this job on the 7 1/2 floor. At this point in the movie you like the weirdness John has a monkey for god sake it's good weird. But later in the story the weirdness just stops being creative and just becomes lame and boring.The acting in this is good no one was terrible but besides John Malkovich all the other characters are unlikeable. Either they are in love with this horrible women who uses people or they use John Malkovich to get what they want.The story does have a interesting plot going into someones head and either seeing the world through there eyes or controlling them. All through this portal in a office. My problem was they didn't play off the portal or really explain why it is only Malkovich that it goes to.Now I have been dogging this movie but I didn't hate it but I didn't like it either if you saw this over someones house or on TV for free you wouldn't hate it but if you rent this I feel like I was disappointed with the out come of the characters and how none of them changed for the better in the movie.,Null,0,1,9 August 2011
Jarhead," Jarheading experience
",As a fan of war films I really enjoyed this movie for focusing only on the marines and very little of the war. They are fighting in the Gulf War which this is the only movie I've seen that they are fighting in Dessert Storm. Something people I knew that seen it there is fighting scenes the solders never see combat and that will throw off many audience members if they think they are getting into the traditional war film will blood and guts and explosions.The story follows many of the marines but the main character is Anthony Swoffward played by Jake Gyllenhall is a kid who only joined because he couldn't get into college and being a Jarhead was in the family his dad joined his grandpa joined. Swoff gets to be a scout sniper one of the coolest things in the marines. One complaint there is the whole sniper thing doesn't even matter until the end otherwise the whole movie could just be about a marine with no special title like a sniper.The emotional aspect in this movie is deep almost a little too emotional. There is one scene where the marines are watching a sex video and one notices it is his wife and neighbor and that is just one of those holy crap moments where you feel for this marine who isn't even part of the main cast. Besides the wives and girlfriends cheating on these guys you also see the war take it's hold on these guys either they have emotional break downs or they turn psycho.The action in this is phenomenal Jake Gyllenhall is great in this he really seems human in this role and you sympathize with him. Another great performance is by Peter Sarsgaard he plays great as the guy holding the marines together and he has this emotional scene towards the end that just leaves you feeling sorry for this poor guy. The weakest of them all was Jamie Foxx he has the funnest lines in the movie but has no emotion to him he is kind of a flat character compared to the rest of the cast.Overall I think this is a very unappreciated war film and it has its problems but is not to be overlooked I say a good rental and you will be satisfied with what this movie bring to the table.,Null,1,1,13 September 2011
No Country for Old Men," A country with no end
","No Country for Old Men is a great film for 2/3s of it after that the movie really does leave you hanging on WTF. This is a Coen brothers film which almost automatically means it will have a great story and clever writing. Which is true through most of this movie.So the story is about a guy named Llewelyn (Josh Brolin) finds the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad almost everyone is dead. But he just happens to find a suitcase with over 1 million dollars in it. So like any normal human he takes the money, little does he know a psycho named Anton (Javier Bardem) is also wanting the money. So the rest of the movie is Anton hunting Llewelyn down to kill him and take the money.The acting and characters all are just amazing my personal favorite was Javier Bardem as a psycho killer because he is so damn subtle it is unreal. One minute he is talking to you the next your'e a corpse. Tommy Lee Jones is great as a sheriff. He plays his role how a old man who has seen just too much and is just saying to himself I don't need this.The writing is phenomenal each scene has that tension in it the feeling like you have no frigging clue what is going to happen.The biggest yet only problem is yes the ending it just ends with no real conclusion and no sense that the story is truly over. Honestly it threw me off because I am all into the movie towards the end I'm there thinking wait what just happened and it kind of ruins the movie. Overall it is still a great film for the most part I say it is worth a shot a high DVD rental.",Null,0,2,26 August 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Slow yet good but not a western
",This is not a bad film but I am one of those guys that just didn't like it at all. This is a good drama film but I was fooled into thinking this was a western. Then you add the time to this oh God three hours of a movie where there is hardly any action at all as a movie where I was expecting at least some shoot outs I got guys that point there guns at each other and nothing happen most of the time.The whole story is how Jesse James (Brad Pitt) was assassinated by Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). That is a true story which is cool how they execute it. The problem for me is I know nothing of Jesse James so when all the other characters are scared of him I have no clue why because I've never seen him do anything cool or ruthless.The acting is really good now saying that I couldn't stand Casey Affleck in this film I wanted him to die more then anyone but Pitt he is good in this I wish I saw more of him and less of Ben Afflecks wannabe actor brother.Overall if you are into dramas and don't mind slow films then this is for you and you will love it but me I can't see this over a rental.,Null,0,1,20 August 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the best film this summer
","Now I have never seen the original Planet of the Apes but if it is half or even a quarter as good as this then your'e you looking at a good movie. So as you can tell this movie blew me away I am shocked because I was one of those people saying how the trailer didn't look that great that the movie will probably be just another summer block buster. I was wrong this is one of my favorite films it had great acting and characters, wonderful storyline, bad-ass action scenes. There is not a single flaw with this film yes I love it that much.So it the movie starts out showing this company experimenting on apes to find a cure for Alzheimer's's and James Franco has a father that has it so this cure is near and dear to his heart. Something goes wrong they have to stop testing but James Francos character is giving this baby chimp that just happens to have the cure in his body. So from there the story goes on to be James teaching the ape and the ape or Ceasar is learning at accelerating speeds. The second act is like a prison movie with Ceasar in a chimp sanctuary that is just were some of the heart felt and jaw dropping scenes happen. Of course the last is the rise of these apes and that is so cool so action oriented you will be on the edge of your seat.To my surprise this movie really has you care for all these characters whether is be Will (James Franco) his father or most importantly Ceasar. Andy Serkis does the motion capture for Ceasar and this guy is so good at monkey related anything he deserves an award for his performance. Overall see this film in theaters then buy it on video this is a Jizz in Your Pants film.",Null,0,1,16 August 2011
Gran Torino," Great but not his best
",Gran Torinio this movie showed me something I never thought I'd see Clint Eastwood hire actors that couldn't act. Yes the Thao character was terrible in this so bad I bring it up in the opening paragraph but even with him the movie was awesome. To see Clint Eastwood as more of a fragile old man but still seem like the bad-ass he was back in the day is great.The plot is Clint Eastwood is a retired old Korean War vet living in this bad neighborhood that is filled with gangs. The thing he hates most are Asians and what lives next door but a family of them of course he hates them but of course as this movie would go because of some gang members harassing his neighbors you learn he has a heart of gold. Clint is great in this playing this old hard-ass and teaching this kid to be a man is some of the high points in this movie and the fact it shows even a old raciest can accept people once he gets to know them kind of leaves you feeling good for a moment. This movie does get dark towards the end and does not give you the ending you think will happen.Most the acting is good from Clint Eastwood but these side characters are just not up there it won't ruin the movie but it is noticeable enough to make you think wow where they get this guy.Overall the emotional points in this movie work well the score isn't too bad and it is a really great story of a man coming to the end of his life and finding the family he needed. So I say low buy because this is one of Clint Eastwoods best not the best but if you like his work you should own this.,Null,0,2,7 September 2011
Black Snake Moan," A dark southern blues
",I'm got start by saying this movie is dark this thing starts out dark. Every character has some type of problem whether it be sexual abuse or wife leaving you for your brother do think you will be in a good mood while watching this. It starts out kinda slow you see this girl who at first you think is just the town trash because she is sleeping with every guy. Then you have good old Samual Jackson playing this honest guy who's wife left him for his brother. I'm not spoiling anything this is in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Later in the film Lazerus (Samual L. Jackson) finds this girl without saying what happens to her lets say he feels the need to fix her turn her into a honest girl. Now that to me is deep in its self and you just want to see him succeed.This is directed and written by Craig Brewer which I haven't seen anything else he has done but he has talent. The music in this if you like southern blues you will love the music in this I'm not even into the music but in this movie your foot will be tapping.There isn't many flaws worth mentioning because it wasn't slow or made you feel dumb the acting was good and the plot was great. The thing is and this is me I don't see myself ever watching this again I do recommend it but it is just not one of those movies you watch over and over. Overall see this film you will enjoy it maybe more then I did.,Null,0,0,8 August 2011
Black Hawk Down," This Really Happened
","Charlie tango ten four we got a modern war movie here requesting permission to review. Black Hawk Down, based on a true event that just so happened a couple months after I was born believe it or not. This one of the based on true events that to my knowledge stays pretty close to the actual event. This movie is gory and it seemed like a modern Saving Private Ryan.The plot is about the Black Hawks that were shot down in our invasion of a Samolian city and how everything just went to hell. Now I find the story extremely interesting and truly captures the feel of what these guys went through. I can describe this as a pure action war film with a sprinkle of drama.The characters are mixed with really interesting to cliché as hell. One of my favorites was Grimes (Ewan McGregor) he plays this army ranger who signed up thinking he will be a army bad-ass but ends up making coffee the entire time till now. They have these two snipers who are the bravest guys ever, just watching the scene where they go to secure a crash site by themselves you think wow they are real heroes. You got some cliché characters or at least boring characters. Josh Hartnett plays this emotionless soldier he might as well not have been in the movie and definitely not the main character. Hoot (Eric Bana) is the man of few words he seemed like the silent protagonist in a Call of Duty game, but they tried way to hard to make him a bad-ass when he doesn't do anything.Overall this is one of my personal favorite war films. It is not for everyone but I say it is still worth a view. With the stellar cast and how they interact with each other I say High Rental.",Null,1,3,21 October 2011
The Dark Knight," Best Comic Movie Ever
","Wow wow wow this movie rocks, there isn't a single flaw in this movie. It starts out with the Joker being well the Joker and just gets better and better. Every action scene is a big edge on your seat scene. Heath Ledger may not be my favorite adaptation of the Joker but he adds this realism to the character that I've never seen before. Christian Bale is good I don't care for the deep raspy Batman voice but thats me being kind of picky. Now this movie is a little long for a action film but you're never bored and it never gets old you love every second of this movie. If you haven't seen this film yet see it stop reading and go watch this because I guaranteed you will love this movie. It deserves it's 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,11 July 2011
Toy Story 2," Great family fun
",This was the movie that I loved as a child I'd watch this and want my own toys to come to life. This is just a sequel to a perfect trilogy and it is my second favorite of them. This one introduced the toys going out on a epic adventure way outside the home and it just gets better with villain toys and heart felt scene with abandonment.So this movie starts with Woody getting broken and he gets mixed up in a garage sale and basically gets stolen by some fat guy. Now the rest of the toys say we need to go save Woody and they go on a rescue mission. This story is just a epic adventure and you get to see where Woody is from which is always cool. My favorite toy is Zurg not in the sense of lines or importance actually they do kind of a stupid joke with his character but I like to see the the toys that are based on villains are actually evil that is something I wanted to see from these movies more evil toys but thats me.The voice acting we all know who does the voices so I won't name any but those guys are great thats really all that needs to be said.Overall if you like Toy Story like me well you've already seen it but buy it for the kids introduce them to this trilogy this movie and the prequel and sequel are classics in the animated movies. So I give this a buy for you and the kids.,Null,0,1,20 August 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Best Heist Movie Ever
",This is one of Tarantinos best movies now I do like Pulp Fiction more but this is up there in one of my favorite films to date. There is no point saying how it starts out being that it jumps around a lot that is one thing I love is the inconsistent story. But basically it is a heist film but a heist that went wrong with cops dead civilians dead some of the robbers are dead as well. The names are great they just use colors you never have to worry who is who oh thats Mr. White thats Mr.Pink. When they are getting there names is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. But in a way this movie starts as a mystery of who is the cop granted it tells you half way through and you can figure it out real quick but the characters are so good at fighting one another on who betrayed them. The soundtrack is one of the best I had to get the song Little Green Bag the theme of Reservoir Dogs because it was just so cool. The writing and acting is phenomenal there isn't a dull moment where you are thinking please move along I want this to be done. The ending wasn't the best ending but that is a minor complaint to this epic film. In the end buy this on Blu Ray it is just stellar movie for the ages.,Null,0,0,14 August 2011
Pulp Fiction," One of the best in film
","This movie is the best Quentin Tarantino film to date. The whole story is just so wonderfully written that you love ever second of it. My personal favorite is the jumpy time-line he does and the integrated story telling it just mushes everything together into one great film.Now I've given it a lot of praise but there are flaws too as in the character Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) she is one of those characters that just annoys me and honestly she slows down the movie. But that is about the only flaw in it.People who wouldn't enjoy this film besides people who hate good movies are people who don't like dark humor or blood,drugs and suggestive themes.This is one of the few films that I have actually bought the soundtrack to because it is just that good.Overall don't barrow or rent this film buy yes buy it on blu ray and enjoy this classic film for the ages.",Null,0,3,9 August 2011
The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant has a big heart
",This is one of the most fantastic yet emotional animated films I have ever seen. Warner Bros. did an amazing job with this the director Brad Bird who directed The Incredables he really knows what he is doing and the writer Tim McCanlies wow can he write a story. This is adapted from a book also called The Iron Giant to be honest no clue if this follows the book at all. So the story starts out with this little kid who is watching movies at night he hears a noise and well finds the Iron Giant and he saves him. This story is great because through out it this will show how the boy and the giant really care for one another.The Iron Giant only wants to be a super-hero like Superman but people in the 50's hell people now in days will freak out and the government will try and kill it and experiment on it. This brings a lot of heart to the story on one end it is a giant monster film yet on another end it is a story about an outcast who is just trying to figure out who he is.At the end of this movie you truly get to see how bad-ass the Iron Giant really is he could've been a unstoppable monster but since he has the boy he is the likable giant. This may not be everyone but this movie gets emotional at the end I teared up it has such a good ending beginning it is a must see. So if you haven't seen this movie because you think it is for kids you are wrong this is for everyone.,Null,0,1,15 August 2011
X-Men: First Class," This is what the X-men is all about
","Best X-men movie ever. Bold statement yes but so, so true I wish they would reboot the series off of this movie. If only the Wolverine movie was at least half way good then I could say I enjoyed all the X-men movies.The plot is the creation of the X-men and the creation of Magnitos Brotherhood. There are so many side character developments in this movie I can't explain in one review. You have Kevin Bacon who is a mutant he wants to start WW3 between America and Russia, so when both sides are defeated the mutants will rise from the rubble. He for some reason believes that mutants can survive nuclear blast. This fits the original 3 X-men movies for the most part there are some plot holes. The fact in the third movie Magnito and Professor X are recruiting Jean Gray they are still friends and that really doesn't fit with this movie.The acting is phenomenal and all the characters are likable and you can see why some have real problems and somehow you relate to them. The best character was Magnito (Micheal Fassbender) he is such a bad-ass and you finally get to see why he hates humans with such a passion. The weakest character was the villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) he had similar motives as the later Magnito would but unlike him he is basically just a power hungry villain with no logical plan.The music score is phenomenal I adore the soundtrack. None are memorable but they enhance every scene making each scene just that much better.Overall this is a great film my favorite of all the X-men movies. I give this movie a Buy it is a comic movie for fans and movie goers alike.",Null,0,1,20 October 2011
Iron Man," Better the second time around
",OK as some may know I'm not a fan of the sequel to this film but I adore the original film of Iron Man. Yes before you continue to read I will be just kissing this movies ass this is just a warning. So Iron Man is not my personal favorite superhero but he is one of the most interesting. I see him as Marvels Batman but less moody and more fun loving.So the plot is a origins story of Iron Man being I never read to many of the comics I don't know if how he made the suit is exactly like the movie or not and honestly I don't care because I love what they did here. So I am not going to go into the plot too much you got Robert Downey Jr playing as Tony Stark and he is perfect I am honestly yet to see a movie where I dislike him even if I don't care for the movie Robert always gives a stellar performance. Then you have Jeff Bridges who plays Tony's business partner note he is bald so if you have seen this cliché before you know what is going to happen.I used to hate the fact that most of this film was Tony building his suit but the second viewing I did notice how that suit defines the character so him building the suit we see a build in character as well. The thing this movie does great is that is just hints at the Avengers here and there and at the end but it doesn't stop the main story so it can just be like oh heres that movie coming out and yadda yadda.The writing is top notch you suspect it to have some cheesy lines because it was a comic movie and it doesn't. The director Jon Favreau does great and I do want to see him make more then just Iron Man.Overall for those who haven't seen this all two of you buy this film it is just one you will want to own and pull out on a rainy day.,Null,0,2,16 September 2011
Trainspotting," I spotted something else besides trains
","Trainspotting has nothing to do with trains at all which is good trains bore me but the struggles of drug addicts thats interesting to see. I saw this movie not knowing anything about it so when they start shooting heroin in to there body that threw me off completely seeing Obi-won doing drugs why wasn't that in Star Wars.The plot is about these drug addicts living in Scotland and how these guys deal with there addiction. Now this isn't depressing at all they add funny moments mixed in with intensely dark moments. The main character is played by Ewan McGregor and all he is trying to do is kick the stuff but of course it is hard because he is addicted and he has friends who don't want to kick it you know peer pressure. If you can't tell this is a character piece.The characters all have there own problems, one is a psycho path and will fight and attack people for no reason at all. Others are so addicted they will land in jail or just throw away there whole life just to get one more hit. Ewan McGregor is the character you want to see get a normal life and get out of this mess so when you see him make these bad decisions or thrown in bad situations you truly root for him to get out.This is directed by Danny Boyle who has made some great films such as Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours and this one is up there not his best but certainly nothing bad. The film is based on a book so but I never read it so I don't know if it is a accurate adaptation of the book.Overall this is a great movie on the struggles of drugs and wanting a normal life. But it isn't buy worthy so I give it a high rental because this is a must see just not a must have.",Null,0,1,27 September 2011
300," This is Average
",I'm all for violence and gore and even slow motion so why isn't this movie amazing you ask because the characters really and the believability.So the story is taken from a graphic novel and that explains why they have basically monsters and guys with saws for arms. But still this isn't a fantasy the fact all these Spartans are half naked makes me wonder how did these guys not get slaughtered during these battles. So it is basically 300 of the best solders in all of Sparta go to fight the endless armies of Persia and how they hold them off for a while. A weird thing I noticed in the story is they preach about freedom yet the main character is still the king of Sparta and his men call him my lord it seemed more or less a power thing then freedom just Leonidas not wanting to bow down to anyone. It is still interesting action wise that the main story just blows over.The visual design is awesome I remember arguing with people because they said it was animated and no I'm not sure what they did visually but I enjoyed that immensely.The acting was OK there was no one I hated but there was also no outstanding performances. Then the writing they had some cheesy dialog but it also came up with everyones favorite line 'This is Sparta'! so it has that going for it.This is directed by Zack Snyder and this is just his trademark slow motion yes the visual design but this still isn't his best film nor his worst.Overall I say this is a high rental because there is still a lot of fun to be had here.,Null,1,3,2 September 2011
Tarzan," Great for kids and adults
",Tarzan is one of those Disney movies that you can enjoy as a kid and really appreciate it as an adult. This movie starts out real emotional with Tarzans parents being eaten alive by a tiger and then shows how an ape who recently lost her baby to that same tiger. That right there hooked me into this emotional but fun story. The whole story is about fitting in and really finding out who you are.The score done by Mark Mancina is fantastic those songs really help bring the mood of the story and even make a good montage.Now I'm no animator but some of the animation is really cool especially saying how old this is I was sitting there thinking wow that's pretty damn cool.The voice acting is great there are some faults with the characters themselves but that would mean me nit picking.Now as someone who doesn't care for the cliché endings yes this one has it but it is for kids so what you expect. Overall this is a great film if you haven't seen it go see it and if you have see it again no harm in that.,Null,0,0,8 August 2011
