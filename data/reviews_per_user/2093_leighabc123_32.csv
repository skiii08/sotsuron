Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Stupid Movie With Not Enough Cameos Of Cartoon Characters
",The only great scene from this movie was the scene when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck were playing the piano and things got out of hand. I enjoyed that scene when the movie first came out and the scene is still great today. This must be the first and last movie ever that had Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny together.(unless Cartoon All Stars to the rescue had them together!)Why was Yosemite Sam on fire? Why didn't Woody Woodpecker have any speaking lines? This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. It was stupid in 1988 and it is still stupid today! This movie was inappropriate for children. The baby cussing and smoking! The movie was pointless and Roger Rabbit is retarded. Why did they make Jessica Rabbit look like someone who should be in a NC-17 movie? The animated shorts were also very very stupid! Roger Rabbit is a fool! What ever happened to Roger Rabbit? I didn't even see him at Disney World!,1,8,58,14 July 2005
Madagascar," Another Animation With A Serious Message
","If you loved the movies Shark Tales, Finding Nemo, and Happy Feet, then you will definitely love Madagascar! Because all of these movies are supposed to be entertaining to children, but have serious adult messages. The animation was great. Jada Pinkett, Chris Rock, and Cedric the Entertainer did great jobs. But this movie was no where close to being entertaining. The zebra wants to excape the zoo. The animals try to find him. They get caught. They get sent to Africa. The penguins sabotage the plan. And the main characters 'ironically' end up on the same island in Madagascar. Never rent this movie! Do like I did and go see it for free.",1,0,4,18 June 2007
Spice World," Number 38 On The Worse Movies Of All Times List?
","Yes this movie was stupid. But is was funny. We also got to hear the Spice Girls' beautiful voices in this movie. And they are such lovely ladies, especially Melanie B! I can watch that movie over and over again!",10,1,4,8 February 2003
Finding Nemo," Great Disney Animation, But Not The Best Disney Movie
","Spoilers AheadWhy did they kill off Nemo's mother in the beginning of the movie? That plot is too serious for a Disney film! Nemo was also hard headed! When Merlin told him not to swim far in the ocean,  he should have listened! He was a rebellious hard headed five year old fish. This was the best Disney film since Toy Story. That statement is not saying much. Kids,  remember,  don't flush your fish down the toilet stool. They will die.",5,1,3,29 November 2003
Scary Movie 2," this movie was just as trifling as the first Scary Movie
","This movie would have been great if the terrible,  inappropriate scenes were edited out. Private parts should never be shown in an R rated movies. The Wayans Brothers need to clean up their act if they want to stay successful. Everyone does not enjoy profanity and vulgar scenes. The original Scary Movie gets the same comment!",1,2,4,29 August 2001
Radio," You Will Understand This Movie Better After Watching It
","This was the second movie that Cuba Gooding Jr. played a mentally retarded person. The movie was supposed to take place in 1976. But by 1976, mentally retarded people were educated in schools. The movie made it seem like Radio never went to school a day in his life. Actually the events in the movie took place from 1964 to 1976, not just 1976. In the scene when the star athlete told Radio to go into the girl's locker room, I bet it was those other athletes who were laughing who snitched on the star athlete. It was sad that Radio's mother died. It is amazing that Radio is still at that school today. Cuba could act. But overall, this was not a good movie.",1,1,5,30 July 2007
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," This Movie Was Supposed To Be Funny, But Had Serious Messages!
","Madagascar 2 was supposed to be a funny movie that makes people laugh out loud. But part of the plot was stolen from 'Happy Feet.' Alex's father did not accept him because he was a lion who danced instead of fought. Then he finally decided to accept him. The zebra was upset with Alex. Then Alex realized that he was a true friend. He could recognized the Zebra out of all those zebras that looked alike. The giraffe was in love with the Hippo,but he was afraid to show it until the end of the movie. There were too many serious messages for a children's comedy. The little koala bear voiced by Cedric the Entertainer did not have much plot in this movie. And the penguins were not as funny as in the first movie.RIP Bernie Mac",5,1,4,19 February 2009
Edward Scissorhands," Edward Scissorhands Is So Gullible!
","'SPOILERS AHEAD!!!'Edward Scissorhands is a cute fairy tale movie. But why was Edward Scissorhands so gullible? He listened to that creep and let him convince him to break into his own father's house. I knew he loved the girl,  but he should have said,  'No!' I like how he cut the devil in the lady's scrubs. She shouldn't have been so mean to him for no reason! Those other ladies were also so mean to him for no reason. (especially the lady who played the 'Hook Lady' on Boston Public) But why did the man create Edward and put the hands on him last? Why didn't the old lady ever go and visit Edward all those years. She is such a cruel friend!",10,0,0,12 April 2003
Dreamgirls," Great Movie With Great Actors, But Many Things Are Based On The Supremes
","Jennifer Hudson should have been the American Idol! She hit notes that very few professional singers (including Beyonce) can hit. Eddie Murphy sings as well as he did on his song 'Party All The Time.' Anika Noni Rose is a fly lady, but she cannot sing well. Jaleel White had a walk on role at the beginning of the movie. I wonder how much money Dawn Lewis got paid just for being Eddie Murphy's wife in the movie. She had no speaking lines. Jamie Fox was great in this movie. Much of the plot of this movie is based on the Supremes real life story. Jamie Fox was just like Berry Gordy. Beyonce was just like Diane Ross. Jennifer Hudson's character was definitely like Florence Ballard. And Anika's character was Mary Wilson. And when Sharon Leal's character joined the Dreamgirls, she was Cindy Birdsong. Everyone should have known that Jamie Fox's character was the father of Effie's daughter. Also, they took real Supreme album covers and footage and replaced it with the characters from Dreamgirls. And there was also a Jackson 5 look alike group that was singing the music in the same tempo as the Jackson 5 did in the 70s with a light skinned little boy with an afro portraying the Michael of the group and four tall teenagers playing the Marlon, Jermaine, Tito, and Jackie of the group. There is so much to this movie. Most of these actresses should be nominated for an Oscar.",10,2,8,25 December 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," This Movie Tried Too Hard To Be Funny!
","This movie was raw, stupid, and foul. A 40 year old virgin who finally gets married to a 'grandmother' at the end of the movie and loses his virginity. But before this happened, there was some crazy plots throughout the movie. The man is 40 and still rides a bike and has action figures! He kicked a lady in the nose when she sucks on his toes. He goes out and the drunk lady throws up on him while she is driving. He actually dates a drag queen. He was about to have sex with his future wife until his wife's daughter and the teenage boyfriend walks in. His wife's daughter hated him until she found out that he was a virgin. Make sure you see the deleted scenes from this movie. It will help you understand the plot better.",1,6,12,19 June 2009
Bad Teacher," This Is The Most Creative Movie That Cameron Diaz Has Ever Starred In!
","Cameron Diaz, plays a stuck up, gold digging, manipulative 7th grade English teacher in this movie. She lets the students watch movies every day in class until she finds out that the teachers receive a bonus for having the highest test scores. Then she starts to teach. She humiliates 7th grade students who get questions wrong and then hits them with dodge balls. Then she cheats to win the bonus. Then she gets promoted to guidance counselor. Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character reminds me of many teachers in Virginia schools. They don't really teach. They get away with so much. They cheat so their students can have the highest test scores. And they never get in trouble with the principal, despite their horrible teaching. Teachers who are dedicated like Mrs. Squirrel in the movie never get any respect. This movie was creative and a slight exaggeration of what really goes on daily in public schools in Virginia.",10,2,5,21 January 2012
Saw III," Bad Acting and Lots Of Fake Blood
","This movie was wack! I want my $13 back! I literally fell asleep during some scenes in this movie. This was some of the phoniest acting in a horror movie that I have ever seen. The screams were unbelievable. I laughed so hard when the judge said, 'Please! I don't want to die!' And the man said 'Shut the ___ up!' I should have known that the doctor was married to the man whose son was killed in the car accident! Another funny scene was when the witness to the car accident was naked and being froze to death by water. She told the man, 'I didn't do anything!' Then the man said, 'That's right! You didn't do anything! That is why my son is dead now!' The writers of this movie tried to confuse to death many people with the plot when they made this movie. This movie was so bad that I want to see Saw I and Saw II.",1,4,10,28 October 2006
School of Rock," This Movie Was Unrealistic And Predictable!
","Spoilers Ahead!!!This movie was so unrealistic! How many schools would let a 5th grade substitute teacher teach students rock and roll music instead of academics? The ignorant principal would have found out about Jack Black's plot the first week he was there and he would have been fired on the spot! The students had great music talent. However, they should have showed it during music class instead of during their academic classes. I knew the kids were going to lose the battle of the bands. If they would have won,  it would have ruined the plot of the whole movie. Those kids would have been rock stars and never would have made it to the 6th grade! Jack's roommate was so gullible and naive. If his girlfriend wasn't there,  no telling what would have happened! Overall, the plot of this movie is something that can only happen in a movie and never in real life!",1,9,31,6 June 2004
Shrek the Third," Too Many Serious Messages For A Fun Movie
","I never give a movie three stars, but I am going to make an exception for this one. There were some funny scenes in this movie, like when the gingerbread man kept cracking jokes about the Prince's bad acting during the beginning of the movie. Shrek also cracked jokes about the Prince's bad acting. But there were too many sad heartbreaking messages in this movie. The frog king, who is Fiona's dad, died. Artie was picked on at school and depressed about how things were going in his life. And Shrek was feeling bad. He was not ready to be a father. There were even serious, not funny moments with the Donkey and Puss in Boots in this movie!",3,0,1,24 November 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Number 225 On The Best Movies Of All Times?
","This movies should have been #225 on the worst movies of all times list. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life! The sound track for the movie was great,  but you cannot have a great sound track and an awful movie! I had more fun watching the clouds turn grey than watching this boring thing they call a movie!",1,1,7,22 March 2003
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," #168 On The Top 250 Movies List?
","This movie was 'good.' Yes. It won a couple of Oscars. But it wasn't that good. First, it was too long! And it was so boring! They added the Hurricane Katrina plot to try to make the movie more interesting. It was great to see Taraji P. Henson play a different type of role. She did not act like a sassy woman in this movie, but a warm loving mother. This is a movie about an old man who became younger. It seems like Benjamin was very strange as a very old toddler and a very young senior citizen. The only time when he was normal was when Brad Pitt played the role of him. I finally found some plot in the movie when I discovered that Daisy's daughter Caroline was Benjamin Button's daughter.",1,4,12,23 May 2009
Shrek 2," This Movie Took A Lot Of Creativity....
","But the entire plot of this movie was predictable! We all knew at the beginning of the movie that the ogre and the princess ogre were going to end up together at the end of the movie. This movie is definitely not for kids. The fairy godmother is supposed to be pleasant, not mean and vicious. And prince charming is supposed to be nice and not mean. Just like the original Shrek, this movie pokes fun of so many fairy tales. The donkey was much less annoying in this movie than the original Shrek. And Puss in Boots was a creative idea. I like the end when the princess's father turns into a frog. Ha! Ha! Ha! It was so cool to see Puss in Boots have a change of heart in this movie.",10,0,2,2 January 2006
There's Something About Mary," This Movie Was Offensive And Unfunny!
","Spoilers Ahead!!You have to be retarded to zip yourself in your pants! Why did so many men try so many tricks to get Mary? If Ted didn't end up with Mary at the end of the movie,  the plot would have been ruined. This movie was offensive to the mentally disabled. They also didn't give Kandi Alexander enough lines in this movie. Cameron Diaz played a gullible fool in this movie. And who would drive from Rhode Island to Florida just to see a girl that you don't even know? And who would send someone from Rhode Island to Florida to find someone? It was cool to see Chris Everett in a hit movie. He haven't did anything really great since the late 1980s.",1,0,6,9 July 2004
Up," This Animation Is Way Too Serious To Be #68 In The Top 250 List
","This movie goes from silly to serious in a heartbeat. The old man meets his future wife when he was a young introverted child. The movie starts off innocent. Then they get married and have many unexpected problems in their marriage that keeps them from going to Paradise Falls. Then his wife either had a miscarriage or stillbirth when she planned on having a baby. Later, she dies before they accomplished their goal. Then they wanted to put the old man in an old folk's home. He flies his house away in balloons. But a boy stows away on his house. The boy has his own share of problems. His father continues to lie to him and not be a part of his life. Too many serious realistic plots to be a funny animation! If that crazy explorer was already an adult when the old man was a little boy, then he was the most active senior citizen cartoon character over 90 that I have ever seen!",5,0,1,7 December 2009
Titanic," Does A Movie Have To Be 3 Hours To Receive An Oscar?
","This movie was way too long! I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio do better acting when he was a kid on 'Growing Pains.' There were so many unbelievable plots in this movie. Why would people bring guns on a ship and shoot people. There are so many unanswered questions in this movie. Why were the rich people so mean and snobby? This movie won eleven Oscars? 1997 must have been a very bad year for movies. Who did the extensive research for this movie? How do they know what happened on the Titanic? Very few people (if any) that were on that ship are alive today. Most of the actors did a very good job. However,  I haven't seen many of them in other movies. The ship did look luxurious for 1912.",1,1,8,6 May 2004
Glory Road," Just Like Remember The Titans and Another Predictable Ending
","Unlike Coach Carter, the team that this movie features does win the championship. Any movie with Tatyana Ali deserves 10 stars. The guys that this movie was based on are still alive today. Look at the DVD version and hear their true stories. The real Coach Haskins make a cameo appearance in this movie as a gas station attendant. Did racism really exist like that in 1965 in El Paso Texas? It did in my hometown. The entire plot of this movie is eerily similar to the plot of Remember The Titans. Both teams had really strict coaches and blacks coming to play for previously all white teams. Both teams end up winning the championship. Both real life coaches are still around to this day.",10,0,0,5 August 2006
Hancock," This Movie Was Over-hyped!
","Will Smith has played in so many movies better than this! He is a hateful all the time superhero who destroys things while he tries to help people. The only good part of the movie was when he got that bully girl looking boy ironically named Michelle with the Russian accent. He knocked that bully away. And when he came back, he cried like a little baby. Then Hancock threatened his buddies. I should have known in the beginning that Charlize's character was immortal! She held a grudge against Hancock at the beginning of the movie. And she was not the mother of Jason Bateman's character's young son. This was revealed later in the movie. Jason Bateman has really grown up as an actor. There were touchy moments in this movie that made it much worse. And the people who Hancock threw in jail tried to get revenge with no success. Overall, this was a horrible movie, but not the worst movie I have ever seen. I didn't pay to see it, but I want my $12 back!",2,6,14,4 July 2008
Ray," Good Movie, But Missing Many Points In Ray's Life
","Spoilers Ahead!!Jamie Foxx did a good job playing Ray Charles. Larenz Tate playing Quincy Jones was a laugh! It is a shame that Ray could never see the movie. They had many lovely ladies, such as Regina King and Kerry Washington to play Ray's lovers. This movie basically stopped in the late 1960s after Ray stopped using heroin. Ray did a trillion things between that time and when he died in 2004! The movie also never told how Ray's mother died and the real reason why he moved to Seattle. It also never showed Ray's experience at the school for the blind. It also didn't show five of Ray's children or Ray's other lovers.",10,1,3,2 November 2004
Despicable Me," Another Comedy Animation With Very Serious Plots
","This movie started out funny. Gru was so mean to everyone. He made a balloon for a little boy and busted it. He froze everyone in the line of the restaurant so he can get to the front of the line. Then he decided to adopt three little girls from the orphanage. Eventually, he became a great father to the little orphan girls. Watching the minions interact was cute. All of those serious plots in the movie were not! Gru never received any love from his mother as a child no matter how hard he tried. The orphan girls never had anyone to care for them until Gru adopted them. We watch animations to be entertained, not to cry during them!",5,1,5,16 January 2011
The Emperor's New Groove," Another Creative Disney Movie
","This movie was so creative. A bossy mean spirited emperor who turns in a llama. A gullible peasant who helps the emperor out. Why did he continue to help the emperor out even though he was so mean to him? A mean wicked assistant who gets fired by the emperor before she turns him into a llama. And the mean wicked assistant's gullible sidekick. If the gullible sidekick had any backbone, imagine what direction this movie would have gone in. Let's not forget about the gullible peasant's wife and hyperactive children. And the annoying squirrel was added to make the movie more crazy. I think it was so cool when the wicked assistant turned into a kitty cat near the end of the movie. Eartha Kitt? Purple Kitty Cat? Isn't that ironic?",10,0,1,21 June 2006
Honey," Number 87 On The Worst Movies Of All Times List?
","Yes. This movie was bad. But it did not deserve to be #87 on the worst movies of all time list. Yes,  we have seen the same plot done in many other movies. Some dancer becomes famous overnight and then something bad happens. However the movie still turns out to have a happy fairy tale ending. The plot was totally unrealistic. I know Missy Elliot isn't the way she is portrayed in that movie. And why did they have Lil Romeo to play in the movie? They needed a young teenager who actually know how it feels to be poor and living in the ghetto. They needed to give Joy Bryant more lines in that movie. This was a bad movie,  but there were 100 more movies that were worse than this that didn't make it to the bottom 100 list!",10,0,3,16 April 2004
Coach Carter," This Movie Doesn't Have A Typical Plot
","Samuel L. Jackson should win an Oscar for this movie just like Jamie Foxx should win an Oscar for the movie 'Ray.' This movie starts out with the same plot that all other basketball movies have. Ghetto basketball players fighting and trying to win games. But there's a twist to this one. Coach Carter locked the gym after the players couldn't keep their grades up. If all basketball coaches behaved like this and put education first, there would be no Kobe Bryant or LeBron James. It was strange seeing Ashanti play the role of some one from the ghetto. This proves that she can act. In all other sports movies, the team that the movie is based on wins the championship. But in this movie, the Richmond Oilers LOSE the championship at the buzzer. All NBA coaches and players who have never been to college should watch this movie.",10,2,8,15 January 2005
Happy Feet," This Was Not A Good Movie!
","Yes. There was a lot of singing and great 3D animation. But the entire plot of this movie was horrible! A father penguin drops his egg son. The son cannot sing like the other penguins. But he can dance. The son penguin loves another female penguin who can sing well. They end up together. But before this happens, he gets advice and helps out a know it all bird named Lovelace. There is so much going on in this movie and too many serious messages for a child's movie. But if you get the DVD, you can see the entire 1936 cartoon, I Love To Singa. There are actually clips of this shown during the movie 'Looney Tunes. Back In Action.' Now I give that cartoon 10 stars!",1,12,21,21 May 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith Is Not The Fresh Prince In This Movie
","It was strange seeing Will Smith playing a serious role. And his son Jaden can act. He looks just like Jada. Thandie did great in this movie. There are things in this movie that were unrealistic. Most of the time when a woman leaves a man, she takes the child. But there was one thing that was realistic. When the shelter rejected Chris and his son because he was a man was realistic. Society helps women with children but not men with children. Will Smith must have been on a track team in high school. I was about to have an asthma attack just by watching him do all that running around in the movie. Were there really so many homeless people in San Francisco that they had to fight for a space in the shelter each day? There were some things that should have been added to the movie. They should have added when Chris's wife came back for a short time to produce another baby for them. This story is a rare rags to riches story.",9,0,0,15 January 2007
Shark Tale," An Animation With Fish That Has A Serious Message!
","Will Smith is a great voice person. But this movie had way too many serious messages for it to be an animation with fishes and sharks. I must say it took a lot of creativity to get Oscar the fish to do MC Hammer dances. This animation was to real! Someone pretending that he's someone that he's not. A lady fish using a man fish. A son shark not being accepted by his own father. We see another stupid movie where someone bets everything that he owns and loses all of his money at the 11th hour. When the big brother shark died, that was the phoniest death scene I have ever seen in an animation in my life! Jack Black plays the role of someone who is very stupid in every movie that he's in, even though he was a shark in this movie.",5,0,3,22 June 2005
Hustle & Flow," The Characters Were Total Jerks In This Movie!
",Terrance Dashon Howard was a hateful pimp who treated women like dogs. He treated the token white girl like dirt! He threw Paula Jai Parker and a crying baby out on the streets in the middle of the night! He slapped a pregnant Taraji Henson for not singing as well as she could have! Elise Neal was trying not to act black in this movie. Anthony Anderson couldn't be in the movie for 5 minutes without acting stupid like he does in all of his movies. And he was a hypocrite. He played gospel music in church and profanity music at home. Terrance's character DJay shouldn't have kissed up to Ludicrous' character. But he needed to beat him up for putting his demo tape in the toilet stool. How did DJay's demo get played on the radio even though he was in jail for whipping Ludicrous' character?,2,2,6,13 August 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Number 43 on the Top 250 List?
","Yes this movie was great. But it was not good enough to be on the top 250 list. First, only 20% of this movie was actually funny and good. The organist plays a slow version of Green Day's American Idiot. There was an advertisement for a TV program and a short pause where the screen turned black. It said, 'To be continued...immediately!' When they were hiding from the law, Bart saw the wanted poster with the Simpsons family and drew on it. And there was a family that looked like the drawing who walked in and they got arrested instead of the Simpsons. The whole plot with Homer and the pig and Lisa having a crush with a foreign boy was pointless. Marge used the Lord's name in vain in this movie. She was never this hateful in the cartoon series. A very serious added Bart wishes Flanders was his father plot ruined the comedy aspect of the movie. For those of you who walked out as soon as the credits were shown missed a lot of surprises. Maggie talks for the second time in the entire 20 year history of the Simpsons!",1,11,25,29 July 2007
