The Lobster," One of the worst films ever made
","The premise of this movie was actually appealing and it seemed to have potential as a quirky satire. However, this movie is so bad in so many ways that I stopped it about halfway through. The writing is confused; the acting is robotic, the humor isn't very funny and the tone is depressing.I have watched and enjoyed numerous futuristic and post apocalyptic stories. In the good ones, the story revolves around real people struggling with difficult situations. But in this one, based on their reactions to various ridiculous situations, every character in this story behaved as though borderline insane or deranged or drugged. I rated this a 2 instead of 1 for the nice scenery and for Rachel Weiss who is always a pleasure to watch. Both were wasted on this nonsense.A week after watching the first hour, I watched the balance to see if there was anything interesting or thought provoking to take away from this. There was not. My best summary for this is: boring, disturbing, sick, and a waste of time.",2,5,6,8 May 2018
Cloud Atlas," Utter Nonsense
","I just finished this mess of a story and I have no idea what I just saw. The outstanding cast and high ratings gave me high expectations; instead I wasted three hours of my life.The cast and acting are good; visually this movie is interesting; but the story is ridiculously convoluted and incomprehensible. The time line jumps back and forth across centuries, the stories go nowhere, and if there was a plot, it was way over my head. I guess this is art, but I don't get it. I kept hoping the end would tie it all together, but it did not.I would rate this one star for the story. However, I add one star for the visual effects and one star for the great cast (though in a wasted effort) for a total of three stars. Very disappointing.",3,5,9,9 November 2018
