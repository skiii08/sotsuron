Black Swan," Beware of Ballet
","I will not be sending my daughter to ballet lessons anytime soon, that is for sure. Anyone watching this film as promotion of ballet will be shocked. I was in the cinema with a bunch of upcoming ballerinas. The lesbian scene had a mother and her daughter heading for the door. I do think the scene was excessive and un-artful and thus only there for sensationalism and controversy (an no serious film lover respects cheap tricks). Was It a good film depends on if we judge it by its period. Now after hunger for something to feed my desire for quality Hollywood cinema this film at least hits some marks. I struggled with 'the American' (it tried and didn't hit the mark as it should have). A good comment was made which said 'As for Portman, she will win the Oscar for 'Black Swan,' however, she should have won it for 'Closer.' it saves time to just quote the better reviewers. The other user says and I agree: Most of the film she played Nina as the Naive, frustrated woman the role required. However, where was the redemptive aggression of the Black Swan? That would have been an action challenge! It was reduced to a few scenes at the end. Wasn't that the whole point of the film? It felt like, 'OK, we're almost out of money so let's wrap this up.' And don't try to label the movie sophisticated or artsy. Please!!!! ' No it isn't an art house film, it is a Hollywood film with an art house marketing dress. Now I didn't like the DP work, I guess I expected stunning stable cinematography which was mirror the delicate world of ballet. I didn't expect gritty and shaky. Without that expectation maybe it would have worked. Now here is the main flaw. As stated above there was a failure to make the case for the Black Swan dual personality. It seemed to show up at the end in a rush. It is subjective but I think there was a failure on the part of the director. I honestly think someone else could have done a much better job with the screenplay. Something is missing in his tool box. I saw the same missing element in Requiem. (a good concept with poor application making it unpleasant to watch as a film, or maybe it was just very bad editing)or maybe it was suppose to be a music video.It is not fair to say but I found Ms Portmans weight distracting (personal opinion) she was so skinny it drew my focus. Her voice has never been a winner, you just don't associate those kind of voices with A-rate actors. Rese being another one along with Melanie Griffith . I think the only Funny voice actress who holds it down and is taken serious is Holly Hunter.The real reason I enjoyed it is because the world of modern cinema is so predictable and boring that this film gives a little joy. So not a perfect execution but a good attempt. I would buy the DVD as it is a valid contribution for any collection. And you will not have to put it in backwards to hide the title from your friends out of shame.",6,0,3,4 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Give up while ahead, please give up now you are behind
","From the first 10 minutes you knew it was utter junk. A series of random actions which are poorly scripted with sub-standard humor and Jack at his worst. Part 1 was banging with action, and so was part 2. Part 3 started to meander into a plot so complex and unrewarding that it lost the viewer.Good films are anchored in good objectives. i.e. What is the major objective of the antagonist. (Jack) what does he want. And this was very unresolved even 40 minutes into the film. But you keep bring up the old news - he doesn't have a ship. And over and over again the same tricks but poorly executed. The same capture and escape. Try something new. What worked for part 1 and 2 was because they were new. It is part 4 now, we want to see something different. And in both 1 and 2 the objectives and the mission was tight sequence after sequence, joke after joke. Jack seems tired and less bouncy in 4, why? Maybe because the script is so weak and the objectives so forced. And even in fiction you need realism within the boundaries of the world the script makers cast. You cant just have people show up unexplained , undeveloped. Did the film truly explain the cast and their passion? No. Keira and Orlando made a very good choice to stay away - so should the audience. Had it been so good you would see them. Knowing when to quit is criticalI hope this will be the last and that money will not squeeze out another story from a franchise which needs to be buried.",1,25,53,21 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Sub-Standard time wasting empty story i.e. Garbage
","This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor- Fact. The word redundant scenes takes on new meaning. If you were teaching a class in redundant scenes (i.e. scenes that tell you nothing, contribute nothing to the story or the plot, but just help to get the film to its status of two hours of a waste of people's time).How many scenes have no direction and could be dropped in anyplace, or to any film. What about the silly dialog? The emergence of characters based solely on their personalities, Jackson for example. You have quality actors in this film looking like very bad actors. The roles given to them and the motives of the characters are paper thin. The only person that looked mean and meant it was Rouke. How many times have we seen the Sam Jackson character. I swore he looked like Shaft returned. Anyone giving this film a rating higher than 4 has no idea about quality. It sounds bold but it is how serious I feel about this zero (if i could) rating. Last film I saw was Titans, and that was at least marginally engaging with a obvious plot, but it followed a plot - at least. Was it asking too much to have a believable story from start to end?Another film which pulls steals peoples money, and the Hollywood industry is so poor these days that people are forced to watch nonsense like this and then say it was 'fun'.",1,45,99,1 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Running Man (2012) Amoral and poor
","It is hard to know what is more sickening, a film about beautiful children killing one another, or a film which is a terrible spin on the Running Man, or the fact that so many people missed these two major issues when they rated it so high. It must be a sign of our time when we have moved beyond the already excessive violence of man vs. man to now target our children and involve them as part of that horrible violence. It must be a first because the worse of the worse, the most violent Rambo IV still have some basic boundaries about children. This film slashes all of that.Now between the direct copy of running man, didn't read the book so cant comment on that, the bad timing (taking how long to arch into a story?),only to find no story, no characters, weak unbelievable people hunting one another, the utter predictability, the false and contrived Romeo and Juliet scene, (that cute African American was inserted for one purpose only, to generate empathy, It didn't because by then I was disconnected because of the excessive violence) what was good? Did could have at least let Lenny Kravitz do the theme song. no luck there. So even without my primary complaint the film is utter garbage in the script and directing department. It is also horrible in the music department. And the lowest score is in the morality department, excessively violent cruel and unusually. Listening to a young boy be ripped apart by CGI dogs. And what was the message? They 'surprisingly' thwarted the system-- Like Running Man. The difference is nothing changed; it just had some awkward pointless ending that was almost like the script writers ran out of stem and just were trying to figure out how to bring up the end credits.",1,15,32,9 April 2012
Us," Without Lupita and Music it would be ZERO
","Why are the critics reviews so high? Yet the audience reviews so low. And when a lot of people keep pulling up the same flaws what does that mean. I do not know about the hype, I just rushed to see it. Yet my complaint is shared.1. beautiful score, 2. Lupita is outstanding, this is acting like Jack in the Shinning--and she is better. 3. film started very well, and then....My word is this a professional filmmaker? How can you get so many things right and then run your own film into the nearest tree and not know? What is up with the dialogue? And seeing his other films it is clearly a problem with Peele. How can you know so much but not enough to keep your film buoyant. It is like two people wrote the film. The start a real script writer and then a novice took over. The films concepts are muddled, random, unexplored and lazy. And I really did not like Mr. Black Panther in this film, what a useless character and horrible acting. The kids were on point.
I am suspect of these so-called critics. Is this one of those ' We need a black film for this year' thing?",4,1,7,22 November 2019
Terminator Salvation," poor Score, weak film but pretty eye catching (if you are into that stuff)
","Lets discuss Mr Dan Elfmans score of this film. The departure from the metallic and iconic score of Brad Fidel was suicidal. Not only does it have nostalgia attached to it, it also is sonically the perfect landscape for a Terminator and judgement day. The strings and the non-signature style make the music of absolutely no consequence, you can't remember it, it has no value. Now Elfman was very effective and industrial on Deconstruction Planet of the Apes and it is a great disappointment that someone so modern and post-futuristic would be so disappointing. To the film which is pretty bland and nonsense from the get go. The little 'Newt' child seemed very Aliens. Apart from that the film lacks character and realism. Let's be honest you gonna attack Skynet and that is all the defences they have? Come on. 1 single terminator waiting for all of the resistance? Films should take you on a journey this film seems to just unroll in 1 day and is thin and without character. An on that subject there is absolutely no character building, if you haven't seen the series before you cannot attach to anything or anyone. So poor they actually even made Helena look dry. No character has any screen presence and definitely not Sam Worthington or Bryce. So on a casting note the film is pretty whack. But common, ironside, moon and maybe Jadagrace were nice to see. The only thing that makes this film watchable is the constant violence, and it doesn't take a genius to produce on screen violence.",2,1,6,8 June 2009
The Hateful Eight," Sam Jackson does all the work
","This film is okay but had the casting been done it would have got a 7/10 Sam Jackson holds this entire film together. Walton and Roth should not have been included, their acting spoiled this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Russell are good also very good. No idea why people think Walton can act. Him and Roth take away from the film and make it awkward. Michael is just being Michael so neither here nor there; same guy we saw in Kill Bill.",5,0,3,1 September 2019
Alien," A classic film
","This film is close to perfection, the style the music the genre. And i am talking about it now in 2007, so put all of this into the context of 1979--wow! The pace the way it takes the viewer to this alien place, it feels like you are there in the situation. It doesn't try to sit on the overused Hollywood storyline or action line. The best parts have in no action. You don't see much blood and gore but you feel it! Alien 3 had a similar style, never understood why people didn't like it. In Aliens it is just not classic, it is standard guns in guns out (still it is good) but it isn't a film it is more a very good movie. Alien is a film by all the arts standards you would want to throw at it.",10,1,3,13 February 2007
Underworld Awakening," Not bad as junk goes
","Lets be honest you do not go into a cinema billing 'Underworld: Awakening' expecting 'Silence of the Lamb' or 'Elegy' this is fast food cinema. The rules of critique that might apply to Spike Lee are therefore not applicable here. So understand my rating of 7/10 is factoring in that. It is 6/10 for fast food cinema. The action was tight, the objectives of the film were clear. Certain 'chosen one' themes i found boring and the film really must find other incentives for Werewolves to hunt vamps. There is something cool about Kate, I don't know what cuz she just looks like a normal Brit, but she is def the kick ass chick of this era. I mean would you pick her or Ms. Weaver to protect you. Well Ms. Weaver cant bounce off walls so I am sticking with Kate. Some parts could have been better but that is always the case. I was happy not to see certain actors but I miss that old dude, Man he was evil. I mean he was really the best. I don't know the future of the franchise and I hope it doesn't turn into the Dark Knight Cop villain relationship.",6,18,32,24 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than those other two and that says very little
","It is not as bad as the other two. So why the hate? B/c that is the nature of hate. It was going around YouTube for so long and if you check carefully a lot of the hate is repetitive-- (one person says something and everyone repeats it). Now that does not make it true or false but that is what is going on. So everyone is talking about Fan service, I heard that criticism already? i heard it had in many themes-- true but that is not its biggest sin, failure to create a story we got invested in was the problem. Still better than Last Jedi. Even that title is clickbait, just like this one. The major issues are how UNORIGINAL it is, mirroring great work from decades ago. JJ or Jah Jah has a talent for polishing other people's genius (quoting someone). He is not that talented-- really he is not. Anyone with true talent would not Twice now have to ape what was done before. And somethings in this film are so stupid he invites criticism. did he not show this film to serious people before green-lighting some of this nonsense

Being John Malkovich," What A Script
","Very rare to see such a complex but tight script. It hits all the points it intends to hit. Very complex yet easy to understand. What kind of mind creates this from nothing. I mean the floor, the puppet thing the whole interwoven of so many themes yet the final film is fluid and functional. The screenplay should have won more awards. what a film, and I am not even into these kinds of films but good work is good work regardless of your personal genre choice. More films with creativity please!Something outside the box which bears nothing to other styles. Just like traffic did that disjointed thing, this film does another thing. Most of the times scripts that are so heavy come from books. So max credit.",9,0,2,23 July 2009
District 9," Racist White nonsense - xenophobic trash
","South Africa says it is a rainbow nation, where is the Rainbow in this film. Where are the Africans? It is Africa and they represent 80% of the population, not even 50%. Oh yeah some Africans made it into the film, guess what they were doing? Helping the White racist immigration argument (xenophobia) that Nigerians and foreigners (who the aliens represent if you didn't get it by now) are bad for SA. You watching the film and you didn't get that did you? The white mans burden, solved by an white man with ethics? This film is dirty, messy and cheap. Over rated, is a mild world. Vulgarly racist in a country that goes on 24/7 about harmony their most successful film looks like it was made pre-94 flat bam in the middle of apartheid. Tells you a lot about those in power who let a racist film speak for SA.For the record because you might not know this 98% of the films out of SA that the world sees are exclusively made by white people, for their white agenda. Inside of SA Africans are only really used for alcohol adverts. This film fits right in with the image of apartheid-- All white.It is not even a good film by any standard.",1,2,13,13 March 2012
The Hurt Locker," Overrated dry predictable, unoriginal
","Had it not been for all the awards and excessive hype i may have enjoyed it a little more. When you see so many awards you open the DVD with a rush expecting to see the kind of film that demarks an era, a generation and an epoch (ideally at least, cant recall the last time that happened).What can I saw, what was so good about it? A man walking around defusing bombs-- That is it! yeah pretty much. A cock sure guy defusing bombs. Well my mom filmed me pulling the wings off of insects once, maybe i should submit that for the nu-vogue cinema nonsense that seems to be fashionable . I mean is story necessary--no. And lets talk about 'suspense' some writers create suspense by writing suspense. Now tell me how much skill does it take a scriptwriter or a director to get suspense from filming a man defusing a bomb? Maybe it might blow up maybe it would not. Defusing a bomb is in itself tense, we know that. So the top talent of Hollywood films a guy defusing a bomb- and get accolades from every quarter of that self-praising incestuous club. Was it not Mr. Fahrenheit 9/11 that also made this comment? What a joke. I don't mind it as some kind of alternative cinema. But the real issue is the hype.",4,2,3,10 March 2012
Avatar," Dances with Wolves in Space as someone said
","I don't know about U but that blue chick is hot. Beyond that when it comes to originality this film will win nothing. In terms of special effects, I am the only one not blown away, maybe I got a bad projection. But Lord of the Rings was similar so I don't see anything which blows you away. As a film it offers nothing to the film buff who is look for art on a screen. It is the same old tricks with 2009 technology. Input the old hero 'Great White Hunter' script into the latest digital CGI software.I think the film could have done better without the slow 'video log' style start, it isn't keeping with the rest of the film. I don't know but the first 90 minutes or so was time to walk out. I liked the film after that boring video log nonsense which was anti- everything. U know in Alien when Weaver does the video log it really really sets the mode. 'This is Ripley Last survivor of the Something, with any luck the company will pick us up' now that had mood and dept. I don't think Sam is the man, and I ll tell you why, take a look at all the greatest actors and I will tell you what they have in common—memorable faces. He has nothing in his face like Weaver, or Al Pacino, Denzel, or Snipes, you could have easily replaced with that English actor that plays Jedi Master Obekanobi. What is special about him, Will Smith would have been perfect and plus he is Black so he would relate to being Blue just that much more. I hope we see less of this Sam guy cuz even his acting is neither here nor there. But back to the technical stuff, the music was nonsense, I cant remember one single song or theme. Definitely not Aliens 3 for music. And the film is so predictable I must assume it is aimed at children.Anyway beyond all of that I will still buy it on DVD because it has merit as an entry into cinema, not as much as the Matrix or 300 but still it makes an entry. Plus movies these days are so horrible that we the consumers are left with bad or badder.",5,5,13,28 December 2009
Invictus," The Great White Hero again, Mandlela story needs the Great Tarzan
","How many more? um? How many more SA films where the Africans are a backdrop to some White hero? Isn't the story Cry Freedom, or In My Country etc etc, or Catch A Fire? The engineered rainbow rhetoric which exist only only screen but nowhere in the economy of South Africa. The story of Africa always needs a great white hero, like Last King of Scotland. And not to mention more white directors. And they are searching hi and low 2 find the white Tarzan in every African victory.Film is an art but I get concerned when every film out of SA sings the same theme. It speaks to something artificial, something social injustice. When did we see a film where whites didn't get let off the hook? When did we see a film where whites didn't exist? Name a 'Black film' and look behind the lens; who wrote it, who produced it, who directed it? Amistad , the music by John Williams, the director Mr. Spielberg. A Jamaican film called One Love , again the same pattern. Tsosti a story of violence in the African communities, violence is a natural reality of South African people in European perception; it sells and it feeds their image of us of being gang bangers, and semi-noble savages . It is almost impossible to consider a film that does not include a European central figure. War Dance, singing dancing through the horrors of a genocide. The recent Last King of Scotland reflects this it is in the legacy of CRY FREEDOM, the title shows the mindset behind it . I t would not be sufficient to tell the story of Idi Amin; so infamous enough and surely notorious enough character in his own right. No, they say, this would reduce the value of the project, in comes the European into the storyline. It is actually amazing to see Mel Gibson attempt to make a film of a non-White people without a central European character. Returning to the likes of Richard Attenborough we cannot blame him for his bias in Cry Freedom , he is by nature a European and is simply acting out his European weighted world view, avoiding Eurocentric as a term, as every healthy race is sensitive to his or her cultural perceptions",1,5,30,16 December 2009
Thor," Utter garbage written around SFX
","Did professionals write this film? Did Antony really read the script or did he just see the figures in the contract? I think Nat and Tony need new agents, because you do not go from Silence of lamb and Black Swan *respectively* to this utter junk.I do not know what other people saw but there is nothing good or unique in this film. The special effects actually made me tired. And lets talk about the story? My Lord, where was it and when did it begin. I got the feeling that the script was written after the action sequences were planned. They therefore said we want this effect and this effect now lets write a film around that. We need to use up Nat so lets force a romance into the script. We want jokes, so lets force a few of those in there. So much dead space in the film that doesn't arch into anything.scenes seem random and disconnected, like writing in junk to get it to a feature length time. drifting focus, drifting priorities. And no great moments that saved the film.Also it is an overnight transformation from utter arrgoance to humility. Does anyone identify with any characters here? Did you understand the brothers motives? Makes no real sense in the real world. Did the film introduce anything for anyone to attach themselves to emotionally? No. Characters appear in odd order without any development. Actually while I am here typing I just realized something : This film is below the dignity of critique. It is so poor, so badly directed and written that to even point out the weak character development or random script turns give too much credit to it. I will therefore cease to add speak about it for fear of giving someone the illusion that there is anything to actually speak about in terms of artistic critique.",1,222,423,7 May 2011

Prometheus," Awful, terrible script, incoherent, multi themes going no where
","As part of an experiment I once watched a film called Two headed Shark attack (or something like that) but what I learned was even the worse B film can master tension and follow some sort of believable plot. This film failed so bad I cannot believe Ridley Scot did it. 15 minutes into the film the first issue was the dialog and the jumping from theme to theme. It didn't flow, it didn't transition. It didn't sit to explain the universe in which the film was to be born into. Now unlike most people I did a few course in script writing. And i would love for someone to tell me this script was good. There is no tension, none. I actually stopped caring why the aliens want to destroy Earth Maybe to destroy Hollywood from making anymore films like this.Please tell me you invested in those empty unrealistic characters, apart from The robot and Theron I really cant remember one person. have no idea who did the casting. Compare the African American to the original African American in Alien. Compare Weavers role in 1-4 (and I complained about 4). You see where I am going. The film has in too many unresolved unexplained, unrealistic themes. Two many aliens, mismatch of boring parts from far too many places, too many motives. Then the last 14 minutes they reveal some silly motive which makes no sense whats so ever. And the film rushes to deal with the threat, what do they do? Get a 1/2 interested captain to grow some deep spirituality (not previous developed in the character) and...Well See independence Day collision for the 20th time in Sci-Fi history. Someone noted that there was a scientist who didn't behave or speak like a scientist there were too many stretches. Boring love affairs, alien implantation, late term abortions, crazy Giant Alien, Father- Daughter inheritance theme, the black oil from X-Files, Captain and Boss booty call, Catholic religious themes, redundant details, redundant scenes and focus (which did not develop) random.com theme, Waste my time theme Help me * 'The alien air is breathable so I will take of my helmet' * I will get drunk 2nd day of the mission, alcohol available on a mission Tell NASA * They took off their helmets, where did they put them * A glitch, but the captain wants to get laid * They camp/sleep in a nest full of suspicious egg bombs * For no reason Robot poisons guy, wants alien baby, but also wants woman hero to be safe *Post operation she is fitter than Serena Wiliams.Visuals are good, 3D not needed (took off my glasses 1/2 way)Now lets deal with the dead dialog. Who seriously wrote those lines? It pops out of the script and makes no sense 1/2 the time. 'I am not here to be your friend I am here for the money'-- how does this fit the theme. How is that continued (as in the case of Alien 1 with the money issue for shares (which is properly introduced to add motive to the film?). Strange bunch of disjointed people who look mostly like heroin addicts. Too much things not quiet right to have to have faith with. Aliens create humans who want them to come to there WMD site to knock of their heads?

Da 5 Bloods," 2/10 real world score 8/10 Affirmative action score
","What a mess. But let us start with the dangers of a woke culture and all these high reviews which are all fake. There is no way a professional reviewer could watch this jumbled disjointed awkward poorly scripted junk and praise it. So why the high reviews? Because the world needs a Black filmmaker to cover up the white domination of everything. But does that mean this film is good? How? The plot holes are not subjective, they are everywhere. The film does not gel. It jerks from scene to scene. As for good acting I see OTT acting from good actors. But they not good in this film. I don't know how you can be conscious bloods but distrustful, and always pointing guns at each other, or calling each other Ni**er, is this how normal Africans behave? Good thing I am African and we certainly don't talk to each other like this. So much for trying to create black value but then erasing your own work with these stereotypes and tropes. There are how many themes in this film? It ends up confusing itself. And us in the process. The score is horrible and does not fit. And how many useless scenes that add nothing to the story? The only reason for 2/10 is for some of the positive forced in cultural references. But honestly the film is the product of a confused black mind",2,3,8,17 June 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," Overrated and badly directed, cheese script
","The hype. So often Hollywood picks a slum film and just blows it up. I think it is the Tarzan white director thing again. Just like if Clint Eastwood did a Chinese film you know it would get an Oscar. human beings are pack hunters and they follow the pack. Compared to anything you can see in a film festival what exactly is so special about this film. Its not Forest Gump which moves and takes you places. The funny thing is the film is moving but going no where. I made no investment in the characters, I didn't care about him. He was not real, his acting definitely want very good either. So character development isn't there. The story is stupid to be blunt. The concept is narrow and just not that interesting. If a script is written from a concept, it is very different from if it is written from a story of human beings on a journey. A collection of unrealistic superhuman independent sketches put together in a cutting room and some of those sketches don't even add anything to the story. Now someone over sold this film and I went out an bought the DVD at the New release rate. Biggest waste of money. I could have got 3 DVDs for the price of this one, I had Valkyre in one hand and I cant believe I put that down for this cotton candy junk. The inter splicing is so over used you would think the director would be able to use it to effect. However it more kills the timing than adds any value. The film takes from cinema and gives absolutely nothing back. There is nothing in this film that you could show to a film student and say here is a good example of Casting is horrid, continuity in terms of the stories intention is amateur. The music is disconnected from the visuals, loud and mood killing save 1 or 2 love themes. It does boast good editing, or good anything. Searching hard I found the 5.1 mix to be well done and that it is itooh the DVD box cover was really funky. That is how stupid this film is.",2,4,6,22 January 2010

Even in the film it doubts its own probability of occuring. Besides 2 or 3 good actors there is ZERO investment in any of the other folk. They seem to be there as fillers.
