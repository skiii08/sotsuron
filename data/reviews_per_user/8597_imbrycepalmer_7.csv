Angels & Demons," Long and predictable
","Made for a few good moments, but there were times where I felt like I'd seen this one already.",4,0,0,1 August 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Acceptable
","So long, but a fun ride along the way. Never read the books, but this was just not my cup of tea personally.",4,0,10,1 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," No story here... but a fun time
",There's no real 'story' told through the events of the movie... but it's well-shot and has a bit of Tarantino magic sprinkled on it. Also awfully long.,5,7,15,1 August 2019
Get Out," Perfectly captivating.
","Tells such an interesting story, leaves the audience on the hook the whole time. Be thankful if you had the 'in-theatre experience' with this one.",10,0,5,1 August 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The fight scene is unreasonably long
",Fight scene takes upwards of an hour... Just a bunch of creatures shooting at each other with no meaningful development to be seen.,3,0,11,1 August 2019
Midsommar," Sad, Uninspired, Waste of time.
","In this movie there is no mystery, no hope, no fun, no substance. It is meaninglessly violent and weird. There's nothing to engage an audience member for very long other than the meaningless violence and weirdness. There are no twists, just a sequence of dissatisfying events that add nothing new. There is no moral to this story, and if you told me I could stab myself in the left shoulder or see this movie again, I would really, really have to think hard on that decision.",2,100,178,23 July 2019
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," No plot!
","The worst kind of movie, in my opinion, is that which tells a story with no point. This is that kind of movie.",2,0,0,24 July 2019
