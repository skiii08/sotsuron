Frost_Nixon," Ron Howard does it again!
","When Ron Howard helms a film that is based on actual events, you can bet your sweet ass it's gonna be a corker... 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Cinderella Man'.. and now 'Frost/Nixon'.'Frost/Nixon' retells the events surrounding the historic face-off between disgraced American President Richard Nixon and women-chasing TV personality David Frost. Three silent and hermitic years after the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon finally approves of an interview, to face once and for all the lingering questions that have plagued him and his legacy. To the tune of a $600,000 fee, the former president finally agrees to be interviewed by David Frost-- a rather naive and silly guy who is better known as an entertainment interviewer as supposed to a political one. Clearly, the former president is planning to manhandle Frost, turn him dizzy about his wit during the interviews and through verbal magnificence make himself look all the more heroic instead of treasonous for his clear infringement of the public trust when he ordered a cover up of the Watergate Scandal.Initially bowing and ineffective against the evasive tactics and pointless monologues of the president during the first interview, Frost's producer and handlers are beginning to doubt his ability to evoke an apology or an admission from the president. Frost feels the pressure. They haven't even raised the required 600k fee for the president, which is supposed to come from the proceeds of the interview, but a confession-less interview wouldn't sell and this particular interview will either make or break them for life. In the third and final interview, a poignant and energetic confrontation between the two will happen in front of the camera.***With this film, im willing to forget that ron howard actually directed the dismal 'Da Vinci Code'. I guess that ought to tell him to stick to movies based on factual events and leave the fiction to other directors. But then again, I might still watch the upcoming 'Angels And Demons' and give him a second chance...",9,4,7,13 January 2009
John Wick," Jack Traven. Thomas Anderson. John Wick. Keanu Reeves is awesome again.
","This movie stars Keanu Reeves and was directed by 2 stunt men, decades-long collaborators of Keanu who worked his action scenes in 'Speed,' 'Point Break,' and the 'Matrix Trilogy.' This alone, is a good indication of the violence in this movie. Set almost entirely at night in an otherworldly New York City, an asphalt jungle exclusively inhabited by violent criminals whose coexistence derives from a delicate balance of honor code and savage ruthlessness, John Wick is a sleek homage to Sergio Leone's Old West. In a world of lawlessness and violence, breaking the code, is the only transgression.With his trademark blank stare and sparse words, Keanu Reeves steps into a persona straight out of a Sergio Leone western- an unstoppable force of nature, roused out of nowhere, whose sole purpose is comeuppance. John Wick is a retired legendary hit-man in quiet agony over the recent passing of his beloved wife. His only recourse, is Daisy, an adorable puppy left by his wife to give his solitary existence some purpose. A charged encounter with Iosef, a braggart Russian mafioso eyeing Wick's 1969 Mustang (love the nod to McQueen!), results in a home invasion that ends with Wick badly beaten, Mustang gone, and Daisy dead! Anytime a baddie kills a dog in a movie, you know a world of pain beckons. This is where the fun starts. Iosef had no idea of John Wick's murderous past, and his disrespectful excursion into John Wick's quiet world in a time of mourning has his father, Viggo, clearly worried. In one scene Viggo scolds Iosef, 'he once killed 3 men with a pencil,' and 'completed the most impossible missions,' but gave it all up for the woman he loved; thus effectively mythologizing John Wick's badassery for the viewer even before he threw his first punch. From here, John Wick checks in at the Continental, an exclusive hotel for assassins and criminals. Peace is preserved only by a strict code that prohibits 'doing business' in its premises. Half- friends and half-enemies welcome him back, but he says he's just visiting. Once the action gets going, only the body count is left unsettled as John Wick dispatches of everyone with his John Woo-ish 'gun-fu' leaving a bloodbath in his wake. Jack Traven. Thomas Anderson. John Wick. Keanu Reeves is awesome again.",9,7,20,1 November 2014
Knocked Up," Vulgar and Offensive but by no means dull.
","I finally had the chance to see Judd Apatow's follow-up movie to his monster hit the 40-yr old Virgin. I've read reviews about this one and after watching the movie, I can understand why so many women think this movie is sexist (and too vulgar). Even its ridiculously pretty star Katherine Heigl is on record calling this movie 'a little sexist,' and elaborates:'It paints women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as goofy, fun-loving guys. It was hard for me to love the movie.'I don't think that's the case however. Heigl's comment seemed to me that she was looking at the glass half-empty instead of half-full. Yes, one female character, Debbie (Leslie Mann) was shown to be a bit of a nagger, and one of those clingy type but she was that way only because she puts premium on having a close relationship with her husband. She says she likes to have him 'around' and wouldn't mind watching Spiderman 3 with him. I know a lot of guys who would kill for a girl like that.There was a scene also wherein Debbie showed her husband a 'sexual-offenders' map of their neighborhood, Debbie takes offense when her husband, seemingly uninterested, jests, 'So we'll skip those houses when we go trick-or-treat.' Some say this particular scene paints Debbie as 'uptight' while the husband is cool and 'goofy'. But the flip-side is, any guy could blow off and say: 'Hey! this scene shows men as 'insensitive' and portray women as 'concerned,'that's a little unfair' See? easier to see it half-empty than half-full.Then there's Heigl's character Alison, well on her way to a successful promotion in her job as an Entertainment News correspondent until a night of celebration with a little too much booze ends up in her getting pregnant from a one-nighter with a jobless, pot-smoking overweight dimwit named Ben. Alison here is portrayed as a career woman (rarely bad) while Ben is shown as your stereotypical man-baby, slacking and getting high in the daytime while turning into lecherous bar prowlers at night. Now if there's anyone who should be offended by this, I don't think it should be the ladies. I mean C'mon!? men are not ENTIRELY like that! (You can stop snickering now lady hehe)I guess what I'm saying is that Knocked-Up showed weaknesses in BOTH sexes and is a very funny movie because there is honesty in it-- Men, being 'men' and women being 'women.'The plot may be a bit tired (slackers finally owning up to responsibilities) but the humorous banter between the characters and the subtle commentary breathes life into an otherwise mediocre shot at comedy.",8,2,2,14 May 2009
Wanted," giddy... and showy... but that's alright by me...
","Half-a-glass of the Matrix essentials: slow-motion, bullets curving and physics-defying moves bordering on the absurd, plus a good-for-nothing who's fed up with his humdrum life suddenly being 'rescued' by a HOT chick (with steve mcqueenesque driving skills!) to be trained and groomed as 'the one'. Then add a little 'Tyler Durden' into the mix, Fightclub-style opening narration, ultraviolence and crimson-face all-over.. a dash of Starwars 'twist' ala Darthvader ... splash some Minority Report mini-philosophies... add some ice and of course..serve ' Shaken, not stirred'... preferably boozed after a long day's work and with a loved one by your side.. =p What follows is intoxication of the most engaging kind,. Giddy, silly and dreamy... dumb but beautiful... painful but worth it,... makes you think... what the heck have you REALLY done lately...Wow, this movie tried everything to embody cool, tried too much for its own good even...'Suspension Of Disbelief' is the key to enjoying this movie... although a much more buffed-up plot or the rationalization of some outrageous plot devices like 'THE LOOM!!???' would have made this movie more than an average popcorn flick.. less tattoos and a little more weight for Angelina (excuse my sacrilege.. =p) would have been nice as well.. =) All in all,... a sequel might not be a bad idea.. =)",7,4,10,31 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," happiness is a choice
","Director Sam Mendes, revisits the tedium of adult life in a way reminiscent of his other movie 'American Beauty.'Set in the 1950's suburbia, Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) meet at a bar and instantly hit it off, they marry and acquire a modest house along revolutionary road. They seem to be a happy couple to the outside world but the lack of fulfillment from the ennui of adult life and their shattered personal dreams and aspirations slowly push their marriage into destruction. Forced to stick with a job he loathes and having difficulty comforting his wife after an unsuccessful stint as a stage actress, Frank starts an extra-marital affair with a co-worker. Kate for her part, starts to become irritable just looking after the house and their 2 children, and not being able to pursue her acting.In an effort to get out of the stifling conformity of their austere married life, April asks Frank to leave everything behind and start a life in Paris (the only place worth living in, according to Frank) and finally 'LIVE' the way they dreamed of before, not a care in the world, just enjoying a bit of their their individuality, their togetherness and their 2 children.Everything is going according to plan and their trip is only a few weeks away, until an unexpected 3rd pregnancy stalls them, and to mess things further, Frank is now being offered a job promotion and a raise, with the 3rd baby on the way, the offer is a hundred times more attractive.Frank thinks it's better to stay, Kate is devastated..and down they go to the demise of their marriage...***This movie is not only tragic, it's almost depressing, the movie's no-holds-barred way of delivering its punches is so brutally honest it's scary. It's like a violent and repugnant defilement of something you have faith in-- married life.Yet, it rings true, a conservative and by-the-mold married life is what most couples dream of. To marry, buy a house, have kids and have a job that pays well-- nevermind if the work sucks, so long as it supports the family it's OK. This has been ingrained far too long in society and an open challenge to stray from what is usual and common will be bereft of success, and will be met with skepticism---- at least that is what the movie is saying..This movie therefore is too frank, and by definition almost always unappealing.. but there is wisdom in it, the wisdom that there is always an OPTION, that things can be done according to one's own standards and not society's.It is hard, it could even be 'fatal', but the most salient point of this movie is that--'TRUE HAPPINESS' is always just one choice away,,..***I wouldn't really recommend this movie, because it's so devastating, but the leads are superb. DiCaprio's emotionally charged portrayal should have won him a golden globe, I can only assume that Mickey Rourke was UNBELIEVABLE in The Wrestler for him to get the golden globe instead of DiCaprio, and kudos to Winslet for winning 2 golden globes, one for her acting in this movie.",7,2,4,13 January 2009
Gran Torino," Dirty Harry in old age...
","78 year old Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a bitter war veteran who lives alone (after the death of his wife) in the suburbs. His son hints at him to enter an institution and 'get together with people his age,' he evidently doesn't have a meaningful relationship with his son and prefers to live alone. That is until he meets an Asian kid who tried to steal his prized '72 Gran Torino, this kid will give his life Meaning and more importantly: Redemption...Pretty straightforward story but don't let the simple plot turn you off.. the rewards from this movie are open to anyone who stays long enough. The first few minutes may be plodding but once Eastwood and the kid get together, sit back relax and enjoy greatness at work... Clint Eastwood's role in this movie, while not as tragic as his roles in 'unforgiven' and 'million dollar baby,' is not in any way less poignant. A sort of dirty harry in old age, Walt Kowalski's tough guy persona with a past that he'd rather forget, will make you laugh and want to cry. He's far from avuncular but his husky voice, squinty eyes and the deep creases of old age fail to mask his desire to care and be cared for, and if there's something remotely human in a person, this movie will not only tug the heart,..It will pinch the soul..",10,1,4,31 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Overrrated...
","The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button sticks out like a sore thumb in David Fincher's filmography. Having already directed 2 contemporary classics such as the dark and labyrinthine 'Se7en' and the ultra violent 'Fight Club', Mr. Fincher forays outside his core competence and tries something new in TCCOBB.With Brad Pitt on his side, and Eric Roth (screenwriter: Forrest Gump, Munich, Ali) writing the screenplay, I would think that Mr. Fincher's first shot at mainstream cinema would be unmissable, and if that's not enough, the 'curious' premise of the movie --being born an 80 year old baby and aging backwards-- is attracting moviegoers by the droves for this one.Alas! In spite of all the talent behind this movie, TCCOBB relegates itself to the barren wastelands of mediocrity. The 'magic' of the premise was not enough to sustain my interest for the whole duration simply because the movie contented itself in showing the obvious and failing to scrape past the crust of Benjamin's feelings, admonitions, hopes and frustrations-- instead the movie labored, in all its 168-minute glory to show TWO key themes: 1. That he QUITE OBVIOUSLY, could not be treated in the same way as other kids and 2. He could not create meaningful relationships .. the whole movie revolved around these 2 themes and at almost 3 hours, you'd think that the movie had gravitas, but it actually has nothing special in it, just a monotonous piece of fantastical story telling.This movie could have been so much more, the movie could have explored the inner recesses of Benjamin's psyche, did he feel bad about his condition, when he fell in love, what were his initial thoughts? shame? guilt? hopelessness? What were his dreams, did he even have a dream at all, how did his condition affect HIS RELATIONSHIP with HIS OWN SELF, as supposed to his relationship with others.When he was 10 years old, then 9 yrs old, then 8 years old.. how did he feel about his pending exit from the world not as an old man but as a baby... i would think that since he grew younger, his death would be the slowly taking away of his faculties,. like a degenerative disease... how did he cope with with this destiny.. those were the most 'pressing' questions I had while watching the movie... but towards the end of the movie, in the waning years of Benjamin, when he was close to death, WHEN HE WAS MOST INTERESTING.... the movie focused on Daisy (Cate Blanchett)... what a cop out...After 3 hours of benjamin, i don't know the guy, he's like someone from a friend's girlfriend's dog's doctor's birthday party... he came, then he left.. that is how i feel about benjamin...No wonder this movie lost to slumdog millionaire in the recently concluded golden globe awards....",6,9,16,13 January 2009
The Wrestler," This was AMAZING..
","'The Wrestler' centers on Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a wildly popular professional wrestler from 2 decades ago who now barely makes ends meet as an aging wrestler in the independent circuit. With his health beginning to fail from his physically demanding job, he tries to amend his life by quitting wrestling, reconciling with his daughter he abandoned long ago and pursuing Cassidy, a prostitute he's been infatuated with for quite sometime. But his efforts failed him, and then he receives an offer to do a high-profile rematch with his nemesis 'The Ayatollah', the match could be his ticket to fame once again. Failing health and all, he must decide whether life is better lived inside the ring, or outside of it.Love. Pain. Glory.Darren Aronofsky's movie is a deeply affecting meditation of the three, and bears many parallels to life as we AIM to live it. Wrestling serves as a metaphor for Randy's stage, a place that is not offered him by the real world. In many ways, the wrestling ring is the only place for randy that he can be himself, stripped of his humanly imperfections and adulated by his fans. In life, he's never had the appreciation of the important people in his life.When Cassidy and Randy started to develop a friendship, randy thought they were headed for the start of a beautiful relationship, but Cassidy, though full of warmth and honest in friendship, turns down Randy and explains that she, like randy the wrestler, puts on a show, as far as she's concerned, he's only a customer who pays just like everyone else. Randy is so torn he goes on to binge on sex, drugs and alcohol that same night, TOTALLY forgetting he's supposed to meet his daughter, (whom he has had small progress with) for a pre-planned dinner...In one night, he lost permanently (in a manner of speaking) the two important people in his life.In some ways, Cassidy and Randy are both similar and different. Similar because both Randy and Cassidy are in a 'world' where the corruption of the body is the trade. Different because Randy does his job out of satisfaction from the glory, while Cassidy treats prostitution as a means to an end, to raise her son. Perhaps Randy saw in Cassidy something that is more important than Glory---- Love.. Randy, at this stage in his life recognizes his need for emotional connection, something real, something that no 'perfect stage' can ever supply. But when the world deprives him of this need, it becomes his realization that the pain from inside the ring is no match against the pain present outside of it..The pain of LOSS and ALIENATION.***Less than 24 hours before the unveiling of the Oscar nominees, I'm surprised there's not much kudos going around for Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler'... but what is even more surprising is the seemingly unanimous opinion that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a 'LOCK' at the Oscar best picture nominations while 'The Wrestler' isn't even mentioned in many 'top 10s' from film sites and film forums. How can a film THIS GOOD be overlooked by the cinephiliacs...The mad love i have for Slumdog Millionaire stays after my 3rd viewing, the movie's technical virtuoso and the directing are all topnotch and it may very well get the Oscar for best picture... but if THE WRESTLER gets nominated alongside slumdog for BEST PICTURE, i won't be surprised if this dark horse edges slumdog for the statuette.",10,2,3,22 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," visual equivalent of a mouth-watering dessert
","Slumdog Millionaire lacks something, depth maybe, so i cannot really call it a masterpiece, but that doesn't take away the glaring fact that this is easily, DEFINITELY, one of the most enjoyable movies (IMO) in recent memory! And whatever it is that it falls short of, it's more than compensated for by its overflowing vitality and panache.This movie simply was mesmerizing,. slumdog millionaire is the visual equivalent of a mouth-watering dessert. An inundation of flavors, arresting and enslaving like an incipient addiction. The cinematography is so good you forget that what is being shown are images of squalor, poverty, harassment and violence. The kinetic editing, the music, the MTV-style vignettes, (even the bollywood sequence at the end!) It's funny, it's heartbreaking and it has a message that we all could use in desperate times. Everything just fits together nicely and effortlessly in this one.Jamal Malik is an 18 year old Call Center agent in Mumbai, orphaned by a bloody riot in their destitute neighborhood, --(where the police is more interested in gambling than in peace and order)-- joins the popular game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.' Jamal Malik, minimally educated and a slumdog (from the slums), was able to answer each and every question in the game and by the end of the show managed to get to the very last question for a whopping 20,000,000 rupees. The show's host is outraged and becomes suspicious of Jamal, he calls the police to detain Jamal and interrogate and torture him for his 'presumed' methods of cheating.... only, Jamal didn't cheat, and he isn't a genius either,. from the interrogation in the police station Jamal narrates to his captors how he knew of the answers--Each and every question in the game represents an episode in his life, these were not book-knowledge, or school lectures, but life experiences that had a rather unusual connection to the game's questions...So by the end of the game, we will have known Jamal's life, family, love and his real motivation for joining the show.",9,1,3,17 January 2009
