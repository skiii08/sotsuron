The Equalizer," Great film but in bits and pieces.
","I have watched John Wick and from some sources I got to know The Equalizer is similar to John Wick, so I was pretty excited as I loved John Wick.After watching Equalizer,I had to say it was completely different from John Wick. It wasn't a fast-paced continuous action film like John Wick nor it had much action sequences.It's rather slow-paced, with movie continuosly losing and regaining its grip unlike John Wick. I was more impressed by the character of Denzel Washington.It's not a revenge drama or a detective film its a movie about a man fighting for justice and beyond himself. Whereas John Wick fights for himself.Denzel Washington was charismatic and accurately portrayed his character. As far as action is concerned it was more brutal but had far less sequences than John Wick.If Denzel had given an unimpressive performance I wouldn't even have watched it. As title suggests some scenes were interesting whereas some were quite boring and unintentional.But definately worth a watch!!",7,0,0,2 June 2020
John Wick," A great fast-paced action film!!
","The first 10-15 mins is the story build-up and after that, 90 mins of continuous action. The dialogues were impactful with extremely well choreographed action sequences. The camera work was praise worthy and especially they didn't used the shaky camera technique which actually spoils an action sequence. It's a noir/action-thriller genre so the themes are dark. There are no moments where the film loses its grip. A solid fast-paced action film. Probably one of the best in decades.",8,1,3,17 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," The perfect farewell!!
","A great ending to the phase 3 of MCU. The film's climatic battle is way better then any of
the battle in infinity war and more emotionally charged than its predecessor. The background score was tremendous with equally good cinematography. People who rate low emphasis more on plot holes and goes way more technical than required. A film's job is to provide entertainment to its audience which it does satisfies.",8,1,8,5 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another great one from Tarantino!!!
","So it's basically a multi-event film. It doesn't have a particular direction. Great screenplay and cinematography. As far as performance is concerned I was more impressed by Brad Pitt. The way he carry himself in the film was really amazing to watch. He was really very cool. Same goes with DiCaprio, the portrayal of his character as a faded television star was very funny and gave a really consistent performance throughout. According to its genre it had the most unpredictable climax ever.",8,12,16,7 May 2020
Aladdin," Not a worthy remake.
","I am not satisfied with this one. It did not elevate me at all, I watched the film with a blank face except for Will Smith's scenes. It couldn't give justice to the original one.The cinematography was average and VFX was a joke, I don't know where have they invested a budget of $183 million, definately on sets and costumes but surely not on VFX.As far as performance is concerned only Will Smith and Naomi Scott could give justice to their characters, rest all were average and dull. Will Smith had perfect comic timing and had a charm in his performance whereas Naomi was stunning and had a great screen presence.Mena Massoud didn't portrayed Aladdin well.
He was not our Aladdin we have known since decades. He wasn't adventurous, didn't look smart and moreover he was not charismatic. Manzar wasn't intimidating, menacing and never looked threatening. He was quite dull and boring, definately a miscast.If it had been the original one, it would have never crossed a billion dollar mark. But it did and all credit goes to the legacy set by the original 1994 animated Aladdin.It's watchable but surely not recommendable.",6,0,0,2 June 2020
The Lion King," Original remains superior.
","To be honest after watching Aladdin (2019) I didn't had much expectation from this one as I figured, first of all Disney had guts to remake such a great classic and then spoiling it real bad, they won't hesitate to do it another time.For Disney this films are just profit and loss statements. They don't worry about public emotions, the Whistles, the tears and the cheering anymore, they just want there profit.The Lion King is another such example. It didn't had any emotional depth or intensity, it was quite hollow. I didn't fell anything when Mufasa died, I didn't fell anything when Simba returned from exile and moreover the animals didn't had any facial expression on their faces, we could only figure out their emotions through their tone. Hand written images were far better in this aspect.But they definately used their $ 260 million budget effectively, the VFX and CGI were damn good, much better than Aladdin (2019). The film was not at all bad, its quite enjoyable with great musical score you would definately feel nostalgic, but is this point valid enough to consider a film good , no, the film even have to score well in technological aspect, cinematography was quite average and the film was rushed at some parts, especially after half time.Just imagine if this would have been the original Lion king, it would have never even crossed a billion-dollar mark.But If you have planned to watch it and my review is holding you from that, then don't hesitate, its surely worth a watch.",6,0,1,4 June 2020
Joker," A great physcological film lived up to my expectation.
","It was a great film unfortunately I couldn't watch it in the theatre, but never mind.
Character development was excellent all credit goes to good screenplay. Joaquin phoenix performance was unforgettable. But to be honest it wasn't a joker film, it was a journey to become the joker it was the journey of Arthur fleck. I didn't understood one thing that the film didn't show Arthur's intelligence or insane IQ as joker possessed tremendous IQ and intelligence. Do it was bit difficult to digest that how an abused loner becomes the criminal mastermind of Gotham. Though it would be a great experience.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
It Chapter Two," It was more like a goosebump film.
","The film couldn't give justice to its predecessor. It was clearly made in a rush, I guess the producers had a lot better projects to do. The film didn't had any depth or intensity and character development was zero, all credit goes to a bad writing. The climax was actually funny. There were no moments where I closed my eyes or get shocked which I generally do in a horror film. Both the chapters were not that horror if compared to the Conjuring franchise, but first part was actually enjoyable as a thriller than a horror. The basic thing that it lacked was the suspense and unpredictability which the Conjuring series had(except The Nun).",5,1,1,18 May 2020
Black Panther," A good film but over-hyped.
","As the title suggest, it was a good film but does not satisfy the hype. It won 3 Oscars from 7 nominations.
1. Original score 2. Costume design 3. Production design.
Original score means the background music of the film. Few scenes had tremendous background score but wasn't consistent, so there's no point in it. Well ok costumes were good. The lastly, production design which means the sets and overall look of the film. The sets were amazing and really creative but I guess infinity war got better production design.
Now the action, well it was mediocre nothing groundbreaking and the screenplay which is the plot, well also mediocre. The film won BAFTA award for best visual effect, infinity war had great VFX but it wasn't even nominated, so again mediocre. A mediocre film winning 3 Oscars. Well I don't know what critics found in it but for me it was an average film. But it really gives a good experience in theatre",7,0,0,6 May 2020
