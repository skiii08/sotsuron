E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Time spoils E.T.
","I used to love this film as a kid, I´m almost 30 now and as I went to see the special edition I was sort of awaiting a big kick, a real movie magic treat. Nevertheless I left the theater bored, and a bit of surprised that this film says nothing to our world today. The facts that Mr. Spielberg digitally removed 'stuff' from the original didn´t help much. I felt cheated, somewhat blinded. No, unlike Star Wars and other fantasy films from the past (The Dark Crystal)which I loved and still do, this one is just a fad. It has lost all of the innocence and wonders it had in the 80´s.",Null,1,2,22 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wonderful masterpiece
","The only film I´ve ever seen that actually gets better the second time. Saw it on the opening night and was in awe of the grandeour of it all. My first thoughts were: This could possibly be the most magnificent film ever made, do I dare to think so? Went to se it again the second night and my thoughts were: Thats it! This is the most powerful, best piece of film ever created. It actually grew the second time. And I´ve heard others say the same.",10,1,1,22 October 2002
Spider-Man," Pure hype.
","I totally did NOT enjoy this pale, almost boring film. What was the hype all about?? Note, the best superhero flim is still Batman Returns, dark, sinister an big fun. This is Cola light folks, dont believe the hype!! It´s deserves a straight to video treatment, or better yet, straight to Tv treatment.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
Pearl Harbor," AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!
","I dont even know why I sit down and take my time to write this, because this movie should just be ignored and forgotten completely. It is the single worst man-made film to date. Just about everything here stinks of patriotism and sentimentalism that makes you really sick! It's like watching a war documentary with a Coca-Cola ad in between. The actors should be ashamed to take money to be in this horribly production. Me and my friend sat in the theater laughing out loud in scenes where you were supposed to cry. Awful, totally awful.",Null,0,1,28 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Powerful.
","There is a movie called The Dark Crystal. It begins with a narrative voice telling 'In a different time...In a different place...In the age of Wonder' Long have I wondered what it would be like to live in that age. Well, with this movie gathering masses of exited cinema goers and in  the darkness binding them with pure Magic I believe we somehow are, living in the Age of Wonder. I bow before Peter Jackson and crew. I had Huge expectations, but this is just a masterpiece like it´s predecessor. I cried happy tears. 10 out of 10.",9,0,0,23 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not nearly as good as Fellowship.
","*Spoilers* There is a film called The Dark Crystal, in it, a narrative voice tells 'In a different place...In a different place...In the Age Of Wonder' Long have I wondered what it means to be living In The Age of Wonder. Til Tuesday night when I sat at the theater at twelve o'clock eagerly anticipating The movie of the year. Heck, this was the movie I've been waiting for more than any other after truly adoring Fellowship. Well, Tuesday night I truly felt that I was living in the age of wonder, expecting it to be as beautiful, and dramatic as the first one. But after a great opening and great first hour the film diminished to become an exaggerated orgy in effects, Ents, comedians, and lacking every ounce of 'wonder'. This film has a great number of beauty spots. Firstly, the score never lifts, never touches the way it did in Fellowship. Mr Shore has re-used some of the earlier themes an re- arranged them, but the new tunes are hard to distinguish in between them. Then there's Gimli who is acting as the film´s Comic Relief to the point where it´s actually tiresome. And Legolas is oh-so serious, as to somehow balance it up. And sadly, no, the Battle Of Helm's Deep isn't as grand as we are told. It's a rather overkill in heroism and exaggerations. Ok, we are dealing with a Fantasy film here, but there's just no-way you can throw yourself in an pit of hell raised Orcs and survive, even if you are called Aragorn or Gimli. No-way! Dominic M, and Billy B (Merry and Pippin) are showing that they are tired, I could spot a dangerous crack in there, their acting doesn't push the story or the drama further. Last but not least it's Peter Jacksons changes from the book, the first hour is ok, even great, but later on it becomes apparent that all the decisions to deviate from the book weren't very healthy. I missed several anticipated scenes. All in all, a good film that doesn't come near it masterpiece predescessor. 6 out of 10...really.",9,0,0,18 December 2002
The Mist," Not at all bad!
","First of all: I love films, I watch as many as I can and it's one of my biggest interests. My taste in movies range from heavy dramas to cheap horror B-flicks. Second: I read the short novel for The Mist when I was 13 I think and I never forgot about it. There was something really chilling in that part in the beginning with the man shouting 'There is something in the mist!'. Without even knowing it I had anxiously awaited the film version of it. My friend had come over a cam-recorded pirate and I was like: Hell NO! I have to see it on the big screen! So, finally there's a movie I'm dying to see, but there is no opening date for Sweden as far as I'm concerned... why? It seems this movie will be a straight-to-DVD release in Sweden...Anyway, after reading the reviews here on IMDb i was intrigued on how it divides people, those ho hated it and those who loved it. And I knew right then and there I had to watch it! I had to make my own decision. So I watched the cam-pirate... And I loved it! I was really into the movie and I thought the creatures looked and felt real and I think it has all the chills of the novel. And the ending? I did NOT see it coming. I was actually shocked. It was GREAT! This is a fine horror film which sadly many will miss, I don't think its marketed well enough. Hopefully it will have it's revenge on DVD.Mind you, had I seen this in a proper cinema, my rating would be higher...",8,0,2,20 February 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Pure joy! What a thrill!
","Well, I had huge expectations on this film, having loved the first one, and having seen the Animatrix chapters. But then it premiered and I read all the lousy reviews from dissapointed fans and critics, my expectations sort of, lowered. Good!! Cuz when I saw it last night I wasn´t expecting much more than X-2 or something similar. Boy was I wrong! I truly loved this second installment of the Matrix Trilogy! Geesus, it´s pure Adrenalin and Hocus Pocus and great cinema entertainment. I suggest to all the fans of the originals to lower your expectations and just enjoy the ride, grab the best seats and whatever you do, STAY TIL AFTER THE END CREDITS ROLL UPP!!! THEN YOU WILL BE TREATED TO A FIRST TEASER TRAILER FOR THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS!!! It´s just oh, so great!!",Null,0,0,21 May 2003
