Marie Antoinette," entertaining, beautifully-photographed yet modernized life of Marie Antoinette
","First, what may seem like criticisms are simply my attempt to convey the flavor of this movie. It is the story of the life of Marie Antoinette, a movie (based upon a book by another author named in the credits) written and directed in the flair of Sofia Coppola, and colored by the persona of actress Kirsten Dunst.The movie is definitely not much of a historical biography. Kirsten Dunst's character is portrayed with a rather light-hearted modern-day post-20th-Century personality and mindset. Various liberties with historical accuracies abound. Yet, if you enjoy Kirsten Dunst, then you will probably love the movie.The soundtrack features plenty of current-day songs, thus further modernizing the tenor of the movie. However, all of the modernizing which is done actually helps modern-mindset viewers to identify with the plight of young Marie Antoinette, forced into an arranged marriage to the heir of the Throne of France at age 14, with the pressure put upon her of uniting and saving the political union of France and Austria.The movie is definitely worth the watch, and highly entertaining. The ending falls flat, and abruptly so, unfortunately failing to close the book with the true outcome and ending of Marie Antoinette's life.If there is a message which the movie seems to convey, it is the awkward stress of an arranged marriage put upon the young husband and wife, aged 15 and 14, and their unprepared rise to King and Queen of France while still in their teen's. The movie accurately conveys the resulting problems however-- Marie's excessive frivolities and extravagances while the people's poverty increased-- their taxes burdened by young husband King Louis XVI's decision to raise money in order to fund the American struggle for independence from England. Louis' lack of perspective regarding the needs of his own people, added to by Marie's extravagant spending, ultimately led to their demise.",Null,0,1,13 February 2007
I'm Not There," Bob Dylan dissected and jigsawed to pieces
","Overall, the movie is extremely well-acted, somewhat interesting despite its relativity and abstract approach, and probably worth the watch.Unfortunately, what we had assumed and expected was a powerful and interesting bio-drama of the life of legendary songwriter/singer Bob Dylan. What we quickly discovered was a confusing semi-clone of 'Across the Universe.' The person thought of as Bob Dylan is scattered into the lives of 4 different characters. Various real-life world events and persons are renamed, so there's little true continuity to the actual events and persons attached with this period in history known as the '60's and '70's.Instead of simply dealing with facts and realities and a person well-known as Bob Dylan, the writers and producers give their scrapbook-cut interpretation of his life while attributing their views to fictional characters--- thereby sidestepping direct accountability while spicing it up in an aura of surreal abstract.Dichotomy-- great acting, interesting movie (great if you're not expecting anything); huge disappointment if you were hoping for anything of a semblance of Bob Dylan reality.",Null,0,0,8 May 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," worthy of watching but plays on previous successes
","In the first Pirates edition, we are enthralled by all of the new characters and excitement, and everything is new. In the second, the primary characters become more known and developed, and the good and bad (or thereabouts) come to final conflict.In this third edition, the writers succumb to a more lackluster plot, scattered with various complicated and less exciting sub-plots. New characters, more worthy of Disney action-figure profits, are introduced.The acting is still top-notch. But the plot is weaker, and we found ourselves frequently more bored in the lulls than enthralled as with the previous two Pirates movies. The plot plays up all of the previous primary characters as though trying to rally forces, but each becomes embroiled in the sub-plots, and the overall continuity and excitement suffers greatly as a result.",Null,0,3,8 December 2006
Beowulf," laughably immature waste of good actors
","Childish and immature. for DVD-viewers. In five years, people will laugh at this 'vintage technology,' turning what would have been a great real-life cast into semi-anime' figures with unreal appearance and motions.The movie starts with no introduction or development of the characters, no apparent explanation for the sudden evolution of this monster-esquire creature and no plot. It doesn't seem to progress much, from there.When will Hollywood directors and producers wake up and realize that not everyone is infatuated with currently-high-tech anime'? Or was this an excuse for 'we couldn't actually make a good movie out of this so we anime'd the heck out of it?' If you're a fan of Hopkins or any of the actors, save the embarrassment and avoid this movie.",Null,2,4,4 April 2008
300," it meets its self-indulgent decadent goal
","There is a reason why currently over 141,000 males and 14,000 females have rated this movie-- it's very much a macho-movie. Lots of decadence, self-indulgent exploitations and graphic gore.This is the perfect made-for-video-game movie. In fact, the movie borrows quite a lot from video game effects and styles.Yes, it's a graphic fantasy of wonderfully-done photo-anime' scenes, complete with fast-stop-fast speed variations.Is it worth watching? If I've already made you think twice and wonder whether you ought to watch, it's still interesting. Still, you'll have to deal with the excessive gore, the excessively done and unnecessary sexual scenes, and the self-indulgent decadent flamboyance of this post-western-civilization celebration.",Null,0,0,21 August 2007
