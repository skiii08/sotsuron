Skyfall," Absolute crap
","In Skyfall we get a middle aged, beer drinking, bisexual man with a mother complex who gets bitter and doesn't want to work for 'mommy', then returns to 'mommy' anyway. This guy has less to do with James Bond than my grandma.The movie itself has obvious high production value - it looks good - but it is unevenly paced, insecurely directed, and the story is a Batman ripoff, as enough critics have pointed out already.I really wanted to enjoy myself when I went to see it. But there is no way to avoid admitting that Skyfall is a pure disaster without sending the brain in orbit first.People who agree to call this Bond must be plain out of their minds - or else they have just never seen a Bond movie.",1,16,39,9 November 2012
