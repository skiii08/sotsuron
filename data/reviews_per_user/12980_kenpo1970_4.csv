3:10 to Yuma," Three things make this movie worthwhile....
","Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster. This movie is basically your run of the mill Western but the acting is what brings this movie from just okay to really good. Those that compare this movie to Unforgiven probably need to go give that movie another look because it certainly isn't in that league but it comes close. The direction of James Mangold and the performances of the three leads are clearly what make this film work. Russell Crowe is in his usual top form confirming my belief that he will go down as one of the greatest actors of the last twenty years. And Christian Bale continues to prove that there is virtually no limit to his versatility. But the real surprise of this film is Ben Foster. He looked familiar but I didn't place him as the same guy who played Claire's dysfunctional boyfriend from Six Feet Under until about a third of the way through the film. All I can say is that he pulls of playing a bad guy with ease and he has a magnetic screen presence. This guy is the real deal and I predict great things for him. I don't know that you have to see this in the theater but if you choose too it certainly wont be a waste of your money.",7,1,3,23 September 2007
The Fountain," Disappointed
","I saw this movie a couple of nights ago at a screening in Beverly Hills and I must say I was extremely let down. Like many other films I of course saw this score on this board so I had very high expectations that just weren't met.I had seen the previews for this film and I must say the concept to me seemed very intriguing but the previews are very misleading. I was expecting to see a film about eternal life and love but instead I saw a film that seemed to be extremely disjointed and confused about what it wanted to do. Now I must say that I have to disagree with some reviewers in that I felt Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz did great jobs with what they were given but they can't be expected to perform miracles. Both of these actors and the director were at the screening I was at and it is very telling when Hugh Jackman says that he was never really sure what the movie was about even while making it. Long story short, if you really want to see this wait for the DVD.",5,4,11,15 November 2006
30 Days of Night," Good but not great.
","I am kind of on the fence about this one. First, I must admit that I have always been a fan of vampire films and I thought the concept for this movie (graphic novel) was a great. Secondly, the movie did definitely creep me out and have my on the egde of my seat. This in many ways the ultimate nightmare scenario, not quite on the level of Salem's Lot, but close. Finally, I think this will be a worthy addition to my DVD collection for a good watch on Halloween once a year, be warned though, this film is graphic. But I can't say this movie isn't without flaws.If you are expecting anything in the way of character development you can just forget it. Showing the relationships seems to serve only the purpose of showing us why character A might care why character B gets slaughtered, but you wont care. Also, I just felt it would have been more interesting to learn a little bit more about these vampires, where they came from and why they decided to take this town right now. They were scary enough but a little more back story would have gone a long way. There were also just seemed to be some obvious questions.Like why wouldn't these vampires just call it a day and head to the next town after their initial slaughter. Why the heck would they hang out for thirty days just looking for a few additonal 'snacks' when according to the characters there were evidently some other towns in the vicinity, probably not a problem for these super human vampires to reach. And if there were a lot of people still alive that they were holding in reserve or as bait it might have been interesting to show that part of it.As I said this isn't a bad film but it's a toss up as to whether you want to wait for the DVD. If you are a big horror fan or love vampire flicks this wouldn't be a complete waste of your money but if not you probably just want to wait and give it a rent.",7,2,5,21 October 2007
Casino Royale," Pretty Good....
","First off let me just say that I wasn't one of the 'haters' that questioned Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond. I actually like Daniel Craig and even though I would have to say that I still consider Connery and Brosnan the two best Bonds Craig and Timothy Dalton are probably the two best actors to play Bond. If anything I guess I was a little baffled as to why Brosnan was pushed out of this role when he probably had at least a couple films left in him and his last Bond film was extremely successful. With all the said I went into this film with a very open mind and high expectations which were mostly met.This film definitely hits the mark on many levels. This is by far the darkest Bond to ever grace the screen and I guess in many ways it seems more appropriate at this time in our history. The violence is probably the most realistic of any Bond film and we finally see a human Bond that if anything is pretty morally ambiguous. As a matter of fact I wasn't really sure I liked this guy. The action is good,although, some of it is a little bit unrealistic and seems to take away from this more realistic portrayal of Bond. The film, however, does fall short on a few levels.As I said I like Daniel Craig but there did seem to be something missing here. I didn't mind the fact that he played Bond more edgy and even made the character hard to like at some points but I do feel there needs to be more charisma given off in the next film. I am not saying I want to see another Brosnan or Moore light hearted Bond but I do want someone that I at least kind of like. I just felt that we weren't really given enough of Bond's personality until, what I felt, was a forced and completely unbelievable transition at the end.My final issue was that the film didn't end when it needed to which creates the above problem. I wont give anything away here but had the movie ended probably about 25 minutes earlier I would have definitely given it a higher mark. The last half an hour or so seems to stretch credibility and expects us to buy a complete change in Bond for very little reason. I kept expecting Bond to kind of give us a wink that he knew something we didn't but that didn't happen. Most of the audience in the showing I went to just weren't buying this.Anyway, like I said above, this is a pretty good movie and I would definitely recommend seeing it in the theater. I am fairly certain that any short comings in this film have less to do with Craig and more to do with the direction and the writing. If this is tweaked just a little bit in the next film Craig could be playing Bond for the next ten years if he wants to.",7,2,4,24 November 2006
