Scarface," Overrated
","I wouldn't think this ridiculously directed movie was that horrible if Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma had actually intended to make it a graphically violent, and obscene exploitation film. But no. They, along with many others, believe this to be a somewhat accurate depiction of an immigrant drug dealer's life in the 1980's. The dialog is absolutely horrible, with expressions and motto's by Tony Montana, that not only leave the audience confused but are simply idiotic. I know many people who think this is one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. They are the same people who would find comfort in the line,' Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.' The movie is filled with attempted prophetic lines that make no sense, just like this film.",8,2,5,18 February 2009
