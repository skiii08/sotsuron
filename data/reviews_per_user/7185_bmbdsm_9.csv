One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Funny and Entertaining!
","In a small town in London, music composer Roger lives with his pet dalmatian Pongo. They later meet Anita and her dalmatian Perdita. Roger and Anita fall in love and eventually get married. They later discover that Perdita is to give birth to 15 puppies. This is good news to Anita's school-mate Cruella DeVil, who wants to make them into a fur coat. When the puppies are stolen by Cruella's henchmen, Pongo and Perdita must set off on a journey to rescue the puppies before it is too late.This is a smart and entertaining film based on the excellent children's novel by Dodie Smith. When first released in 1961, it was a huge box-office success. And today, 45 years after it was released, it still entertains audiences. The characters make the film likable, from Pongo, Perdita and the puppies to the flamboyant Cruella DeVil. Listen for excellent performances from the voice cast, with Rod Taylor playing Pongo, Betty Lou Gerson playing Cruella, and many more. Even though there are not a lot of songs, they are still entertaining, such as 'Cruella DeVil' from 'Dalmatian Plantation'. Overall, this is a must-see for Disney buffs, or animation buffs.Recommended. 10/10",10,3,3,25 January 2006
Gone with the Wind," One of the Best Movies EVER!
","As I write this review, today is the 66th anniversary of GWTW. The story about a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara showing her trials before, during, and after the Civil War makes up a movie that continues to enthrall audiences even today. Here are the reasons why I think it is THE perfect movie: Cast- The cast gives perfect performances that makes this movie memorable. Clark Gable is Rhett Butler, the role that seems made JUST for him. Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett O'Hara, deserved the Best Actress Oscar. Leslie Howard is excellent as Ashley Wilkes, the man that Scarlett loves. Olivia deHavilland plays Melanie, the kind-hearted woman who always thinks of others before herself, perfectly. Hattie McDaniel gives a awesome performance as Scarlett's strong-willed servant.Direction- Victor Fleming (THE WIZARD OF OZ), along with uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood, directs his cast superbly, making you believe in the characters.There are many more reasons to list,including Sidney Howard's script(based on Margaret Mitchell's novel), Max Steiner's wonderful music, and the awe-inspiring sets and costumes. So, see this Oscar-winning classic. You'll remember this for the rest of your life.10/10",10,2,3,15 December 2005
Psycho," True horror classic that has not lost the ability to scare.
","When this film was released in 1960, it literally took the world by storm. It was received with mixed reviews but tremendous profits at the box office. The world in 1960 had never seen a film like this, and everyone was taken off guard. Watching the film today, I can see why.Alfred Hitchcock wastes no time in setting up the proper mood for the film, starting right from Saul Bass' title sequence in combination with Bernard Hermann's legendary score. This mood is accomplished by John Russell's eerie black and white cinematography and the seedy set design, in addition to the razor sharp editing by George Tomasini. Anthony Perkins- what else can I say? He manages to make Norman Bates both sympathetic and truly frightening. Janet Leigh also creates a sympathetic character who meets a grisly demise in the legendary shower scene, one of the most recognized scenes in the history of film. Special mention must go to Martin Balsam as the detective who also meets a horrifying death, and Vera Miles and John Gavin as Leigh's sister and boyfriend, respectively, who go to look for her.I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but this is one I can watch without getting tired of. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10. Followed by three sequels and a shot-for-shot remake (only for the curious).",Null,0,0,23 October 2011
Jaws," One of the most terrifying films of all time...
","When a small New England seaside town becomes victim to several attacks from a Great White shark, the police chief, a grizzly seaman, and a young shark expert go out to sea in order to try and stop the shark from attacking.Based on the Peter Benchley novel, this film manages to take the relatively simple plot and make so much more out of it. This movie's insane success supposedly jump started the type of film known as the summer blockbuster. With this film, Steven Spielberg became a household name and one of the world's most famous directors. Spielberg manages to create a Hitchcock-style thriller while putting his own unique touch on it. Indeed, just like how Hitchcock's PSYCHO made people afraid to take a shower, Spielberg made people afraid of going swimming. Spielberg doesn't show the shark on screen for a great deal of the film, which works to the film's advantage. When he does show the creature, he gives it the right amount of menace and terror to make it believable. Besides being incredibly frightening, Spielberg creates a fascinating character study. He sets the last third of the film on-board a small fishing boat, which allows the three main actors to play off of each other and create natural performances. Roy Scheider gives a natural performance as Chief Brody. Schieder makes Brody feel like Everyman, a person you'd know in real life. Robert Shaw gives an incredibly intense and raw performance as Quint, the grizzled seaman. His intensity matches the film's tone perfectly. Richard Dreyfuss has some funny moments as Hooper. What review would be complete without mentioning the music by the legendary John Williams? His main theme for the film is one of the most recognizable in film history, and right up there with Bernard Hermann's score for PSYCHO as one of the best scores for a horror film. Followed by three sequels, but the original is by far the best of the lot. Highly recommended. 10/10.",10,2,5,18 July 2012
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Disney's first, and certainly one of his best!

After watching it, you'll remember the many characters, including Snow White, the Queen/Peddlar Woman, Snow White's animal friends, and the dwarfs (especially Dopey)! The backgrounds are beautifully painted. The songs are also memorable, including 'I'm Wishing,' 'Whistle While You Work,' and 'Someday My Prince Will Come'. This is recommended for the whole family! 10/10 P.S.

The Lion King," A Disney Masterpiece!
","A young lion cub named Simba is told by his father Mufasa that he will be king after Mufasa dies. Mufasa's evil brother Scar wants to be king himself, so, with the help of his three hyena henchmen, causes a wildebeest stampede to kill him. Scar then tells Simba that he was responsible for Mufasa's death, and that he must run away and never come back to the kingdom. Simba runs away and meets meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa. He decides to stay with them for a long lazy life. When a childhood friend, Nala, tells him that Scar is ruining the Pride Lands, Simba returns to battle Scar and gain his place as king.THE LION KING is considered to be one of Disney's best. It became one of Disney's money-making films. KING contains wonderful voice talent, with Matthew Broderick as Simba, James Earl Jones as Scar, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, Simba's friend, and Whoopi Goldberg as one of the hyenas. It has wonderful songs (including 'The Circle of Life', 'I Just Can't Wait to be King', and 'Hakuna Matata'). The animation is incredible, with computer animation at its best in the wildebeest stampede. Those are just some of the things that make THE LION KING a wonderfully entertaining film. KING was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, and was later turned into an excellent Broadway musical. KING was later re-released into IMAX theaters, digitally remastered with a brand new song, 'The Morning Report'. Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,24 June 2006

Aladdin," True Disney masterpiece!
","In a far off city called Agrabah there lives a young thief named Aladdin who wants people to respect him for who he is. But when he meets the princess Jasmine, his life is turned upside down. Jasmine is tired of people telling her how to live her life, and her father the Sultan wants her to choose a bride by her birthday, which only gives her 3 more days. Jafar, the Royal Vizer to the Sultan, wants to overthrow the Sultan and rule over Agrabah himself. So, disguised as a beggar, he asks Aladdin to go into the Cave of Wonders and retrieve a magic lamp. Aladdin winds up with the lamp instead, and unleashes a magic Genie, who grants him 3 wishes. This gives Aladdin the chance to win Jasmine's heart. Jafar is angered, and tries to stop Aladdin. But, Aladdin wins, and marries Jasmine.When Disney struck gold with their excellent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, they tackled the classic Arabian Nights story and wound up with another winner, which was a box office hit, and 2 Academy Awards (Best Score and Best Song for 'A Whole New World'). The voices are excellent, with Scott Weinger (TV's 'Full House') as Aladdin, Robin Williams as the hilarious Genie, and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's pet parrot (also hilarious). The backgrounds are well-rendered, and the songs by Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Tim Rice are some of the best songs in a Disney film ever. Followed by two direct-to-video sequels and a TV series. Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,3,25 November 2006
The Wizard of Oz," One of Judy Garland's best performances.
","One of the best movies ever. Judy Garland deservedly won a Special 1939 Academy Award (the only time she ever won an Oscar) for her performance as Dorothy. Filled with great songs such as 'Over the Rainbow' and 'Ding-Dong, the Witch is Dead.' Bert Lahr is hilarious as the Cowardly Lion ('Put 'em up, Put 'em up!). Excellent direction by Victor Fleming (Gone With The Wind), great costumes and sets, and a well-written script, which is based on the book by L.Frank Baum. The movie is even better seen on the big screen. The characters are brought to life by amazing performances (which includes Frank Morgan in 5 roles). 'Oz' is a film to watch over and over. Recommended. 10/10.",10,4,7,26 August 2005
