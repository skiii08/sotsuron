The Devil's Advocate," Captivating, frightening thriller...
","The separation between reality and nightmare becomes more and more difficult to maintain through this film as it progresses. Young Kevin Lomax(Reeves) enjoys a flawless record of wins as a Southern lawyer in the face of overwhelming odds at times. Life is good for him and his lovely wife Mary Ann(Theron) until Milton(Pacino) offers him the position of his dreams in the Big City. Kevin continues to enjoy success in his new position, and faces the biggest challenge of his career with a high-profile murder case which has been handed to him. When the pieces of the plot all come together and their lives reach a dramatic point, all of the reasons behind his success are made known, and the story unfolds into an unexpected turn of events.The film is well made, though a bit slow at times. I think the highlight of the film is the performance by Charlize Theron as the tormented wife, though Reeves is solid and Pacino gives the expected brilliant performance. The supporting cast deserve high marks as well.
This film ranks high on my list of favorites.   8 1/2 out of 10",Null,0,1,27 October 2002
