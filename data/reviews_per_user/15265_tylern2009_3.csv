The Legend of Bagger Vance," My Favorite and one of the most underrated and undervalued movies of all time
","This movie is the best of the best. Many will disagree but for me, its my favorite movie of all time behind the dark knight and the lord of the rings trilogy. This movie grasps the essence of film making as an art form. In other words, great and beautiful cinematography. When people first judge this movie they will probably see it as just your normal sports movie and in this case its golf. I am a golfer but you can absolutely hate golf and still enjoy this movie. Being a golfer really only helps with the technicalities of the sport, which the movie minimally shows. The movie is just one big metaphor for someone who is need of faith. In this movie that person is Junah, played by Matt Damon (whos performance is excellent), Junah was one of the highest praised upcoming golfers in the 1920s but after serving in WWI and becoming a war hero, he suffers from memories of battle and has lost his faith in just about anything from his old girlfriend, Adele, played by Charlize Theron (another great performance), his faith in talents, and especially his faith in life, which the movie centers on. Just when Junah's faith is nearly gone for good while horribly swing golf balls in his backyard, Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith, (greatest actor today and a legendary performance), comes out of nowhere, like an angel(WINK WINK) and immediately tries helping Junah. This movie is just one big metaphor of an angel who is disguised as a golf caddy and is uplifting the faith of a person in need. Golf is just the format or stage they use to translate this message in a different way. You know Bagger is an angel because he never receives nearly any of the rewards he should receive after all the help he has given Junah, his spiritually perfect advice (like an angels would be), and at the end there is a clear give away when Hardy(the little boy, the narrator, and the old man in the beginning and end of the film) dies from a heart attack on the golf course and wakes up in heaven(which is still the golf course he was playing on) to see Bagger waving to him in his ageless form. This is also showing that the movie suggest heaven isn't this big epic white scenery of clouds but instead a place that you are the most happy. I'm not a very religious person but this movie is a religious/spiritual/life experience that is great in all areas from storyline, script,acting, directing, and cinematography. You will be moved after watching this.So for the people who haven't seen it....watch it. For the people who have but didn't realize the real story behind it...watch it again and my mind blown....and for the people who have watched it and did get the memo....watch it again and still be blown away and entertained like I am every time.10/10 obviously.",10,1,3,13 January 2012
Hancock," Give it some slack this was entertaining and underrated
","Don't get me wrong here...this is not the greatest superhero movie of all time but its definitely refreshing. It takes the side of a superhero in a darker, comedic, adult version, and almost more realistic/relate-able side. It shows that even superheros aren't perfect which is honestly a great idea and great side to show. Hancock is basically a non-perfect superman. He has a drinking problem, doesn't care what people think of him, and has personal issues. This allows normal people like us to relate to someone who basically is an all powerful God, and lowers him down to be more on a human level, which again is refreshing and key word: DIFFERENT! After watching other cheesy, totally unfathomable, even for superhero movies, its takes a different viewpoint on what problems a superhero could face if they were in fact real, which gives it a more realistic feel to it. Will Smith also is great, hands down greatest actor of all time and if you don't agree....don't watch movies. He can play any role. But OK i will admit at the end it got kind of weird and I had my doubts because of the story that unfolds, but then when I saw the great acting and how much pain and sadness you could feel while watch Will and Charlize Theron, who have great chemistry together rooting from the Legend of Bagger Vance, it immediately took away my doubts and took the movie for what it is. The producers had a goal and accomplished it. This movie is very good but by no means great. Its very funny at times and very dramatic at times using realistic viewpoints in a very unrealistic world. SEE IT!7/10",7,2,3,13 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Greatest Movie Of All Time
","To be honest....there's not much to say about this movie. I am an avid film critic and I am completely lost for words.Christopher Nolan is the best director/writer/producer/creator right now and now arguably of all time. Christian Bale = consistently phenomenal. Tom Hardy = unbelievable. Hewitt = great young actor. Hathaway = incredible. Freeman = Freeman, enough said.The Dark Knight Rises has not only set the bar for superhero/action movies, but movies of all genres. 15/10..yup. Unbelievable.There really isn't much to say about this movie because honestly there is nothing to compare it too. NO movie comes close...try to argue it and I will leave you in the dust. Enough said...I'm done. WOW",10,36,74,20 July 2012
