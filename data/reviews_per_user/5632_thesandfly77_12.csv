Black Swan," Very Good Watch, But Not Great. Overpraised, Somewhat.
","Highly stylised, intriguing production nicely woven with the Swan Lake story. But also sometimes very predictable, clichéd, and no more incisive than TV-series-level thriller.There are plenty of elements of psychological horror, all of which you'll be familiar with and offer no real suspense - we've been down this road many, many times before.I was expecting something darker and deeper after reading many fanboy reviews on here. I'd hoped for a treasure akin to Jacob's Ladder in psychological mainstream horror/thriller terms but ultimately this was Diet Lyne/Demme for figure-conscious ballerina types.But this does sound as if I have a downer on it. No. Black Swan deserves to hold its head above the monotonous waters of 2010's film fodder.It does so mainly thanks to the performance of Natalie Portman. From Leon's jailbait sidekick to yawnsome Star Wars royalty to prima ballerina, she's grown into a sometimes stunningly beautiful woman and refined actress.She carries her character's dramatic personality shifts effortlessly and is completely convincing. None of the supporting cast let anyone down and all-round they work well with an occasionally fragile script.The story itself is conveyed skilfully enough to absorb anyone unfamiliar with the world of ballet (hello, fellow blokes) and the dramatic hooks snag effectively to hold your attention even if the subject matter is completely alien (hello again, fellas).I suspect many gushing reviews are from those who willed this forte into the ballet world to be a success and may be slightly blinkered as to its merits on a strictly thriller level.All in, however, is is a welcome alternative to the usual lame fare. Doesn't deserve nominations but does deserve a mention and a recommendation for all. A good 7.5 out of 10.Liked it but won't be watching again until its on terrestrial TV.",7,7,15,21 December 2010
It," Beautifully Balanced Vision Of A Classic
","First - this review is not of the remedial variety; the classic numbnut 'It didunt scayer me as a munched mu popcurn'.There's a ton of them out there sapping my will to live.I've read the book on three occasions since 1987. The 1990 mini-series was a frustrating, strangled attempt to get IT onto some kind of live action format. Memorable, yes - and only - for Tim Curry's Pennywise.Stephen King unwittingly created a cultural landmark, and did more to demonise clowns than John Wayne Gacy.My heart sank when this reboot of IT was announced. How do you present a consumable version of a tale so embedded in cultural subconscious, a villainous killer-clown theme so worn by terrible Z-movie clichés? How do you engage indifferent VOD generations who have seen it all, or at least believe they have? Who have experienced every trick in the cinematic horror-book? Well, you get as clever as Andy Muschetti and his production team and you build it from the solid foundations-up.They got back to the classic tale; took the spirit of the book and made sure it's prevalent in every scene, even in the new added invention that throws us some original, beautifully constructed moments.And right the way through we got raucous adventure, grisly horror, tension, and tragedy.You're never a few moments away from being reminded this is a tale that revolves around the loss of a murdered little brother, and a dark history of smalltown evil. There's a gravity to the story that grounds it constantly, and also makes it more compelling because this is the everyday evil you just didn't notice...You're also never more than moments away from laughing out loud or gritting your teeth, or a shiver running down the spine.The balance is great.My only contention - the running time. But that's restricted by budget and studio expectations. There's so much more they could have told but what they did for 2 hours 10 minutes and $35 million is remarkable, particularly to a long-time fan of the epic novel.Pennywise - well, terrific. More villain than vaudeville, more sinister than silly. Bill Skaarsgard will be very popular at his family's children's birthday parties in the years to come. Or maybe not...I loved this incarnation of the killer clown as opposed to Curry's; as much a Heath Ledger Joker to Nicholson's. Captivating, and both amusing and horrific.Overall, IT is more thrilling than frightening, and that's no bad thing; there are dimensions to this film that elevate it above the worn tropes of desperate 'horror' directors.You could say IT floats.I cannot wait to see the second chapter; I expect the adult timeline to be very, very dark indeed compared to this hugely entertaining Goonies v Kruger romp.8/10",8,3,5,17 September 2017
127 Hours," The Greatest Ever Movie About An Extreme-Sports Twonk Stuck In A Canyon
","A welcome return from Danny Boyle, and a stunning cameo return for the junkie-swallowing couch last seen in Trainspotting.James Franco does a fantastic job of fleshing out Arron, a thoroughly annoying canyon-leaping (or canyon-fail) extreme-sports loner-loser whose life undergoes a change for the better due to the miraculous healing properties of a rock more stubborn about lifelong commitment than a desperate fat chick.It's no spoiler to point out he loses an arm as their relationship breaks down (no more than a holiday romance, ultimately). Could have been worse as Arron - now married - will find out if that goes wrong; he'll lose a leg as well (sage nod from many out there...).However one-dimensional the premise sounds, what transpires for an hour and a half is as gripping as you could possibly imagine wringing out of it.Tense and unnerving, gruesome, and heartwarming. And that was just my reaction to the reappearance of the Trainspotting couch (looking fitter and stronger; undoubtedly a method-couch).Stunningly shot, a treat for the eye. An absorbing tale of one schmuck's bravery and redemption. Expect to see some alert mobile phone company jump all over it in future. If only he'd remembered...Oh, and kudos to the camcorder company for the longest-life battery ever. If only mine lasted that long on babe-laden vacation beaches...Watch this. See nature and geological time hate us and realise they await your one cosmic moment of wrong-footedness.Then never leave the house.A climbing Seven. And a half, because IMDb are an anti-fraction faction. ;))",7,0,2,24 January 2011
Cloverfield," Naysayers Completely Miss The Point
","A couple of things which will help you chart my review:1) I hated the Blair Witch Project2) Did I mention the above?Now, to get the motion sickness issue dealt with: Put yourself in a time of trauma, some disastrous 911-style event and imagine the camera-work you are capable of.Yes, it's all over the place, yes it's frequently difficult to have exact clarity as to what's going on. . . And yes, if it weren't for the above two points this movie would not work at all.As it is, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly.Intense is a word that's used in many reviews here and that fits the bill perfectly. The immersion and sense of place is perfect.Indeed, I suspect - quite strongly - that Cloverfield's style owes a little to the video-gaming FPS (First Person Shooter) genre, BUT do not let that drift your mind towards cheesy cannon-fodder shoot-'em ups, instead think of the much more sophisticated and adult 'Half-Life 2' PC series.This, for those unfamiliar, is a tremendous compliment in that never before has a PC game managed to create such a sense of immersion and suspension of disbelief, and nor has a movie before mirrored that interactive sense of involvement. Half-Life 2 sets the player in an alternative near-future where government dealings with extra-dimensional beings has resulted in the collapse of society and the imposition of a totalitarian regime whilst the cities are infested with all sorts of nasties - and in Cloverfield the smaller parasitical creatures which drop off the monster and scuttle around the streets and subways are a direct lift of Half-life 2's 'antlions'.Indeed, the bleakness of the movie continually drew me to the HL2 gaming experience - there is no saccharine salvation here, just the plain horror of the attack and the ever-perilous dilemma of the characters, into which the viewer is also thrust through the first-person perspective with excitement cranked up after an initial domestic scene that lulls you into a false soap-opera storyline which is cut abruptly and amusingly short with a - literal - bang.Too many complainers are hung up on the camera style. But there's no Cloverfield if there's no shaky cam. It's realism come to town, beautifully executed and completely understandable. In fact, as the film wears on I found myself looking for compromise in the shots, scene to scene, awaiting the inevitable third-person palliative for the groaning masses, the shot out of synch with what's gone before. It never comes, thank god. Honesty and conviction survive and triumph.And the trembling smile of being immersed into this bitterly tense, sci-fi survival horror along with the amiable characters stays on your lips. You UNDERSTAND why you don't see this and that clearly - because if it were you wielding the camera its exactly what you'd shoot, too, no more, no less. A different, brave, and joyful, nail-biting experience that I'm thoroughly glad I indulged in. You'll need a couple of beers to relax after the experience but it's well worth it if you throw yourself into it the way you might not have done since you were a child. It deserves its 8 out of 10. In time, if anyone else is competent and ballsy enough to execute similar styles of storytelling and we develop a genre with a canon of work, you might just look back on this as a 10, a defining moment where all the endless familiarity of the 21st Century's obsession with reality TV, and youTube, and eyewitness documentaries, and warzone reportage and the video gaming subculture came together in a sharp-as-a-tack embodiment of our times and our fascination with apocalyptic self-destruction.My opinion of the Blair Witch Project didn't alter as a result of Cloverfield - they're different enough; BWP a bit gimmicky, with overkill on the camera motion (blah,blah,blah to the 'small-budget' apologists - they still forced it far too much with little respite). But here, the balance is struck beautifully between disorientation and comprehension.Don't miss Cloverfield. You'll be pleased you didn't. FOOTNOTE: As for the motion-sickness fluster - a tip which worked for me: when the camera is in extremis, focus on then CENTRE of the screen - you're not missing anything anyway and as the movement stops you'll find your eyes in direct focus with the camera. Think of yourself running - you don't whip your head side to side; there's always a focus for your brain, a direction to which you aspire. Same here, forget the whipping camera - natural if you were carrying it - and instead keep focused as if you were running INTO the screen. In fact, don't treat this as just a movie; think of it as a bit of a theme-park ride thrown in and treat it accordingly.",8,0,2,1 February 2008
Knowing," Far Reaching And Almost A Knockout
","If you really want to read one lengthy review, please give this one a go; I promise it's no knee-jerk, spoiler-free and considered with your bucks in mind.Firstly - I've taken time to think this one over and read the reviews here. Opinion seems divided between love and hate. I'd say the haters have jumped the gun.Nowadays, after decades of sci-fi mythery, everyone's a sage of the genre and oh-s-o-clever at second-guessing plot lines and themes.Even a quick scan of the negative reviews will fill your weary eyes with stock-ready film student rhetoric. Well, have a chuckle at the trap they all fell into.Right from the start this movie wears its heart on its sleeve, but such a duplicitous organ it is this time round, making no apology for its bombastic fanfare.Christian parable, Scientology homage? Bullshit. For all the clever dicks out there who suspect subterfuge at spotting a Hubbard novel, there's another dozen who only saw the bible on Cage's bedside table (or wherever the hell it appeared; positioning is not the point).Knowing's influences are varied, blatant and well contrived to provide two hours of solid entertainment in a blockbuster that requires its audience to think a little; of course every teenage 'knowing-all' (see what I did there, eagle-eyed students of the pun? lol) who's posted on here at 'getting it' within the first act has completely missed the point.And the point was this: There IS nothing new this film can show you. There IS nothing new any sci-fi film can show you nowadays. You're all experts! What this film does, quite brilliantly in some parts - is take all those clichés, tweak them, mix them together and ask you to continually question if they DARE play it out towards the big apocalyptic premise that builds as Nic Cage unravels a 50 year old conundrum.That's what I mean by far-reaching. I enjoyed the ride, impressed by the refusal to bend to Shaymalan twist or surprise denouement; this film grows and grows and eventually consumes its own audacity but it does so in a resplendent blockbuster manner that allows an intriguing premise to flourish without the need for paint-by-number building-brick exposition for the popcorn crunchers.By the end I was sat grinning - not in mockery - at the ambition and execution.It was, overall, an admirable job of clinging to the roller-coaster without being thrown to an unsatisfactory demise in the dark of the theatre.I'm not going to even list any trivial complaints about certain late special effects being slightly ropey - they didn't influence the ending a jot. I won't even list praise for other spectacular effects which take the breath away. As a metaphor for the film they're perfect - a mix of ambitious vision and occasional shaky execution.A solid 8 out of 10.Refreshing and engaging attempt at growing the biggest of tales from the smallest of beginnings. Sure, we've all heard and seen bits and pieces of it before but as remixes go, this is a new beat I dug.Go into it with an open mind, leave any lame cynicism at the door and bathe in its courageous enthusiasm to entertain on a big scale.",8,2,5,27 June 2009
2012," Now A Classic B Movie
","Over a decade on, I re-watch 2012 with my kids and, well, if it doesn't just pop that big bubble of pretentiousness the triggered carry in their narcissist manbags.
It's pure theme park, big action movie nonsense with a sweet ironic undercurrent of conspiracy theory and biblical theme.
How any movie fan cannot enjoy this testament to mad, overblown creativity beats me. Overacting by notable actors, demented cgi that still holds a wow factor all these years and advances later - this is just damn good fun.
Kick back, unclench your critical sphincter and revel in the mentalness of unhinged ridiculousness; this is movie-making on cocaine speedballs served up with a pitcher of JD and an acid dessert. Cinema to make you shake your head with a grin.",7,0,0,4 July 2020
I Am Legend," I Am A Leg-End
","Simple pieces of information for the interested, for Hollywood execs, and for those with a grip on (sur)reality:The 160-page source novel by Richard Mathieson is a piece of genius. This effort is a piece of (dead-zombie) dog turd.What committee designed this abomination, a whole which is a whole lot worse than the sum of its lame parts?Egomaniac Will aside, here playing the Last Ponce of F-All, what about the sub-MTV video direction? How many illegal immigrant cinematic clichÃ©s can we pack into this redneck pickup of a movie before it drives off credibility cliff?How many intellects can we insult with the stereotypical adversaries (was the book's dichotomy - its emergent vampire duality - so difficult to translate to screen for the credited morons here? Writer's strike? Strike them all I say. Hard.) and hodgepodge of an ending? NB: The novel's ending is rich in pathos, irony, myth and gravity. Truly outstanding and seminal. The movie's ending is rich in. . .well, banality. It'll make your jaw drop if only because you're gagging on the stench of the abundant cheese.Of course with the ending morphed into something out of the Dubya school of fantasy finales - groans come free with the hollow gut ache and sense of deep financial loss - the title loses its original acuity.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars Schadenfreude!
","Well, well, a Star Wars for grown-ups.Speaking as one of the generation who has seen every Star Wars movie in a theatre, I must say this last week of fanboy outrage has been a devilish indulgence.Finally, a rebel Star Wars film - not kow-towing to the gigabites of bandwidth wasted on predictions, plot speculations and character assassinations by the entitled generation of demanding, new First Order smartasses.And how it slaps down and pokes a finger in the eye of every know-all on the web forums and tube sites who now seek a safe-space to nurse their wounded egos and ferment about big bad Disney corporations 'betraying' the 'fanbase'. Spoiled brats ahoy!Director RJ pitched the tension beautifully, pulled the rug from under every angry-millennial theory and led us into a scintillating final hour of simmering drama and epic vistas.What I liked :The space battles - no need for endless seat-of-pants dogfights any more and we got variety - flyboy gung-ho bombing raids, suicidal lightspeed assaults: WHAT a scene that is - the silence, the white lightning mega-explosion and the intercut blitz of angles it throws at you; a stunning 10 seconds of cinema if ever there was. See it in 3D; immense.Kylo Ren/Skywalker - Adam Driver shares the show with Mark Hamil; conflicted Ren and rueful Skywalker are two great performances. Their showdown is raw and intimate and epic; master and apprentice, emotion bridging generations.The meme of the 'side-quest' - surprised and pleased to see the addition of a little grim reality as Finn and Rose - and us - are introduced to the reality behind every war - even galactic ones - when we see the mercenary nature of those who feed off death; the arms dealers and suppliers. A very mature theme to introduce, albeit amid a herd of giant racing puppy-dogs or something.That lightsaber battle in the throne room against the red praetorian guard - superb. Brutal, lethal, spectacular and 'believable' use of the force - had me on the edge of my seat and whistling appreciation; everything the ridicuous balletic displays of the prequels failed at.Final hour - as mentioned, total Star wars porn - a rollercoaster of great scenes - the Crait battle/Throne room/Finn v Phasma/Ren v Rey/Leia's sentimental moments/Skywalkers' end; just terrific. Even the cryptic force-kid at the end and the eyebrow raising 'ohhhhhhh...'s he induced from the cinema.Humour - first gag too early; would've fitted nicer about 10/20 minutes in once we'd established the feel of the film. Rest of it - fine, well pitched - Porgs not at all irritating and provide a true LOL moment when Chewy tips the Falcon and one slams into the window.The unpredictability; guessed nothing right going in, grinned at every red herring revealed.What I disliked:
first hour or so a little iffy; unable to establish what exactly was being aimed for - we had a prequel-ish interlude around the casino with those aforementioned racing giant puppies. Felt scattered a bit. Settled into overstretched scenes with one character when you were itching to see a little more development with others. May be due more to the final edit than content.Mary Poppins Leia was poorly thought out; the wrong physical execution of that idea; too open to parody. As ironically, I've just reverted to.Not enough of Del Toro's character - like an amoral Han Solo; he may play a greater part to come. I hope so; there's a dimension to his character that adds to the new 'maturity' of the Star Wars universe. The whines of fanboys around me. Really, if you want to bleat like a little shaved ewok when things don't work our just the way you want, keep it out of my range, snowflakes.
When I hear the countless proclamations of some Last Jedi event being 'unfeasible' I would like to remind people that 34 years ago the watching world was perfectly happy to accept a gang of feral teddy bears taking on and overcoming a battalion of crack Empire stormtroopers led by the most evil villain in the galaxy.
There's a line you may be familiar with at the opening frame of the films, -something about a galaxy far, far away: that hints at fiction; Science-Fantasy fiction. Roll with it.
OVERALL:8.3 out of 10Surprising, spectacular and unpredictable. The way Star Wars SHOULD be. Kudos to the crew for knowingly defying the demands of the undeserving and producing a controversial but solid epic.This is the way the Star Wars story is going, kids; dig it or walk.Episode 9 here I come. Kill 'em all, JJ, kill 'em ALL!",8,1,3,23 December 2017
30 Days of Night," 30 Ways To Fright(en)...groan...
","Now this is how to do it.I came to this film late, seeking an antidote for the tepid morass that was I Am Legend. And how I found it!Thank you. a refreshing and invigorating take on a well-worn legend. The plot you'll be aware of so I won't take up time with a summary. I'll concentrate on the qualities this little gem possesses in abundance.1) Intensity. It reminded me, due to setting but also the intensity of some set-pieces, of The Thing. A good Thing (sic, apologies.) The tension is cranked up and left taut. 2)It is totally Uncompromising. Although a gore-fest in many places, do not let that put you off. The reluctance to bow to the political correctness of many modern-day horrors or ease up on the relentless peril the protagonist and his band of depleting survivors face which the movie exudes is an incredibly admirable trait in today's market place of redemption and faux nicety.The vampire clan here are no lost children of the Lord, they're downright feral and as similar a species to humanity as we are to the ape. There is neither the sense of pity, romance or longing invested in these creatures; a point worth noting the quality of acting by those playing them - not easy to pull off, and with potential to edge into cheese as we've seen before in countless lesser productions but a balance is nicely struck between animal aggression and intelligent darkness. Kudos to those involved in pitching it just right for necessary suspension of disbelief.3) The Acting. As mentioned above, the vampires work very well, but so to do the survivors. Josh Hartnett was a convincing joy as the troubled, heroic Sheriff and each minor part was filled out to the max. Of course credit to the director for encouraging such quality of performance.4) Cliché Management. Predictably in many other reviews of this, particularly the negative ones, the word cliché is thrown around like water at a 4 year old's summer birthday party involving a pool a lawn and copious water-pistol armament. Well, stop it now. Perhaps too many people fall upon clichés themselves when searching for the necessary language to compose reviews like this. I'd like to make a valid point here: When dealing with the horror/vampire genre the cliché, be it written, spoken, or visual is UNAVOIDABLE. Got that, moaners? With any project like this, the management of the cliché is what is most important. And, with every man and his dog (see, a small cliché there) having an opinion/take on the vampire legend it's all a movie can do to put up convincing arguments both for and against convention. And I think this film does so with aplomb and no apology.5) THE END. I've warned of possible spoilers but I'll try not to express any plot points here. Of course any smart kid with a Pc can declare on here that he/she KNEW such and such was going to happen. But as a veteran of these B-movie homages I can honestly hold up my 40 year-old hands and say the climax was a genuine pleasure, a genuine surprise and in no way signaled throughout the film.It is the icing on the cake and closes off a tense, harrowing hour and 40 minutes of creeping dread in a unique way that does stamp this movie as different from the pack - not totally unique but certainly outstanding - and well worth your time. In summary: It is savage, grim, gory, brutal and painful to watch at times but that's all positive when dealing with a new take on the genre. You'll wince and grimace and breath fast and your heart will race as you feel the tension. And that's quite a feat for a modern-day vampire flick.I marked this 8 mainly because its brimming with gore, perhaps - and this is but a light criticism - overtly in some places. But you got to please the teenage crowd as well as offering plenty of intellectual engagement for those seeking more. Also, I would have liked a bit more exposition on the nature of the vampires and their origins but that is maybe a very good sign - that the film held me enough for my curiosity to go along for the ride and left me wanting more. Yeah, add another half point, lol.Do watch this. For its genre,it's a diamond in the rough. It deserves your time far more than most gargantuan-budget blockbusters, and it will neither insult your intelligence or leave your expectations wanting. Thoroughly enjoyable.",8,2,3,15 January 2008
It Chapter Two," IT Evolution
","33 years I've waited.....Since reading the book in 1986, then again twice over the decades.The 1990 miniseries was kitschy treat, making an icon of Tim Curry's Pennywise and introducing stubborn non-reading retards to a slice of the wondrous freaked-out cosmic horror hidden within the novel's 1100 pages; at school I was failed in a term exam for an essay on IT by a teacher who labelled it 'Satanic drivel', yet professed to never having read it :)) Yes, the world's full of them...2017 IT was a surprise - a realy great surprise as it delivered sometihng akin but deliciously different to the original adaption. Trouble was...They created a monster all over again. In this age of connectivity, IT - Pennywise - became a juggernaut of cultural reference, almost ubiquitous in everyday lives, instantly recognisable to multi-millions of consumers however invested in the actual story they were. He was the original killer clown and he had returned to take over the world.So how the hell do you conjour a second part to the tale, remaining faithful to the source material and somehow incorporate this all-pervading pop-culture icon without it becoming a blandishment of clown-memes?Well, they certainly went for an angle, and I commend the reach - further than I thought they would go but not as far as I would have liked.Pennywise was never going to have the same chiller-killer impact of 2017 so the move towards lashings of dark humour infused with the shlock-horror was a brave one and very meta - recognising the part that clown has come to play in the consumer psyche.So we get something that echoes the original Evil Dead series for sardonic black comedy and still manages to hold together the book's struggle of mere humans battling cosmic evil.Most admirably, they managed to make it entertaining over the 3-hour run-time.
Pennywise gets a slew of great moments and each adult actor is given the chance to inhabit the grown-up Loser to the best of their abilities; and note that they all do a splendid job.The effects are absolutely fine - lol at the facebook-smart intellectuals who parrot the 'poor CGI' line; you gotta ask why none of those creative geniuses didn't step in and offer their services to save the day. They'll be sat on the couch with the 'look at me, I'm not scared' crew when the DVD comes out.Some people just don't get it, or IT...The dread of IT was always beyond impactful first-level boogeyman frights - as soon as the book opened up the exposition into realms of ancient inter-dimensional cosmic horror I was blown away. Stephen King, brilliantly drug-addled, took us on a trip into primeval darkness, from the unsettling events in a small American town to the abyssal terrors of the universe itself. The reach was epic and they made a grab for that here too, almost fulfilling the wishes of many who wanted the deep lore, the trippy light-fantastic backstory revelations of the novel.So very nearly, but this cultural monster had to deliver at the box-office, had to sate the demands of the casual jump-scare popcorn junkie and so the compromise was reached; entertaining, chilling, sentimental and twisted, comedic and vicious, with a shot of lore to add some depth.They managed to keep a lot of the plates spinning and deserve praise for never allowing the span of the film to lapse into dreary segments of character development or predictability - there's always something round the corner, even if you're expecting it, you're still guessing it. I though the pacing was excellent for the most part.Ultimately, you can criticise IT chapter 2 for its level of personal-expectation fulfillment - e.g was the end true-form reveal a cop-out, a compromise or a clever concept? - but you can't criticise the crew's commitment to doing a classic book and cultural phenomenon justice over what is a sprawling but consistent and worthwhile epic movie.Thank you, Andy et al, I very much enjoyed your celluloid realisation of decades of wonder.",8,18,30,8 September 2019
Inception," Blade Runner. I'm Thinking Blade Runner. But I Can't Be Sure That's My Own Thought...
","A Multi-megamix of reference points combines into something very familiar but still stunningly original.THAT is the beauty of Nolan's Magnum Opus.'It's complicated!' They whine. 'Too clever by half!' 'Up its own ass!' Of course it is. But it DESERVES to be. It's a layered mindf*ck of novel-esque conception, a living book up there on the screen, giving you no time to analyse but encouraging you to take the ride and let your brain work it all out on autopilot as the adrenalin frazzles your imagination.You might just hate it immediately afterwards; like the bewilderment and guilt of a beautiful one-night stand way out your league.But later you'll want more as events turn in your mind; satisfaction will demand proper comprehension, or at least a cognitive reasoning of the plot.Inception warrants more than one viewing (if you hadn't guessed already from the hysterics among us).It deserves its high ratings for the attention to detail, for daring to intellectualise the blockbuster premise. It commits the crime of hurting the brains of the multiplex popcorn-rustling Crackers. +1 rating there alone.Re: Blade runner - the beginning and end, meshing together to leave eternal unanswered questions, a macguffin, spinning, spinning, a la origami unicorn.Great. Watch it. Again.",9,1,7,24 January 2011
Alien: Covenant," I Am Not A Film Student
","...Nor am I a wannabe film critic.Therefore this review will not be written from a smug, supercilious point of view, sneering at a piece of work by a renowned director and able cast, the kind of project that I will never hope to exceed or even participate in because once outside the bubble of my ego I will discover the big bad world cares not a jot for my pretensions and self-satisfied viewpoint that makes me popular in student bars and probably on my own youtube channel where I will inevitably end up after my narcissistic ambitions are thwarted and eventually scorched, like the burgers I end up flipping through tears of petulant frustration.What I am is a middle-aged film fan who managed, nearly 40 years ago - jeez... - to sneak into a late-night screening of 'Alien' with a cadre of gormless teenage youths thanks to the culpability of a friend's usher-employee older brother.I say 'culpability' because - in the good old days, kids - that fermenting spine-chilling two hours of celluloid darkness haunted me for years. All very well sniffing at the xenomorph through decades of cultural saturation on little-to-medium screens but at its cinematic big-screen birth? - primordially terrifying.And now Ridley proves relentless as his ouevre, storming the theatres again through his old-age. Four decades on, what does yer scary old English uncle do to twist his spine-tingling tales to keep those wizened children of the age on edge? Well, there was Prometheus - and you really should have seen it in order to gain the most from Covenant. To be honest, I left the cinema after Prometheus very disappointed. Confused in the main about what the main thrust of its themes were. Upon revision and repeated viewings, its irritating mishaps are outweighed by its grander narrative and the big ideas it explores.The Gestalt factor - THE principle that good movie producers understand can elevate a film from its perceived failings; that the whole is other than the sum of its parts. And Prometheus, for me, ultimately fitted that theory.So to Covenant with anticipation. And what I got was a solid thriller to add to the canon, sitting nicely behind the first two and again vindicating ol' Gestalt.It's about 80% what I hoped for, and what I'd expected to find regarding the overriding theme...MINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (But i'll try to keep it opaque): Fassbender - owns it; about the only living actor who could pull of that dual role convincingly, with tremendous malevolent threat and excoriatingly disturbing execution. Completely brilliant.Xenomorph - maximised its threat and power beyond what I had expected - genuinely menacing again, and along with the Neomorph, formidable kings of the sci-fi baddies catalog once again; You CAN breathe new life into the familiar.Cast - fine. What's not to like? Everyone carries their part with conviction and leaves nothing off the celluloid.Dialogue/Script - 90% fine with me. Sure there's the few creaky lines that might not survive real scrutiny but a perfect script? There's always something someone will add/alter/replace subjectively; it doesn't exist. And doesn't need to be here, because...The Action - sorry, but the naysayers are talking out their arses; the sequences are perfectly balanced. There's NO overkill or overt gratuity in the violence or the gore; I was surprised at the satisfying gravity and screen time allotted to both - each sequence felt authentic and 'realistically' pitched in terms of timescale, combat authenticity and outcome. Great, to be honest, with a thrilling finale as well.Innovations/Reveals (PROPER SPOILERS, skip if necessary) - Personally, I liked the fleeting xenomorph POV; a wry smile accompanied this 'distorted' HUD, 'ahhh, they can see to an extent...' As far as the big reveal - David the destroyer/creator - I'd 'guessed it/hypothesised it beforehand, when in conversation or thought about the forthcoming sequels. It made it no less satisfying/interesting/frustrating to see it portrayed in the actual narrative and lit the imagination as to the promise of the third and final prequel/sequel. I will have no hesitation is attending asap to see where Ridley Scott will take us next in the inevitable ascent/descent towards the origin.Other points of note springing to mind - the nods towards the first, with the nodding bird and the bleeping tracker; lovely. Not trite, just neat.OVERALL - if you have anything more than a mild appreciation or interest in the Alien universe this film will not disappoint. Even for the diehards, it offers a very admirable chapter in the huge backstory Ridley Scott and his writers are creating; they melded the philosophical, the physical and the fantastical well here, allowing for intellectual musings and savage sci-fi horror to sit contemporaneously.After Prometheus I was a little detached from Ridley's ideology. After Alien: Covenant I'm fully engaged again. Mishaps forgiven, grand themes absorbed and I'm happily strapped into the drop-ship for the next badass ride to hell in space. (Bill P RIP).A solid 7.5/10 from me. Will watch again.",8,40,74,17 May 2017
