Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Vol. II presents strong symbolism with a modern twist
","Q.T's kill bill vol. II, has accomplished a feat that most modern film students will strive to achieve over the next decade. This great film touches on the eternal theme of love and its complicated struggles, all through the symbolic world of serial assassins. Carradine portrays a stunning villain, who like many of Q.T.'s bad guys, we desire to associate with. Thurman herself continues the passion carried on from first part of the film. The ability of the film to blend genres and still maintain a complete and functional story and style is very commendable.Also, deeper meaning is a waiting for those willing and able to look for it. I also recommend viewing the volumes together back to back as the film was intended to be seen. Enjoy!",10,0,1,10 January 2005
