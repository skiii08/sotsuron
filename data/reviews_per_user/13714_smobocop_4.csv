The Rock," One of the greatest action films ever made!!!!!
","This film is amzing. The actors they picked for the parts in this are perfect.  Sean Connery is the man.  Ed Harris plays the perfect good villain.  And finally michael biehn is in a good movie again(1996).nicholas Cage's best movie i think in the action genre. This movie has it all, good characters, awesome action. Also at some points it can be funny too.9 out of 10",10,2,2,17 December 2002
X-Men," Awesome, but still had its flaws.
","I thought this was all in all a good movie, I managed to get to see the premier when it came out. I now own and have watched it many of times.The Good: Hugh Jackmen as Woleverine, good job in choosing a nobody, Patrick Stwert as Xavier,and also Sir Ian and Magneto, the special effects were great and the fact that if you know the comics, they show alot of characters from the comics as kind of cameos and/or minor parts.The Bad: Using Rogue as the Jubilee story,James Marsden as Cyclops, they needed to get someone older,no Beast, he is one of the original X-men, he's also the smartest second to Xavier, also no Gambit, a fan favorite.Also there weren't enough action scenes, this made the films pace a little slow.All in all this film deserves an 8 of 10, its well executed but has some flaws that could easily, in some ways be fixed.",8,0,0,17 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Two Towers is by far one of the greatest films I have ever seen, and possibly ever made.There was no flaws in this film.  The Acting was superb, Andy Serkis/Gollum was picture perfect and deserves to be Oscar nominated, so does Viggo Mortensen, he nearly carries this film.If Peter Jackson does not win and Oscar for best director and/or picture, the Acadamey Awards are definitly fixed in some way or manor.  I am sure Gangs of New York will be good, but nothing can compare to this amazing film.Overall this movie has everything a movie goer and a fan of the book will enjoy.10 out of 10. Anything less would be unjust.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Simply Unbelievable
","This is film is simply amazing.Admittingly the begin was somewhat slow, but as soon as it the story begain to pick up it was just consuming.  The visual effects were just as spectacular as ever but it is the acting of some of characters which is truly impressive.  There so much you can say about this movie, but all you can say is Long Live The King.  If no oscar is given to this its a  farce to all movies.",10,0,0,17 December 2003
