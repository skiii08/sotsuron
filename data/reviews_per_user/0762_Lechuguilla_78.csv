National Treasure: Book of Secrets," In Search Of El Dorado
","Finding the lost city of El Dorado, or Quivira, or Cibola (take your pick) would be easier than finding any plausibility in this film. Our hero Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) goes from one narrow escape to another, as he zooms to Paris, then to London, then to the White House in Washington (with a personal chitchat with the President no less), and then on to Mount Rushmore, in search of, well, in search of ... something. I think he's looking for evidence to clear his family name, in the historical conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln. What he actually finds, with superhuman luck, is something else, something he didn't expect to find. But none of it really matters. The plot here is so wildly unbelievable, so far-fetched, and so muddled as to be a cinematic magic carpet ride.Clearly, 'National Treasure: Book Of Secrets' is aimed at kids. It's a highly visual movie, with lots of eye-popping outdoor color images. The physical action is so fast at times, with lots of high speed editing, that there is no danger that the audience will be required to do any thinking. Acting and dialogue are largely irrelevant. And the film has elaborate and expensive production design.Not all of the conflict is physical. Ben must negotiate with his partner Riley (Justin Bartha), his dad (Jon Voight), his mom (Helen Mirren), and a couple of others, all of whom become involved in Ben's quest. The film has a clever twist, but if you're not paying close attention, it's easy to miss.There is no sex, nor is there any prohibitive violence here; it's a Disney-type adventure all the way. Still, if the film can get kids interested in history, whether it's the legend of El Dorado or Lincoln's assassination, then I suppose 'National Treasure: Book Of Secrets' can be said to have some redeeming value, it's plot implausibility notwithstanding.",Null,12,22,27 May 2008
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Beautifully Bizarre Travelogue
","Three gay male performers journey from Sydney to Alice Springs in a colorful bus. I found the story to be contrived and not very interesting, though never let it be said that the three main characters lacked personality. The film's dialogue seemed flat and unimaginative.But what the film lacked in screen story, it made up for, as a travelogue. What a grand music video. The Australian outback, in its lonesome desolation, with its resident lizards and ants, was magnificent. Amplifying these images was the film's harshly haunting score. The result was a wonderful tribute to the visuals of Sergio Leone, and the music of Ennio Morricone, in their spaghetti westerns. Then, into these emotionally evocative scenes, add a transvestite walking alone to nowhere, or applying lipstick, and you have what amounts to true cinematic art. Just terrific.I also liked the images of the sleek, shiny fabric streaming back from the top of the bus as it flees across desert badlands, while Felicia sings, with gusto, some operatic aria. And then there is the image of the pink kite flying high, with ethereal music playing in the background. Given the offbeat nature of the story, somewhere, concealed in all these stark images and intense sounds, is a profound symbolism.Most of the scenes in this film are tedious and uninteresting. But those scenes that do stand out are memorable and hugely successful. I don't recall a film in which the cinematography and the music of selected scenes so overwhelmed the overall story. ' ... Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert' is certainly evidence that a film can, and should, be more than a mere script.",Null,5,13,29 September 2005
The Sound of Music," Pollyanna Personified
","One of the most beloved films of all time, 'The Sound Of Music' conveys optimism and beauty, much needed in a real world that too often sinks into pessimism and ugliness. It is this underlying theme, the heart and soul of the film, that explains its enduring popularity. And rightly so.That theme is attractively wrapped in a cinematic package consisting of, among other things, topnotch direction, cinematography, editing, and dialogue. The bow on top is the music, which exudes enough inspiration to warm the coldest of cold, cold hearts. It's as if 'Edelweiss', 'Climb Every Mountain', and 'The Sound Of Music' were written to be hymns for the next thousand years.These towering cinematic achievements make the film a classic among classics, in the abstract. But, in practical terms, they do not offset the film's downside which, for me, keeps the film at arms length.'The Sound Of Music' is sugary. The sappy story has 'cute' Julie Andrews playing a Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes character preoccupied in some euphoric fantasy, oblivious to reality. Maria (who curiously has no last name) thus seems as lost on her side of the rainbow as Oz's Dorothy is on her side.And so, my thoughts and feelings are ambivalent. I admire the film for its uplifting theme and for its technical quality. But it is not a film that I would watch often for fear that I might choke on all that sugar.",Null,4,12,30 November 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," All The Right Moves
","A globe-trotting American archaeologist travels to Egypt in search of the ancient Ark of the Covenant, in this adventure epic from director Steven Spielberg. It's a big-budget popcorn flick aimed mostly at kids. There's lots of heavy-duty action as our hero, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), makes all the right moves to escape dreaded Nazis, a bed of snakes, knife-wielding Egyptians, fiery explosions, poison food, human skeletons, bullets, airplane propeller blades, and assorted other dangers. Since there's nothing subtle about the story or the characters, and since the action plot zips along at the speed of light, viewers need not engage in any thinking.With Jones as a surrogate for American virtuousness, 'foreigners' in this film seem inept and villainous for the most part, a politically correct view for the era in which the film was made. American stereotypes aside, non-Americans are portrayed in the film mostly as clutter, film props for our hero to knock over.It's all a bit much, a bit over-the-top. Not only is the story not believable, the story's theme is rather condescending. I despised the background music, annoyingly loud and manipulative. Acting is largely irrelevant, not surprising, given the film's genre.In its defense, there are some good visual images. For example, I liked the scene of Jones, wearing his trademark hat, in silhouette, on a hill, back-lit by an orange sun. The film's color cinematography probably is its best element.Otherwise, 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' is just one more in a long series of 'action' movies for kids to drool over, a two hour cinematic ... cartoon. The script concept is silly; the characters are poorly defined; the plot is ridiculous; the score is annoying; and the American hero theme is very irritating.",Null,1,1,20 July 2008
Stop-Loss," A Noble Effort
","Well intentioned, this film tells the fictional story of Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), an American soldier who, after successfully completing a heroic but horrendous tour of duty in Iraq, is notified that, despite his wishes, he must return to Iraq for yet more combat duty, a real-life contingency called 'stop-loss'. It's a fate that neither King, nor real-life soldiers, want or deserve, but which the U.S. government justifies in lieu of a wartime draft.The film's first few minutes provide a montage of images and scenes showing King, and his men, in Iraq, as they bond together as protective buddies, and as they endure a violent urban ambush, during which several buddies get killed or seriously wounded.Back home in Texas, King and a couple of his men briefly celebrate their hero status. But life for them quickly deteriorates, as their wartime trauma leaves both physical and mental scars. And then, King gets his 'stop-loss' notice. This sets up the rest of the film's plot.The theme here is obvious. The brave soldier, having endured more than enough danger and trauma, is still just a powerless individual. As such, he or she is caught between having to resubmit to the horrors of war, or submit to a perilous and life-altering AWOL status in the U.S., or elsewhere, forever on the run from an overpowering American political system. It's a timely and worthy subject for a film.That much effort and care went into the creation of the film, from background research to attention to detail in costumes, production design, and military protocol is obvious.And the film's color cinematography also is quite good. There are lots of close-ups, to get a feel for what the characters are going through. Many scenes feature natural lighting, used in clever ways. At times, the film has an almost documentary look and feel. Acting is overall credible. I especially liked the performances of Linda Emond, as King's mom, and Abbie Cornish, as a young woman who tries to help King.The major problem is the script. Characters are rather stereotyped and two-dimensional. The plot is fairly predictable. And the story and its attendant theme are a tad too direct. I could have wished for a little more depth, and a plot twist or two. The film's ending is not very satisfying.Yet, 'Stop-Loss' is a noble effort to document the brutality not only of war but also of an American government that uses, then basically throws away, people, to ensure the preservation of an American war industry and continued power of faceless bureaucrats and corrupt politicians.",Null,47,58,4 August 2008
Casablanca," Wartime Themes
","Love and sacrifice during WWII underlie the story about a café owner named Rick (Humphrey Bogart), and his link to two intellectual refugees from Nazi occupied France. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and, like other European refugees, gravitate to Rick's upscale café, near the city's airport, with its revolving searchlight.Rick is a middle-aged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism, especially for people in need, like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's café, an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons, from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's café that renders this film so appealing, with a variety of interesting accents, clothes, and uniforms. And, of course, there's Sam, the piano player, who plays all the favorites, including 'As Time Goes By'.All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script, with its colorful characters, like the debonair Captain Renault (Claude Rains); and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), the articulate and portly 'leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca'. And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's (Corinna Mura), whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.The film's dialogue, though substantial, is clever and lively, like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar: 'How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that; some day they may be scarce'.High-contrast B&W lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning; it evokes a feeling of far-off adventure.'Casablanca' differs from traditional noir films, mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism, an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.",Null,8,10,28 November 2007
Chinatown," A Haunting Atmosphere
","This film reminds me of 'The Big Sleep' with Bogie and Bacall, although 'Chinatown' is more enjoyable than the 1946 so-called 'classic'. Both Jake Gittes and Philip Marlowe exude smugness and insolence; both have to contend with, and are inexorably drawn to, classy women with secrets. And typical of movies that feature gumshoe detectives, the stories of both 'The Big Sleep' and 'Chinatown' are confusing and convoluted.'Chinatown' combines power and corruption with sex and murder into a needlessly complex plot, written perhaps deliberately to confound viewers, in keeping with traditional noir doctrine, which espouses that confusion equals arty sophistication.So who did kill Ida Sessions, and how did she get possession of those pictures? Fans of 'Chinatown' would regard such questions as irrelevant, just as fans of 'The Big Sleep' would regard the question of who killed Owen Taylor irrelevant. Who cares who the killer was, so long as you have the infallible Nicholson, as heir to the infallible Bogart, to distract attention from the story. Sorry, but I just don't agree that a muddled story can be a film's virtue.'Chinatown' does have its strengths. Good acting permeates the film, even among minor characters. But the performance of John Huston was inspired (pardon the irony), and should have been recognized as such with an academy award. The music, too, is impressive. The slow, lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography.This film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and, to some extent, that helps overcome a perplexing plot.",5,20,38,1 July 2003
Citizen Kane," Wonderful Cinematography
","If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, 'Citizen Kane' is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.The film's B&W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. 'Citizen Kane' should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as 'the number one greatest film in history'.But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&W cinematography. Then, they need to let go of the guilt.",6,49,75,29 June 2008
Mississippi Burning," Through The Mississippi Darkness
","In 1964 three Civil Rights workers were murdered in rural Mississippi by Southern White racists. This film tells the story of the follow-up investigation by two FBI guys named Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe). Although the triple murder is based on a real-life case, script plot points are mostly fictional.The Anderson and Ward characters are fictional. And it's unfortunate that the writers here portray the FBI as the good guys, which is a distortion of the historical reality. The Mrs. Pell character (Frances McDormand), also is fictional and distracts from the case. While the inclusion of some fiction can be acceptable in real-life stories, since such films are not intended as documentaries, 'Mississippi Burning' deviates too much from the historical truth, and that's my main criticism of the film.Some have argued that the film is biased because it presents a stereotyped view that all Mississippi Blacks were victims and all Mississippi Whites were villainous. But that's pretty much the way it was back then. Even now, I'm not sure a lot has changed since 1964, though villainy may be more subtle now. Because of the heavy political overtones, some viewers will necessarily be put off by the film's overall message.The visuals are the real strength of the film. Detailed prod design, period costumes, and the casting of local, non-professional actors make the film come alive with a sense of realism. Much of the plot takes place at night, thematically appropriate given that evil redneck thugs terrorized an entire race of people and caused untold suffering.Casting is appropriate, with the possible exception of Willem Dafoe, an actor with an annoying voice. Cinematography is quite good. Colors are highly muted; lighting is fairly low, with night scenes quite dark.'Where does it come from, all this hatred (toward Blacks)', asks one character. It comes from the reality that the South never recovered from the Civil War. And all that resentment expressed in 1964 to some extent still exists, some 25 years after 'Mississippi Burning' was made, and a half-century after the event upon which the film is based. Many Southern Whites just cannot let go of the past. Perhaps they never will ...",8,1,1,17 August 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Pirate For Our Times
","What lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's humorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric, individualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a humorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more like Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than a pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate, Barbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in 'The Wizard Of Oz'.Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and general mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic slight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance. Still, it's an entertaining popcorn flick. I'm glad I watched it. Depp's deft performance gives us a memorable character, one that is perhaps unique in cinema history.",Null,75,133,5 September 2005
The Notebook," Somewhere In Time
","James Garner plays a contemporary older man who reads a story from a diary, in an effort to reach out to an elderly lady, played by Gena Rowlands. She likes listening to the story, (told in the film via flashbacks), a 1940's romance between a young country hick with a heart of gold, Noah, played by Ryan Gosling, and an attractive, but confused, young woman, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. Allie lives with her rich parents. Noah lives with his poverty-ridden father. Naturally, the love affair encounters complications, including opposition from Allie's snobbish parents. Where this romance leads is the basis for the film's plot. 'The Notebook' will appeal to viewers who enjoy low-key, sentimental love stories. In what it sets out to accomplish, the film does a fairly good job.But the fact that so much of the plot centers on the two young lovers renders a somewhat unsatisfying result when the actors playing those two parts botch their roles. Rachel McAdams overacts. Ryan Gosling underacts ... stunningly. Indeed, throughout most of the film, Gosling, mumbling his lines, seems to be 'out to lunch'. Further, for a rural kid from South Carolina, Gosling's Southern accent was way too subtle. On the other hand, Gena Rowlands gives a marvelous performance, as does Joan Allen, who plays Allie's mother.The film manipulates viewer emotions. But I suppose that is to be expected in a love story. The final twelve minutes really tug at your heart strings.'The Notebook' is a well-intentioned film about the chasm that separates youth from old age. And, I applaud any film, this one included, set in a contemporary nursing home. Although the plot is a little too predictable for my taste, and although the acting is highly variable, the film is a welcome, low-key alternative to Hollywood's usual preoccupation with monsters, gore, car chases, micro-burst flashes, explosions, and general residuum.",Null,0,0,15 September 2005
Public Enemies," Blurry And Dark
","Chicago's Biograph Theater and immediate surroundings in the film's final fifteen minutes look authentically 1930s. And the accompanying sense of impending climax captures a growing drama. The ending of 'Public Enemies' thus makes for absorbing viewing, helped along by the realization that these events actually happened.That said, I find little of interest in this mostly factual account of public enemy number one, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), and attempts by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to catch him, under the watchful eye of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup). Though the period-piece sets and era music are fine, the film suffers from two big flaws.First, despite the focus on Dillinger, the script overwhelms the audience with too many background characters, all of whom seem nondescript and confusingly intrusive. I counted 43 characters significant enough to earn a 'biography'. The total list of characters exceeds a hundred. The film purports to be a biography of 'public enemies', namely Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and their sidekicks. But all these added people blur the story, and render a very impersonal account.Second, the film's lighting trends dark, and as unhelpful as the script. Faces merge together. There's lots of hubbub and 'action'. I can barely remember any of it, apart from those final fifteen minutes, and one other segment wherein Dillinger walks nonchalantly into a police station room devoted to his capture. But, in general, the lighting compounds the confusion with regard to characters and plot.Overall performances trend dull and wooden. Depp is a terrific actor. But he's dull here. Christian Bale gives as wooden a performance as I have ever seen. Other actors leave little or no impression.Sound effects are good, especially the sounds of gunfire.One gets the impression that the film's director aimed for a particular style of storytelling. If so, the results don't work, at least for me. There are many good true-life gangster films out there. 'Public Enemies' isn't one of them.",Null,3,4,30 March 2010
127 Hours," Deliverance
","A young man named Aron Ralston (James Franco) sets out on a solo hike into the empty and rugged Canyonlands of Utah. But his quest for adventure turns ugly when he encounters a villainous large rock. It's a story of wilderness survival reminiscent of the 1972 film 'Deliverance'. But whereas 'Deliverance' is fictional, '127 Hours' is a true story.There are several problems I have with this film, not the least of which is the character of Aron Ralston. In '127 Hours' he comes across as cocky, too sure of himself, disrespectful of the desert, and vain. He talks into a video cam as if the world fixates on every word he mumbles and every step he takes. He's inattentive. And he takes way too much for granted.In addition, the film's script is poorly plotted. Aron's dilemma gets stretched out way too long, resulting in tedium and boredom for many viewers. With a runtime of 94 minutes, his plight consumes fully sixty minutes ... just Aron, that villainous rock, and various plot contrivances that pad the story, including hallucinations and dreams, story flashbacks, efforts to set himself free, and that annoying, ever-present video cam. A much better structure would have been for the script to have shown Aron on previous successful hikes, leading up to the midpoint plot turn, with his predicament postponed until the second half.Further, the film's loud, intrusive music contradicts the silence of a wilderness trek. Yet it does foster the impression that Aron is basically an urban guy who, despite his yearn for wilderness, can't let go of modern conveniences. The flashy, gimmicky cinematography also is out of sync with a wilderness theme, and included seemingly to mask a story that otherwise is not really cinematic.The scenery is beautiful. And the script's underlying premise is quite compelling, given that the events really happened.A wilderness experience can be worthwhile and enjoyable if, and only if, a person takes seriously all of the things that could go wrong. Aron Ralston didn't do that. And for his recklessness he paid dearly.",Null,3,6,5 September 2011
Alexander," Another Sword And Sandal Epic
","Hollywood star power and tons of money can't save this overwrought, melodramatic story of the life and times of Alexander The Great (Colin Farrell), the Greek warrior who conquered lands in times B.C.The single biggest problem here is the script, and in particular the plot structure. Just as viewers are getting familiar with a plot sequence, the time period of the story shifts backward to a previous era, or forward to a future era. Displayed on the screen as '10 Years Earlier' or '40 Years Later' or '9 Years Earlier' or '8 Years Later', back and forth we go. It's maddening. It makes the story, which already contains too many characters with strange names, muddled and hard to follow. Director Oliver Stone apparently tries to cram in too much information; as such, the story's scope is too broad. Another possibility is that the time-shifts were necessitated in post-production editing. But whatever the cause, the screen story's convoluted plot is a huge barrier to understanding Alexander and the people in his life.In addition, the script's dialogue contains too much exposition, mostly from Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) who, via numerous monologues, lectures us about Greek history. Again, one gets the impression that Stone is trying too hard to make the film a comprehensive history lesson.Non-script elements are not much better. Casting for the main parts is poor. I like Angelina Jolie, but she is no Olympias. And Colin Farrell, with his golden locks, would fit better in a modern day romantic comedy. Acting is hammy, at times almost laughably so. Actors don't communicate with each other so much as they speechify. Every line of dialogue is heavy with import. Even the film's makeup is overdone. Jared Leto, with all that eyeliner, looks like a drag queen.Perhaps the best element of the film is the color cinematography. It's quite good. Some of the landscapes are visually sweeping and majestic. And I liked that ethereal background music from Vangelis. Also, the costumes are colorful and apparently quite authentic.I like Oliver Stone. But I have never cared for sword and sandal movies. They always seem pretentious, so proud of themselves, in their extended runtimes and sweeping scope. 'Alexander' is no exception; it muddles along for nearly three hours, and covers most of one man's lifetime as he conquers lands from the Mediterranean to the Far East.Maybe Oliver Stone would have been better advised to confine his saga to a smaller, more restricted story, one wherein viewers can get to know the protagonist and his inspirations and challenges. In its present form, 'Alexander' is just too sprawling and epical to warrant any enthusiasm from me.",Null,8,11,21 July 2008
Ed Wood," 'Cut, print, we're moving on; that was perfect'
","What a delight! Dreamlike in tone, 'Ed Wood' lovingly imparts to viewers the humorously delusional world of 1950s bad-film artiste Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Johnny Depp), creator of legendary bad films, most notably 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Part of the film's charm is how it portrays Wood, gushing with uncalled-for enthusiasm and optimism. Depp's facial expressions are priceless; that glib smile, those bugged-out eyes, the raised eyebrows, all enhanced by exaggerated makeup.But no amount of incompetence can deny Wood's passion for making films. With a big megaphone to call out commands to his actors, Wood is like a ten-year-old boy, thoughtless of the finished product; he just wants to play movie director.Wood surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, including most especially washed-up 'Dracula' actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose relationship with Wood propels most of the film's plot. But there are other, equally eccentric, people drawn to Wood, the most interesting being Bunny Breckinridge (a surprisingly good performance by Bill Murray), Vampira (Lisa Marie), and Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), that otherworldly seer of the future. The misfit label applies to Wood too, of course, who directs his actors, dressed in women's clothes, seemingly oblivious to the managerial discordance of such attire.The script's characters and the film's high-contrast B&W lighting combine to portray Hollywood as a comically nightmarish place of delusional unreality. Simple sets mirror the cheapness in Wood's world. And that bongo-laced score with accompanying Theremin and crashing symbols is almost hypnotic.Acting is way, way above average. Depp is absolutely terrific. And so is Landau. I can't think of any weak performances. My only problem with this film is that the plot gives a tad too much attention to Lugosi.That Wood was anointed as the 'worst director of all time' seems a bit cruel. At least he had heart and soul. Yet one cannot deny the unintended humor in his films.Wonderfully nostalgic, 'Ed Wood' reflects back to another era in film-making, when thinking big, self-assurance, and nerve were all a young man needed to make his Hollywood dreams come true, no matter how untalented.",10,10,11,15 April 2010
The Hustler," A Talented Loser
","It's an intriguing idea. If a person is talented, that person should be a winner. And, we would expect a loser to be someone who is not talented. But the idea that someone could be a talented loser is a paradox, a contradiction that doesn't fit into the conventional mindset of American culture, and is the basis for 'The Hustler', a character study of an ace pool player who can't seem to win respect from his peers.The pool player is (Fast) Eddie Felson (Paul Newman). The plot moves along by means of four secondary characters with whom Fast Eddie interacts: (1) his manager, Charlie; (2) the veteran pool player, Minnesota Fats; (3) Eddie's girlfriend, Sarah; and (4) the money man, Bert Gordon.'The Hustler' is very much a product of the late 50's and early 60's, when progressive filmmakers were trying to buck the staid post WWII era, with its reactionary Cold War mentality that resulted in strict conformity to established American values. In this film, Bert Gordon and Minnesota Fats represent the establishment. Eddie Felson is the loner, up against the establishment; he's the renegade kid, out to beat the system. Yet, at every turn, the establishment beats Eddie, one way or another. His idealism is useless. He must conform to the establishment's rules, expressed in the film as 'character', or give up his dreams.The film is therefore very cynical and incredibly cold. From start to finish, there's not an ounce of humor. It depresses the spirit. But the film is a very good metaphor for a terrible era wherein societal repression was the norm.While the story's main character may be a loser, the film itself is a talented winner. The excellent B&W lighting, together with a jazzy score, create an effectively somber and downbeat tone, consistent with the oppressive political atmosphere of that era. The dialogue is sparse and incisive. And the acting is persuasive. Paul Newman is convincing, as are the secondary characters. I especially liked the performance of Jackie Gleason, who comes across as suave, serious, and in total control, a great contrast to his comedic side, in 'The Honeymooners'.'The Hustler' is depressing and grim. But the film is very well made. It entertains in ways that are obvious, and educates in ways that are subtle.",8,108,148,29 October 2005
Insomnia," Like A Bad Dream
","Will Dormer, an L.A. detective played by Al Pacino, goes north to Alaska to help solve a murder case, only to find that in the land of the midnight sun, he can't get any sleep. That can be a nuisance to anyone. But for an on-the-job policeman, it can be deadly.It's a strange premise for a film, but one that has lots of potential. Unfortunately, in 'Insomnia' (2002), that potential fails to solidify, owing to Pacino's acting, and a foggy, ambiguous plot that had me wondering if I was trapped in someone else's nightmare.Dormer is not very likable. He has a craggy face. He keeps his mouth open too much. He has a scratchy voice that is annoying, and made worse by Pacino's tendency to whisper, or mumble, his lines. Dormer is a kind of Lt. Columbo, without the charm of Peter Falk.And the film's plot is a mess. It is confusing and convoluted. There are scenes that don't make any sense. The script is devoid of humor. The music is irrelevant. The lighting is inappropriately dim for some scenes. And the editing compounds these problems. You get the feeling that they were trying to create an atmosphere comparable to what you find in 'Se7en', an atmosphere suggestive of some unknown, lurking evil. What they did instead was merely make 'Insomnia' hard to follow.Except for the film's unique premise, and the gorgeous and well-photographed Alaskan scenery, 'Insomnia' comes across as a bad dream.

","With those five words and with countless threats and baffling cryptograms, a serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 60s and early 70s. In the thirty-five years since the attacks, the only suspect ever officially named in the case was Arthur Leigh Allen. Yet, recent DNA analysis seems to have eliminated Allen as a suspect. Like Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac's identity remains, to this day ... unknown.There have been a couple of other films about the Zodiac. But Director David Fincher's thriller is by far the most ambitious and high profile. Based on two books by researcher Robert Graysmith, the film starts off with reenactments of some of the killer's attacks. Most of the film, however, follows three men who were involved in the original investigation: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), and reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.).Procedural in style, the film reminds me of 'All The President's Men', with its dogged and maddening investigation by unofficial individuals. Here, Graysmith's obsession with the case matches the obsession of Woodward and Bernstein. 'Zodiac' has a big problem with pacing. Suspense is sporadic at best. Too much dialogue, and unnecessary sequences, especially in the film's middle Act, render considerable boredom. Given the film's length, these talky sequences could easily have been edited out.The film's production design and overall acting quality are good. I could have wished for more late 60's era music. 'The Hurdy Gurdy Man' was good, but not enough. Authentic location shots add credibility to the story as non-fiction. The film's cinematography makes use of the new digital 'Viper' camera. As such, 'Zodiac' is significant in that it becomes the first major movie to be filmed without conventional videotape or film.A flabby screenplay interferes with what should have been a riveting thriller. Still, if you are interested in this true life crime case, Fincher's 'Zodiac' records the lengthy, and futile, search for the infamous killer who still fascinates us, even after all these years. Unless this case is solved quickly, it will soon become a crime legend of historic proportions, every bit as haunting as the legend of Jack the Ripper.",7,87,172,2 March 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," They Fought The Law And The Law ...
","Two American bank robbers head for Bolivia to evade capture, in this George Roy Hill directed Western, based on real-life events. I have never understood the appeal of this film. Its plot is boring for the most part, although it does pick up in the second half.Maybe Butch (Paul Newman) and the 'Kid' (Robert Redford) charm viewers with their roguish and outlaw attitudes and behavior, so that they, in effect, become the story. Maybe the appeal is their spirit of teamwork. Or maybe it's because the two are so photogenic. In any event, the plot's slow pace could have been improved if the film had been only about seventy or eighty minutes. As is, it's stretched out to 110 minutes with what seems to me to be lots of filler, especially in the first half.The color cinematography is dark, so dark I could hardly see the images at times. So much of the plot happens at night. The scenery might have been beautiful ... if I could have seen it. And I don't care for all those photographic stills; I find them distracting and jarring.This film certainly gets great reviews from others. That's fine. My preference in Westerns would be 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'For A Few Dollars More'.",Null,2,3,7 September 2007
Alien," A Rat In The Attic
","A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative 'sci-fi' flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably to escape the crew's incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope, he's in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is condemned.I'm constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects. Where in this film is a sense of the cosmic? Where is the originality? Where is the science fiction in all of this?",2,28,72,29 December 2008
The Doors," Mr. Mojo Risin And The Turbulent 60s
","Although less popular now, Jim Morrison was an American pop culture icon during the late 1960s. He liked to refer to himself as 'Mr. Mojo Risin', an anagram of his name. Oliver Stone's film 'The Doors' is mostly about Morrison ... his rise to stardom in the 1960s, his personality, and his mysterious death in 1971.Influenced in childhood by American Indians, Morrison grew up fascinated with Indian Shamanism, elements of which he would later infuse into his poetry and music while hanging out in the mid 60s in the hip areas of Los Angeles. Here he would meet musician Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan). Along with two other band members, the group would form 'The Doors', a name Morrison borrowed from the title of Aldous Huxley's book on drug use and enlightenment, called 'The Doors Of Perception'. During this time Morrison comes across as sensitive, shy, poetic, and an idealistic dreamer. The film's first hour is quite good. We get some insights into Jim's early years, and we get to hear some of that great music, like 'Riders On The Storm', and 'Light My Fire'.The film's second half is less interesting. Morrison himself has changed, as a result of his celebrity status. His narcissism, his boozing and drug use, have turned his world into chaos, which is evident in a couple of staged concert events, one in New Haven, the other in Miami. The amount of time that Oliver Stone spends on these noisy, chaotic events is excessive. Some of that could have been edited out.As with most Stone films, the cinematography in 'The Doors' is excellent, and includes some early CGI. Val Kilmer is a great choice to play the part of Morrison. And Kathleen Quinlan is good as Patricia, the seductive witch. The film's images at the cemetery in Paris, together with Gothic background music, make for a haunting finale.Stone's movie is not to be taken in a literal sense. Rather, it is suggestive of the complex mix of personal and cultural forces that interacted to create a pop culture legend. As a byproduct of this cinematic tribute, the viewer gets to see how the late 1960s really were, with the art deco, the hippie lingo, and all that hostility that existed in society. The film thus counters the political revisionism that later decades have assigned to that period. As such, 'The Doors' complements and reinforces other films of that era which also 'tell it like it really was': 'Medium Cool', 'Easy Rider', 'Alice's Restaurant', and 'Zabriskie Point', to name a few.Despite a noisy, irksome second half, 'The Doors' is an intriguing film about an intriguing historical figure. Mr. Mojo Risin's 'style' may have died with the times. But Jim Morrison, himself, lives on ... as legend.",Null,39,54,23 April 2006
Closer," Oh What Wretched Characters
","Unnecessarily tangled romantic relationships among four beautiful people in modern London form the core of this Mike Nichols directed film, based on a play. About the only thing I liked here was the melancholy song 'The Blower's Daughter', sung by Damien Rice, that opens the film. The film's script is wretched.Selfish, self-absorbed, obsessed with sex, vindictive, and shallow are how I would describe the four main characters, people who are annoyingly photogenic and 'hip'. The dialogue is like an interrogation session, with characters asking prying, intimate questions, over and over. These characters don't talk like real people. They emote, as if their words came straight from a screenplay, which makes the story seem ... fake. The dialogue is so contrived, so expedient to the plot, that I couldn't take any of these vain people, or their drama, seriously.The film's action trends static. Characterization and dialogue are what count here, the back and forth banter that describes these miserable people.Casting is terrible. I would have had more respect for this film if the four beautiful people had been played by less well-known actors. All four of the A-list actors here ... pose. They convey the impression that the film is about their performances, their careers.Visuals are acceptable, if unremarkable. The highbrow, artsy music is fine, except that it amplifies an overall sense of pretentiousness.With such unlikeable characters and with dialogue that is super, super contrived, this film left me bored and eager for it to end. Mike Nichols used to be a really fine director. 'Closer' is not one of his better films.",2,16,24,4 November 2009
Taxi Driver," A Metaphor For Loneliness
","Gritty, grim, and depressing, 'Taxi Driver' tells the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a desperately lonely Vietnam vet who takes a job as a New York City cabby. The job should, in theory, draw him closer to people. Instead, it does just the opposite. Through the endless repetition of impersonal contacts, the ever-present prostitutes and pimps, and all the other reminders of urban indifference and sleaze, Travis' loneliness and alienation deepen into concealed rage.Both delusional and morally judgmental, Travis counters in the only way he knows how, by taking up arms, literally. In his words: 'Here's a man who would not take it anymore'. He shaves the sides of his head, he pumps iron to get physically fit, perfects his weapons skills, and sets out to be a one-man vigilante committee.'Taxi Driver' was, and still is, a relevant cinematic statement on urban alienation. The film's tone seesaws between menacing and dangerous on the one hand, and tawdry and seedy on the other, depending largely on Bernard Herrmann's excellent background music, and the moody neon of nighttime Manhattan. The taxi itself functions as a visual metaphor for loneliness.The film looks and feels like typical 1970's drama: dark, downbeat, somber. There's almost no humor to offset the weighty subject matter. Dialogue is realistic for NYC street life. My major technical objection is the violence, which is overplayed. I did not much like the film's ending.'Taxi Driver' has evolved into a cinematic classic, owing to its social message, Scorsese's direction, and Di Niro's flawless performance as the anti-hero at the center of the urban maelstrom. This is one of those films that a viewer can appreciate for its technical quality, but not really enjoy watching. Indeed, I find the film to be somewhat tedious to sit through. It's all just a bit too grungy and sordid for my taste.",Null,4,7,28 August 2006
Capote," Hoffman's Terrific Performance
","This is a fine character study of Truman Capote whose professional desires collide with his personal desires, as he researches and writes about the 1959 murders of a Kansas family. The film examines how these conflicting desires arose, and how Capote, the person, handled the ordeal once he realized that these desires were mutually exclusive.Hoffman mimics Capote's posture, voice, facial expressions, and overall mannerisms quite well. It's a great impersonation. But, towards the film's end when Capote has to say goodbye for the last time, Hoffman's portrayal of Capote's grief and helplessness goes well beyond parody. It's an example of genuine acting ability.Other performances are also good, especially Chris Cooper as Prosecutor Alvin Dewey, and Catherine Keener as Capote's friend, Nelle Harper Lee. In addition to the fine acting, the story itself is gripping, because it is a true story. It's been told before, most convincingly in 1967's 'In Cold Blood', from the POV of the killers. That film was photographed in B&W. 'Capote', by contrast, is in color. But the colors are all muted, reassuringly so, in view of the subject matter. The tone of 'Capote' is solemn and earnest, almost funereal. The pace is slow and deliberate. Music is restrained.Viewers with little or no interest in the central character may find the first half of the film slow going. It plods along without a lot of tension or suspense. But as the writer bonds with the convicted killer, tension picks up, and then further builds en route to a profound destiny.My only critique, beyond a slow beginning, pertains to the minimal attention given to era atmosphere. Given that the story takes place in the late 1950s and early to mid-1960s, I would have preferred more cinematic cues of that time period, especially with regard to music, decor, and cultural themes which are curiously absent, aside from obvious props like cars and telephones.The Clutter killings were, and still are, unsettling and haunting, even after all these years. 'Capote' is a high quality film that describes Truman Capote's research into the case, especially as regards the mindset and motivations of the killers, and further examines the effects that Capote's investigation had on him, both as a writer and as a human being with feelings. Though the story is good, Hoffman's wonderful performance is the real reason to see this film.",Null,10,13,15 May 2006
Barry Lyndon," Obliquely Napoleonic
","In the early 1970s, Director Kubrick wanted to make a film about Napoleon. For various reasons, that effort failed to materialize. But Kubrick put his research on Napoleon and that historical era to good use later, in a story about a fictional character of that same time period, Barry Lyndon, a roguish young Irishman whose ambition and opportunism would carry him into splendorous surroundings of Europe's high and mighty, despite one setback after another.In 'Barry Lyndon' what we get is thus a Napoleon-like character: clever, charming, calculating, and commanding. And we follow this character over an extended period of his life, as he interacts with the grandiose and powerful, en route to a destiny dictated as much by uncontrollable fate as by his own selfish desires.Given the film's very slow pace, I like the way the unseen narrator explains the plot as it proceeds. Such a script device ensures an overview approach to the story, so that we don't get lost in details. Implicit here is the nullification of both suspense and mystery. The title character's ever-changing circumstances, however prosaic, and his responses to those changes, are what matter. The narrator functions thus as an impartial, emotionless observer, a stand-in for Kubrick himself.Production values rate quite high as does the cinematography. Interior scenes especially look really good, with those lit candles amid colorful costumes and makeup. Indeed, some scenes convey an air of romanticized unreality, as characters pose like statues in a museum. The classical background music thus completes the Enlightenment-age mood.'Barry Lyndon' is a period film with colorful costumes and some interesting characters. With a runtime of three hours and a big budget, it comes across as self-conscious and forced. Its stiffness, as displayed in stagy acting and stilted dialogue, renders it hard to like. I found it not particularly entertaining. But the film does succeed at giving viewers a Napoleon-like character, and a pretty good feel for what life must have been like among the aristocratic elite in that time and place.",7,1,5,2 November 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Paint It Black
","'With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black'. So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles.",10,92,118,16 November 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Misrepresentation Of History
","This hyped classic has a number of problems seldom acknowledged by reviewers and serious film historians. Only the first 45 minutes or so take place in Oklahoma. Well over half the plot is set either on the road or in California. This is a curious plot structure for a film about 'okies'.Very few of the Oklahoma scenes were actually filmed in Oklahoma. Indeed, the Joad farmstead and surrounding landscape look nothing at all like Oklahoma; these scenes were all filmed in California. In point of fact, John Steinbeck was born and raised in California. His novel is based on second-hand information, distorted even more by a Hollywood cinema machine interested only in money.Viewers have come to assume, implicitly, that Steinbeck's book is factual. It is not. The story is fiction. The Joad clan is fictional. Their journey to California is fictional. The specific worker camps are fictional. The only elements of the film that are based on truth are the era setting and the struggles that most people from the Great Plains endured during the 1930s. That part is real.There was genuine hardship and suffering. But it's a mistake to assume that everyone who migrated to California during that period were as destitute as the Joads. I personally have ancestors who lived in Oklahoma in that era; some moved; some stayed in Oklahoma, but none were indigent. The Joad's decrepit car is a symbol of the film's visual misrepresentation, in addition to the fake Oklahoma landscape.The exaggerated impoverishment of script characters results from a Hollywood establishment eager to send a political message about social class inequity, a way to manipulate viewer perceptions. But the downside to that manipulation is that it has had a profoundly negative effect on Oklahoma and other Great Plains states in the subsequent sixty years. The resulting cultural bias against these dust bowl states has caused damage that far surpasses the damage done by nature and the economy. Such is the power of Hollywood and the gullibility of viewers to trust filmmakers.That said, the film's B&W cinematography is quite good. The story is rendered mournfully bleak, largely as a result of Gregg Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and dim lighting. The song 'Red River Valley' is ideal for the locale and era. I also like the absence of actors' makeup, which adds a subtle touch of realism. Casting is acceptable and so is acting, except for the two most elderly of the Joads (Grandpa and Grandma), who overact dreadfully. Their portrayal of old people is insulting.I consider 'The Grapes Of Wrath' a Hollywood sacred cow, critically untouchable. But Steinbeck and Hollywood combined to do far more damage to the dust bowl states than the hardships that actually occurred. The cultural residue this film has left has been most unfortunate.",4,7,17,24 November 2014
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Forces Of Darkness
","Historically compressed, this reenactment of the trial and subsequent murder of French martyr Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is a famous silent film that has had a torturous past. The film was initially censored. Then the negative was destroyed. A second negative somehow survived but went undiscovered for fifty years.The film is unusual in several regards. First, it has very little action. A big part of the film is the interrogation of Jeanne by Church hierarchy, hostile old men who fear her dedication and inner conviction. Second, camera shots are mostly close-ups, or of medium range. This strips images of background distractions in the interrogation sessions. Props and scenery are thus either absent or largely irrelevant.The only consideration is the interplay between Jeanne and her tormentors. Camera lighting is bright when focused on the faces of the monks and judges. And none of the actors wore makeup, another unusual trait of this film. The visuals thus present these men as forces of darkness, looking hideous, barbaric, and cruel, unable to hide behind their righteousness or religious ritual.By contrast, Jeanne comes across as sincere, courageous, honest, and unwavering in her convictions. Falconetti gives a really fine performance. Some critics regard it as one of the greatest performances in film history. Falconetti seems to have the ability to cry on cue.After the interrogation, Jeanne is led outdoors where she is roped to a stake. The townsfolk gather to watch. Their sympathies, judged by their crying and grim faces, clearly side with Jeanne. The film's climax is uncompromising. The images at the end are quite potent.This is a true story of a lone individual up against an arrogant, institutional bully. No wonder Jeanne d'Arc is now regarded as a Saint. The DVD provides a couple of options for watching this silent film: one with no sound at all, the other with the 'Voices of Light' music track. I prefer the latter because the classical music instills a sense of historical majesty and grandeur to this simple, but powerful film.",Null,2,4,22 May 2009
The Aviator," Leonardo Portrays DiCaprio
","He looks like a little boy trying to play the role of a grownup. Has there ever been a worse casting mistake? With his baby face looks, his high pitch voice, his phony Texas twang, and his forced mannerisms, DiCaprio not only is the wrong actor for the role, he is so distracting as to ruin the entire film.That's the main problem. Another problem is the part of the plot that deals with the tedious technicalities of early aviation. I found it to be totally not interesting. Maybe it would be of interest to an aviation historian.In addition, the film gushes with busy hubbub and lots of non-substantive chatter. The screenplay must have weighed a ton. Despite all the dialogue, the film's script lacks an emotional spine, making the film seem shallow, superficial, and insincere.At a cost of over $100 million and a runtime of nearly three hours, the film conveys an air of superiority. It is very, very impressed with itself. It spews implied bravado. I cringe when I consider that the filmmakers could have made five very good films, costing $20 million each. Those are five films we will never see.However, if you like DiCaprio, the Hollywood 'star', you will no doubt like this film. After all, 'The Aviator' is mostly just a flashy cinematic vehicle to enhance his star status. Viewers looking for an honest and in-depth study of the life of Howard Hughes will need to look elsewhere.",1,18,33,4 February 2006
Grease," Disco Hound Dog
","Well golly gee whiz, I don't even know where to begin with this one. To its credit, it does have energy ... lots of high voltage zing and zest, hyper kinetic hubbub, in that optimistic spirit of high school days, with all that singing, dancing, and chattering like magpies. And the production design and costumes are colorful and splashy.'Grease' also has two terrific songs that function as musical bookends. At the beginning, we get to hear 'Grease (Is The Word)', sung by Frankie Valli. I've always liked that song. And near the end, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John dazzle and electrify with the snappy, pulsating sounds of 'You're The One That I Want' ... 'oo-oo-oo, honey'. Marvelous.Trouble is, both those songs engender a 1970's disco flavor into a film ostensibly about the 1950s. So where are all those really great oldies-but-goodies? Sha-na-na sings a few oldies, like Elvis' 'Hound Dog'. But the missed musical opportunities are striking.The film's story, about high school romance, is not original. And the plot is choppy, and lacks scene transitions, or any sense of logical progression or flow. Plot points seem placed almost in random order, a result of poor script structure.Although the film is a comedy, the jokes aren't really funny. The writers are trying too hard, and the humor comes across as forced and unnatural.One of the worst elements of 'Grease' is the 'Greased Lightning' segment, which has John Travolta acting like a jerk, as he struts and prances in an auto garage. Wearing too much makeup, he comes across as a poor imitation of 1970's singer Freddie Mercury, from the 1970's rock band 'Queen'.The film's casting is terrible. Most of them look too old to be high school seniors. Not for a microsecond did I think Stockard Channing was 17 years old.What's good about this film is really, really good. And what's bad is really, really bad. But overall, 'Grease' fails to engender a sense of the 1950s. Instead, it looks, sounds, and feels like an homage to the 1970s disco era.",Null,9,16,28 December 2007
The Color of Money," Teacher And Student
","The teacher is has-been pool shark Eddie Felson (Paul Newman). The student is Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), a cocky, overconfident kid who knows how to beat opponents but whose swaggering attitude gets in the way of being taken seriously by professional pool players. At face value, 'The Color Of Money' is a character driven story of Felson's efforts to teach young Vincent the importance of psychology and subtlety, en route to the big-time pool tournaments in Atlantic City. At a slightly deeper level, the film is the story of how Felson, with his own personal agenda, uses Vincent as a means to an end.For pool players the film offers lots of terrific pool playing. For everyone else, the story can seem dull and claustrophobic. Most of the film is set indoors, in dark pool halls. Except at the very beginning, there's a curious absence of cigarette smoke in these places, perhaps an oversight in production design. Camera 'takes' are rather long at the film's beginning. And that gets the movie off to a slow start.Pool playing is not real conducive to great cinema, as it is not particularly visual. Director Scorsese does his best to make the visuals interesting, through quick editing and camera dissolves, especially in the film's second half. And there's plenty of story conflict between Eddie and Vincent, even though one wonders how Vincent can be so mentally ... dense. Perhaps his 'attitude' is more a character contrivance, to add interest to the relationship between him and Felson.Despite wearing too much makeup, Paul Newman gives a fine performance. By contrast, Tom Cruise, with his big pompadour hairdo, is simply annoying. He struts his stuff, huffs and puffs on cue (pardon the pun), but otherwise lacks any sense of subtlety or refinement in emotional expression. I will credit both Newman and Cruise with skill in playing pool, as they made many of the shots themselves.Overall, Newman's name and the story's connection to 'The Hustler' (1961) are what carry this film. 'The Color Of Money' is a rather dull, slightly depressing movie that's not nearly as good as the 1961 original, but one that will nevertheless appeal both to fans of Newman and to viewers who enjoy the game of pool.",Null,5,10,31 January 2008
21," 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner'
","Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. 'Variable change' is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And 'winner winner, chicken dinner' is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source 'Bringing Down The House' by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, '21' is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in '21' really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.",8,214,310,28 March 2008
Pitch Black," A Film For The Eyes, Not The Brain
","In this sci-fi action flick, a spacecraft full of youthful, photogenic people crash lands on a desert world lorded over by hostile creatures that have an aversion to light. The script does a nice job of allowing the space travelers to change as the plot progresses, or rather for their true selves to emerge, as a result of the alien threat. But we never really get to know the characters in any depth, and I was indifferent to all of them.Lack of depth is noticeable in this film. The premise lacks scientific credibility, and the screenplay has a couple of obvious plot holes. There is no cerebral message or subtext that I could discern; there is nothing to think about or ponder. The film is pure escapist entertainment, with an accent on high quality special effects. Visually, the film strikes me as a cross between 'Alien' and 'The Road Warrior'.'Pitch Black' will appeal to viewers who like fast action sci-fi films that emphasize visuals, not dialogue. The film also will appeal to people who have no need to infer, contemplate, question, analyze, or read between the lines. What you see is what you get.",Null,10,18,30 July 2005
American Psycho," Gleefully Subversive
","Highly satirical in tone, 'American Psycho' punches Wall Street in the gut, and does so better than any other film I have seen about that odious institution. The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate 'mergers and acquisitions' industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick. But in his off-hours he commits blatant acts of violence. Patrick Bateman is a psychotic Gordon Gekko.Yet, the script implies no back-story for Bateman or motivation for his antisocial behavior. Thinly veiled behind the obvious plot line is the film's subversive message. This Wall Street jerk is not a person so much as an analytical construct, an idea, representative of financial violence that lies beneath the veneer of material power and success that Wall Street prides itself on. Because Bateman exhibits overt physical violence, there's no way that viewers can look up to him as a role model like they can theoretically look up to Oliver Stone's Gekko. As such, 'American Psycho' surpasses 'Wall Street' (1987) in thematic potency.The dialogue even says as much. In voice-over, Bateman tells us: 'There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me.' And Patrick's 'confession' at the end is the confession of modern Wall Street.The film's non-script technical quality is quite good. Cinematography, editing, costumes, prod design, art design, sound effects, and acting are all high quality. The semi-classical music in the opening credits provides clever irony. But I didn't care for the 1980s songs, though they are representative of that era.The humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone prevents the film from being perceived as a too heavy-handed cinematic lecture. Instead, the film infers 'black comedy', adroitly mixing the usually discordant genres of horror with social commentary.In the Patrick Bateman character, 'American Psycho' accurately describes the Wall Street mentality of the 1980s. That mentality has become blatantly more intense since then. As such, the film continues to be relevant and probably will remain so for a long time to come.",9,14,19,12 September 2011
North by Northwest," The Adventures Of Mr. Thornhill
","My opinion of this film is mixed. At times the dialogue is clever and amusing. And the final fifteen minutes offer some genuine suspense, together with excellent visual perspective. During this final sequence, the physically risky maneuvers of the main characters, ordinary and vulnerable, contrast thematically with the stone-cold lifelessness of past characters, grand and immortal.But oh my, the trial of having to sit through two hours getting to that last sequence. Highly contrived, the adventure plot is overblown with sequences that defy logic and scatter the location settings in a near-random manner. As such, the plot seems chaotic, disorganized, and unedited. Major sections could have been excised, or reduced in length. I think the film runs about thirty minutes too long.Color cinematography is acceptable for the 1950s. Today, the cinematography looks antiquated and clunky, with day-for-night camera filters in outdoor scenes, and lots of rear-screen projections.As advertising man Roger Thornhill, Cary Grant is clearly miscast, looking way too old for the role. I have no problem with the rest of the casting. And James Mason is always a delight to watch and listen to.There are some memorable visuals in this film, like the crop-dusting sequence. But overall, 'North By Northwest' offers a poor script, until near the end. Hitchcock made some really terrific films in his day. But this is not one of them.",Null,4,6,2 November 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," A Film Of Enduring Value
","They say that time heals all heartache. In the case of the Third Reich, I'm not sure that the old saying is true. Out of respect for the Holocaust victims, and as an important history lesson, there's something to be said for not forgetting the evils of Hitler. Fortunately, we have this great film to help us not forget.'Judgment At Nuremberg' is a dramatization of one of the many real life post WWII Nuremberg trials of high ranking Nazis. Most of the film focuses on the 1948 courtroom trial of four judges who helped to carry out Hitler's decrees. As part of the prosecution's case against the judges, real life, graphic film footage showing the horrors of the death camps engenders a gut level impression that is both powerful and persuasive. The film thus educates viewers in ways that a dry textbook of facts and figures never could.But there's more to the film than the trial. In other parts of Nuremberg we see ordinary Germans trying to get on with their lives as best they can, three years after the war's end, in a bombed out and bleak city. One of these persons is Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the wife of a dead German soldier. In contrast to the harsh and contentious trial, Madame Bertholt's kindness toward the tribunal's lead judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), provides an example of the innocence and decency of ordinary Germans, and thus adds a softer, more contemplative perspective to the ordeal. In these non-courtroom scenes, the melancholy background music and the soft production lighting create a mood of depression and sadness.I find very little to criticize in this three hour film. Perhaps the plot could have been clearer in identifying the legal counsel of three of the four defendants. And maybe in those scenes wherein the four defendants conversed among themselves, the dialogue should have been in German, not English. But these are trivial points. Overall, this is a film that is well written and directed, a film with credible actors giving stellar performances, and most of all, a film that assures preservation of that era's historic significance, with a political and social message that has enduring value.",10,113,146,8 May 2005
No Country for Old Men," Some Interesting Characters
","While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. 'No Country For Old Men' is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.'No Country For Old Men' is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.",9,157,229,13 July 2008
Tigerland," Rebel With A Cause
","American military authority is the enemy for Pvt. Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), a nonconformist trainee who, along with other infantry trainees, endures brutal, sadistic treatment in preparation for combat in Vietnam. Tigerland is a swampy, steamy camp near Fort Polk, Louisiana that is supposed to simulate conditions in Vietnam. The story is set in 1971.The amount and severity of physical and verbal aggression displayed in this film may be a tad overstated. But the point the film is making is that many, if not most, of the young guys drafted into the army in the late 60s and early 70s absolutely did not want, or deserve, to be there.Roland Bozz is one of those young men. He's angry at the war, angry at the army. The army won't release him because they know that's what he wants. If Bozz can't get himself out, the next best thing is to try and get other recruits out. That will be his revenge, his way to fight the system.A fellow trainee shares his background with Bozz, who then tells the trainee: 'I know army regulations the way prisoners know the law. You're a hardship discharge, man, if ever I saw one. Okay. I'll get you out of the army'. Bravo for Roland Bozz, a young rebel with a mission, a cause, trapped like the others by an oppressive, controlling institution.Acting is very, very good. Colin Farrell is terrific, at a time when he, and the rest of the cast, was largely unknown. No need for overpaid A-list actors. The film's acting style trends naturalistic, spontaneous, and emotionally intense. None of the acting seems forced.With a hand-held camera, combined with grainy film stock, and using quick zooms and unexpected cuts, the cinematography and editing convey a documentary look and feel, which results in sequences that are quite realistic. Lighting is mostly natural. Sets are plain and unadorned. Background music is minimal.Much better than I ever expected, 'Tigerland' is a well-made film with an intense, anti-war theme. It's about putting others ahead of one's own selfish interest. That Hollywood largely shunned this low-budget film is all the more reason to see it.",8,25,29,21 January 2010
Man on the Moon," The Unique And Chaotic Andy Kaufman
","Even as an adult, Andy Kaufman had a child-like personality. He liked to play elaborate, childish pranks and hoaxes on his unsuspecting audience. A big part of the plot details some of those pranks. He was also well known for doing a very good impersonation of Elvis. And of course his 'Latka' was a major character in the 1970s sitcom 'Taxi'.Kaufman had a unique outward persona that made him easily recognizable. In 'Man On The Moon', Jim Carrey captures that persona well. Carrey's performance is probably the best element of the film.But there are a couple of problems with the movie. First, too much time is spent on these pranks and hoaxes. Just a little of the nasal and obnoxious 'Tony Clifton' goes a long way. I would have preferred more emphasis on Andy's personal life rather than so much time on his various 'acts', such as Clifton and the TV wrestling bits. Which leads to the second problem.It's true that Kaufman's relationship with his audience was significant. But in this film there are way too many camera shots of the audience. Even worse is their hyped-up expressions. Many of Kaufman's performances are neither funny nor bad; they do not evoke much response of any kind. Yet people in these irksome audiences gush with animation every time Kaufman does so much as move his eyes back and forth or pauses in silence. Audience over-reaction is one strike against the film's Director. Though Kaufman could be humorous, and many people regard him as a comedian, I would not put this film in the comedy genre. Indeed, there's an undercurrent of sadness throughout, owing mostly to Kaufman's death at an early age. The film has a poignant ending.Although somewhat superficial, 'Man On The Moon' is a reasonably interesting biography of an enigmatic entertainer who died too young. I admired Kaufman's uniqueness. And he came along at just the right time, in the late 70s and early 80s, a chaotic time culturally, a perfect historical fit for a chaotic personality.",7,0,0,25 November 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," Visual Grandeur
","Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place.So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash.The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: 'What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?' To which Lawrence responds in two words: 'It's clean.' Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered.Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times.My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with 'Intermission.''Lawrence Of Arabia' was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.",8,5,7,5 June 2013
JFK," Message Film With A Gripping Plot
","Will we ever solve the mysteries of the JFK assassination to everyone's satisfaction? No, I don't think so. LBJ's Warren Commission (WC), with cheer-leading from the mainstream press, tried to sell the public on the Oswald-as-lone-gunman idea. After a brief, national acceptance, the public began to question the WC conclusions. Ever since, the public's collective belief that Oswald acted alone, as measured by opinion polls, has been trending steadily downward.The general impression is that the WC did not set out to find the truth. Instead, they set out to build a case that Oswald acted alone, a man who had long since been silenced by Jack Ruby. The WC built their lone-gunman case by cherry-picking those bits of information that would fit their predetermined conclusions. But an excess of bizarre coincidences, torturous logic, and massive inconsistencies of every sort in every facet of this multifaceted case overwhelm officialdom's weak arguments, and make the mainstream press look sheepishly beholden to Washington insiders.The script's arguments for a conspiracy are compelling. Unfortunately, Stone's script tells the story from Jim Garrison's POV. Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was tenuous, at best. Result: officialdom and the press ... pounce. That Shaw may not have had a proved link to the assassination, however, does not in any way, plug up the massive holes in the conclusions of the Warren Commission. So a conspiracy is still a possibility, sans Garrison's theories. As a result, we're back where we started, with a silly lone-gunman theory, and some vague 'conspiracy'. What a mess!As cinema, Stone's film is brilliant. The plot is gripping, riveting, mesmerizing. With an all-star cast, there's not a weak link in the bunch. Lighting is stylized and at times 1940's noirish. The dignified and profound musical score by John Williams enhances a tone of mystery and intrigue.Editing is terrific. An enormous amount of information is telegraphed in the well-over three-hour production, information that could not have been included without split second cuts. As a result, the film's pace oscillates nicely between casual and rapid-fire.A message film that persuasively demolishes the WC conclusions yet suffers from a too-literal belief in the Jim Garrison narrative, leaves us with a lot to think about. To a person with an open mind, the 'mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma', as David Ferrie called it, is just as deep, just as profound now as it was fifty years ago. It probably always will remain such ... the stuff of legend.",9,3,7,4 April 2015
Behind The Candelabra," HBO Is The Hero Here
","Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. 'Behind The Candelabra' gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, 'blond Adonis' Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.Aside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot's first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.This film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee's elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace's mannerisms and image are so well known.Lavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story's credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace's on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.I was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders.",8,14,17,9 August 2014
Velvet Goldmine," There's A Story Here Somewhere
","As music video (rock, glitter, glam,or whatever), parts of it might work. As a full-length feature film, none of it works. A film requires a story. There might be one here, but I couldn't find it.Even a visual fantasy needs some kind of structure, if for no other reason than to propel the fantasy forward. But this 'film' seems to have multiple beginnings, a chaotic, nonsensical middle, and a non-resolution. Scenes are put together apparently in random order. Hey mister director guy, help us out here. Is this someone's idea of an inside joke? If so, I didn't find it amusing.None of the characters are worth caring about. They're all cardboard cutout dolls, stick-figure mannequins, two-dimensional caricatures. Self-proclaimed as artists, they're more flimflam than paragon. Maybe that's the point.The underlying concept is intriguing. A music star fakes his own death. What ever became of him? And so, the Christian Bale character goes on a Citizen Kane journey, of sorts. But all that glittery glam, or glam-glitter, gets in the way. We're lost in a phantasmagoria of colorfully bizarre images. Along the way we come to the conclusion that the 'star' is so shallow, so immature, so unlikeable we lose interest in him and his destiny. The only message I got out of this cinematic mess was that mod music audiences are duped into thinking that image is reality. But that's hardly original. And I doubt that was the director's intent.Aimed at a pubescent crowd, 'Velvet Goldmine' is hardly more than a flashy, moment-by-moment distraction. Lots of films, perhaps most, can deliver a higher quality, more mature form of distraction because they tell a coherent story that requires an attention span of greater than two microseconds.",2,6,12,8 November 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," The Boys In The Bank
","'The medium is the message', said media critic Marshall McLuhan in 1964. The presence of cameras, news equipment, and news reporters changes an event which may, as a result, take on the characteristics of a circus. Participants in the event get their 'fifteen minutes of fame'. Viewers get to gawk at reality and be entertained, no matter how tragic the event.An in-progress robbery turned media circus is the main theme of this true-life story about a Brooklyn man who, with an accomplice, tries to rob a bank. The man's name is Sonny. He's a guy with a heart, an interesting twist to our stereotyped image of bank robbers. Sonny's reason for the holdup would make for an ironic plot point in the film 'The Boys In The Band' (1970).But from the get-go, Sonny's plans unravel quickly. A third accomplice chickens out at the last minute, embarrassing Sonny in the presence of the bank hostages. The amount of money in the vault is far less than expected. Some of the women hostages need to use the restroom, a development that our kindhearted criminal can't ignore. And an inquisitive storekeeper across the street gets suspicious. Soon, cops surround the bank. And what Sonny had envisioned as a simple easy-in, easy-out holdup evolves into an hour-after-hour ordeal, involving negotiations with the police.'Dog Day Afternoon' is alternately funny and sad. The script is rather talky. Some of the dialogue is improvised, which adds realism. Al Pacino, as Sonny, gives a fine performance. But he's rather nasal, and a little of his shrill ranting with the hostages and cops goes a long way.The film has no score. It opens with an Elton John song, presumably coming from Sonny's car radio. Color cinematography is fine. Most of the lighting is natural.I do think the film is about twenty minutes too long. After a while, those hours inside the bank become as tedious for viewers as for the hostages. This is a film that can leave you exhausted.The circumstances of this story are so outrageous that they would have been deemed too silly had they originated in the mind of a Hollywood scriptwriter. Viewers would not have taken the film seriously. But the events did actually happen, and for a reason that only someone as complex, driven, compulsive, and altruistic as Sonny could have dreamed up.",7,2,3,21 June 2009
The Game," Puppet On A String
","Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, and very unlikeable, businessman who has every material comfort and pleasure money can buy. So, his younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gives Nicholas an unusual gift for his 48th birthday: an invitation to play an elaborate and mysterious 'game', from a mysterious corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).It's an intriguing film concept; a cold-blooded corporate exec submits to a proposition that forces him to function as a puppet on a string. We can imagine all sorts of humiliating challenges that this reptilian man must confront, what great payback.Unfortunately, although it's a great concept, the story is awful. Nicholas' challenges are too physical to be believable. Most of the middle Act consists of repetitive encounters that cause Nicholas physical pain and/or major financial and logistical trouble. Over and over we see him confront ludicrous obstacles that are so contrived and improbable as to be silly. The problem here is that the script is written as a souped-up action movie, evidently to appeal to kids. The film presents all of this revved-up action well. But, given that Nicholas does not invoke the supernatural or super human skills, the film's plot is totally inconsistent with reality. Plot holes are everywhere.The film would have been far better with challenges that are more cerebral, more realistic. But, of course, that would have bored the intended audience. As is, 'The Game' comes across as an animated cartoon, aimed at youngsters.The film's cinematography, acting, and production design are fine. I am disappointed that Michael Douglas would agree to play the lead role in a film wherein the story is so implausible, so 'cartoonish'.",Null,5,11,1 September 2007
Meet Joe Black," Reflective And Philosophical
","For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But 'Meet Joe Black' is anything but 'superficial', and 'teen comedy' does not describe this movie at all.Set in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter 'Joe Black' (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda.This is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul.For viewers who liked 'The Sixth Sense', another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend 'Meet Joe Black' most highly.",8,140,181,16 January 2005
La Grande Illusion," Its Historical Significance Is No Illusion
","Franklin Roosevelt said of it: 'Everyone who believes in democracy should see this film'. Mussolini banned it in Italy, and Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda banned it in Nazi Germany. The film vanished during WWII, and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946, but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.The Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist, anti-war, theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914, during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp, specifically for officers. After several escape attempts, the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle, run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.Unlike other war movies, 'La Grande Illusion' shows no actual combat, and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. Writer/Director Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners, despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating, and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest, but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers, even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war; it's just their 'duty', when called on.In most of the film, scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end, outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end, I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments, like a harmonica or a flute. Of course, given the time period and considering the setting, such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries, that we take for granted, is striking. The film's B&W cinematography accentuates the drab environment.The story can be a bit confusing in the first half, because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom. The plot is easier to follow in the second half.The film's acting is credible. I especially liked the performance of von Stroheim, all decked out in that imposing uniform, that monocle, and with that stiff bearing.'La Grande Illusion' is an unusual 'war' film, one that had real significance during WWII. For this reason alone, it deserves to be seen.",9,35,43,12 October 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," More Educational Than Entertaining
","As a semi-documentary, this film does a great job. Back in the 1950s American journalists tackled serious issues with integrity and courage. Edward R. Murrow exemplified that level of journalistic quality, as he clashed with powerful U.S. Senator Joe McCarthy, a fanatical right-wing conservative who alleged that certain prominent Americans were allied with Communism. McCarthy's accusations not only were unfounded, but also led to a general atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Probably more than anyone else, Murrow exposed McCarthy and his tactics, and in so doing showed that television journalists could serve a useful public function by questioning Washington politicians.As much as anything Clooney's film reminds us, by inference, that today's television 'news' is shallow, flippant, dishonest, and very, very self-serving. In effect, there is no Edward R. Murrow among today's myriad 'news' people.The cinematic package of 'Good Night, and Good Luck' is high quality, but scholastic. The film's pace is very slow. There are several long speeches. The setting is entirely indoors giving a claustrophobic feel to the film, accentuated by close-up shots. David Strathairn does a terrific job in the role of Murrow.The film's B&W cinematography is great but, along with all the cigarette smoke, the serious dialogue, and the jazzy score, contributes to a downbeat, depressing tone. Murrow, himself, comes across as a somber, studious, articulate man who smokes heavily and rarely smiles.As educational as this film is, it is not particularly entertaining. A lot of viewers are going to be bored. The film is low-key, dreary and lacks the special effects, the humor, and the various cinematic gimmicks that contemporary viewers have come to expect from modern films.Your opinion of this film will depend heavily on whether your purpose in watching is to learn something or to be entertained. Some films can do both. 'Good Night, and Good Luck' excels mostly as education.",Null,0,0,15 April 2006
Mulholland Drive," Oh, About That Muddled Meaning
","A long string of mostly indifferent images wedded to some glib chatter is what comes to mind when I think about this pointless film from the same director who brought us the sci-fi turkey called 'Dune' (1984). To be fair, there are a few artistic images in 'Mulholland Dr.' The sequence at the Silencio Club I seem to recall was interesting in a surreal sort of way. But that was about it.Apparently, Lynch is trying to make a film about filmdom. But the convoluted plot leads us down a garden path that splinters into a muddled maze of plot twists that confuse viewers as to the film's 'meaning'. I have no problem with film puzzles wherein the solutions are vague or open-ended. But a film whose puzzle is puzzling is a different matter.The problem here is the screenplay. Any newbie writer with a head full of jumbled ideas can write an inane story, and then have his or her stooge proclaim it to be a masterpiece because it is unintelligible. But for an industry professional, the writing standards need to be a little higher.In 'Mulholland Dr.' I sense a bored or lazy professional, resting on his dubious laurels, unwilling to exert the requisite cerebral effort to tell a story that is both original and has purpose. Coated in superficial gloss, the film is empty, senseless, and self-indulgent. It is also, by logical extension, very, very pretentious. We can argue until the cows come home about a film's 'meaning'. But I, for one, am not going to waste my time or my brain on behalf of a lazy writer.",Null,3,6,11 January 2006
The Imitation Game," The Lonely Genius
","A cursory read of Alan Turing's biography proves that the basic points of this film are factual. That some details have been tinkered with for cinematic appeal is possible. Turing was historically significant because he built a computer that broke the Nazi code, which helped win WWII. The script blends these events with Turing's personal life.Despite his genius brain, Turing nevertheless suffered as a gay man in a homophobic era, which brought loneliness and run-ins with the cops. With acquaintances he could be socially awkward, eccentric, arrogant, and humorously quirky.The script's non-linear structure makes for difficult viewing at times. Constant flashbacks to, and returns from, three different eras in Turing's life render unnecessary confusion. The first half is a bit boring, but drama picks up in the second half. The script conveys a realistic view of Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Most of the supporting characters come across as a bit nebulous.Appropriate for the historical era, the film uses 35mm format wherein grain structure is obvious. In Turing's later years, desaturated colors dominate, to convey a gray, sad tone; brighter colors and more contrast highlight his younger years. B&W archival clips show actual WWII scenes. Editing and production design compliment the cinematography. The nondescript piano score is okay but too loud in some scenes. Overall casting and acting are acceptable; Cumberbatch gives a credible performance.Significant historical content and release dates suggest that the producers intended for 'The Imitation Game' to be Oscar bait. The film is a recent addition to a list of culturally relevant films meant to confer on Hollywood a sense of legitimacy. Fine film aside, Hollywood's motives here reek of self-congratulatory prestige.",6,2,2,24 May 2016
The Evil Dead," Cabin In The Woods
","The premise is simple. Five generic college students arrive at an inconspicuous cabin in the woods for a few days of vacation. Unbeknownst to them, the cabin and the surrounding woods are home to evil beings that are dormant ... that is, until the kids find an old book and tape recorder filled with zombie gibberish. The story is set mostly during one night. Dense fog obscures one's vision outside the cabin.The first-half plot isn't bad. The camera takes the POV of unseen entities, darting here and there. And the kids spend a lot of time exploring the cabin and its cellar, waiting and listening, as eerie sounds put them on guard that something isn't quite right. The music, too, adds to the sinister atmosphere.But if the first half conveys a pleasantly spooky atmosphere because of what we do not see, the second half's plot plummets to stupidity because of what we do see. No longer hidden, the evil makes itself visible, in the form of nightmarish images and gratuitous gore. The film thus loses its suspense and mystery.The second-half plot trends repetitive as the same fate befalls one kid after another. And the gore continues to escalate. Nearing the film's merciful end, I started getting a headache, as the gore got progressively more annoying.The film has no thematic depth. And since the underlying premise presumes a supernatural explanation, we can't apply logic to any story element. Acting is largely irrelevant. The credibility of the film thus lies mostly in sound effects and special effects, which are nicely crafted but over-used. I would have enjoyed the film more if the zombies, or whatever they're called, had been less visible and if the gore factor had been hugely reduced.",5,3,8,5 April 2015
Jurassic World," Those Lovable Dinosaurs
","It's more tolerable than most blockbuster films, but only because the dinosaurs, however digital, still make effective characters. Not so with the humans who come across as stereotyped and annoying. I didn't know some of the human characters' names until the end credits. The human cast probably exceeds a thousand. Then there are at least a billion extras, nameless human chumps eager to tell their grandchildren they were once in a Spielberg movie.And though not directed by him, this is, after all, a Steven Spielberg movie. That's all you really need to know, as in: action is more important than characters, plot, dialogue, casting, or acting. But, hey, the production design is good. And visual effects are really spectacular. Mostly, the film aims to please a 12 to 24 year old, easily wowed, viewer demographic.Of all the irritations here, which include a predictable Disney-style plot, none is more annoying than the loud background music. It's a manipulative and insulting device, to remind us that the film aims to be epic in scope and costly in budget. Which is made worse by the film's run-time. At least 15 to 20 minutes could have been shaved off, mostly in the second half repetitive action.But the dinos are still lovable. Of course, that's cinematic manipulation, too, to get us to care for and relate to these nonexistent creatures. Ever since I watched 'Walking With Dinosaurs', I have enjoyed researching these prehistoric beings. 'Jurassic World', with all its Steven Spielberg cinematic faults, gives us plenty of them, and for me that makes this blockbuster at least tolerable.",5,3,4,31 December 2016
Quiz Show," The Medium Is The Message
","Media critic Marshall McLuhan coined the famous adage 'the medium is the message' nearly half a century ago. The idea is that powerful people can use technology selfishly to manipulate mass human behavior. And so, Redford's 'Quiz Show' gives us a real life example of McLuhan's insight by showing how, in the 1950s, corporate TV sponsors sought to increase the number of viewers by rigging game shows. The boob tube was the 'medium' used to transmit bogus entertainment that camouflaged the real 'message', namely that TV sponsors used deception to attract a larger audience, thereby increasing product sales potential. McLuhan's insight was, and still is ... potent.In no uncertain terms, Redford's film renders a scathing indictment of television 'entertainment' in the 1950s. What shocked me was the extent of viewer gullibility in those days. But the film's story is relevant now because it shows that today's unethical TV programming has a historic precedent. Current game shows may not be rigged. But, the lack of ethics has invaded shows that are more important, like news and current events, with gullible viewers assuming that what they see and hear represents the absolute truth with no hidden agenda.While the film's theme is potent, its cinematic package is less so. For one thing, the film is too long. Some scenes could have been edited out, especially home life of the main characters, and the film's first three minutes.Casting and performances are generally good. I especially liked Paul Scofield as the erudite professor. And Allan Rich was perfect as executive Robert Kintner. But Rob Morrow's Boston accent seemed unnatural and forced. And some of the main characters were annoying, like Herb Stempel, Dan Enright, and Al Freedman. The film's production design was impressively lavish, almost to the point of looking too slick. Cinematography was acceptable, but for such a big budget film I could have wished for more photographic pizazz.'Quiz Show' is best considered as a cinematic study of a culturally significant set of historic events. One should remember, however, that film is a medium, too. If the viewer keeps in mind that this film is an interpretation of history, not history itself, then he or she will be more discerning, and be less prone to gullibility.",Null,1,4,7 May 2006
Into the Wild," Mr. Penn's Grand Opus
","Deeply thematic, the story of a young man's wilderness experience is rendered compelling because the events really happened. Non-fiction is usually more potent than contrived fiction. And in this case the story's climax packs quite a dramatic punch. Mostly as a result of how the story ends, viewers are bound to come away with strong opinions about the idealistic protagonist, Chris McCandless, and his quest for truth. As such, 'Into The Wild' works, but only because the real life events force you to think.That said, it's been quite some time since I have endured a movie wherein the film direction was so annoying. You would think that Director Sean Penn would fashion a low-key, restrained film in sync with McCandless' disdain for money and showy materialism. No such luck.Penn constructs a two and a half hour grand opus, bombastic in tone and smug in its philosophical righteousness. The main character is portrayed as some modern day spiritual guru endowed with miraculous insight. Penn hangs on every word the guru says. The film's plot structure is unnecessarily convoluted as if to suggest profundity. Camera work is gimmicky and flashy. And the soundtrack is overbearing. In short, McCandless' genuinely moving real life story provides the opportunistic Penn with a chance to display his flair for showmanship.With all that ostentation and excess, the film screams out for recognition. It's as if Sean Penn is campaigning for every cinematic award in the books. I would thus argue that 'Into The Wild' is not so much about Chris McCandless as it is about ... Sean Penn.I normally like outdoor adventure stories and films based on real life events. But I found this film something of an ordeal to sit through. The basic story is quite compelling. And much of the film's scenery is gorgeous. Both casting and acting are quite acceptable, especially the performance of the always reliable Hal Holbrook. But the film's direction is so distracting in a tacitly self-congratulatory way, I don't think I could sit through it again.",Null,15,28,16 April 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Cosmic Art
","Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of '2001: A Space Odyssey', a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We 'see' our primordial past, and we 'infer' a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.'2001 ... ' is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word 'masterpiece' to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa', or Vincent Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night'.",10,361,602,6 February 2005
Saw," Budget Cinema
","If you've ever wanted to write a screenplay, 'Saw' is a good film to study, because of its financial profile. The film was made on a budget of about $1 million, super cheap in today's feature film market. Producers are more apt to take a new screenwriter's work seriously, if the writer can write a script that, when produced, doesn't break the bank.Despite the cheap production costs of 'Saw', it earned over $100 million, worldwide, resulting in a huge ROI, to the delight, I am sure, of the film's financial backers. Cost was kept low as a result of, among other things: single location shooting, an eighteen day completion schedule, and minimal speaking roles. Even with these restrictions, the film still managed to include some elements that normally would be expensive, such as: gunfire, stunts, and a child actor.Of course, the film's popularity, as expressed in its revenue, does not necessarily equate to film quality. Indeed, I would argue that, relative to the quality of other modern films, 'Saw' is no better than average, and well below average when compared to older, classic films. The original concept of 'Saw' is intriguing. And the film does provide some fairly good tension, especially at the beginning. But, beyond the concept, the plot unravels into a mass of laughable predicaments and character reactions.My biggest complaint is the script. The plot is hopelessly illogical. Characters say and do things that make sense only in the context of a screenwriter trying to maximize screenplay conflict. There's a complete disconnect from reality. Further, the film's main characters are not well defined. It's hard to care about them, if we don't know much about them. Finally, from the use of flashbacks, to dialogue, to acting, to production design and costumes, the film has an amateurish quality to it. You get the feeling it was put together by kids just out of film school.In summary, this film is useful to new screenwriters, as a tool to gauge those elements that can be included in a story, at a bargain-basement cost. The flip side is that while you may be able to produce a profitable film, there's no guarantee that it will have qualitative merit.",Null,0,1,20 December 2005
Snowden," Riveting
","Oliver Stone knows how to make good movies. And 'Snowden' is a good movie. From start to finish the film suggests a political thriller, comparable to 'All The President's Men'. With an overall tone of suspense and intrigue, the underlying theme here expresses the clash between citizen privacy and government spying by means of technology in the name of national security.Of course Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 'just' a 29 year old computer geek who wears casual clothes and a backpack. How could he be a threat to the government? Well, in addition to being smart and having a conscience he happens to be in a position that allows access to sensitive computer information. He doesn't like what he sees; and he takes action.Ed Snowden comes across as innocent, naÃ¯ve, and introverted. His girlfriend has an influence on him, and gradually changes his political point of view in a way that motivates his extreme actions.The script is well written except for the continual use of flashbacks, which would normally render a jerky plot. Yet, the editing is so polished that the plot flows fairly well despite the flashbacks. Background music generally is somber and serious. Editing is terrific. Casting and acting are fine. At first I had qualms about the casting of Gordon-Levitt, based on movies of his I have seen. But here he gives a surprisingly effective performance in the title role.Cinematography is acceptable, but I could have wished for more realistic production design. Computer control rooms and panels look a bit too futuristic in a Star Wars sense, for American government facilities.'Snowden' conveys a mood of justified paranoia. It reminds me of the film 'Silkwood', wherein an ordinary person takes on a powerful institution. This underlying theme is almost always potent in the right directorial hands. Consistent with his past films, Oliver Stone has made a riveting, timely, and potent film.",9,1,2,21 June 2017
From Hell," From Hollywood
","An account of the Jack the Ripper case of 1888, 'From Hell' is not a credible film for true crime buffs. The film's script contains too many major inaccuracies, and its conclusions are preposterous. Aside from false presentation of various real people, including Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), the film proceeds to 'solve' the case with a solution that has been discredited for decades. Indeed, among serious 'ripperologists', there still is no consensus on who Jack the Ripper was. A recently published book lists no fewer than 27 possible suspects, the surnames of which include: Druitt, Ostrog, Chapman, Cohen, Sickert, Gibson, Dodgson, Deeming, Thompson, and Williams.As a fictional whodunit, with suitable red herrings, the film offers a little more, but it still contains problems. Characters are not adequately defined by name early on. The Abberline / Sergeant Godley relationship is a formulaic continuation of the Holmes / Watson relationship. And the film identifies the killer too soon; after which, the plot trends anticlimactic.This film can be described most accurately as a fictional period piece thriller, with an emphasis on the lives of poor London prostitutes, known as 'unfortunates', a social class counterpoint to the rich and privileged. In this context the story's theme would pertain to the inherent hypocrisy of the rich, amid strict, 19th century Victorian values.Visually, the film looks good, as we would expect for a big-budget Hollywood production. Sets and period costumes seem realistic. Highly saturated colors convey a dingy, sooty London, again probably accurate. But ambient sounds are unrealistic. And the background music is horrible. Not only is it too loud and manipulative, it's too synthesized and modern. It's the kind of music we would expect in some modern dark zombie movie. Casting is acceptable. Robbie Coltrane gives a fine performance as Sergeant Godley. But Depp seems bored.Melodramatic in tone, 'From Hell' offers viewers an interesting, and reasonably accurate, interpretation of prostitutes and their environment in London's Whitechapel district of the late 19th century. But as a viable, authoritative account of Jack the Ripper and his crimes, the film, typical of Hollywood, cannot be taken seriously.",Null,3,5,31 March 2012
Mystic River," Oh What Dreary Lives
","Three young boys in Boston grow up to live in the same general neighborhood. As adults their lives go in different directions, but a murder reunites them, and causes them to reflect on a shared childhood incident important in the life journey of each of the three men. It's not a bad premise for a film. But as adults, the characters and their wives are doleful, downtrodden, grungy, and generally not very interesting. Their environment is drab. The film contains little humor. And the pacing is very slow.'Mystic River' tries to be a character study of the three men, and a whodunit murder mystery, concurrently. But the film is overly wrought with back-story details about the characters. And the plot blends these details into the murder mystery, which results in a story that is muddled. The solution to the murder mystery is both implausible and contrived. The film's story is so convoluted that it suggests that the writer couldn't decide what to focus on, or what to cut out.The film's ending provides some interesting ironies, and has a lot to say about the issue of fate. But with a runtime of well over two hours, and all that tedious detail, the film's theme tends to get lost in the meandering and unnecessarily complex plot. It's a common problem in today's big-budget Hollywood productions.Some of the viewers who rate 'Mystic River' so highly may be basing their evaluations on hype, generated from the big name cast, Eastwood as Director, and promotional considerations. The inherent merits, and demerits, of this film suggest to me that it is mediocre, at best.",Null,2,4,11 October 2006
Rosemary's Baby," A Veneer Of Normalcy
","It starts off like one of those 1950's Doris Day movies. Young, idealistic Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and new hubby Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a Manhattan apartment building called the 'Bramford'. Throughout most of the film we, as viewers, see and hear what innocent Rosemary sees and hears. There's a veneer of normalcy at the Bramford that belies what's really going on, behind our backs. It's the script's POV, therefore, that makes this film so chilling.At the Bramford, which has quite a colorful history, you can hear through the walls. And, as Rosemary and we viewers soon find out, strange people lurk in other parts of the building. The strangest of all are Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), superficially cordial, but a bit too inquisitive. Roman is retired. His wife, Minnie, wears tons of makeup and pawnshop jewelry, and gushes with praise for herbal cures, especially something called tannis-root. And Minnie's friend Laura-Louise (Patsy Kelly) wears thick glasses that make her eyes seem to bulge, and she talks with a strangely deep voice.'Rosemary's Baby' is one of the great thrillers of all time. Given the underlying subject matter, can you imagine how this film must have come across to viewers in 1968? The strength of the film is the script, which through its plot and dialogue implies and suggests. Not until near the end do we, like Rosemary, find out the presumed truth. Suspense increases toward the end as Rosemary ventures into the inner sanctum of the Bramford.The film's acting is great, and reinforces the strong script. I particularly liked Ruth Gordon, with her delightfully eccentric behavior and mannerisms. Production design and especially costumes are lavish and colorful. Clothes and hairstyles, as you would expect, are very 1960ish. Visual effects are minimal, and are used to enhance the story, not be the story.Given the film's POV, the story is rather subjective. Its interpretation is based on Rosemary's perceptions, images, and fears. One could explain that Rosemary suffers from delusions. Or, alternately, one could explain that what happens is real. It's all in the interpretation. Either way, it's a great movie. It holds up well, forty years later, a tribute to its writer and director, Roman Polanski.",9,83,96,25 November 2007
Burlesque," LA Cabaret
","At least it's got Cher, and the iconic 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'. There isn't much else to see or listen to. Annoyingly unoriginal story about an ambitious, small town Iowa girl named Ali (Christina Aguilera), who leaves the slow lane for the fast lights and glitter of L.A.There, she too easily lands a job at a nightclub overseen by Tess (Cher). The club features small tables and a stage whereupon mini-clad young ladies dance, lip-sync to the music, and pose evocatively for mostly male patrons. Ali gets her chance to replace the lead performer. Along the way, various characters and incidents intersperse the club's stage numbers to keep the contrived plot moving along.You get the feeling that the entire script was written for Aguilera. Yes, she can sing, if by singing you mean yelling out lyrics attached to modern rap beats, nominally called 'music', devoid of melody or substantive meaning. Aguilera specializes in loudness. The stage numbers start out fine, before Aguilera horns in, but then deteriorate. The final stage number reeks of cringe inducing, vapid noise.Further, Aguilera is miscast. She looks too little-girl innocent in the first half; in the second, with all that garish makeup and posing, she looks horribly fake. Cher is better cast and I like her backstage presence. Performances are okay. Indoor lighting looks convincing. But the stage seems to change size; in one scene, it looks small, in another, overwhelming.I would have preferred a more unpredictable plot, more emphasis on Cher's character, a different actor for the Ali character, and stage numbers that didn't sound like they came from the portfolio of Justin Bieber. Still, the presence of Cher elevates 'Burlesque' to borderline entertaining. It's worth a one-time watch.",5,0,1,2 June 2016
Jaws," It's A Kid's Movie
","The film has its moments of tension, like when Brody (Roy Scheider) feeds fish into the ocean and, as he is chatting, quite unexpectedly the head of a giant shark pops up out of the water next to him. 'You're going to need a bigger boat', Brody then ominously warns Quint (Robert Shaw), skipper of the rickety old fishing boat they're in. This sequence shows up in the second half, where most of the film's tension is. And the cinematography in this second half is quite good.But overall 'Jaws' is a silly, made-for-kids adventure that is not remotely plausible. The shark keeps coming back to the crew's boat, as if the shark is out for revenge. Referring to the shark, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the third of three crew members, says: 'he's chasing us; I don't believe it.' No, I don't believe it either. Natural predators are not capable of revenge.Of course, to advance the plot and keep the audience engaged, the unlikable and stupid three-man crew does all the wrong things. On-board chaos results. But the film's shallow (pardon the pun) premise and plot sells the popcorn, no 'deep' themes needed.The story setup is way too long. Lots of talky dialogue, crowds of beached whales (or rather sunbathers), a parade, and a greedy mayor who is more of a villain than the shark render a boring first half. Director Spielberg could have used the shark to chop off most of the script's first half.'Jaws' is a big budget Hollywood production with some tension out on the open waters. And it has some good underwater footage. But a too simplistic premise, precious little subtext, vapid setup, and unlikable, overwrought characters sink the film into the dregs, the production appeal veering sharply toward viewers pacified by frothy, Disney-ish cheese.",3,14,42,11 May 2012
Carrie," At Seventeen
","Living every high school kid's worst nightmare, homely Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) knows a thing or two about rejection, about adolescent trauma. Carrie is the personification of the haunting lyrics in Janis Ian's classic song 'At Seventeen', popular at the same time as this film. 'To those of us who knew the pain of valentines that never came', words that convey a deeply felt theme of those awkward teenage years, a theme that is emotional and potentially scarring for life.Unlike the lack of recourse in the song lyrics, however, Carrie has a secret weapon, special powers reserved for her tormentors. But in using these powers, she morphs into a kind of female Darth Vader, slaying not just the bad and the ugly, but the good, too. It's this wielding of 'supernatural' powers that puts the film in the horror genre, and which likewise, turns me off.For my taste, everything about this production is too over-the-top: the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the acting. Using extreme lighting and camera angles, the visuals are so souped-up and Gothic as to imply some kind of grand opera. Exaggeration is the hallmark of this film. If it is meant as satire, I didn't find any of it funny.Playing the title role, Sissy Spacek carries 'Carrie'. Any other actress in the role probably would have doomed the film, its deep theme notwithstanding. Her facial expressions with those buggy eyes, and her overall body language, especially during the fright night prom sequence, render indelible visuals.One of the more respected horror films, 'Carrie' gets points from me for its deeply felt theme and for the performance of Sissy Spacek. Otherwise, the film, like others in its genre, lacks any degree of subtlety or realism, and therefore does not interest me, beyond general curiosity.",Null,1,2,2 December 2009
The Queen," 'Let's Keep In Touch'; 'Yes, Let's'
","The film plots the response of the British royal family to the death of Princess Diana in a car accident in 1997. Tension focuses on the idea that, in contrast to the general public, the Royals didn't much care for Diana. In one scene, Prime Minister Blair (Michael Sheen), in tune with the public's mood, talks on the phone with the Queen; they're discussing how the monarchy should respond to Diana's death. After a tense and difficult conversation, Blair concludes by saying: 'let's keep in touch'. To which the Queen, in an icy voice, responds curtly: 'Yes, let's', then hangs up. 'The Queen' is a good movie.In the film, the Queen (Helen Mirren) comes across as dignified, disciplined, confident, unemotional but brooding, perceptive, stoic, and fond of protocol and tradition. Blair comes across as informal, perceptive, jovial, and easy to relate to. Differences in their personalities are blatant and obvious.In addition to a delicate script that zips along at a good clip, the film's production design is terrific. Though palace interiors are probably tacky in comparison to what the real British palaces must look like, the film crew does a fine job with the budget they had to work with. Ditto the credible costumes. Cinematography is fine. Casting is ideal.A couple of concerns keep the film from being really great. There's a bit too much screen time spent on the 'stag' hunt in the North. And in those scenes, I wouldn't have thought that the Queen actually drives a car herself, or wears a scarf. And second, and more important, you get the feeling that the film was made in direct response to the death of Diana; otherwise, the film would never have been made. If that's true, then it's Diana who is the real story here, and the title is thus a tad disingenuous.Despite my problem with the film's reason for being, 'The Queen' is a fascinating drama. Helen Mirren's understated performance is wonderful, and boosts the overall quality tremendously. It's a film well worth watching.",8,0,1,11 December 2017
Vanilla Sky," Vanilla Mush
","This is another one of those films about the human mind and the content therein ... memories, dreams, emotions, perceptions, what is real and what is not. Hollywood has been there before, many times. In 'Vanilla Sky' the setting is modern day New York City. The main character is David Aames, a smug, self-satisfied, wealthy playboy who is heir to a publishing empire. He's a man who has it all, until an unfortunate event changes him forever.The best approach to this film is to go with the flow, and not try to analyze it too much. The story gets complicated and confusing. The narrative jumps back and forth. There are many flashbacks. Interpretations vary as to the film's 'meaning'. And therein lies my main problem with the story. When filmmakers try to cover too much philosophical ground, and go deep into the human psyche, the end result is usually ... mush. This film would have been better if the screenplay had focused on one or two philosophical points only. As is, the film's complex subject matter and disjointed structure convey not insight but confusion.The screenplay aside, other technical components run the gamut from good to awful. Cinematography is probably the strongest element of the film, and includes some creative camera shots of Manhattan. Special effects are effective, and without being intrusive. And production design is impressive. On the other hand, the film's editing contributes to a confused plot. And the background music is very, very weak. As to the acting, well, I don't even want to talk about it ...Compared to other contemporary films, 'Vanilla Sky' is neither better nor worse, but about average. Seeing it once is probably enough.",Null,11,21,8 October 2005
Tombstone," Right Off The Hollywood Assembly Line
","Muddled story about gunslingers in 1879 Tombstone, boom town of the Old West. Too many speaking parts and a lack of character focus make a mess of the plot. Cast extras number in the hundreds if not thousands. This is a big-budget Hollywood production, bombastic in tone, with lots of violent action, and not much depth.The film's casting is generally atrocious. Kurt Russell, complete with ugly mustache, looks too young to play a retired Wyatt Earp. Powers Boothe, who was quite good as preacher Jim Jones, is not convincing in a story set in the nineteenth century. The cast even includes old-man Sam Elliott, a has-been actor from the 1970s. And the women, cast mostly as ornaments, make no significant impression.Despite being too young to play Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer gives a fine performance as the alcoholic but eloquently spoken Doc. Unlike other actors who phone in their performances, Kilmer at least tries to imbue his character with some uniqueness.Wyatt Earp yearns for some peace and quiet amid retirement. Of course, things don't work out that way, as a gang of thugs invokes Earp's wrath. Lots of shoot-em-ups initiated by scowling villains who, in stereotyped fashion, have no sense of humor. Even the dialogue is clichéd. Costumes are way over done, and feature black suits and capes, Hollywood stylish in the 1990s.Cinematography features an unfortunate widescreen projection that leaves lots of black space above and below the images. Some of the dusk scenes are evocative, with human silhouettes set against an orange sunset. Most of the film looks like it was shot on studio sets and back-lots. The film's thundering score is overbearing and manipulative, totally in keeping with a film that is in-your-face blunt. Sound effects are needlessly exaggerated.There's nothing subtle about 'Tombstone'. Except for Doc Holliday, there's no depth to the characters. And there's no depth at all to the contrived story. This is a film that's benefited from lots of marketing and a big-name cast. Like most Hollywood assembly-line films, the effect of 'Tombstone' is momentary. It will leave no lasting impression.",3,22,42,8 June 2010
Blade Runner," What A Great Film Concept
","Extraterrestrial robots return to earth in search of their 'maker', in an effort to extend their preset four-year life span. Lots to think about and ponder. Can robots achieve self-awareness? Are humans merely self-aware robots? Are thoughts and feelings programmable?But 'Blade Runner', to me, is only partially satisfying. So much of the film, which is generally fast paced, is saturated with unnecessary objects and images that are almost constantly in motion. All of which translates into a kaleidoscope of hubbub and visual overload that I found irritating. Also, the violence, especially in the Rutger Hauer character, is off-putting. Given the film's clever premise, I would have thought the screenwriters could have devised a more futuristic way to express conflict.On the other hand, the film does a good job of describing a future that is truly bleak. In the year 2019, the rich and powerful have fled earth, leaving only the poor and oppressed to endure a post-apocalyptic urban wasteland of gritty neon, dense atmospheric smog, and constant rain. The film's noirish lighting, combined with its cultural ambiguity, and strange sound effects (especially the use of echoes), effectively convey a mood of despair and helplessness. And the music by Vangelis is both beautiful and chilling, and adds to the overall bleakness.'Blade Runner' is based on a really good premise. And some of the dialogue is fairly profound. But the over emphasis on special effects, cinematography, and sets dilutes the film's philosophical import. While most viewers probably prefer the razzle-dazzle visuals, I would have preferred some restraint in production, with a corresponding expansion of the implications inherent in the underlying concept.",Null,3,6,27 February 2005
The Sixth Sense," A Film For Thinking People
","A child psychologist, played by Bruce Willis, tries to help a troubled boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, who says he sees ghosts.  This film could easily have been one of those dreadful fright night horror flicks played for cheap shocks, aimed at a juvenile mind.  Instead, the film maker chose to tell a story of fragile human feelings, and hidden assumptions.  'The Sixth Sense' thus appeals to a more mature audience.This film is carefully constructed, and deliberately slow, so that we can absorb the excellent cinematography, and have a chance to find clues that will help us avoid preconceived ideas.  But our assumptions are hard to overcome, and most of us are headed for a surprise ending, an outcome which is made possible as a result of superb film editing.And the acting is well above average.  I would not have cast Willis in the role of the fatherly psychologist, but he is more convincing than I would have predicted.  Osment's performance is as good as I have ever seen for a child actor.  And Toni Collette is totally convincing as the boy's mother. Both Osment and Collette deserved their Oscar nominations.This film may, or may not, have a subtext.  I found what could be one, but then I may have been reading too much into the story.  Sensitive, thought provoking, and well crafted, 'The Sixth Sense' is one of the better films of the last ten years.",Null,13,16,24 June 2004
Rear Window," The Peeping Tom Movie
","When the issue is a fifty year old 'classic' that others rave over, the easiest thing in the world is to go along with the crowd, and proclaim the film a 'masterpiece'. You've got lots of protective cover.But I, for one, do not like this film, and I don't mind saying so. First, the film's theme is unethical. Many people equate Jefferies' voyeurism to an audience watching a movie. Such a comparison ostensibly makes the voyeuristic theme harmless. But filmmakers make movies specifically to be watched. By contrast, most people at home value their privacy, and would not like some neighbor from across the street spying on them through binoculars. In this film, Hitchcock gets away with it because the guy doing the spying is played by a famous, and beloved, actor named James Stewart.The second problem is the film's contrived plot. The timing of Thorwald's activities with Jefferies' spying is way too coincidental, for my taste. And without Thorwald's activities, you don't have a story. Further, Thorwald conveniently leaves his windows open to view, behavior that is not believable. For that matter, how believable is it that any of those neighbors would leave their windows open to view, in such a tight, claustrophobic setting? And without those open windows, you don't have a story.My third objection is the film's lack of suspense and lack of plot twists. I do not consider this film to be a thriller at all. It's more of a social commentary on nosy neighbors.Most viewers would pounce on a film whose theme is unethical, or would jump all over a film that has obvious contrivances, or lacks suspense or plot twists. In the case of 'Rear Window', however, viewers ignore the film's flaws, because the film has Hitchcock's name attached to it. And so, we have a double standard. The standards are fairly low for films directed by Hitchcock. A much tougher set of standards apply to films made by other directors.",Null,14,25,21 February 2006
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Comedy With Some Deep Themes
","As with most comedy films, the viewer needs to be in the right mood for 'Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure' to work; otherwise it will fall flat. With help from the enigmatic time-travel guide Rufus (George Carlin) and a magic phone booth, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) go back in time to learn firsthand about, and kidnap, historical figures as a way to pass their high school history course in 1988.The historical figures are all stereotypical of their contemporary public image, and include among others: Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Lincoln, Napoleon, and a couple of 'dudes' who Bill and Ted refer to as Sigmund 'Frood' and that well-known Greek philosopher 'So-craits'.Indeed, part of the fun is the inane jabber between dim-bulbs Bill and Ted. But the dudes are charming and energetic and mean no harm. Of the two, Ted, whom I refer to as mop head, is probably the funnier. At one point he addresses Billy the Kid as 'Mr. The Kid'. And when So-craits says: 'the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing', mop head responds cheerfully: 'That's us, dude'. Marvelous.The film's first half contains some good humor; the second half becomes ever sillier, from the shopping mall sequence on to the end. The sequence in the auditorium where students give their reports is not the least bit funny, and is loaded with juvenile clichÃ©s. None of the script's dialogue contains any subtext. But that's to be expected when we have such bodacious characters that only want to 'party on'. The plot centers on physical action, not cerebral mind games.There's a lot of CGI in this film, and it is done rather well; the special effects do not get in the way of the story. Casting is acceptable. But it's the photogenic Keanu Reeves who really makes the story interesting. Acting is about what we would expect for a popcorn flick.However shallow the characters may be, and however silly some of the plot elements are, there are some deep messages here. The film offers a satire on suburban youth culture in the frivolous 80s. It also speaks to how different our contemporary culture is from bygone eras, thus offering historical perspective. And of course, 'Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure', despite the comedy or perhaps through it, veritably oozes contempt for the failure of American education. The film's thematic depth thus renders it a serious study of suburban youth culture in the latter decades of the twentieth century.",8,1,2,18 November 2013
Cube," A Maze Of Technology
","Six people find themselves trapped in various small rooms, each in the shape of a 14'x14'x14' cube. They can walk around and talk, but if they try to move into an adjacent cube, they risk being annihilated by this or that unseen booby trap. They have no idea why they're here, or how they got here. Their obvious goal is to escape.Since almost all of the scenes take place in the cubes, the plot consists of efforts, and conversations on how, to escape. And there's lots of bickering. Dialogue is not especially clever or enlightening.Nor are the characters likable. A young girl is a too-brainy math whiz, convenient for trying to interpret various numerical digits in and around their confined space. One guy is a cop with an annoying attitude. An older woman is a doctor with a paranoid attitude.Given limited sets, the plot trends repetitive. Dialogue changes, but efforts to escape merely repeat, using alternate strategies. The film really, really wants to make a philosophical statement about modern human existence, but seems unable to express it. That humans are trapped in a maze of impersonal technology seems too obvious. I suppose viewers are expected to define for themselves the film's thematic import. Otherwise, the plot just seems to go round and round in a circle, then stops.A low-budget sci-fi film, 'Cube' could easily be converted into a stage play. I didn't especially care for it. Characters are annoying. There's not much suspense. And the story seems somewhat pointless. Script aside, acting is acceptable. The background music is interestingly atmospheric. Sound effects are well done. And the constructed walls are pleasantly artistic.",Null,9,18,3 February 2010
Contact," Contemporary Hollywood Garbage
","It gets off to a good start. A noisy Earth recedes into space as the silence of an implacable universe overwhelms the senses. And I must say that a SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) inspired story could have had real promise. But most everything else about this film reeks of modern Hollywood garbage. They took the novel of a a respected astronomer, Carl Sagan, and turned his work into cinematic junk.Jodie Foster is a fine actress, and I like her. But she's the wrong person for the role she plays. Except for her character and the blind researcher, none of the characters are sympathetic. I couldn't stand that Drumlin person (played by Tom Skerritt). Smarmy Matthew McConaughey is super annoying, and his role is unnecessary. But much, much worse are the cameo appearances of real-life boob tube personalities and assorted real-life politicians, offering their 'comments' on Earth's contact with ET. Are we, as viewers, supposed to be impressed with this showy display of 'teevee' celebrities? Their presence is nauseating.Not only do these self-important, disingenuous talking heads date the film, their tiresome faces and hackneyed babble sabotage whatever other-worldly mood or atmosphere the film, as sci-fi, could have imparted. Every time one of these pompous 'know-it-alls' came on the screen, I fast-forwarded the DVD.The film's big-budget grandstanding is unbelievable: overblown special effects, irksome engineering lingo, huge sets, every acting extra in existence plus his or her extended family, background music that is highly manipulative, and on and on and on. Yet, for all the ninety million dollar budget, the film's climax is an unimaginative cop out that conveys no useful or original insights.Bombastic in presentation, and very pleased with itself, 'Contact' is what I would have expected from a Ron Howard movie: big-budget, ostentatious visuals, a story that lacks thematic depth, and aimed at an audience of fourteen-year-old boys and clueless adults. It's the same audience that Hollywood has been pandering to for decades.",1,58,137,9 August 2009
The Social Network," Cold And Soulless
","It took about a minute for me to know I was not going to like this film. The male character, Mark (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard University computer geek, addresses a college-age girl sitting across from him in a pub. In an annoying voice and with all the warmth of a dead computer, he speed-talks his way through what is supposed to be a romantic date. As the plot moves along, Mark morphs into a kind of juvenile Gordon Gekko, obsessed with his work, greedy, self-satisfied, and unconcerned with the welfare of anyone but himself.With the possible exception of Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), almost all other characters, including Mark, are cold as ice, selfish, and downright soulless. The Harvard University President is portrayed not only as obnoxious but also unethical. Basically, the script consists of a thousand villains and no one to applaud.One really good line of dialogue stabs like a dagger. In a scene where Mark sits in a conference room staring at his laptop, as usual, a female legal assistant named Marilyn asks him: 'What are you doing?' 'Checking in to see how (Facebook) is going in Bosnia'. To which Marilyn responds in a tone of sadness: 'Bosnia, they don't have roads but they have Facebook'.The cast is too big. Acting is acceptable, given the heartless subject matter. Visuals overall are too dark. Sound quality in some scenes is terrible. Filler scenes could have been edited out.Trying to be 'hip', 'The Social Network' cashes in on the 'success' of a contemporary internet fad. Twenty years from now the film not only will be dated; it will play like some relic from antiquity. Either that or humanity will have been replaced by soulless robots exchanging notes with each other in code through some ghostly Orwellian hologram called Bot-book.",2,8,14,30 January 2014
The Birds," Terrific Visuals And Special Effects
","Gripping and unnerving, Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is one of the great films of all time. In more recent movies, special effects are the sole reason to see the film; there is no real story. What makes 'The Birds' so eloquent is that the special effects enhance an already masterful story.One could reasonably argue that Hitchcock's classic was one of the first, if not the first, films to explore an environmental apocalypse. As such, it has great thematic depth. The story shows how we take for granted simple features of our everyday world, and how unsettling it would be not to have control over these mundane environmental features. Characters are multidimensional; we care about them; they clearly display their humanity. And the dialogue is excellent. My favorite character is the amusingly intellectual ornithologist. Mrs. Bundy, so sure of herself in the Café scene: 'I hardly think that either species (of birds) would have sufficient intelligence to launch a mass attack; their brain pans are not big enough'.Plot structure is fine, although it's not unreasonable to state that the story is a bit slow to develop; perhaps a few scenes in the first twenty minutes could have been deleted or shortened. The film's ending is sufficiently clear without being explicit.There are so many good visuals it's hard to know where to begin. A favorite of mine is the scene where Melanie sits in front of a jungle-gym smoking a cigarette; birds casually and innocently gather behind her. After a time when she has finished her cigarette, the camera reverts back to the jungle-gym; this time it has been overrun by an ominous army of birds; the scene is rendered even more effective by having no dialogue.Another factor that makes this film good is the absence of background music; the story doesn't need it. Ambient sounds alone enhance suspense and realism. The sounds of flapping and squawking birds are eerie and effective. Casting is almost ideal. Tippi Hedren may be a bit prim and proper but she does a good job with her role. I don't recall a weak performance anywhere.'The Birds' is probably my favorite Hitchcock film. Aside from possibly a slow start, it's a well-made film, using technically difficult visual effects. It is not only entertaining but also thought-provoking in its underlying environmental theme.",10,6,12,2 November 2014
Jurassic Park," Pop-Culture Friendly
","Leave it to Spielberg to trivialize such a profound topic. The big draw is the dinosaurs. Yet they appear in only about 15 minutes of the film's 120-minute plot. Mostly what we have here are banal humans, and even an obnoxious character named Dennis (Wayne Knight), engaged in trite conversations, and exposition contrived to bring viewers up to speed. At the film's worst, viewers and the two lead 'scientists' are treated to what is literally a cartoon on the relationship between mosquitoes and dinosaur DNA. The film talks down to its audience.And there is no intrinsic need for those two kids. They are added to draw in viewers from across all age ranges. 'Jurassic Park' is a popcorn flick that's pop-culture friendly. At least it's not as bad as Spielberg's 'Jaws', a kiddie movie lacking in thematic depth.The only character in 'Jurassic Park' that acts like an adult is Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). He conveys a skeptical view of the intent of the Park's creator, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), when Malcolm says ... 'Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, staggers me'. He further critiques Hammond: 'You packaged (your discovery), slapped it on a plastic lunch-box and now you're selling it ... What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world'. So there is a bit of depth to the film, if only in passing.By far the best element is the visual effects, truly spectacular. The dinosaurs look realistic and believable. These visuals are enhanced by sound effects accompanied by a subtle echo. Which, when combined with the rain forest background, create a faraway feel, consistent with the historical remoteness of the Mesozoic era in which the dinosaurs lived.Casting is acceptable. Acting trends a bit overblown. Production and art design are almost as good as the special effects. But I did not like the overbearing and manipulative background music.With a huge budget and a famous director, this Hollywood blockbuster aims at a mass audience. Though the visual effects are spectacular, the script gives us a childish story, with childish characters, that I find mildly insulting to the study of such a fascinatingly alien era in Earth's history.",6,2,5,19 December 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Immortal
","It's hard to overstate the true significance of this film. The Library of Congress informs us that it is the most watched film ever made. Its signature song, 'Over The Rainbow', written for the film, didn't merely win the Oscar for best original song of 1939. More significantly, decades later the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts both voted this song as the number 1 song of the twentieth century. The American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest movie song of all time.But the film's accolades go on and on. It is one of only a few films listed in UNESCO's 'Memory Of The World' Registry. Even in a supporting role, actress Margaret Hamilton turned her Wicked Witch into American Film Institute's 4th-greatest villain of all time, behind Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates, and Darth Vader. All of the main actors and many people responsible for the film's technical achievements have received and continue to receive innumerable awards and honors seventy years after the film was released.From its inception as a children's book in 1900 by author L. Frank Baum, the simple story was retold countless times in novels, stage presentations, and other forms, in many subsequent years, including: 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1933, and 1938. But it was the film of 1939, directed by Victor Fleming, that propelled the story into immortality.With its perfect 3-Act structure, the script creates iconic characters and iconic dialogue. Some lines have morphed into cultural clichés, they are so often repeated. How many times has the line 'Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more' been borrowed by hack writers to use in their hack scripts? I think it was Oscar Wilde who said: 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness'.At a deeper level than the well-known story, the film's many allegories have been and will continue to be debated by scholars. Many of these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers, especially in an age when subtlety has been rendered a forgotten art. Is the naïve Dorothy really the American people? Does the yellow brick road symbolize the gold standard? Is the Emerald City a symbol of materialism that we in the early 21st century might equate to Wall Street?A deep, intellectual script it may be, but the film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal to the heart. It's the visuals and music that render the film so beloved by the world.And when you join the simple, yet intellectual, story with the power of great visuals and great music, you create a timeless expression of the human experience. The summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam, and no matter what joys and friendships you may experience along the way, after all and in the end, there's no place like home.It's almost impossible to view this film objectively, critically, so magical, mythical, and powerful has it become. It's a film that does not require a plot summary; it's too well known for that, too burned into our collective consciousness.Academy Award films, well-made classic films linger with us. But 'The Wizard Of Oz' isn't just another Oscar winner or classic film. It is unique, its own category, a one-of-a-kind artistic expression. There will never be another film quite like it. If humans are still around a thousand years from now, someone, somewhere, using some form of futuristic technology, will be watching it, enthralled by its universality, its timelessness.",10,10,11,28 August 2017
The Soloist," A True Story About Urban Homelessness
","What makes this film watchable is that it is based on a true story. A caring Los Angeles reporter named Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) tries to help a homeless man named Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx).Ayers suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. But he once attended Julliard, and he still lives and breathes the music of Beethoven. Ayers, with his shopping cart of possessions, walks the streets, playing his violin amid the noise of the freeway. He's content, in his own world.That unusual behavior grabs the attention of Lopez, no doubt as a human interest story for his own column. But as Lopez gradually becomes more genuinely concerned about Ayers, their relationship encounters frustration, anger, and emotional pain.It's a poignant, gritty story, full of realism. The film manages to be compassionate without being patronizing. The film does a terrific job in portraying the harsh, depressing reality of the boarders who live at a large shelter where Ayers goes, at the insistence of Lopez. Technical elements of the film are good. The visuals are thematically impressive. Production design and costumes are detailed and realistic. Acting is credible. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a fine performance.The main problem is the plot. Too much time is spent on Lopez and his trivialities. Somehow, the compelling Ayers story morphs into a weighty examination of Lopez and his distress in dealing with Ayers. The script is to blame here. I think if the main character had been Ayers, instead of Lopez, the film could have been quite inspiring.Even so, the film clearly calls attention to the plight of the urban homeless. As such, the film deserves viewer support.",7,91,115,24 April 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Journey Through A Bad Dream
","Three not-so-smart convicts escape a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi and in three stooges fashion, go from one disaster to another. The semi-humorous plot is like a bad dream that goes on and on, each segment brief and with little or no continuity to the segment that went before. Along the way our stooges encounter interesting, oddball characters, most of whom represent some stereotyped persona from that era in American history. Probably the most interesting of these characters is 'Radio Station Man', a blind one man outfit that records and plays corny songs to a local hick audience.Given the surreal storyline, lack of scene continuity is not a problem. But some segments and some characters seem like unnecessary filler. Character exaggeration works well for some characters, but not others. Toward the end the plot gets a little silly and the climax seems tacked on.Except for the wide ratio, letterbox screen format, color cinematography is terrific. The brownish yellow sepia toned images, which exist throughout, convey an appropriately dry and old look, consistent with the story's bygone era. Overall mise-en-scene design adds emotional support to that visual feel.I could have wished for less screen time for George Clooney, whose character dominates the plot. Aside from that, casting and acting are acceptable. Possibly the best element is that harmonic music, a down home type that generally has gone out of style, though it remains popular among mostly rural Americans.A splashy, big budget, in-your-face satire of some elements in American history, 'O Brother ...' holds your attention as we journey dream-like through a world of three guys whose collective IQ may be limited but whose capacity to find trouble is not.",7,0,0,14 February 2016
