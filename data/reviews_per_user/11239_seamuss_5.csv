Catch Me If You Can," the triumph of lightness
","Since Schindler's List, Stephen Spielberg has felt compelled to make Important Movies.  Thus the portentous likes of AI and Minority Report have bored moviegoers worldwide. Spielberg' s latest is thankfully more playful than his recent work. And unlike some of his previous films, its less manipulative of the emotions than usual. Ironically Catch Me If You Can's lightness and lack of manipulativeness make its more emotional moments much more effective.  Partly this is due to John Williams' soundtrack; usually Spielberg's in-house composer writes rather formulaic orchestra-driven music, but marimbas and glockenspiels and other percussion instruments lead the breezy theme here.Both AI and Minority Report went on far too long; both could have ended at a point where it was logical and satisfying but chose to carry on and on and on. Catch Me If You Can only possesses this fault of Spielberg's recent work to some extent; the film might have ended ten minutes earlier to no particular disadvantage. It tells the story of Frank Abagnale Junior (di Caprio), son of his namesake upright pillar of the community father (played by Christopher Walken, in one of his less psychotic roles), who runs away from home rather than confront his parents divorce. He learns that forging cheques and impersonating airline pilots and other professionals is much easier than it seems. All it takes is audacity. Inevitably, Abagnale draws the attention of plodding, methodical FBI man Hanratty (Hanks), the FBI's one passionate believer in the importance of cheque fraud.The opening credits resemble nothing so much as the cover of a 1960s paperback. In a way Catch Me If You Can is a film about the Sixties, but a Sixties slightly different from the image we have of it. Both Abagnale and Hanratty are touched by broken marriages, his parents in the case of Abagnale, his own for the older man. Aside from a few brief references, Vietnam and student radicalism and LSD might as well not exist.Some might see this as Spielberg closing his eyes to reality, but for me it more accurately reflects what the Sixties must have been like for the great mass of people who actually lived through them. It reminds us that for most people (at least most people who didn't go on to lucrative media careers in which they could endlessly revisit their preoccupations) the Sixties weren't about fashionable radicalism and rioting but a decade where they got on with their lives as most people generally do; working, living, getting married etc. Or in Frank Abagnale Junior's case, impersonating doctors and lawyers and airline pilots and passing fraudulent cheques.",Null,0,1,4 March 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Remember MAD?
","When I was seven Gorbachev was newly installed in the USSR, CND logos were everywhere, and to a highly impressionable young boy who read a lot, every high altitude roar could be the ICBMs and death was a matter of minutes away. We weren't sure if it would take 15 or 30 minutes for humanity to be annihilated and how many times over they could blow the world up. I was among the last people born for whom worldwide nuclear apocalypse was a possibility, the ultimate childhood bogeyman.Dr Strangelove may seem dated to many, but two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis it was a prescient as they come. The blackest of black comedies, Sellers' triple performance, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D Ripper ('Women sense my power, and they seek out the life force... I don't fear women Mandrake, but I deny them my essence' - there's a line for Copperface Jacks), Slim Pickens' cowboy/B52 pilot Major Kong (famously yee-hawing his plunge on the back of a nuclear missile) and the demented eponymous doctor are all still hilarious. The US military insisted on a disclaimer at the start describing the film as a work of fiction bearing no resemblance to any possibility; recently it has emerged that this was not true.",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
American Psycho," Interesting, but too stylised to have any lasting impact.
","POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!
This adaptation of American Psycho is interesting, at times repellent, at times hilarious, yet strangely uninvolving and ultimately lacking in any real satirical bite. Christian Bale delivers a highly stylised performance; when he gives his critiques of Huey Lewis and Genesis prior to committing some atrocity, he reminded me of none other than Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days. By the scene where Bateman casually explodes a cop car with his revolver, it is clear that the murders we see - with the possible exception of the homeless man in the alley, and the attempted murder of his secretary - are entirely imaginary. These factors combine to make it less a portrait of a society and culture where surface is everything and more of a chamber piece portrayal of an individual's dysfunctional mind.",Null,0,0,11 June 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," you say you want an evolution, well you know....
","Impenetrable, mystical, beautiful, hilarious, moving, inspiring, baffling. Kubrick's vision was never realised so completely as in this masterwork. Kubrick himself said he didn't want to impose a meaning on the viewer; this is a film that rewards attention and a willingness to suspend the quest for a clear direct meaning. Few filmmakers understand the rather obvious fact that cinema is primarily a visual medium; Kubrick's gem is among the most visually stunning movies ever made.The plot, such as it is, revolves around a big black monolith that seems to act as some sort of accelerator of human evolution; we first encounter it at the Dawn of Humanity as it appears to inspire the first use of tools. There's an amazing jump cut from a bone thrown aloft by an exuberant ape to a spiralling spaceship - the connection of technologies is made beautifully. The most famous aspect of the film is HAL, the all-powerful computer that controls the ship sent to investigate the Black Monolith. HAL is possessed of the ultimate deadpan voice, which is used to both hilarious and moving effect. Overall 2001 - A Space Odyssey is truly the ultimate trip.",Null,0,1,7 February 2001
Die Hard," The Last Battle of World War II
","The Last Battle of World War IIAs Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika set in motion the events that would lead to the collapse of both the illusion of Soviet power and the Soviet Union, Hollywood, and in particular the makers of contemporary action movies, had a problem. The Russians (never mind the fact that the Soviets weren't all Russians) were good villains, all sinister accents and sinister brooding looks. For decades they had been led by dour Commies humourlessly taking the salute on May Day. But along came charismatic old Gorby and suddenly the Ruskies were warm, fuzzy huggable allies trying to make a better world. South African apartheid-mongers,  South American drug barons and Arab-world terrorists all stood in for the sinister Soviets  but things weren't the same.John McTiernan's 1988 `Die Hard' went back to the definitive screen villains  German Nazis. Of course, films featuring Teutonic villainy had been made since World War II, but most of these were marred somewhat by the difficulty of making them contemporary, and the fact that most people know who won World War II. `Die Hard' can be seen as a typical World War II movie.For those of you who haven't seen the movie, here's a brief synopsis: Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop who is in Los Angeles to go to a Christmas party with his estranged wife. An unspecified group of German terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman, the man who would later impersonate Eamon de Valera as a pantomime sniveling whinger in Michael Collins) takes over the building where his wife works and holds her and 30 workmates hostage. Willis is left alone in the building and the film essentially is made up of McClane wearing a vest and foiling the terrorists by increasingly spectacular means. See it  even if you make a point of loathing that sort of thing, it is a classic example of what Hitchcock meant by `pure cinema'  a series of brilliant sequences held together by a largely irrelevant `McGuffin' or plot.Die Hard's villains are loosely defined German terrorists. Ultimately their motivation is financial, but that doesn't really matter  they fit in as ruthless, hyperefficient Aryan ubermenschen sneering at American culture as decadent  in short, the stereotypical Hollywood Nazi. They even have a Oriental gentleman in their party  echoes of the Axis (the benevolent owner of the building is Japanese, who makes a jocular reference to Pearl Harbor) who at one stage unconsciously underlines American pop culture's supremacy by surreptitiously grabbing a Mars bar just before another violent showdown.The starkest illustration of the clash of cultures is when Hans Gruber engages McClane with the celebrated dialogue:Hans Gruber:  You know my name but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne? Rambo? Marshall Dillon? Detective John McClane: Was always kinda' partial to Roy Rogers actually. I really dig those sequined shirts.`Die Hard' retains the values of the World War II morale booster  multiethnic America's can-do spirit and resourcefulness trumps sinister German murderousness and cultural snobbery. The GIs of World War II modeled themselves on Bogart and westerns, lusted after Betty Grable, swung to the sounds of Glenn Miller  in short, they were creatures of their dominant pop culture. Even in the tension of the decisive showdown, McClane goes on to trump Gruber again in the pop culture stakes:Hans Gruber: This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. Detective John McClane: That was Gary Cooper, a**holeInterestingly, the German the terrorists speak is often grammatically incorrect and meaningless. The German release of the film feature terrorists from `Europe' and the terrorists Hans and Karl have been renamed Jack and Charlie. In the scene where McClane writes down the names Hans and Karl on his forearm, he says 'I'm gonna call you Hans and Karl, just like the two evil giants in the fairy tale.' Later on, he still refers to them as Jack and Charlie.`Die Hard' taps into the ideal of resourcefulness and independence; of course these ideals are especially strong in America where the pioneer experience is historically recent and important to American self-image. You could even read the film as an illustration of the individualist Objectivism of Ayn Rand; the lone McClane trumps the teamwork of the Germans despite the ineffectual teamwork of the police and FBI outside the building. The efficiency and technical expertise of the Germans is no match for good ol' American can-do.Another interesting aspect of `Die Hard' is its racial politics. McClane's first contact outside the building is the black Sergeant Powell. McClane's relationship to Sergeant Powell is again typical of the buddy films of World War II. They strike up a relationship on CB radio during the crisis, which extends to warm family reminiscences. Powell has a tragic past; one night he accidentally shot a child and since then has moved to desk duties since he can never bring himself shoot a gun again. In the best tradition of the buddy movie, Powell ultimately overcomes his fear to save the day. Yet another example of redemption through violence.The terrorists are helped by Theo, a black computer whiz, who is counterpoised by Argyle, a guy ensconced in a limo in the underground car park who ultimately stops him making a getaway. Again one can't help being reminded of the World War II platoon movies where a WASP, a Jew, an Italian kid, an Irish guy, a Native American and a black guy all unite to trump the monotonously Aryan Germans.World War II was the dominant political and social event of the Twentieth Century. Millions of young men  now elderly  went off to fight, and in many cases witness unimaginable horror, and often killed; and then came back to civilian life. No wonder the themes of World War II are revisited again and again, in surprising locations and in surprising times.",Null,0,0,27 December 2000
