Black Swan," An exciting and engaging psychological thriller
","* * * 1/2 Very GoodEffective, lively, hand-held camera technique, creative writing, spirited direction and Natalie Portman's passionate performance, all come together beautifully, in this impressive psychological thriller-drama. Portman portrays a New York City ballerina in heated competition for the lead role in a local production of the famous 'Swan Lake' ballet. It's a compelling portrait of an artist driving herself too hard and mentally falling apart, in order to achieve perfection in playing a role. Portman's character (Nina), lacks the good/bad duality required to most effectively play the role of this version of the Swan Queen of the ballet. Nina has excellent technique and is naturally good portraying the White Swan, but lacks the passion and raw emotion required of the Black Swan character. Nina slowly undergoes a dark, violent, psychological, hallucinatory transformation, where the boundaries of reality, fantasy and dreams become blurred and begin blending together. Winona Ryder, in her 2nd comeback film of the year, does well in a dark and disturbed supporting role.Portman dominates her role and the film. Physically, she fits the role perfectly. Portman is definitely more than just a pretty face and has shown signs of serious acting ability (emotional depth) before, since her 1994 feature film debut in 'The Professional'. Portman was nominated for an Academy Award for acting in 2005 and I believe she is deserving of being nominated again, for her lead acting role in 'Black Swan'.",9,2,5,25 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Highly original, daring, brilliant, dark humor!
","This amazing film really exceeded my expectations! I consider it a masterpiece of dark humor. Never saw anything quite like it! I enjoyed it thoroughly! There needs to be at least seven Oscar nominations for this film: 1: Best Picture, 2: Best Director, 3: Best Original Screenplay, 4 and 5: Best Supporting Actor x 2 for Christoff Waltz and Brad Pitt, 6: Best Cinematography and 7: Best Art Direction. It's a very unusual, audacious, dark, funny, violent and stylish film. Tarantino's best film since 'Pulp Fiction' (1994). One needs to be a fan of Tarantino's work and be open to dark humor, to best appreciate and enjoy this particular film. In a theater of about 200 people, I was only one of three people laughing throughout the film. I realize most people are somewhat uneasy about dark comedy. To me, dark humor is highly underrated in this country.",10,5,14,28 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An entertaining action-adventure
","'The Pirates of The Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl', 2003 Directed by: Gore Verbinski* * *Viewed: September 30, 2010The first chapter of what was to be a successful trilogy, is an entertaining, big scale adventure film, loaded with action and visual effects. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, gives an impressive performance in the film, complete with accent, energy and mannerisms.The film, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, is longer than usual, for it's genre of action/adventure. The film moves along at an energetic pace, and considering the scale of it's story, does not feel overly long.The story concerns pirate Captain Jack Sparrow's return from exile and meeting up by chance, with the owner of a fabled pirate medallion, believed to have the power to help lift an old deadly 'curse of the black pearl'.Technically, the film delivers, along with Johnny Depp's acting performance. One should not expect much from the story however, as it was inspired by a Disney Land theme park attraction. The story is a blend of action, adventure, fantasy and humor. I imagine, humor was added to lighten up the film as a whole and provide additional entertainment value, while not frightening it's targeted young audience too much. The somewhat solid story has some convenient plot points to move things along, but there is a large cast of characters: heroes and villains, to help keep things interesting. Keep watching until the end of the closing credits, for a sneak preview of the story set up, for the next film in the trilogy.The real stars of this film: Director Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp and the technical/effects crew.",8,0,2,30 September 2010
Beauty and the Beast," A charming, enchanting and beautiful animated film!
","'Beauty and the Beast' (1991), marked a return to top form for Disney. In this film, excellent animation, characters, story and songs all come together. After Walt Disney died in 1967, the animated films after that had lost that special Disney touch. With this film, Disney re-discovered it's magic touch.'Beauty and the Beast' is a re-telling of the classic fairy tale. Here, the heroine 'Belle' is an independent, book loving woman with a strong sense of imagination. The second change made to the traditional story are the castle servants under the spell as furniture and kitchenware.I was very impressed with the film. I felt it definitely deserved it's Academy Award nomination for Best Picture of 1991 (a first ever). It's competition that year were: 'Thelma and Louise' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' (both very good films, in my opinion). Now there is a new category: Best Animated Feature Film. If it existed then, this is the award that Beauty and the Beast deserved to win. I've seen the other Disney classic films: from 'Snow White' (1937) to 'Dumbo' (1942) and believe that this film ranks with them as one of Disney's Best.",Null,0,0,6 January 2004
The Notebook," A very romantic and visually stunning film
","Director Nick Cassavetes, famous son of the admired film director John Cassavetes, has created an impressive film. The story is based on a first time novelist's best selling book. Though there are some weaknesses in the story, the film is filled with artistic visual delights from beginning to end. It's a love story of the American South told in flashback. By a quarter of the way into the film, I was hooked, and being familiar with this particular storytelling technique, made a successful prediction, one that connects the present with the past, in the film. This did not lessen my enjoyment of the film. As a romantic, this film was definitely 'pushing the right buttons' for me.Cassavetes could be accused of pushing the romantic look a little too far in this film. I'm a natural born romantic, so the look of the film had me captivated from the first few minutes. Cinematography and art direction are outstanding to create a very convincing romantic look for the film.About half way into the film, I predicted this would become a new favorite film of mine. I was correct.",9,0,1,20 January 2010
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A bold, vulgar and very funny comedy
","* * * Goodyes, it's vulgar and obscene, but it's also very bold and very funny.the film uses well known traditional musical themes to contrast with it's unique style of parody humor.this is a film that can both easily be attacked for it's vulgarity and also praised for it's imagination and bold sense of all out humor.president clinton, winona ryder, bill gates, the baldwins, canada and more real life people are targeted with the humor of this film. there's some truth to parts of the story: racism, politics, the mindset of rural, Christian conservative Americans. the story is rather simple here. the popular young schoolmates see a vulgar r-rated comedy film from Canada, become overly influenced by it and all hell breaks loose.yes, the animation is crude, but this film is not afraid to make fun of itself and a number of well known people. the film comes across as a parody of the popular American musical and contemporary American life and attitudes.i liked and enjoyed the film. sure it has weaknesses, but how often does one see such a brave parody of American life, attitudes and politics? the devil and sadaam hussain together in bed are an especially creative touch, not up to everyone's taste.as a serious film critic, it's certainly easy to attack and criticize this film. it's mixed. best appreciated and enjoyed by those who pay attention to popular American culture and have an open minded sense of humor.",8,0,0,21 September 2010
Orphan," A highly derivative, weak thriller
","'Orphan', 2009, is a largely uninspired, highly derivative, pseudo-art film attempt at a thriller that tries hard to be chilling. The only thing that makes it worthwhile to view, is the performance of newcomer Isabelle Furham as Esther, the adopted child of unknown origin, from Russia. Director Jaume Collet Sera is not able to maintain any convincing drama or tension, due to a weak, ineffective screenplay, by David Johnson, which contains several convenient plot points. I would have given this film a rating of '5', if it weren't for Isabelle Furham's slightly chilling performance, portrayed with a mix of sweetness, charm and coldness.The revelation at the end of the film helps explain the main character and the story, but arrives too late to rescue the film.",6,9,15,10 January 2010
My Neighbor Totoro," A highly charming, imaginative and heartwarming animated film.
","'My Neighbor Totoro'Animated, 1988, JapanRunning time: 88 minutes Written and directed by: Hiyao Miyazaki* * * 1/2 Very GoodI happened to see this film March 13, 2010, for the very first time and have many positive adjectives of praise for this film fresh in mind. My first impressions are: 'My Neighbor Totoro' is an exceptionally imaginative, detailed, charming, heartwarming and very cute film. Japan has mastered cute probably better than anyone else in the world. Cute is relatively easy to achieve, especially in an animated film, as the legacy of Disney shows. So, cute, really is a weak adjective of praise here.'My Neighbor Totoro', 1988, is the first feature length animated film from the acclaimed animation director Hayao Miyazaki of Japan. Prior to this film, he worked in television, but found that artistically unsatisfying over time. Miyazaki has said, at first, he did not consider animation, as the medium of choice, for his imaginative stories and career change. For anyone with a large and vivid imagination, animation is the ideal choice of expression. If one can imagine it, one can bring it to life in animation, without difficulty or great expense, as compared to live action film.What most impressed me about this film is Miyazaki's keen knowledge and expression of how it feels to be a child, how we perceive and react to the world around us, with energy, excitement, enthusiasm, imagination and curiosity. To me, this is what came across, most profoundly. Animation and sound are good overall in the film, nothing especially impressive. This is to be expected, as a first time feature length film director rarely is granted a large budget for their very first film. What's impressive about 'My Neighbor Totoro', is the storytelling. That's what matters most, of course. Film is simply a highly visual medium of storytelling.Miyazaki based the story of the film on his own childhood, growing up in rural Japan during the 1950's. All of the locations in the animated film, have their real life counterparts in Japan. The story concerns two young girls and their father, who move into a new countryside home, while their mother is away, sick in a hospital. Totoro can best be described as a large, gentle, friendly, furry, teddy bear-cat kind of creature, who is actually a spirit of the forest, near the new home of the two girls. Miyazaki is wise to hold off and wait until the halfway point of the story, to introduce the main character of Totoro, to build up the anticipation of Totoro's arrival in the film. The cat bus is an especially charming and imaginative character that appears later in the film. Miyazki's story telling style keeps some suspense going, regarding the mother's relation to the story.Miyzaki's film takes it's time to slowly introduce it's characters and become acquainted with them. Clearly, Miyazaki is a gifted storyteller, with heart and details in his characters and stories. What people appreciate most about his animated films is that they are about ordinary, common people in extraordinary situations and told with heart, charm, genuine emotion and special little details, regarding the characters, landscapes and inventions. When first released theatrically in Japan, 'My Neighbor Totoro' was only modestly successful. When it was later released on television in Japan, it took off in popularity.I have seen a number of Miyazaki films since his 'Princess Mononoke', 1997, before seeing 'My Neighbor Totoro', his very first film. 'My Neighbor Totoro' by itself, is enough to have made me a Miyazaki fan, if I had seen it years ago, before I ever saw any of his other animated films.Miyazaki's animated films are the type that always present something new both in characters and inventions, in an engaging and captivating way. With most of his animated films, it always worth experiencing them again and they continue to delight and entertain, both children and adults alike.I consider myself a child at heart. I remember how it felt to be a child. How the world seemed so different at that time in life.. Children perceive and react to the world much differently than adults. Viewing a film such as 'My Neighbor Totoro', Miyazaki recaptures childhood very accurately. Doesn't really matter he is Japanese. Children are children, with the same traits, all over the world, regardless of country or culture.To me, Miyazaki deserves comparison to the great animation pioneer, Walt Disney. I realize this is a big compliment, however I feel that Miyazaki has earned and deserves comparison to Disney. Like Disney, Miyazaki is also highly imaginative, artistic and detailed with his animation stories, as was Walt Disney. I consider Miyazaki, the new Disney. Miyazaki is an excellent story teller and deserves his exalted and admired status within the animation industry, here in the United States.",9,0,1,15 March 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Visually impressive and entertaining
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' Released: May 24, 2007 Viewed: May 28, 2007*** Good This is the first time I have seen any of the highly successful POC fantasy/adventure films.

Once," A highly natural, honest and charming romantic drama
","Director/writer John Carney has crafted an exceptional film with 'Once'. Simply put: 'Once' feels real. Photographed in and around Dublin, Ireland, on a low budget, using hand held cameras, the film has a private documentary look and feel to it. 'Once' is loaded with naturalness, sincerity, spontaneity, honesty and charm. It's one of the best films of the decade, outperforming most big budget Hollywood films with famous actors. This film is evidence that an inspired director and writer, are far more important to the success of a film, than the traditional Hollywood formula of big budgets and famous actors. By success, my meaning is, the film tells it's story very convincingly.The story concerns a chance encounter between two musicians and follows them on their eventful weekend that follows. The two main character, identified only as guy and girl, are portrayed by two real life musicians. 'Once' contains some genuinely beautiful original music and songs.For me, there are really three key scenes, that help lift this film from lesser efforts of the genre. One, is the performance of the beautiful song 'Falling Slowly' in the music store. Second, has the girl walking home at night with fresh batteries, listening to and singing to one of the guy's songs on the portable CD player he gave her. Third, would be the guy creating a new guitar song, while watching home movies of his ex- love, for inspiration. The ending of the film is brave for this genre and fits perfectly with the story telling style of the film.Though deserving of more than one Academy Award nomination, 'Once' is the not the usual choice of Academy voters (big budget, famous actors, epic story) for Best Picture.About the R rating for the film. The f-word is used throughout the film., however, it's never used in a vulgar, aggressive or insulting manner. It's obviously the common language style of the common people portrayed in the film. Considering the context of the story and characters, I believe an R rating is unjustified. That's unfortunate for a low budget film like this, which needs to play in as many theaters as possible. R rated films earn less than PG or PG-13 films.Highly recommended.",10,3,4,23 January 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," A visually stunning masterpiece of the imagination!
","Written and directed by: Guillermo Del Toro / Released: December 2006 / Viewed: January 7, 2007'Pan's Labyrinth' is truly a powerful, beautiful and emotional film. Set in postwar Spain of 1944, it tells the story of a young girl (and her fantasies),accompanying her pregnant mother to meet her new military stepfather.This is Mexican writer/ director Guillermo Del Toro's eighth film since his debut in 1985. His other film highpoint is 'The Devil's Backbone' (2001). I would not have expected a great film such as this, from his fantasy/horror film background. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had to create this remarkable film.This is the story of a young book loving girl who possesses a powerful and rich imagination. The film depicts both her fantasy world and the real world she lives in, both to powerful complimentary effect. Both an emotionally powerful drama and a beautifully realized fantasy, this film is certain to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language film of 2006. It has been nominated for The Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the most emotional and beautifully realized fantasy films I have ever seen. It has left a strong impression on me. Cinematography, production design and visual effects are excellent throughout the film. The main and central character's are emotionally engaging throughout the film also. The central villain is chilling and convincing. Two fantasy creatures stand out: the faun and more impressively, 'The Pale Man'. The real life story of the girl is occasionally graphic, the film is always a feast for the eyes and a triumph of the heart. This is definitely a film for for older children and adults, not for young children.",10,2,4,7 January 2007
Knocked Up," Funny, honest and warm hearted!
","'Knocked Up' / 2006 / Released: June 1, 2007 / Viewed: June 3, 2007 / Comedy***.5 (Very Good)Written and Directed by: Jude Apatow / Running time: 129 minutes'Knocked Up' is a surprisingly well written, acted and directed film from Jude Apatow 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 2005. I have not seen 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', nor any other films from this director-writer. I was impressed by the honesty, humor and sweetness of the film. This film has a title I took a quick liking to. The title promised an honest film, and the film delivers in that respect among others. A young, attractive and ambitious female E! television host meets a young lazy, immature and unambitious young man at a bar while she is celebrating a promotion at work. They drink together and quickly become friendly. This leads to an unexpected sexual encounter. The problem is, that 8 weeks later, she learns she is pregnant from their one night stand sex encounter.Director-writer Jude Apatow shows a lot of insight into anxieties about relationships and pregnancy. With an unusually long running time for a comedy (2 hours and 9 minutes), this film takes time to really develop it's two main characters and follow their story over the next 7 months with humor, honesty and sensitivity. Considering the long running time, and this is a comedy film, the film never feels stretched out or too long. With a cast of largely unknown actors and the insightful screenplay, the main and supporting characters come across as convincingly real and ordinary.The few weaknesses are some occasional moments of humor and character types typically found in crude adolescent comedy films. What really makes this film a winner is it's screenplay, directing and acting, in that order. The film initially appears to be a man's film, however it spends a generous amount of time with some strong female characters, that convincingly speak with honesty and sensitivity.Director-writer Apatow is a former television comedy writer. With this film, he shows he is very keen on finding and exploring the anxieties, humor and warm feelings found in romantic relationships. And he is being honest and straightforward with his characters and how they express themselves. The story involves some male and female bonding, to help cope with and make it through difficult personal situations. The lead man and woman each pair off with a same sex friend, bond and travel off to have some fun together. It's here that they really learn about themselves and realize they need to return home and bravely face their difficult and awkward personal circumstances in life.Definitely one of the better written, directed and acted comedies of recent years!",9,1,5,3 June 2007
Forrest Gump," An unconventional film, but one with genuine charm and sweetness
","I have seen 'Forrest Gump' (FG), a number of times, since I first saw it theatrically July 1994, when it was first released. I was first captured by it's beautiful music score. Then the story and Tom Hanks's performance as Forrest Gump, also won me over. This film knows how to push the right emotional buttons. There is no conventional story or plot in this film, yet the film works very well. Some people dislike this film, because the main character is of low intelligence and his adventures in life seem hard to believe. There are several reasons to attribute the big success of this film. Partly the screenplay, partly Tom Hank's performance, partly the music score and the film's sweep through 30 years of recent and familiar American history. FG is a very American film. Americans like a story of a simple person achieving great things. I believe many people reacted and related to the character of Forrest Gump in this film. A simple, innocent and humble man achieving great things in his life. Part of the moral of the story, is that brains aren't always necessary to achieve in life, a warm and kind heart can achieve in other ways in life. The story idea is that life is both destiny and luck. I like that philosophy and agree with it. To me, FG is a modern classic, American film.",9,1,4,17 March 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," A tense, exciting and absorbing action-thriller!
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' (2007)The 3rd part of the Bourne trilogy is certainly the best film of this trilogy. Though lacking a little in storytelling, the technique of this film is especially impressive, especially film editing. There's a lot of hand held camera usage and precise film editing on display here, that adds a lot of excitement and tension to the film. Unfortunately, two sequences actually duplicate from the 2nd Bourne Film, including the ending scene of the 2nd Bourne film. This is a disappointment and shows a lack of initiative and creativity. When Bourne finds a surviving scrap of paper from a burned out briefcase that just happens to contain useful information to him (an address), well, this strains plausibility a little. What's immediately noticeable about this film is it's technique. The 2nd Bourne film, by the same director, was, in bits and pieces, a trial run for this film. Overall, director Paul Verhoven has crafted and excellent action film here.The story begins where we left off in the 2nd film, with Jason Bourne on the run in Russia. The 2nd film came to a closure with Jason Bourne's escape. His escape sequence in Russia continues here to open this film. Jason Bourne, on the run in Russia at the end of the 2nd Bourne film, came to a safe escape, but yet we continue it here to open the 3rd film. This is my first minor criticism of this film. The 2nd and my biggest criticism is recreating, essentially duplicating the ending scene of the 2nd film near the beginning of the climax of this 3rd film. The police car chase scene near the end of this film, duplicates the same ending as the action set piece sequence of the 2nd film. On it's own, this film is genuinely exciting and absorbing entertainment. Only with the 2nd film in memory, the minor flaws of this film become evident. Winner of 3 Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Sound and Sound Editing.",9,0,1,26 May 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," An unusually original, honest and funny film
","Hollywood comedies are usually boring, predictable (by the numbers) and mediocre. 'Little Miss Sunshine', 2006, is a notable exception. Contrary to the title, there's not much happiness in the story, instead, there's a lot of originality, honesty, insight, charm, sly humor and a little darkness contained in the story of the film. Overall, the film is genuine, charming, spirited and funny. In one unusual scene, about two-thirds in, the film takes a sudden, bold and surprising leap with it's comedy, which is to be applauded. The screenplay itself is worthy of praise and applause.First time screenwriter Michael Arndt delivers something rarely seen in Hollywood: a very original and honest story. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is about the dysfunctional relationships of an American middle class family and their road trip to a girl's beauty pageant. Yes, it's a simple premise and the road trip sub-genre of movies has been done many times before. Going through the conventions of the sub-genre of road movies, the movie loses some of it's power for brief periods of time, notable in one specific and unnecessary scene. Writing and acting make the big difference in this film, to set it above and beyond most other comedies. It's a film not afraid to go beyond the usual boundaries of comedies and be honest and realistic about human nature and human relationships. Actually, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is more accurately described as a 'dramedy' (comedy/drama). Writer Arndt based the screenplay on personal real life experiences and relationships. Arndt has created an interesting and wide variety of family member characters, which their own clearly defined problems, anxieties and goals.We're quickly introduced to all the characters of the ensemble cast at the beginning of the film. The family dinner scene works well to introduce the dynamics of the family and their relationships to each other. In other words, good exposition to open the film.Abigail Breslin (just 10 years old) and Alan Arkin both deliver realistic and charming acting performances. There are two directors in this film, which is odd, considering it's a small scale, low budget film. I think having two directors did not really cancel each other out for a possible Academy Award nomination. This is clearly a writing and acting dominated film. Both directors are relatively unknown newcomers to film directing. Direction is good, nothing special.The film ends with an accurate statement about the absurdity and ridicules nature of girl beauty pageants.",9,2,3,23 September 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A comedy done with charm and sweetness
","'The 40 Year Old Virgin' / 2005 / Directed by: Judd Apatow / Written by: Judd Apatow and Steve Carell* * * GoodI like and admire Judd Apatow's story telling style. I was impressed, more than expected for this film. Most Hollywood comedies are 'by the numbers', juvenile and predictable, best appreciated by adolescents or adolescent minded adults.This sex comedy, would seem to be yet another mediocre and immature Hollywood comedy, however, director/co-writer Apatow, shows some honesty and insight into human nature and relationships between the sexes. Sometimes ordinary comedy, sometimes special, the film does have moments of genuine charm and sweetness.This is only the 2nd Apatow film I've ever seen. first was: 'Knocked Up, 2007'. Both films share a lot in common, showing Apatow's signature style. Apatow is good at writing a variety of interesting and relate-able characters and being truthful about the insecurities of dating, sex and heterosexual relationships. Comedian and co-writer Steve Carell does a good job at portraying this sexually repressed, adolescent minded virgin middle aged man.The story setup of the main character is a little overdone, attempting to show the nerdy life of a 40 year old man stuck in adolescence, with his collection of childhood toys and addiction to video games still with him. Overall, the film is a works, as it balances comedy, honesty, charm and sweetness, which are Apatow's talent and trademark.",8,0,1,5 October 2010
Ratatouille," A unique and sophisticated animated film!
","'Ratatouille' (2007) / Directed and written by: Brad Bird ****(Excellent) This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Though it's largely a comedy, it ranks up there with some of Disney's best work, including Snow White, Bambi and Pinnochio. As usual, the Pixar digital animation is excellent and always improving in some small way with each new film. The step forward for this film, is water and how it's depicted in a very realistic manner. That's the small technical leap here. However, this is a rare film (of any genre), where all the right elements are done very well and all come together to make a unique and special film.'Ratatouille' is a film with some surprisingly sly, sophisticated humor that goes beyond the expectations of the usual animated film. There's a surprisingly well written, humorous and touching story here, that probably connects better with adults than with children. Though there's plenty of action and humor children will find appealing, the humor and finer peaks of the story are more aimed at adults. I've rarely seen a film rated G that contains with such creativity and sophistication.A young man begins work in a famous restaurant in Paris. Here he accidentally meets and befriends a unique rat that was discovered in the restaurant kitchen. This young man has a secret connection to the restaurant. This unique rat has an affection for fine food and a talent for food preparation. It's a story idea that doesn't seem to hold much promise to hold adult attention and interest for the length of a feature film. However, there are a number of factors that strengthen the story, such as well conceived and voiced characters and a fine attention to visual detail. The look of Paris and food preparation is done with remarkable authenticity. The distinguished actor Peter O' Toole provides the voice of a hard hearted and egotistical restaurant critic. This character looks and sounds like a villain, however the real villain of the story turns out to be the current chef of the restaurant.Two of the best scenes of the film are when the current chef is getting the young man drunk on wine, in order for him to divulge his secrets of success. The other scene is when the hard hearted restaurant critic suddenly has a childhood flashback upon tasting one of the restaurants famous creations prepared in a new way.Though I think children will generally find this an entertaining film, it's adults who will most appreciate it's sophisticated, sly humor and amazing visual details. In an audience largely of families, I noticed a sometimes bewildered look on the face of a young girl sitting next to me during the film. It was at this time that adults better connected with the film than children.Not to forget the lively music score, which really supports the humor and dramatic moments of the film. The film editing provides the right pace and rhythm all throughout the film.Overall, 'Ratatouille' celebrates the preparation of and enjoyment of fine food with a surprisingly well conceived and written story and characters. This film deserves two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature Film.Highly Recommended.",10,5,9,4 July 2007
Enchanted," Another success for Disney self parody. This time in both live action and animation.
","Newcomer Amy Adams as Giselle is really the star of this film. Disney has had success before with self parody: 'Aladdin' (1992) and 'Hercules' (1997), but never before with a live action film. The Disney self parody works most of the time, but what really carries the film along is Amy Adams' performance as Princess Giselle. Immediately, she is lively, charming, spunky, likable and very much a Disney style fairy tale heroine. That's the first thing I noticed about this film. In my opinion, Disney does not have a good track record of live action films, with the notable exception of 'Mary Poppins' (1964). So, I'm pleased to see a better than usual live action film from Disney.I thought Disney's self parody idea, used here in a live action film, would be the star of the film, and bring out, as before, more lively and creative screen writing. In parts, it does, more or less throughout the film. With the return of Academy Award winning Disney composer Alan Menken, the songwriting for this film seems to have had a very good inspiration, I think, partly due to Disney's return to it's fairy tale story roots. The self parody is mostly 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' without the dwarfs at first and later uses 'Cinderella' for more references.The story idea of self parody, which can be very insightfully funny when done right, works well for most of the film. Whenever it falters a little, there is always Amy Adams charming and sprightly acting performance to hold one's interest and keep one believing in the magic of Disney's fairy tale stories all over again, for a new generation.Received 3 Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song.",8,3,3,28 May 2008
Gone with the Wind," The one and only
","Directed by: Victor Fleming mostly, getting the credit, among 4 directors during the amazing extended preproduction, production and post production of the film.Writer: Sidney Howard, credited, was one of 14 writers for this film.A little Hollwoodish, however, an excellent film overall, in many ways, from directing, writing, acting, cinematography, costumes, makeup, music score. Adjusted for inflation, it's still the box office champion, in the history of cinema, exceeding 'Titanic', 1997 and 'Avatar', 2009.I actually did not see GWTW until a theatrical re-release in 1998. I was impressed and saw it a second time during that same theatrical re-release. I actually lived near Atlanta from 1988 to 1993, and could have visited CNN Center anytime to see it's perpetual run there.How this film came to be made is a quite a story all by itself. Based on the Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize winning, best selling novel of 1934, of which the rights were purchased for only $50,000.A lot has been written and said about this most famous of all Hollywood films. With a running time just under four hours and one of the largest ensemble casts ever, the film has a huge canvas to paint on. Dramatic, romantic, sentimental and highly entertaining.",10,2,3,27 January 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A long and detailed look at the supposed assassin of the famous outlaw Jesse James
","With a long title, this long and serious film takes a hard and detailed look at the self claimed assassin of Jesse James through a soft, romantic and warm lens. I'm not familiar with the details of this famous 19th century American outlaw and the circumstances surrounding his untimely death. So, I cannot attest to it's historical accuracy. In this film, the focus is more on the motives of his would be assassin. For those not familiar with the circumstances after the death of Jesse James, there is a surprise in store near the end of the film. From beginning to end, there's plenty of biographical information, narrated, to inform those not familiar with the details of Jesse James and the story of his supposed assassin.Acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins provides some exceptionally beautiful widescreen Western style photography. For a complicated and dark story, we, the audience, are viewing it through a soft, sentimental, warm and romantic lens. Casey Affleck's performance as the assassin Robert Ford is convincingly complicated and serious.I'm a modest fan of old westerns and more a fan of biographical films of famous historical people. The photography and detailed narration initially drew me into this film. The screenplay, with it's carefully used and timed narration, works effectively throughout the entire film. Curiosity about the famous outlaw aside, the excellent cinematography of Roger Deakins and the acting performance of Casey Affleck, make this long film absorbing and engaging from beginning to end.2 Academy Award Nominations: Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins) and Best Supporting Actor (Casey Affleck).",8,1,3,10 July 2008
Liar Liar," Rises a little above mediocrity
","With a hokey premise, this film rises a little out of the usual Hollywood mediocrity of comedy films. The screenplay provides some occasional genuinely funny and touching moments. What really helps lift the film above it's premise is Jim Carrey's inspired slapstick comedy performance. Jim Carrey portrays the separated husband and father of a young boy. He works as a lawyer. His son makes a birthday wish that he cannot lie for 24 hours. This sets up the comedy that follows. As comedy pieces, the boardroom meeting scene and the bathroom scene work best for Jim Carrey to display his talents.Best for Jim Carrey fans.",7,0,1,22 July 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," A visually spectacular biopic
","Director: David Lean Writer: Robert Bolt and based on some of the actual writings of T.E. Lawrence.'Lawrence of Arabia' is a very famous and admired film. It tells the story of a real life British soldier during his adventures in Arabia during World War I.Peter O' Toole gives an impressive film acting debut here, as the main character of T. E. Lawrence. As for cinematography, this film, to me, ranks as one of the all time greats, in the history of cinema. There's a lot of great shots, scene changes and amazing attention to detail, all throughout the film.As a biopic, we really don't get to know the real life Lawrence that well. This is a my only minor criticism of the film. We do see highlights of where T.E. Lawrence was and what he did. With a running time of 3 1/2 hours, there was more than enough time available to get to know T. E. Lawrence in a more personal way. Filmed on location in the harsh desert climates of Morocco and Saudi Arabia, the photographic shoot had to be one of the most challenging ever done for a Hollywood film.",9,0,2,27 January 2010
Drive," An action film for those who usually don't like action films
","'Drive ' is a film, very much about mood and style, that exceeds the usual genre expectations for action films. It's an action / art film.. Ryan Gosling plays a quiet, loner, movie stunt driver and mechanic, simply known as driver. He occasionally works as a getaway driver for robberies. He meets and begins to fall for his attractive female neighbor, who's husband is in prison. Driver befriends this woman's son. Her husband shortly returns home from prison and driver decides to help him out with his problem. Unfortunately, this problem involves gangsters. I'm not a fan of the action genre, but this film set in LA, impressed me with it's style, mood and use of music. The cinematography is very creative an effective. I found myself absorbed from beginning to end. The opening robbery is definitely an adrenalin rush. 'Drive' works as action, drama, thriller and mystery. Driver portrays the loner protagonist character, as Clint Eastwood was in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. As characters, driver and his female neighbor have little dialogue, which lends itself to building mood. The minimalist music score is very effective to enhance mood.Overall, 'Drive' is a film that pays homage to noir mythology and combines it with modern day extreme violence, which some may not find a likable combination. I was a little shocked by the brutal scenes of violence, but these served for character.'Drive' was nominated for the Palm De Or and Best Director at The Cannes Film Festival, winning for Best Director.",9,1,3,22 June 2012
Moulin Rouge!," A stylish, over the top, experimental romantic musical that works!
","'Moulin Rouge' is a film that requires an open mind to watch. As an experimental musical film, it divided audiences who were either enthralled or bewildered by it. After Ewan McGregor (Christian) sings a line from 'The Sound of Music' in 1899 Paris, it's becomes apparent that this film is different from the usual film and willing to try new ideas. Especially after Christian sings the first complete song of the film 'Your Song' by Elton John to Satine (Nicole Kidman), you either accept the use of pop songs from the 1950's through 1990's in 1899 Paris or you don't. If you don't, the film will probably begin to lose it's hold on you.'Moulin Rouge' became a most favorite film for me upon my first viewing of it shortly after it's theatrical release. I left the film feeling wonderfully entertained! The art direction, cinematography, costumes and Nicole Kidman's performance as Satine are all very impressive!As a discerning film buff, I consider 'Moulin Rouge' to be an excellent film overall, however it has a notable flaw: a flaw that I accepted. How Satine and Christian fall in love is not at all convincing, however their feelings for each other, especially when they sing together, is convincing. 'Moulin Rouge' is not a film about character development, it's a film that celebrates love with bursts of passion and romance!'Moulin Rouge' is certainly a quirky, fast paced paced film that will not be to everyone's taste. In the end, however,I feel that director Baz Luhrman's gamble paid off. He's created a new kind of musical film that will influence future directors.",10,0,1,30 December 2003
Million Dollar Baby," One of Hollywood's Best Ever Films!
","Note: Actors names are used instead of their character's names in the film.'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) Directed by: Clint Eastwood Starring:Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman **** Excellent'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) is that rare and daring film from Hollywood, when skilled direction, writing and acting come together in a surprisingly powerful manner. 'MDB' is a small scale, low key, intimate film that packs honesty and raw, heart wrenching emotion. Hillary Swank gives a powerful performance as a poor, single waitress from a rural background, who decides, against the odds, to become a boxer. Clint Eastwood portrays a former boxer, now trainer in his own gym. He reluctantly accepts Swank as her first trainer. Morgan Freeman portrays a retired boxer who almost won a title under Eastwood's training. He is now an assistant to Eastwood at the gym and is the one who notices Swank's determination and gives her a chance getting started with training at the gym. Both Eastwood and Freeman give strong performances to back up Swank's memorable acting performance. Swank's character and transformation are convincing and believable, as she begins to find herself in life. Her toughness, stubbornness and determination help make her a winning boxer. From a troubled, broken family and a life of struggle, her new boxing career becomes a life renewed. During the several years of successful partnership as boxer and trainer, Eastwood gradually becomes a father figure to Swank.Nothing, however, really prepares one for the sudden and unexpected change of events that occur about midway into the story and dramatically changes the mood of the film. By this time, we have strongly bonded emotionally with Swank's character, feeling empathy for her life situation and struggles. So this sudden shift in the story is all the more powerful and sets the stage for deeply intimate and heart wrenching emotions in the second half of the film, which ends in a surprising and poignant manner.Unlike typical Hollywood films, 'MDB' has honesty, sensitivity, believable, ordinary people and raw emotional power. 'MDB' will leave you with lingering, heartfelt sorrow. An extraordinary film.",Null,3,5,8 March 2005
Mulholland Drive," An extremely interesting, intelligent, imaginative and absorbing psychological mystery thriller
","'Mulholland Drive', 2001. Written and Directed by: David Lynch. * * * *This is one of the most expertly directed, imaginative and fascinating psychological mystery drama films I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I really admire this film. I consider it a masterpiece. Made in Lynch's signature dreamlike, dark, weird and complicated storytelling style, involving changed and uncertain identities and character relationships. As a bonus, Lynch manages to skillfully add and execute a scene of dark humor into the story. It's a film to pay close attention to, with clues presented from beginning to end.'Mulholland Drive' is similar to the weird 'Lost Highway', 1997, which most critics dismissed as mediocre. Both have strange and complicated characters and stories. Personally, I liked 'Lost Highway', but admit it's shortcomings. It's all style and not much else. 'Mulholland Drive' is superior mainly for it's superior direction. For it's genre, it's more engaging and convincing.Clearly, Lynch has mastered his unusual and very unique storytelling style and technique with this film. Lynch's ability to set up scenes of troubled characters in strange circumstances and the acting performance he gets out of them is especially impressive. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both give very good acting performances, making memorable impressions for the film year of 2001. Another impressive, haunting and hypnotic music score from Angelo Badalamenti.The story of 'Mulholland Drive' is set in present day Los Angeles and concerns a young woman who suffers from memory loss after a car accident. She befriends a hopeful and optimistic woman newly arrived and seeking acting auditions in Hollywood. This is not quite the truth. The real story is very different. The film is very non-linear and thematic. Very much a thinking person's kind of film. Part real life, part fantasy, part dream and part hallucination. 'Mulholland Drive' is all of these things. There's a lot of different layers, elements, ideas, characters and themes in the film and it all doesn't come completely together until the chilling sequence of the final minutes of the film. This scene really threw me off a lot, the first time I saw it. That's just Lynch's style. To mystify and hypnotize the audience all the way through and then through in a radical, bizarre twist at the end. I consider myself of above average intelligence and to be highly visually attentive. It took me several viewings of the film to better understand exactly what happened in the story and the meaning and relationship of all these different characters to the two lead characters (Watts and Harring).Nominated for a Best Director Academy Award, nominated for The Golden Palm at Cannes and winner of the Best Director award at Cannes. This film deserved more Academy Award nominations than it received, only Best Director. My guess is the film is simply too weird for Hollywood to fully acknowledge. At least Hollywood gave Lynch a Best Director nomination. Screenplay, cinematography, sound, music score and the lead acting performances of Watts and Harring are all excellent, yet the film received no nominations at all, in these very obvious and deserving categories. Overall, the film looks great. It's hard to believe the budget for this film was only $7 million dollars, far below the typical budget of a Hollywood film of 2001. A must see for any discerning, serious film buff.",10,5,8,13 August 2010
The Piano," A unique, beautiful and powerful film
","'The Piano', is indeed a joy and pleasure to experience. As an art film, it certainly dazzles with it's cinematography, music score, art direction, costumes and makeup, however it's most crucial strengths are it's writing and acting. Writing and acting are the qualities that set apart the merely good films from the excellent films.Set in New Zealand, 1850, and photographed on location, the story is about an arranged marriage and an affair. The storytelling is exceptionally beautiful and original.Producer, writer and director Jane Campion of Australia, does an outstanding job with this film. Campion won the 1993 Palme De' Or award at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, making her the first ever female recipient of this high honor. Campion also won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this film.The director should always receive some credit for an excellent acting performance, as they are providing the inspiration and motivation for the actors to do their best. Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin both give powerful acting performances. Most impressively, this was Anna Paquin's first feature length film, and at the age of 11 was nominated for and won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, making her the second youngest ever recipient of an Academy acting award, after Tatum O' Neal, age 10, for 'Paper Moon', 1973. First feature length film role, only 11 years old, first nomination, and win for an Academy Award for Anna Pacquin. That's a rare feat and great start to any acting career. Most actors never get nominated for an Academy Award, let alone win one during their entire film acting career. Anna Pacquin's film acting career was certainly born with an impressive bang.",10,0,3,6 January 2010
The Dark Knight," A surprisingly effective dark and psychological film!
","Dark, chilling and creepy. As a comic book film, is unusually impressive. Heath Ledger as the Joker is impressive: creepy and engaging. Jack Nicolson as the Joker in the first Batman film was good, somewhat campy, Heath Ledger goes beyond that performance, with a darker, more psychological and more intense portrayal of the character.As the sixth Batman film since 1989, this one is easily the best.Gets to the heart of the Batman story very effectively: there's a fine line between good and evil and vigilante and hero.Filmed in location in Chicago, downtown and Navy Pier areas. The camera is always carefully framed as not to the make the actual location obvious.",9,4,9,2 August 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An exceptionally honest and poignant love story!
","* * * * (Excellent)I admit, I'm a tough critic who is rarely impressed by current and recent films from Hollywood. Rarely a film comes about with an outstanding and very original story. This is such a film. I'm viewing and critiquing this film four years after it's theatrical release. I was aware of the critical acclaim for this film before viewing it.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' (2004), is an exceptionally intelligent, sensitive, romantic and honest film about memories and falling in and out of love. This film has a very complicated story that frequently jumps around in time. I wasn't paying complete enough attention the first viewing and so viewed it a second time, when I picked up on critical moments I missed the first time, especially a critical line of dialog that really links and help make sense of the complicated story. The story of this film is told as a 'mobius strip', that wraps around and connects back to itself. I was not familiar with the origin of the title of this film. My first impression was the title is intriguing and poetic.The story concerns a man having his memory erased of a woman he recently had a stormy romantic relationship with. He is using a supposed medical treatment that can selectively erase unpleasant or troublesome memories. My brief story description, is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, here the iceberg is the film's story. There are a lot of wonderful things to discover in this film and I don't want to tease or spoil things for the reader. I believe that in describing something complicated, less, truly is, more.Jim Carrey gives a credible performance in his lead acting role here in a drama film. His first was in 'The Truman Show' (1998). Kate Winslet, is the acting highlight of the film, giving, yet another impressive and memorable acting performance in the lead actress role of the film, opposite Jim Carey.This is a film, in which many positive things can be said about, in a long review. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I lack the knowledge and talent for that. Films about memories are difficult to make in a convincing manner. 'Memento' (2000), also a film about memory, works in a different and less impressive style than 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. The only recent excellent film about memory that comes to mind is 'Afterlife' (Japan, 1998). The best stories are ones that are original, genuine, keenly perceptive and brutally honest. 'Eternal Sunshine' is truly a thought provoking film about the usefulness and purpose of human memories, good and bad.Awards: Nominated for and won Academy Award for 'Best Original Screenplay', Kate Winslet nominated (her fourth acting nomination) for Academy Award as Best Actress in a Leading Role. Kate Winslet is the youngest ever actress to achieve 4 Academy Award nominations for acting. She achieved her fourth here, at age 29, for this film.",10,1,4,18 June 2008
Some Like It Hot," A very entertaining and clever comedy!
","'Some Like It Hot', 1959***.5 (Very Good)A mini, capsule review. I viewed this film yesterday for the first time. I already knew the reputation of this film as one of Hollywood's best comedies. I was impressed and entertained by the clever and insightful screenplay, acting, film editing and directing. The story is set in 1929 Prohibition Chicago and then moves to Miami. This was one of the first films of it's kind for it's day back in 1959. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny as two down on their luck musicians who witness a gangster murder, aka: The St. Valentines's Day Massacre. They go on the run from the gangsters and decide to go to Miami disguised as women while accompanying other traveling female musicians.Billy Wilder directed and co-wrote the adapted screenplay to this film. From this film and his previous past successes, Wilder has displayed a real talent for creative and insightful screenplays. In this film, he uses his social commentary style to positive effect in a cross dressing comedy. 'Some Like it Hot' also makes fun of gangster films. Production values are high: cinematography, art direction and makeup. Wilder actually chose to photograph this film in black and white because of the garish makeup designs of it's two acting leads: Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. 'Some Like It Hot' succeeds on several levels: funny and insightful social commentary and acting. The editing and directing show a natural pacing and rhythm that works very well for a comedy film. One of Hollywood's best ever films of any genre.",9,0,0,5 May 2007
Les Misérables," An engaging musical filled with emotion
","'Les Miserables' (2012) is certainly the most musical of musicals I've ever experienced. This famous Victor Hugo story has been adapted countless times. This ambitious film version features a wide range of characters and the story is told almost entirely through song. I did not have a problem with the highly active cinematography and film editing. Some have criticized the film for excessive camera movement and film editing. 'Les Miserables' has a large scope with many characters. The camera is always moving in for close ups of characters singing. It's an entirely different experience than a stage musical version, where an audience views the story on a large scale. I agreed with the active camera work of the film, to emphasize the emotions of all the characters. There are a couple of comical characters, which I felt weakened the impact of the film. 'Les Miserables' is very much a drama, one about love, honor and redemption. For those who dislike musicals or admire stage musicals, this film version of the famous Victor Hugo story might seem overly long and excessive with emotion and song. I had no problem with it's 157 minute running time. It's a big story that requires significant length to best be told. What's unusual about the making of this film is all the actors are singing live on camera, without post dubbing. Anne Hathaway's strong performance is certainly one of the highlights of the film, in addition to the directing, music score, art direction, costumes and makeup.",9,2,3,30 April 2013
The Departed," An old school style, but surprising and engaging crime thriller!
","'The Departed' / 2006/ Directed by: Martin Scorsese / Written by: William Monahan / Starring: Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen.'The Departed' is a welcome change for director Scorsese from his last few films. Here he returns to an old school style crime thriller. With a first rate cast, an excellent adapted screenplay, strong lead and supporting acting, this film delivers in major aspects. Longtime veteran of Scorsese film's, Thelma Schoonmaker delivers some impressive film editing. The pace and rhythm of the film are near perfect, suiting and serving the story very well. The film begins with Nicholson's character narrating. We quickly learn his character and what he is about. We receive some background information on the story and main characters at this time. The film convincingly shows corruption on both sides of the law. Monahan's adapted screenplay, from 'Infernal Affairs' changes the story setting to present day Boston. Damon's character quickly rises in the Boston State Police Department. DeCaprio gives one of his best acting performances ever as a misguided, violent tough guy with heart. I felt the film deserved two more Academy Award nominations: Jack Nicholson for Best Supporting Actor and Thelma Schoonmaker for Best Film Editing. I was surprised by the humor at the beginning of the film. Though all lead and supporting acting is impressive in this film, Wahlberg's character is my personal favorite here. I liked his tough, tell it like it is, no holes barred style. The film does has a few weaknesses such as the love interest story with the psychiatrist. The acting performance by Vera Farmiga as the psychiatrist is solid and convincing. Her character does serve well to show the personal weaknesses of DeCaprio's and Damon's characters. But it does not serve to move the plot forward. My only other minor complaint is the ending with the rat walking on the balcony railing, not really necessary, but perhaps, a last minute choice for a humorous exclamation point to who the villain really was.",9,1,2,10 February 2007
The Reader," A powerful, authentic and compelling drama
","First of all, I'm surprised and disappointed by the weak reviews this film received from a significant number of critics. In my opinion, 'The Reader' was, by a small margin, the best Hollywood film of 2008. 'Milk', 2008, is also excellent, however, I felt 'The Reader' was a little more powerful and the entire cast gave exceptionally good acting performances, especially newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg, besides the obvious powerful performance of Kate Winslet, as Hanna Schmitz. I considered 'Frost/Nixon', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' and 'Slumdog Millionaire', all from 2008, to be very good, but not excellent films. The five films mentioned here were the five nominees for the Best Picture Oscar of 2008. The feel good 'Slumdog Millionaire' won the Oscar for Best Picture.The story is based on a German novel of 1995, and concerns the remembrance of a long ago summer love affair between a 15 year old boy and a 32 year old woman. This story point apparently was objectionable and distasteful to many critics. I disagree with their perspective. Of course, the behavior of Hanna Schmitz, in the story, is wrong and immoral and could be considered statutory rape. For this offense and the later, more serious offense committed later by Hanna Schmitz, I found myself surprisingly sympathetic to her plight during and after her trial. The story, as depicted in the film, spans 34 years of the life of Hanna Schmitz. 'The Reader' was shot mostly in Germany, where the original story of the novel takes place. I was impressed with the emotional authenticity, weight and honesty of the film. Director Stephen Daldry, with his stage background, does an excellent job obtaining the best possible performances with all of his actors in the film. Daldry certainly knows how to tell a story with significant and authentic emotional impact. The courtroom trial is dramatically authentic, powerful and emotional. There is some raw sexuality in the summer lover affair and it's done with admirable restraint and grace.Though Kate Winslet has given some very good to excellent acting performances before this film, which include five Oscar nominations, I felt this was her most compelling and powerful acting performance ever, since her feature film debut in 'Heavenly Creatures', 1994. This performance in 'The Reader' represents her sixth Oscar nomination, so it was certainly her time to finally win. Winslet has received six Oscar nominations for acting in only 15 years, which is certainly impressive. Most actors and actresses do not even receive a nomination during their entire acting career. Since 2004, it became apparent to me that Winslet was an especially gifted and promising film actress. I have thought of Winslet as 'The Great Kate', since 2004. With time, I believe it is certainly possible for her to reach Meryl Streep's amazing acting achievement of 16 Oscar nominations. After Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet is the film actress I hold with the highest esteem, respect and admiration.Besides Winslet's great acting performance in 'The Reader', I was most impressed with newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg. As a native German speaker, he not only mastered the English language, he proves himself very genuine and sensitive with his acting and has an authoritative voice, in this, his third feature film. I will be watching for future film performances of his, as he appears to have a promising acting future.",10,2,2,9 March 2010
Dark Shadows," Meets expectations from Tim Burton
","'Dark Shadows' is based on the 1966-1971 television series that director Tim Burton was a fan of. Here it becomes a mildly amusing mix of horror, fantasy and comedy. Barnabus Collins becomes a vampire under the spell of a witch and is buried for 200 years. He's accidentally set free and returns to his ancestral family home. Following the dramatic prologue, the film becomes a comedy set in 1972, one year after the television series ended. The Collins family is dysfunctional, which makes for some good comic moments. I've never seen any episodes of the original television series, however, I feel the film would have worked more effectively with a darker, more serious tone. Burton is likely going for popular appeal here. Introducing an old television series to a new generation. Worth a look for Tim Burton fans.",6,0,0,18 May 2012
The Lion King," Bambi set in Africa
","'The Lion King' (1994) is the third better than average Disney film of the 1990's. This is Disney's first film to use an original story instead of the usual classic fairy tale. However the story follows much the same path as all other Disney stories: the hero or heroine is without one parent. 'The Lion King' is best described as 'Bambi' set in Africa. The opening sequence of the film is very impressive: the music, African vocals and animation! Though the rest of the film is not quite up to it's great beginning, it's certainly a very good film overall. 'The Lion King' also marks the first time an on screen death is shown in an animated Disney film. Excluding the opening, this makes for the other most impressive sequence in the film.As with 'Aladdin' (1992), Disney again uses contemporary dialogue to make the film more appealing to their target child and pre-adolescent audiences. Though this weakens the film a little, I believe it was one of the factors that made 'The Lion King' a huge success. The other factor was that it contained only animals, no humans, which certainly appeals to children. 'The Lion King' was written by three screenwriters. Instead of having a completed screenplay, prior to beginning animation, the story was created as the film was being made.'The Lion King' features excellent animation and an excellent music score by Hans Zimmer. The character voices are very good (as usual for Disney). The companion characters to Simba (Pumba and Timone) are entertaining.
'The Lion King' suffers from one major flaw: it's a little preachy and moralizing (more than other Disney films based on fairy tales). Without the preachy, moralizing tone and less contemporary dialogue, 'The Lion King' would have been an excellent film.",Null,0,0,10 February 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," A mostly effective thriller with two excellent acting performances
","Only the third film ever in Academy Award history to sweep the top five awards. Also, the first time a thriller wins a Best Picture Academy Award. 'The Silence of the Lambs' is most famous for Anthony Hopkin's memorable chilling performance as the clever, charming, cultured, well mannered serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter's character is a composite based on several real life serial killers, including Ted Bundy. Jody Foster gives a powerful, intelligent complementary acting performance as the FBI agent trainee recruited to help catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, with the help of Lecter.What's most impressive about the film is the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. They both bring intelligence, believability and a strong minded directness. They play exceptionally well off each other: Lecter is intelligent, but obviously crazy, while Starling is very sane, determined and intelligent enough to match wits and will against the evil, charming, well mannered and clever Lecter.Not having seen the film in several years, with a fresh perspective, it came across to me as an unusually creepy, strange psychological film. That's a compliment. We have a rare portrayal of a transvestite serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The film contains two scenes I've never seen before, ever, in any film. The first involves Clairice Starling at the beginning of the film, shortly after she first meets Hannibal Lecter in the insane asylum dungeon. The second scene is near the end of the film and involves a very bizarre disguise used by Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins performance in this film, is my all time movie villain favorite. As a thriller, it works well most of the time, narrative wise. There are a few factual errors. The film is best when both Hopkins and Foster are on screen together. Then it's quite a powerful and gripping psychological drama.",9,2,3,21 February 2010
Amélie," A imaginative and beautiful romantic fantasy!
","'Amelie' is one of the most beautiful, wonderful and enchanting films I've ever seen! Upon my first viewing, it became one of my most favorite films and I've seen hundreds of films from all over the world. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a wonderfully gifted director with a rich visual imagination. Audrey Tautou portrays the role of Amelie with convincing charm. I think she has a bright acting future, especially after the success of this film.What really sets 'Amelie' apart from most other films are it's art direction, cinematography, use of visual effects and clever, insightful story. The lighthearted French soundtrack is beautiful from beginning to end. I think 'Amelie' would be enjoyable for most anyone, not just film buffs or lovers of French films.No one can really deny that after you watch 'Amelie' you have a smile on your face! Yes, it's a fantasy film, however it shows the little things in life that matter. It's very vivid in it's use of cinematography and visual effects to display a mood or feeling. One of my favorite images of the film is when Amelie, disheartened and disappointed when her would be boyfriend leaves the cafe, dissolves into water and splashes onto the floor of the cafe she works at. This beautifully and poetically captures the feeling most of us would have in a similar situation of a potential love relationship.Highly recommended!",10,3,9,8 December 2004
Apollo 13," An exceptional true life drama comes to cinematic life
","Simply put, 'Apollo 13', 1995, get's it all right: the look, details and emotions. Based on the true story of the the failed Apollo 13 mission. The film really brings back the drama and excitement, of this historical time in NASA's history. Nominated for 9 and won 2 Academy Awards. I'm surprised by the omission of a particular award nomination. Director Ron Howard deserved an Academy Award nomination for his directing. Clearly, this is a director's film. The inspiration shows. Ron Howard did receive a Director's Guild of America Award for Best Director.To me, 'Apollo 13' is just about a perfectly made film. The sense of time and emotion is very true to life. The story is told between three perspectives: the crew of Apollo 13, their families and the mission control center in Houston. Everything from direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, film editing, visual effects and sound, all come together remarkably well in this exceptional film. The film manages to be educational, inspiring and entertaining. That's a rare and special achievement.I was 7 when the mission of Apollo 13 occurred. The look and feel of the film is very accurate. I felt very much like I was back in 1970 again. The attention to technical, personal and environmental details, is what makes this film outstanding. I'm a science/technical minded person. I noticed most of the technical details are accurate, and what was lost in the historical archives (personal and technical), is recreated intelligently and dramatically.The makers of the film definitely did their homework and put some admirable passion, creativity and inspiration into the film, and it shows very much.",10,1,2,25 February 2010
The Social Network," An absorbing, intelligent and timely pop culture technology portrait of the last decade
","'The Social Network' / Directed by: David Fincher / Written by: Aaron Sorkin / Based on the book: 'The Accidental Billionaires' by Ben Mezrich / Released September 2010 (Chicago) / Viewed October 1, 2010* * * * ExcellentI liked this, almost masterpiece of a film, very much. Director David Fincher keeps things moving along at a lively pace and shows a refreshingly original style and mastery of how to best tell the story of the film. Due to the subject matter, this is a case where the product is much more famous than it's creators. Based on the startup of facebook.com by Harvard student Mark Zuckerburg and friend/fellow student, beginning in 2003 on the campus of Harvard University. After telling the beginning/genesis of 'the facebook', as it was known at Harvard at the time, the film then tells the remainder of it's story in flashback, during a double law suit deposition by four Harvard students, alleging Zuckerburg stole the idea of facebook from them.Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin delivers an absorbing and intelligent screenplay with biting humor and wit. The film itself is part social commentary, with some thought provoking statements about the popular influence of social websites and the good and bad of the current Internet information age we live in. Accessing too much information, too quickly, easily and the ability to share it freely with the whole world, presents some problems. Without maturity, wisdom, good judgment and reasoning, harm can be easily done, intentionally or unintentionally. Things can be taken out of context and facts distorted easier than ever before.The film looks and feels very authentic. I was impressed by the focused direction and the intelligent, witty and humorous writing style. The film begins with a good bang. The opening scene is set in a college bar. It's 2003. Mark Zuckerberg and a female friend are having a passionate discussion about many different topics. Zuckerberg is presented as riding a thin line between highly motivated and obsessed with ideas. He's a very intelligent young man and his brain is jam packed with many ideas swirling around at the same time. His female friend comments that, conversing with him, is like being on a stairmaster. It's simply too tiring and also a little confusing.Fincher knows exactly the right pace and rhythm and exactly how to set up and execute each individual scene, while getting some excellent all around acting performances out of his mostly young cast. The first two things I noticed and was impressed by, early into the film, were Jesse Eisenburg's exceptional acting performance as facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and the screenplay. The excellent direction of Fincher then becomes apparent.Jesse Eisenburg nails his role, portraying facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, convincingly, as a highly intelligent, introverted, slightly immature, social inept and nerdy 19 year old Harvard student, who entered Harvard with an impressive, perfect 1600 score on his SAT. He does a great, if unusual job at defending himself against his accusers during the deposition. Also, Justin Timberlake gives a convincing supporting role performance as slightly paranoid, but passionate and driven Napster founder Sean Parker and third startup partner of facebook.'The Social Network' is definitely one of the most timely, intelligent and engaging films to come along in a while.",10,2,5,1 October 2010
Back to the Future," Original, imaginative, clever and highly entertaining.
","I have fond memories of seeing 'Back to the Future' for the first time when first released during the summer of 1985. The audience I saw it with actually applauded at the end of the film, which is rare for a movie. I remember coming back to see it five more times that summer. Yes, it was only 'just a movie', but such an original, clever, imaginative, heartwarming, charming movie. One that is very enjoyable and relate-able to a wide audience. 'Back to the Future' made a big, positive impression on me. I realized I had seen a special, unique film, that might stand the test of time, which it has. I've seen this film many times since 1985 and it has never failed to lift my spirits. It's simply one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.'Back to the Future' was the product of the imagination of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale. The story idea was in genesis for several years. This was the third film of Zemeckis, after 'Use Cars', 1982 did poor box office and 'Romancing the Stone', 1984 became a minor hit.Marty McFly is an average 80's teenager who accidentally gets sent back in time and interferes with the meeting of his mother and father, jeopardizing his very existence. A simple premise, but one really well thought out and done with imagination and heart. It's part comedy, part action-adventure, part science fiction and part drama. All together, a very entertaining and enjoyable film with great appeal.Here's where Zemecicks first showed what would become one of his trademarks: using the same characters in the same setting of different times. This playful manner with history that would fully develop in the visual effect techniques of 'Forrest Gump', 1994.'Back to the Future' is really not much of a visual effects film. What sets 'Back to the Future' apart is, that it focuses on story, characters and circumstances, in a playful, clever and imaginative manner.For science minded viewers, it's the first a time travel film got most of the physics correct about time travel. It broke the old designs of past time travel movies. Here, energy is used to crack open the space time continuum and the trip through time occurs in a fraction of a second.There's some surprisingly heartwarming and charming moments between the main and supporting characters, such as Marty and Doc saying goodbye and Marty talking to his mother and father at the dance after they've been reunited. All the characters and situations are very relate-able, which is part of the films' appeal.Zemecicks knew he had a small film here, so he requested and received a big, rousing, traditional style film music score from Alan Sylvestri. The climax and epilogue/twist ending of the film were especially memorable and engaging. 'Back to the Future' was a critical hit and an enormous box office success, that really launched Zemecicks as a prominent director. The film stayed at number one for 11 weeks, which is the third best ever performance for any movie. It received four Academy Award nominations, the most important and nomination being for Best Original Screenplay. I'm happy this film has stood the test of time to be appreciated and enjoyed by a new generation. In 2007, 'Back to the Future' was added to the National Film Registry as a film of historic or cultural significance. My personal favorite line: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything'.",9,0,0,31 March 2010
The Simpsons Movie," Entertaining and satisfying for casual and die hard fans
","'The Simpsons Movie' / Released: July 27, 2007 / Viewed: July 26, 2007*** GoodI don't really consider myself a fan of The Simpsons, though I have seen the first season episodes on DVD. As this film shows, it's the writing that has made the film such a long running success. A total of 11 writers, including creator Matt Groening, contributed to the film. That's a very large number of writers for a film made in Hollywood, the most I've ever known. I'm guessing the idea was to try make the film have a broad appeal to as many Simpsons fans as possible. Now in it's 18th season, it's the longest running sitcom ever in the U.S. I viewed the film with my sister, who's a fan from when the show first began in 1990. She especially liked the opening and was overall pleased with the film.Though I'm hardly an expert on 'The Simpsons', this film wasn't much different than a typical TV episode of the show. Yes, there is a bigger, more dramatic story here and most of the many characters who have ever appeared on the TV show appear here. There are two firsts that occur, making the film a little unique from the TV show. Faithful to the TV show, the animation is hand drawn, except for a few CGI sequences.The first 15 minutes of the film is impressive with its fast moving slapstick and parody. The film was made in a loose style that is characteristic of the TV show in it's early years. There is parody going on all throughout the film. At the beginning, Homer says: 'I can't believe people would actually pay to see this as a movie when it can be watched for free on TV'.The plan, as announced one year ago, is that there would be one more final season after release of the first film. There has been nothing to contradict this as of yet.The audience I was with was mostly adults, the typical Simpsons audience. Many of it's fans have watched it for 15+ years beginning as children or young adults. I saw the film on a preview screening, one day before it's official nationwide release. I guess that most of the audience were long time Simpsons fans. Most of the audience appeared to enjoy the film all the way through, from beginning to end. There are probably some who will feel a little disappointed as their favorite character did not appear or appeared for too short a time. However it would have weakened the film to try to appeal to all Simpsons fans. Here the aim was to appeal to casual and die hard fans, as much as possible. 'The Simpsons Movie' succeeds in it's goals.",8,2,7,29 July 2007
All the President's Men," Talky historical drama-thriller about the Watergate cover up
","A first rate script and cast come together to make an engaging film based on the book 'All The President's Men'. Long on realism, intelligence and logic, however, short on suspense. Almost entirely a dialogue and character driven film. From the perspective of two Washington Post reporters played convincingly by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Slow pacing helps create a realistic feel for how long a complicated story about powerful people can take to eventually come together. The teletype ending provides effective story closure without resorting to a dramatization of a well known historical event in modern American history.Nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Winner of 4 Oscars including Best Adapted Screenplay.88 / 100",9,2,2,17 August 2008
The Wizard of Oz," A highly charming, heartwarming, imaginative and entertaining film.
","Out of all the films I admire and love, 'The Wizard of Oz', 1939, is the film I love the most, with all my heart. I grew up with annual showings of the film each year, during the 1970's, as many other people did. This helped make the film such a beloved classic.After watching 'The Wizard of Oz', 1939, many times on TV during the 1970's, I finally viewed it in a 1998 theatrical re-release. Though it was not in the sepia tone of the original film, I appreciated the visual imagination of the film much more than before.The 2005 restored and remastered version is definitely more impressive than the 1998 version. Lovingly restored, frame by frame, to it's original sepia tone and Technicolor. The original mono audio track is cleaned up and expanded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The film looks and sounds better than ever. The film restoration is the best I've ever seen for a 1930's film. The quality of this 2005 restoration is claimed to be better than many of the theater prints of the film back in 1939, which were copies of copies. 'The Wizard of Oz' is based on one of Frank L. Baum's series of 'Oz' books, first published in 1900. The original book, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz', is widely regarded as one of the best children's' books of the 20th century. Most everyone familiar with movies, is at least somewhat familiar with the story of Dorothy and Kansas, which was changed, in it's film adaption. Dorothy is whisked away from her farm home in Kansas by a tornado into the magical land of Oz, befriends a scarecrow, lion and tin man, as she seeks out the Wizard of Oz, all the time pursued by the Wicked Witch of the West, for her precious ruby slippers. Dorothy's fantasy journey, from the original book, was here changed to a dream. It was thought movie audiences of the time would be reluctant to accept an all out fantasy. Dorothy's slippers were changed from silver, in the original book to red ruby, which could be shown off better in Technicolor.Judy Garland was just 16 at the time of filming, four years older than the character of Dorothy in the original book. I love Garland's acting performance in this film, as much as I love the film as a whole. This is her first big acting role in a Hollywood feature length film, and she does a terrific job. Her acting performance in 'The Wizard of Oz', is genuinely charming, sweet and sincere. Judy Garland is definitely the big acting highlight of the film. Much credit goes to director Victor Fleming, for getting such a good acting performance from Judy Garland and from the cast in general. At the time the film was released, actors under the age of 18, could not be nominated for an Academy Award for acting. During 1940, Judy Garland won a 'mini' Academy Award for 'Outstanding Performance by a Juvenile Actor', for her work in 'Babes in Arms' and 'The Wizard of Oz', both released in 1939. In my opinion, her acting performance deserved a Best Actress in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination. The voting rules were different back then. An actor under the age of 18 could not be nominated in the usual two categories of Best Lead Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress.Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, the film won for Best Original Song for 'Over the Rainbow' and Best Original Music Score. I completely agree with The American Film Institutes' choice of 'Over the Rainbow', as the greatest movie song ever. The Record Industry Association of America (RIAA), voted it: Song of the Century. A very famous, beloved and charming song, indeed. The film deserved to be nominated for Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Makeup (if the category existed at that time) and Best Costume Design.Victor Fleming was already nominated for Best Director for 'Gone With the Wind' of the same year. Actually, Fleming had much more to do directing 'The Wizard of Oz', than 'Gone With the Wind', where he was one of four directors. Fleming directed all of the Oz sequences in 'The Wizard of Oz', which is most of the film. Art direction, cinematography, sound and visual effects are all excellent. The famous tornado scene, was done long before computer graphics were possible, and yet, looks great. The famous transition from sepia toned black and white to Technicolor, was a movie first and one of the many inspired imaginative decisions made for the film.There's a lot to admire and be charmed by, in the film. The story is timeless because it's universal: the importance of home, discovering oneself, intelligence, heart and courage. The film contains a number of famous and memorable quotes, the most famous being: 'We're not in Kansas anymore'. 'I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too' is a favorite line of mine from the film. The ending of the film has three memorable lines: 'Hearts will never be practical, until they can be made unbreakable', 'A person's heart is judged not by how much they have loved, but by how much they have been loved by others' and 'There's no place like home'.",9,3,4,1 June 2010
