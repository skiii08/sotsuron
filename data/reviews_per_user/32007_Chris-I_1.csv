Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How did it get such bad reviews?
","I wondered why Star Wars: The Phantom Menace got such poor reviews.  I read a few and found that what was mentioned could only be seen well from a critic's eye.  I must say the fights were beautifully programmed/choreographed and there were a couple questions that were cleared up.  Lucas could have held the area/panoramic shots a little longer, but it was done well despite that.  I'm already impatient for the next episode to come out!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
