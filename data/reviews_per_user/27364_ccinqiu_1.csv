The Blair Witch Project," Below Expectations :(
","I was expecting quite a bit from this movie, since I have heard many positive reviews on it. But in the end this movie turned out quite disappointing. I'm not sure this is considered a spoiler, but either ways, after a while I found that the characters were getting quite annoying. Even though it made you want to just shove their face into a tree hole, it was very realistic. Of course things are going to get annoying when you're frustrated and lost, so that was quite nice, the acting was great! But I watched this movie hoping I would get a little scare, but I ended up disappointed. :( It wasn't really scary. The ending was also quite confusing and in my opinion, not in a good way. Sometimes movies have awesome confusing endings which keeps you guessing. This ending was just plain unexplained and, once again, annoying.",3,0,2,8 January 2014
