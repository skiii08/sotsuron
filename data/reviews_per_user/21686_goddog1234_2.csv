","When you take part of the real story out, because you think it will offend the extremist, you should not have anything to do with the entertainment business.

The New World," worst
","This is one of the few times I've ever seen people walking out. I felt I was watching a cheesy perfume commercial. There was nothing but whispers from the actors. The only reason I stayed because I just new there had to be a moral to the story. Guess what, I was wrong. I left the theater wondering who would release something so meaningless and boring. I now know why this film bombed. DO NOT WAST YOUR TIME!!!!! A few people have told me that when they release movies this bad they hire people to get on sites like this one and give it a great review. They were right or these people need to get out a little more. Once again, do not see this movie IT SUCKS.",1,18,30,21 February 2006
