Ali," Good Movie
","Despite it's two and a half hour running time, I found this an easy movie to sit through.  It was entertaining.  I am a huge boxing fan, and this had some great boxing scenes.  Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all put up great performances.  I've always been a Muhammad Ali fan and this was a great biopic of him.  See it now.

Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining
","This entertaining movie strains a bit and becomes a little bit repetative, but it is very entertaining.  Steven Spielberg does a great job directing, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and especcially Christopher Walken put up Oscar diserving performances.  See this movie now, its an entertaining popcorn flick with some great performances and directing. B+",10,0,1,29 January 2003
