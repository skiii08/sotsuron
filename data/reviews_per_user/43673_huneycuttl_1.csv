First Man," The most realistic space movie ever made.
","This movie is neither 'Right Stuff' or 'Apollo 13' Part Two. Instead, it's a film that shows the awful price that had to be paid in order to make the moon landing happen. It shows the dedication of those involved, and leads us through the 1960s, never letting us forget that winning the Space Race was not a foregone conclusion, and that good men died along the way trying to make it happen.The space scenes are shot from an angle we haven't seen before, and yes, it does provide a bit of claustrophobia and vertigo, all the more if you are watching on an IMAX.The film is also moody and introspective, and one of the big questions is whether the moon landing was worth it. On a national level, it was expensive and sometimes divisive. On a personal level, Armstrong ultimately lost his marriage and years watching his boys grow up.I will be thinking about this film for a very long time, and lan to see it again this weekend.",10,1,3,16 October 2018
