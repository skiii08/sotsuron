Saturday Night Fever," a movie in conflict with itself
","having recently seen 'saturdy night fever' for the first time since adolescence i was struck by how much i previously had failed to see in the this movie. when i was a kid 'saturday night fever' was a movie about dancing, about going out, and about being young and with your friends. now, when i see this film, what i see instead is a man grappling with his identity as he separates from the world he was given. despite his realization that there may be more to life then working at the hardware store, travolta's character is unaware that one can evolve without losing sight of who they were. the only figure he has to look to for guidance in this is a woman who has sold out her past in an effort to be bought by the future she believes will save her.",8,2,4,22 April 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," see it.
",Borat is hilarious. I was cracking up the whole time. It's kind of sad that the only way to present this subject matter is through extremely inappropriate jokes. The rodeo was soo funny. The character of borat was extremely outrageous. Getting a bear for protection instead of a gun was priceless. Each scene was more and more crazy. This film really pushed the envelope as far racial jokes go. I liked how that the prostitute was one of the only people he was able to treat with respect. The naked wrestling scene was very intense. I liked this movie a lot. I think everyone should watch it. It really puts a mirror up to America and the image is not pretty.,8,0,5,27 March 2007
