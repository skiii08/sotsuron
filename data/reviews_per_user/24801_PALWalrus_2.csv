The Blair Witch Project," A cult? Yes. A great movie? I think not!!!
",While this film has received a cult following in a very short time and the concept is intriguing I must admit that this was just not a very good movie.The trouble with cult movies is that objectivity seems to go out the window and the film is not judged on its merits. This is one that falls into that category.,3,0,1,8 December 1999
Thirteen Days," Absolute drivel
","Factually inaccurate, poor performances and scripts...just another sounding board for the Hollyweird left wing. Save your money and just buy a Democratic manifesto...absolute rubbish...The only redeeming feature was the uncanny likeness of Steven Culp to Bobby Kennedy. If you want a laugh just concentrate on Kevin Costner's accent...",2,4,14,23 August 2001
