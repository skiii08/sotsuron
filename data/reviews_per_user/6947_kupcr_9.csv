Ghost," This Is NOT A Horror, More Of A Romantic One
","I decided to watch this one again after so many years. It is indeed one of my favourite Whoopi Goldberg movies. She's WONDERFUL in this. I loved her work since 'Colour Purple' and 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. In 'Ghost', she plays a medium named Oda Mae Brown who may not have people's best interests in heart and she gets entangled in a sheme that gets people killed. I hope you will watch this film, since it does have Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in this. The story follows a banker by the name of Sam Wheat who is in love with Molly, played by Moore. I really appreciated how she was able to immerse herself in her character, with the late Swayze's becoming more and more emotionally tied to her, but Sam's friend Carl, played excellently by Tony Goldwyn, eventually shows his true colours and they discover that he was not to be trusted.",8,0,0,27 May 2020
Erin Brockovich," Julia's A Force Majeure
","I had to really think really hard before I wrote this review, because of the type of film this is and loosely based on the real Erin Brokovitch, a hard-to-believe yet true story of a foul-mouthed ex-beauty queen, given to wearing skin-tight skirts and revealing blouses. I like Julia as an actress and it's not the first time Julia Roberts has marched through like a force of nature in her films. I can't take her for granted as to let you know the movie 'Erin Brokovitch' has given her some of the best dialog. Julia Roberts really has fire in her eyes as she grabs this eponymous role, injecting the character with great energy and drive she can muster. Her acting performance makes her a true star. Albert Finney also gives this role as real-life lawyer Ed Masry, a powerful performance and that's why I give this film an 8/10 because how Roberts and Finney make an excellent team!",8,0,0,29 May 2020
Face_Off," Travolta And Cage Battle It All!
","This movie is a typical John Woo film and has it's brilliant and action-packed moments. Director John Woo can really direct an action movie. If you look closely sometime during the action scenes, you'll notice that the stunt doubles for both Cage and Travolta don't look like them, but it is a movie and you don't really notice. The 'Face/Off' plot is an impossibility, but after all it is the star power of Travolta and Cage who make this film and pairing the two actors make me give the film a 9 out of 10! This movie is worth a look and does help when RT gives it 92%. I totally agree!",9,0,0,22 May 2020
Taken," Liam Neeson Strikes Again
","What an awesome movie, if you like Neeson who is part of a plot derived from 'real' life about the sex trade and anything that can happen when you throw in a guy named Marco from Tropoja. This movie contains a lot of action, like a great car chase and a foot chase. Neeson plays Brian Mills, an ex-Militia man, who's daughter Kimmie, Maggie Gr√¢ce, is abducted along with her friend Amanda, as they arrive in Germany to follow a band. Things go bad and Mills goes after his daughter, killing anyone who gets in his way! Neeson has one of the best dialog sequences of a phone call with his daughter's abductor that ends the phone call, 'Good luck!' This movie is worth watching simply for that, but overall I give it an 8/10",8,0,0,3 June 2020
Pitch Perfect 2," Anna Kendrick Wins Again
","Becca and the rest of the Bellas are at it again, as they try to keep up with their Acapella. In this movie, there's trouble when a German acapella singing group from Copenhagen appears on the scene and they try to win the next prize at a competition there. Another Bella arrives, Hailee Steinfeld, named Emily who tries to
Sell a song she wrote. It's still a great movie. The singing is great. It's a laugh a minute and Anna Kendrick is still ACA-wonderful!",8,0,0,3 June 2020
Speed," A Suspenseful Ride A Minute!!
","This is the kind of suspenseful action thriller with Keanu Reeves that has you guessing until the very end. Here, he plays a confident and over-bearing cop named Jack and Sandra Bullock's Annie Porter is something not to be toyed with and when she is paired up with Jack, she's a raving sparkler, strong and caring, so have no fear, Jack and Annie are here. Don't forget that Dennis Hopper is a psychotic terrorist and would do anything to get what he wants. I don't know if you like Jeff Daniels as an actor, but he plays Harry, Jack's friend and Joe Morton plays a supporting character. I suggest you watch this movie and decide whether you like it or not.",8,0,0,15 June 2020
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," a Most Excellent Time Travelling Party!
","I haven't seen this most audacious film in a long time, but when I heard that the 3rd instalment 'Bill & Ted Face The Music' will be released in August 2020, I knew had to watch this most excellent first film, again. I'll tell ya, this is just a laugh a minute, as two unsuccessful musicians Ted 'Theodore' Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) get a visitor from a time traveller named Rufus, played by George Carlin, who tell Bill & Ted that they have to pass their history report in order to save the world. There's a lot of hilarious banter between them and the laughs start when Bill & Ted meet different historic characters, such as Billy The Kid and interact with Napoleon. The part where Napoleon takes over Waterloo Waterslide is the most funniest! I can't get enough of this most excellent movie, so '...be excellent to each other and....PARTY ON DUDE!'",9,0,0,11 June 2020
Me Before You," Worth Every Minute
","I really appreciated how this movie played out, adequately depicting a couple who have loss and pain and how much we take for granted. I felt drawn towards these characters, especially kind-hearted Louisa (Emilia Clarke), who has such a caring heart, that when she found employment as a care giver for a Quadriplegic named William (Sam Claflin), you feel like you are part of their life, you laugh at the humour they both bring into the situation, and in their pain, I discovered a glimmer of hope, life and love as they cope day by day. Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Jenna Coleman (Clara, Dr. Who) and Joanna Lumley (AbFab) are supporting actors. To tell you the truth, I didn't have enough Kleenex.",9,1,1,23 June 2020
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler NEVER Gives Up
","I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler, but The Wedding Singer is an exception. Sandler plays a wedding singer named Robbie Hart who is jilted at the alter and his life suddenly goes into a tailspin, until he meets Julia (Drew Barrymore). I love this situation comedy. As we go back to the 80's, it was like a flashback in time. The hair the clothes and the music. This was the first movie Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler did together. She was about to marry a horrid rich jerk. Only to fall for the awkward goofy wedding singer. Their chemistry was like meeting a date for the first time. The cast was fair at best. It was a cute movie. And yes Billy Idol did have a cameo as himself at the end.",9,0,0,18 May 2020
