Mission: Impossible III," If you liked The Fugitive, you'll like this movie.......
","As the credits fade we are instantly out of the gate and at a full gallop. The suspense, action, and emotional roller coaster never stops in this exciting film. True about three quarters of the way through I did figure out the bad guy but, It added an additional realm to the movie in the way salt adds flavor to food.Special effects, stunts and casting compliment one another.This is not a movie to take you're girl to nor is it for the tender hearted. This is an action movie that has been waited for for to long from the movie industry. Time has answer the call of those who wish to be on the edge of there seat for the entire movie experience. This is a must see film..............",10,1,3,6 May 2006
