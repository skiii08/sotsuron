The King's Speech," Best film I have seen for ages. Don't miss it!
","I was lucky enough to see this wonderful film, having dragged two friends along as well. We all agreed it is the best film we have seen for ages. This deserves all the praise that it is getting, for this is truly a brilliant movie in every department. Story, acting, direction and production values.The story is very engaging right from the first scene and told in a brisk pace and laced with humor. The acting is terrific throughout, truly stunning and deserving of the acclaim they receive. Colin Firth is truly exceptional, and in his scenes in public with his stammer are excruciating to watch. Geoffery Rush matches him step for step as the unorthodox therapist and Helen Bonham Carter is excellent as usual. Guy Pearce and Timothy Spall act their parts incredibly well.There are plenty of films about the monarchy, but The King's Speech is more about the personal story of a man who reluctantly became King. So often films that receive the 'hype' such has 'The King's Speech' has done, you watch with anticipation, then wonder what all the fuss has been about, I can only say it surpassed all the expectations that I had. You do not need to have any particular thoughts, for, against or neutral in regards to the Royal Family to enjoy the film, it's that good it will captivate your attention from the off. l loved this movie and it has been an inspiration to many l am sure who suffer with the same impediment. Overall a very entertaining true story. I will watch it again.",10,0,1,5 July 2014
