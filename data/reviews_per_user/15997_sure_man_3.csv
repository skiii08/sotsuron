The Equalizer," Overrated
","Visually appealing yet remarkably devoid of content and vitality. But that's what a Hollywood 'action potboiler' is supposed to be all about, isn't it? I'm not sure what I was expecting, and yes, I'll have to reflect on that, but ridiculously slicing-and-dicing and hole punching and barbwire garroting, etc., the generic Russian prison tattooed bad guys in the local hardware warehouse left me cold and annoyed I'd shelled out the price of a ticket. I wonder how it would have played if he'd worked at Dunkin' Donuts? Admittedly, the bad guy was venal and repulsive, just another 'thug doing his job' (trained on the streets of Grozny?) when no one else on the oligarch's staff can get the job done - and he got his just desserts. Yay! And the reformed teenager finding him on the street at the end to thank him? You're kidding, right?",4,8,15,26 October 2014
Ex Machina," Faking It
","OMG, she didn't mean it and she was just leading the poor guy on? Using him? I wonder if there isn't just a touch of misogyny in the writing here. What if the character genders of the had been reversed with the same psycho-sexual thread running through everything? What kind of entertainment would that have been? The Turing test in this case wasn't so much if you could distinguish the human from the machine based on dialogue, but rather more incisively whether the two could be distinguished based on feeling. It is clear that Ava had no feelings, feelings that were recognizable to the audience – apart from an innate hostility to being caged / imprisoned – and the one off of 'How does it feel to know what you've created hates you?' I didn't think this was developed enough. Whether it is possible to acquire feelings, and understand them, is a question posed, vaguely, and left unresolved with Ava's liberation and entry into society in general. She didn't care about Caleb other than as a means of escape, and we, the audience, were beguiled by this plot device. In the end leaving him trapped by his own feelings. But did she even have the capacity for caring? We'll never know and it's left up to our imaginations. Something akin to whether an orgasm was experienced in the other, or whether it was simply faked. Or if it matters.I suppose the McGuffin is assuming Ava could distinguish between captivity and freedom. How would she know (unless programmed), or was this simply a plot device?",6,3,7,26 May 2015
The Secret Life of Pets," Sadly, this movie is a mess.
","Just because it's a cartoon with vivid colors and non-human characters doesn't necessarily make this something for kids. There are many LOL moments but these are undercut and ultimately sabotaged by large swathes of unfunny scenes punctuated by unpleasant (and unnecessarily nasty) dialogue, images and themes. They dragged down the entire effort. Our expectations, based on the amusing but highly selective individual scenes-out-of-context preview(s), were profoundly betrayed by the committee that put this together. Clearly everyone was not on the same page and that's too bad because wiser heads whose vanity was set aside could have made the end result so much better.",3,3,10,27 July 2016
