The Avengers," a spectacle..literally!!
","The shot of all the avengers standing in the circle..that sold it for me. This is as good and fun as a superhero movie can get.Its too good to spoil. Joss Whedon takes four different visions of directors and makes it his own. This is the ultimate pay off for marvel's five years of planning and hard work. The team dynamics Whedon captured perfectly in 'firefly' are in full display here. Every person has motive and a relation with the other. Special mention to the HULK. You literally don't see anything when he is on the scree. This is the peak of entertainment. The stunning action, the witty dialog makes it irresistible.Avengers makes it fun to be a geek. If you like intelligent humor, thrilling story and larger than life action in your movie, then Avengers is for you. There were claps, cheers and shouts all around in the cinema. In this day when you think you have seen it all, that's an achievement in itself. How I wish it were 3 hrs long. Don't miss it!",8,9,18,27 April 2012
The Artist," didn't expect to like it so much...
","THE ARTIST, is a film that proves that words are not the only medium of expression. I never thought that a silent, black and white film could be so charming. The visual metaphors it employs are just amazing.The credit has to lie with the director Micheal hazanavicius for choosing to treat this subject in such a lovely manner. Check out the dream sequence where George Valentin goes silent when every thing else begins to sound. The scene alone can convey so many emotions, and there are many like that.Do watch it by all means. It deserves to be seen, to be understood and appreciated. If you can, try watching it without the Oscar baggage. You will enjoy even more.",10,1,5,27 February 2012
