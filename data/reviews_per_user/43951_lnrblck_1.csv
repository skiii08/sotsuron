The Lobster," not a COMEDY
","Not funny at all. Waste of time. Interesting cast and bilingual scenes. And the idea of the hotel. But nothing to laugh there. Hope people won't mark a comedy tag to movies, when it's got nothing to do with it. OK, more lines needed, so here you go: horrible, long, brutal, sad and pathetic in many ways. The trailer was funny though. That's the one star.",1,2,3,28 September 2017
