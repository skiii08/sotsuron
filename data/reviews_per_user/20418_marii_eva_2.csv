Howl's Moving Castle," Absolutely Beautiful...Watch It!!
","I came across Howls Moving Castle and was wondering if the hype was going to be justifiable, was it really that good. But I decided I'd watched it anyway and can I just say I was absolutely stupid, an idiot I should add, to think that this film wasn't going to be enjoyable or any good because it was undoubtedly magical.I personally just loved Christian Bale's voice as 'Howl', his tone was so simple and soft, certainly enough for me to fall in love with him, and Jean Simmons as Sophie quite honestly stole the show at her comedic timing she brought the such fun and love to the film and certainly made it more homely to watch.The film's score and music was magnificent and I will be listening to it again.Highly recommended to all you Hayao Miyazaki skeptics. This is a great start into Ghibli Animation.",10,0,1,24 August 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful and Powerful Story telling
",i tried my best to avoid this film because i was 15 when this film actually came out and wasn't even mature to understand and i always avoided Oscar type movies...but last year i actually remembered this film and how i avoided it like the plague...i was numbed by Heath Ledgers performance he is truly remarkable and how he didn't win an Oscar for it really has shocked me...Jake Gyllenhaal was great he made Ennis and Jack's relationship beautiful in his role also but Heath Ledger without a doubt stole the show...he makes acting look like a piece of cake and its hurts to know he isn't alive anymore and why it took me this long to actually watch this film... i was crying with Ennis and i truly fell in love with him and i can also feel what he feels without having never felt that pain personally myself Heath Ledger will never be replaced...never in my day and age did i think we could lose such a superb actor...its hard especially when you enjoy watching this one of a kind on the screen.. Anyhow this film has become a favourite for me forever and has changed my views also 10/10 simply beautiful and the score adds to the effects of numbness,10,8,8,7 August 2008
