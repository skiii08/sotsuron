The Blair Witch Project," Pretty bad movie..
","This movie wasn't my think. There was some scary scenes in this movie but this was more documentary movie than horror film. The ending was good but it still was pretty weird. Anyway, I saw yesterday that IMDb recommended this movie for me and I watched it today. I was excited about what happens in this movie and I thought this could be good horror movie but it wasn't... I was disappointed when I watched the movie. One of the parodys from this film in Scary Movie was funny. This movie has some power of horror but just a little bit. If you have seen this movie, what have you guys thought about it? This was my critic from this day and I hope that you will find some better movies than this in the future. Thank you!",3,2,5,22 May 2016
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Born
","Wow, I really mean wow! This movie blew my mind right away it begun. I have never thought that Lady Gaga could act that good as she did in this movie. She made a great performance and I hope that we'll see her in another movies in the future. I have always liked Lady Gaga's voice and in this movie she can show herself more than just a pop star even though she starts to make pop music in the middle of the movie. I prefer her singing more in rock music, for example, in 'Shallow', but she still can sing in any song.
The soundtrack in this movie is absolutely perfect! How could you ever do such a good duet song as 'Shallow'? It has became one of my favourite songs and I always enjoy it when I can hear the song somewhere. The soundtrack is on my list on Spotify because it's so good! I just want to say that Bradley Cooper made one of the best movies in 2018 and it should have won more than just one Oscar, especially Lady Gaga should have been awarded from Best Actress. Thank you for reading my review!",10,0,2,22 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Really good movie!
","We just watch this movie in school and I thought that this movie was so good! I have never seen so good movie as this is. This is not my favorite movie but I would like to put it one of the best movie of all time list. Tom Hanks was good actor and deserved his Oscar. The actress of Jenny was really good too and I would like to give her the Oscar too. If you want so see this movie then watch it! This movie gives me some chills and some power of the excellent movie. Robert Zemeckis is one of the greatest director I know. Haven't you seen it? Then buy it for your DVD or Blu-Ray. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!!",10,10,17,27 May 2016
The Shining," My favorite movies of all time!! <3
","I haven't seen so good movie as The Shining! I almost love every Stanley Kubrick's film but this is the best Stanley Kubrick's movie and my favorite movie ever. When I see Shelley Duvall nowadays, I feel bad for her. She made an excellent acting performance in this movie. Two Razzie nominees were really useless. But anyway, I love the movie so so much! You have to watch it, it's never too late to watch it. This movie is really one of those classic horror movies of all time. I have watched it already maybe 10 times or more... I am honest now and say: Stanley Kubrick still lives even he's already dead, in my heart <3 Thank you, Stanley Kubrick for great movie moments I have spent with you. You are my favorite movie director always! <3",10,3,5,23 January 2017
The Exorcist," One of the best horror movies of all time!
","I watched this movie tonight and when I saw it, I said to myself: I loved it very much! Acting was really good and this movie deserves those 2 Oscars. This movie really can teach something to us, like what are we doing? We can say some bad words and be mean to other people. I learned something really important about people around us. We should think what are we doing. We can't just say some bad words if we don't have any reason to say them. I will watch this movie again and again for many years. People can mean to others but we have to think what we're saying to other people. God is important to all of us maybe (well, some of you maybe). Go ahead and watch it!",9,1,1,2 August 2016
La La Land," This was one of the best movies I've seen this year
","I was in the movie theatre today with my sister and we waited for that the movie will start. Finally we get to the cinema hall and we ate some popcorns. Anyway the movie finally started after commercials and the first scene was pretty good. After the first music scene, the real movie started. We watched the movie while eating popcorns. But the movie was the important thing in that hall. After a while there was a scene from 'Rebel Without A Cause' (1955). I have seen the movie of course but the most important thing in the movie was the respect to old classic movies especially 'Rebel Without A Cause' and of course 'Casablanca' (1942). There were also a scene where the man and the woman went to the observation and danced through the stars. That scene was so good that I get chills from it. The love story between that man and woman was romantic description about what can you exprerience in the jazz bars. Emma Stone deserve the Oscar from her acting performance and was singing very beautifully about her grandmother. The movie was really good and one of the best movies I've seen in my entire year! I'm really thankful to the cast and of course the director. Thank you from me to all movie makers!",9,1,7,4 March 2017
Psycho," Best horror movie!
","Alfred Hitchcock's movies are so scary, even this one! I have never seen so scary as this is. How Gus Van Sant can do another film from this movie what's the same as this?! Doesn't he have any idea what movie he's directing? Well I can say, no one can not make any good rip-off from this movie! I loved it and still do. This movie really is one of the best movies of all time! If any of you haven't seen it, well I say that you better watch it before it's too late. This movie lives forever and give some chills of horror. I'm really big horror fan and I think this movie should win Oscar! Not just be nominated for Oscar. If you hate the movie, you should watch it again and come back. When you have seen it again, you can think as I do now. Go on watch it now!!",8,0,1,2 August 2016
