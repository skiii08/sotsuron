The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What Happened?
","I am not sure why Breaking Dawn Part 1 didn't hit me between the eyes but after considerable thought I think it's because it took 1.5 years to get here after Eclipse. Also, the acting was horrible. The movie was way too long for the plot it was supposed to portray. From the beginning it seemed staged from Alice's obvious wig to Edward smirking with doe eyes in almost every shot. I am not a teenager, in fact I am a grandmother. I was introduced to the Twilight phenom by my daughter a few years ago when she gave me a very used copy of Twilight. I absolutely loved the books and then the 3 DVD's that I watched over and over. Was I excited to see Breaking Dawn? You bet, but as I stated above is was fair at best.Kristen Stewart, Billy Burke and the actress playing Bella's mother did the best acting job with enough exposure in the film to determine their performance. The other actors - the Cullen family - didn't seem to be a true part of the movie. Why didn't we see more of Ashley, Nikki, Kellan and Rathbone??? To me, there is no reason to have 2 parts to Breaking Dawn. Making the movie a bit longer and more precise would have been the thrill I was looking for. I am disappointed in Stephanie Meyer for botching up her own story. Is this all an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the 3 previous movies by making this movie two parts? The very best part of the entire movie was Bella's transformation from human to vampire with the kicker being opening her eyes at the close of the movie. I wanted this type of thrill in the rest of the movie but it failed to delight.I am in no hurry to see Part 2 and don't even know when it will be 'revealed'. I just hope it is not the dud that Part 1 turned out to be.",Null,15,23,22 November 2011
