Iron Man 3," I am sad. I was not prepared for how bad this is.
","I think I have figured how Iron Man 3 got a 7.5+ rating this early in the release process. I think many Tony Stark / Iron Man series fans went to the movie (as did I) with a strong predilection to like the movie (as did I). I was ready and excited for a great flick.Sadly at around 38 minutes into the movie, I found myself checking my watch again to see if I shouldn't have seen enough that it would start making sense. I would find myself checking my watch many times after that, wondering when this movie was going to be over. I am sad to report that this episode is tragically long.I've loved this Iron Man series (some better than others). But now, this current Iron Man 3 element seems to be part of the series only in that you recognize some of the gear, mostly suits that work poorly or not at all and of course we all recognize Pepper and Tony Stark. And if you've seen none of the previous movies in the series, I suspect you will be completely lost. What is with all these unexplained round light sources in the chest and hands of Stark and the gear? Admittedly it would be very difficult to explain all of that without showing all the previous releases but just a heads up to those getting into the series late; save your money. I am still sitting here bewildered by how this movie got released. I am still sad I find myself writing a negative review for anything 'Iron Man' related. Honestly, I'm not sure why I even gave it a three star. Memories perhaps.",3,3,6,26 June 2013
