Casablanca," An American staple that stands as a timeless classic
","Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, staring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. In the realm of American films, Casablanca is as well regarded as Gandhi or Einstein, and for good reason. You can make the argument about the films political messages regarding the time period, but nothing overall hinders the movie, in my opinion. Like most other movies of the time, the cinematography is excellent, not very exciting but well made none the less. Curtiz also uses dark lighting in an excellent way, in fact one could make the argument that this film is total film noir because of Curtiz's obsession with shadows. Otherwise, in terms of content, nothing else about the movie really stands out, with maybe the exception of the mini airfield they made for the movie. What keeps Casablanca as a hallmark in our collective movie going memory is the love story. With the exception of the part where Rick just casually asks Ilsa if she wanted to get married, a truly boss move on Bogart's part, the love story feels very natural, and realistic. Even a violence craving, Scorsese/Tarantino loving person like myself can't help but feel the plight of Rick and Ilsa, two humans in an extreme rut. 9/10",9,2,3,2 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," What a glorious feeling
","Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 Arthur Freed Musical directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly. Staring Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood and Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. I'm not a big musical person, but even i found myself enjoying this movie, of course i prefer the version of the title song used in A Clockwork Orange. It's a very fun movie to watch, even though it's incredibly corny and campy. Like most films of the time, there isn't a lot of camera work that stands out. There are a few shots that stuck with me, like the dream sequence of Don Lockwood's fantasy musical, and some of the early back story scenes, but all-in-all i won't look back on this movie for the camera angles. This movie brings its A- game in its music. The score for the movie is near perfect, with varying genres and perfectly executed choreography. I almost broke my foot trying to tap dance like Gene Kelly. Unfortunately, the quality of the dancing didn't transfer to the story. The story wasn't bad, i liked it, in fact i thought it had a pretty creative concept, but i was expecting a whole lot more coming from a movie which placed 5th on AFI's top 100 movies list. Still though, the movie succeeds, and not even all these flaws can stop the sun in my heart, cause i'm ready for love! 8/10",8,0,1,3 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," A champion of non-linearity, dialog, and art-house film.
","Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. Staring Jon Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as two B.A.M.F's and Bruce Willis as Butch. Let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie. I've seen Pulp more than any other movie, in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for Pulp. That being said, Tarantino really showed that he's got game in this film. Many people say that he's just a really big fan simply 'steals' shots from other directors, and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots, but Tarantino manages to make it his own every time. Even if the set up is exactly the same, the shots he uses are able to stay 'Tarantino- esque'. Its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out, as the cinematography, editing, sound, story, acting, and even the wardrobe stands out. What makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story. Its non-linear, its almost aggressively non-linear. For years i've been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean, i'm sure there's something there, but i haven't really been able to figure it out. That being said though, it doesn't hold the movie back. At the end of the day, this movie is everything a good movie could be. Go watch it, go obsess over it, go talk about it, go go go! 10/10",10,1,3,9 May 2013
