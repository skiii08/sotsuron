Despicable Me 2," Despicable 2 , not as good as first part but definitely worth watching.
","Animation flicks are the best way to beat the mood. It brings a smile on your face , cheers you and relishes the spirit within.

Insidious: Chapter 2," Spooky Less !!!
","Nail biting , nerve-breaking and curiosity is part of watching a horror movie. If you have tense moments engaged in any horror , then half of the director's job is done in scaring people. Insidious 2 fails to live up to the expectations raised by the director of The Conjuring and Saw.The Lambert family has moved to a new house but the ghost of the past is haunting them. The family must seek a way to fight off the evil before something serious happens in the house.Looking at the trailer of Insidious 2 made me excited about watching the movie, especially the first part had its share of scary moments. As the movie begin, not much justice has been done to spooky moments. The movie gives you tense moments but those are few in number to scare the hell out of you. James Wan is not in form this time. The process to create a haunting scenario is not upto the mark. The story is good but the screenplay is loose. Even the cinematography is ordinary. Performances by Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson is refreshing.Overall , I felt slight disappointed with spooky-less flick. Average 2.5/5",6,1,2,17 December 2013
Moneyball," Brad Pitt does it all through his break through performance !!!
","A true story about a baseball team's general manager and how he used computer gimmicks to analyze the performance of individual player and led it to 20 win record. The movie was very well directed along with riveting performances by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Billy Beane( Brad Pitt) is under pressure with the lowest salary constraint in his baseball team. To salvage his team's reputation to win the world series championship, he takes help from Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to analyze the statistics of the individual team player and uses the data to re-invent the team. He faces lot of criticism from his management, coach but things takes a Topsy turn when the Oakland A's begins to win the streak of games and records a 20 consecutive win for the first time in 103 years of American League baseball. Moneyball is inspired by true story of Billy Beane and is based on a novel of the same name. Bennet Miller , director of Oscar nominated 'Capote' has done a full justice to a very motivational story of a man who silenced his detractors after facing lot of criticism. The script was handled very efficiently along with a powerful performance by Brad Pitt. His acting has grown over the years and this we can observe from the choice of films he is doing. He emotes everything through his eyes and expression itself makes this film worth a watch. This is first time Jonah Hill has taken a serious role and he was very impressive as in the supporting role. Philip Seymour was just about OK in a small role. An actor of his caliber could have been given more meatier role. The cinematography was outright with soothing background score. Overall , an amazing inspiring sports film which is definitely worth a watch thanks to enduring performance by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and superb direction. Very good : 4/5",8,0,1,30 December 2011
The Avengers," It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.
","Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.

Million Dollar Arm," A nice , brave attempt with wonderful direction and hard-hitting performances. A must watch for every Indian
","Million Dollar Arm was one of the most under-rated film which will inspire and motivate you with head-strong story of two boys who succeeded and achieved within short span of time.Million Dollar Arm tells story of a sports agent who travels to India to look for the best arm-pitcher for a major league baseball team. Hats off to Craig Gillespie for choosing a difficult subject and bring out the true story of 2 Indian boys coming from a remote village. He succeeds in telling the story of brave kids who, despite all odds,dares to dream and achieves the goal. The screenplay is outstanding keeping the audience alive coupled with beautiful background score and strong performances. Music by A.R.Rehman gels well with mood of the film supported with crisp editing. May I please request the Hollywood makers not to show India in bad light. There are more things in India than just showing dirt, hunger and cows. You have to explore the better side of India. Anyways , the film boast of wonderful performances by Jon Hamm, Madhur Mittal, Suraj Sharma and Darshan Jariwala. Special mention for Alan Arkin for giving a fabulous performance in a short role. All of them suited the characters till T.A nice , brave attempt with wonderful direction and hard-hitting performances. Very good 4/5",8,0,1,22 September 2014
Men in Black 3," Was it even necessary to make another part to the dying series ?
","MIB 3 was an unnecessary follow-up to its previous parts which had entertainment material in it but was low on content.Agent J travels back in time to 1969 with help of time machine to stop a ruthless alien from killing his partner Agent J and saving the world from under attack.When I saw the trailer of MIB 3 for the first time , immediately the interest died upon me to watch the three-quel. The original part was so everlasting followed by a dead sequel 5 years later. My question was it even necessary to make another movie on MIB series ? Barry Sonenfeld ( MIB series , RV) gives you plot which is interesting but unfortunately was directed poorly. Screenplay is completely shabby followed by tacky visual effects and dialogues. However , above weaknesses are camouflaged by good performances by Tommy Lee Jones , Josh Brolin and Will Smith , in particular. I wish we had few more scenes between Smith and Jones. Will Smith as usual is superb in his comic-timings and facial expressions.Overall , a movie which was not required to made at all . But thanks to Will Smith , it can be watchable at least once . Average 2.5 /5",6,0,3,8 September 2012

The sequel starts off where it was left in the first part. Professor Moriarty swears to start a world war by initiating series of bombings in Europe and take advantage of the consequences. The only person standing in his way is Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty challenges Holmes and his partner Watson , who must watch closely each and every deadly step of Moriarty and prevent his misdeeds to wage a war. Guy Ritchie has taken a last chapter from Sherlock Holmes series to create a film where he would meet his arch rival , Professor James Moriarty.

The art direction is just fabulous showcasing the picturesque location of Europe. The visual effects are so enthralling that was you would love to watch it again and again. The chase scene in the forest is outstanding and handled effectively. Cinematography is fantabulous. Hans Zimmer's background score provide the exact touch to this high- fi gripping drama. Coming to the performances, could you ever think of anyone apart from Robert Downey Jr who can play the character of Sherlock Holmes so effectively. The supremely talented actor is so convincing that he fits this role to T. He is humorous , quick-witted , efficient and acts naturally. Jude Law supports Downey Jr. efficiently . He plays the part of Dr.Watson with amazing charm. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part. Overall , An amazing , intellectual thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge.

The Equalizer," You will become a fan of Denzel Washington after watching The Equalizer
","+ Denzel Washington : Amazing - Editing could have been better Denzel Washington has created a strong reputation of himself as a hard- hitting performer with powerful dialogues coupled with stylish-action stunts. The Equalizer might be similar to what you have seen before on the silver screen but it the strong charisma of Denzel which makes the film simply superb.Robert is an ex-army man leading a simple and quiet life until one evening his life changes when tries to do the right thing by saving an unknown person's life.Based on TV series, The Equalizer is a simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was little over-stretched in the climax but was saved by astounding Denzel Washington. Antonie Fuqua ( Training Day ) did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge action-packed thriller. The movie takes sometime to build on you but when it does , there is no turning back. Each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Art direction and cinematography is superb. I loved Denzel Washington's punchline as he turns from a common man into a super-human rescuing the girl from the hands of evil. Do not the miss 16-seconds action scenes between him and the thugs. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz does well in the supporting role.You will become a fan of Denzel Washington after watching The Equalizer. Good 3/5",7,0,2,1 March 2015
The Expendables 2," Kind of old wine in a new bottle !!!
","Expendables 2 was a decent follow up to its predecessor where bunch of popular tough guys from early 80's and 90's collaborate and gives you gun-throttling action popcorn masala entertainment. The sequel starts from where it was left in the first part when Mr.Church goes on a mission leading Expendables to discover a map to a plutonium location somewhere down in Russia. However , the mission goes topsy-turvy when one of his fellow mate is murdered by cruel Villain played by Van Damme. Expendables must go out and seek revenge for their members and save plutonium from falling into wrong hand. Directed by Simon West ( Con-Air) , Expendables 2 promises to have more impact then its predecessor but falls flat on the face. It is just an average flick with old wine in a new bottle. If you have been a great fan of Stallone , Schwarzenegger , Van-Damme , Statham then you might enjoy the film otherwise the screenplay has nothing new to offer. Even the actions scenes are seen-similar kind with nothing new to offer. Simon West has not been in form this time. He could have made it more entertaining with punching dialogues ... good action sequences ... good story line !! Unfortunately , it is just a time-pass. It is Stallone and team which makes this otherwise seen-before movie watchable.Overall , if you have liked 90's action stars , this movie is meant for you otherwise stay away from it !!!",6,0,0,10 October 2012
Skyfall," An opportunity gone wasted
","Skyfall was not a typical James Bond with cool gadgets and cars , high octane action scenes. It is purely story-oriented which would be little bit disappointing for James Bond fans.M's past comes back to haunt her and is threatening to kill her. 007 must track down the killer at any cost before he comes forward to hunt down MDirected by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty) , Skyfall starts off very well with well choreographed beginning scene(usually the charm of a James Bond film) but loses the steam somewhere down the line and it will make you wonder if you are watching a bond film or just some other action drama. The problem with Skyfall is the must-see trailer which will build the excitement but will be sagged down by weak screenplay. Before watching Skyfall , I heard a lot about the mindblowing reviews but was surprise to see whether if the movie was even close to those glowing reviews. Even Sam Mendes direction is not in form. James Bond film is more of punching dialogues , high octane action stunts( like Casino Royale) and cool gadgets which is clearly missing here. Story is catchy. Screenplay could have been more crispy  action scenes are just about fine. Dialogues are less impacting. Cinematography is nice- watch for the beautiful camera work done while filming action scene in the skyscraper of Shanghai city. Performance by Daniel Craig , Judi Dench and Xavier Bardem is what drives the movie. Each of them played their character with convinced attitude. Skyfall could have been made much better considering it to be directed by Sam Mendes but I felt less satisfied with movie on the overall basis. If you going to watch as a Bond film you will be disappointed .. or watch it otherwise Average 2.5 /5",6,7,14,16 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Do yourself a favor , watch Iron man 3 to feel the punch
","'A hero must fall to rise up ' . Iron man 3 was entertaining with high- class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performance by Robert Downey Jr.Iron man 3 narrates the story of how Tony Stark( played by Robert Downey Jr)'s world is torn apart by dreaded terrorist, Mandarin( played by Ben Kinglsley). To make it worse , Mandarin is supported by Stark's fan- turned-foe,Aldrich Killian( played by Guy Pierce). Tony Stark fights back to rebuild and re tribute. Taking over the director's chair from Jon Favreau , Shane Black does a fantastic job in keeping Iron man 3 series alive with sheer hard work and dedicated direction. The movie is narrated in flashback mode depicting how Stark's friends and fans turns into arch-rival. It also reveals the changing personality of Stark from I-don't-care attitude to a responsible person. Enters Mandarin and Stark's world turns upside- down by Mandarin's brutal attack at his house. Stark is compelled to fight back and save the country from being destroyed by atrocious Mandarin. Story was good along with nice screenplay. Art direction was nice. Cinematography was excellent along with punching dialogues. Visual effects is the high-light of superhero flicks and Iron man 3 is no different. The 3D effects were astonishing. CGI was stunning and couple of scenes are enthralling and is sure to excite you with adrenalin- pumping action scenes. Robert Downey Jr is excellent. The way he suits up in Iron Man clad ,the same way he gets into character of Iron man as if it has been tailor-made for him. He is expressive and will leave you spellbinding with stupendous performance. Guy Pierce and Ben Kingsley were good as villain in the flick. Gwyneth Paltrow , Don Cheadle and Jon Farveau does fine job in the supporting role.Do yourself a favor , watch Iron man 3 to get feel the punch.

Airlift," Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant !!
","Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of 'Mera Bharat Mahaan' actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thrillerOverall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",9,108,129,22 January 2016
John Wick," A kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin
","One thing I noted while watching John Wick was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was over-stretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding script.John Wick is an ex-hit-man who comes out of his retirement in search of a mafia's son who was responsible for killing his dog, the last gift sent by his late wife.First time directors, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge action-packed thriller. The movie takes sometime to build on but when it does , there is no turning back. Each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues. It gives an holistic view of gangland and rules they live in and high respect for each other. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Keanue Reeves is back in form and I loved him after long time especially post Matrix series. He does well in dialogues delivery and will be appreciated for his acting.Overall, a kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin. Good 3/5",7,1,4,7 February 2015
Gravity," 'You have to admit one thing; you can't beat the view '. Gravity is SPECTACULAR !!!
","I always believe that a movie is worth-watching if its completely mesmerizes you with hold-your-attention direction and screenplay and stupendous performances. Gravity is the right ingredient for cinema lovers and it will be thoroughly enjoyed. Gravity tells the survival story of an astronaut when her spaceship is destroyed by oncoming debris from a nearby Russian satellite explosion. From the critical acclaimed Children of Men , director Alfonso Cuaron goes one step ahead and gives you a live-action solid drama which will completely immerse you in the film as if you are actually experiencing it. Screenplay is taut and grabs your attention from the very moment you are in the film. Next level CGI technology is like icing on the cake. Never before footage of galaxy has been so well-captured. Sandra Bullock steals the thunder with her immensely likable performance. Watch out for her in the climax scene. George Clooney lends in a fantastic support as wise-cracking astronaut who helps Bullock to gain confidence.Gravity is spectacular. As the great dialogue by Clooney in the film goes ' You have to admit one thing; you can't beat the view '. Excellent 4.5/5",10,2,3,17 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Lone Survivor is one of best war films to come out this year. Highly recommended
","War movies are inspiring to watch and they give factual events of the soldiers who have laid down their life for the motherland. Lone Survivor is one the best war film in the recent times.Lone Survivor follows the true events of Marcus and his team who travels through harsh terrains of Afghanistan hills to track down a Taliban Leader Ahmad Shah.From the director of heavy-duty action flicks like Welcome to Jungle , The Kingdom and Hancock , Peter Berg mixes the real-time events with well choreographed action sequences.

Wind River," Highly recommended
","There will be time when you just need to some good movie that will keep you engaged till the end. Wind River is one such film. I felt good after watching this film which had everything going in its favor. Wind River tells the story of a FBI investigator (played by Elizabeth Olsen of The Avengers fame) who seeks help from a local huntsman to solve a cold-blooded murder of a 18 year girl in Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, US.Directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River is a perfect crime thriller that has some wow moments. The film begins on a slow note which will eventually wrap you in its stunning visuals and interesting plot. The screenplay is crispy and will keep you hooked on to screen. The movie does have some shallow moments but it is compensated by electrifying climax and strong performance.The cinematography is eye-catching while background score gels with the mood of the film. Jeremy Renner is superb as agent Cory Lamber. The brilliant actor is ruthless when it comes to seek justice. Elizabeth Olsen proves that she is more than a eye-candy. She shows the sign of maturity and proves her credibility as an actor.Overall, I thoroughly watching Wind River and would highly recommend it. Excellent 4/5",8,2,5,11 October 2017
World War Z," World War Z is engaging , thrilling and stunning. Highly recommended
","Zombies movies are common in Hollywood for quite sometime with Resident Evil series , Planet Terror, Warm Bodies, 28 days later to name few. World War Z touted as the most expensive Zombie film , does lives up to to much and hoopla surrounding it.As the entire world is hit by a plague, Zombies are becoming more ferocious and scattered. UN employee Gerry Lane must travel to the crux of the situation and prevent the disease from spreading to untouched location.From the critical acclaim films like Kite Runner and Stranger Than Fiction , Marc Foster goes out of his comfort zone and takes one step further into an unexplored area. From the very first scene, he goes in the main subject and shows how Zombies are attacking the innocent people and eventually the disease is spreading to other continents. The best among all these scenes was the attack shown in Israel. I would consider to be one of the highlight of the film. Another good thing about the film is they show how to camouflage the dead people and escape from them. Kudos to the director and story teller. Screenplay is extremely engaging and editing is tight. Special mention to art direction and cinematography. The only thing where I felt the movie could do better was the less-impacting. It is Brad Pitt who takes the entire film on his shoulder. Though the visual effects driven film does not have much scope of acting , Pitt is expressive and does a fine job.World War Z is engaging , thrilling and stunning. Highly recommended. 4/5",8,0,3,7 September 2013
The Hunger Games," Overall , a very boring and disheartening film moving at a snail pace.
","The Hunger Games turned out to a big disappointing movie rather than an exciting ride which I had expected after reading glowing reviews and earth shattering box office collections. True to its title, it kept me hungry for a solid entertainment. Set in near future , The Hunger Game is a live-captured tournament aired on the TV where two people from each district must compete and fight with each other in order to survive and win the title. The Review Directed by Gary Ross , The Hunger Games was like a thundering clouds which makes lot of noise before raining but actually doesn't rain at all. After watching such an exciting trailer, you will feel a complete let down. Neither it is thrilling nor exciting at all. Loosely based on a novel of same name , the story of a girl struggling to survive do raise few eyebrows but that does not transpire into an must-watch film. Direction is completely immature with movie running sluggishly at a snail pace. There is not even a single moment which is entertaining. Story is good which could have made more sense given in the hands of some other director. Screenplay is haywire. I did not understand if every participant has to kill each other to survive , why everyone was after Kate ? How come little Rue came to find the whereabouts of Kate and how did she protect her continuously for 2 days ? I am still surprised to the 7.5 IMDb rating for this boring flick. The only silver lining is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She leaves no stone unturned when it comes to superb acting. Rest of the star cast are average. At Direction and Cinematography is good. Background score is nice. Dialogues are just OK. Overall , a very boring and disheartening film moving at a snail pace. Neither it is entertaining nor it has any good action scenes to keep viewer's interest alive. Disappointing 1.5 /5",5,2,4,14 August 2012
The Impossible," well-directed and superbly performed telling the story of a family survival in the dark hour making it actually possible
","The Impossible was high-emotional drama with beautiful true to tell along with brave performances by the lead star cast.On 26th December 2004, deadly Tsunami attacked the South East Asia Coast killing thousands of people and leaving many homeless. The Impossible tells the true story of a family's suffering and how do they survive this natural disaster and unite in the end.The Impossible is a brave attempt by Juan Antonio Bayona(The Orphanage)and scripted by Sergio G Sanchez which is based on the horrific account written by Maria herself. Hats off to the director for dealing with the subject so sensitively and yet making it to the detailed level and what actually really happened on that unfateful day. The Tsunami attack was executed properly though the length could have been extended( The best Tsunami attack was captured in Hereafter). However, this movie tells aftermath of Tsunami attack. The scenes shot in the hospital and the chemistry between mother( Naomi Watts) and son(Tom Holland) is the highlight of the film. The screenplay will keep you intact. Editing is good. Cinematography was good but not great. I like the last scene where Naomi Watts was thinking about the underwater incident while actually getting operated. Story is well-written and captured on silver screen. Naomi has given her finest performance and shares a great on screen chemistry with Tom Holland. Both of them haven given stupendous performances. Ewan Mcgregor as usual was good.The Impossible is well-directed and superbly performed telling the story of a family survival in the dark hour making it actually possible.

Argo," It will be remembered for depicting the true story with accurate details and amazing direction
","Argo was easily one of the best film of 2012 with fantastic direction , tight screenplay and catchy story line.Argo is the name of a fake movie created by CIA-Canadian collaboration to escort 6 fugitive Americans from highly-tensed Iran.Ben Affleck ( Gone Baby Gone , The Town ) is getting better and better with each film. Gone Baby Gone was more of crime-drama where as The Town was more of action-thriller but with Argo , he has cemented his status as a matured director. Argo , loosely based on the true events taking place in the 80's era, was directed with aplomb. Affleck made sure he handles the sensitive subject effectively and the outcome was awesome. Screenplay is engrossing. The moment you are in the film , you will be impatient to know how will be the hostages freed from devastating state of Iran. Cinematography is eye-catching capturing the beautiful city of Istanbul ,Turkey. Art direction is great. The 80's period has been shown very-well. Performances by the star cast is good. However it Affleck show all the way. Not only is he a good director but a great actor as well. His action spoke more rather than words and was very expressive. Alan Arkin gives in a good support.Overall , ARGO was one of the finest movie produced in 2012. It will be remembered for depicting the true story with accurate details and amazing direction.

Public Enemies," Not worth it....
","Public enemies was a colossal disappointment with huge star cast and a famous director. The difficult 1930s is a time of robbers who knock over banks and other rich targets with alarming frequency. Of them, none is more notorious than John Dillinger, whose gang plies its trade with cunning efficiency against big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone. As Dillinger becomes a folk hero, FBI head J. Edger Hoover is determined to stop his ilk by assigning ace agent Melvin Purvis to hunt down Dillinger. As Purvis struggles with the manhunt's realities, Dillinger himself faces an ominous future with the loss of friends, dwindling options and a changing world of organized crime with no room for him. When I saw the trailer, I was very excited from the promos but was completely disappointed after watching the film. The film was too long and at some point of time was dragging at a snail's pace. Michael Mann direction was extremely poor. The way Depp escapes from the prison was too difficult to digest. It was too lenient. He is not in form this time. Christian Bale did his part well as an FBI agent. Cinematography was awesome along with the art direction and sound effects. So, overall I was not satisfied with the movie at all. If it wouldn't been for Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I would never see the movie.",5,0,0,15 December 2010
Ted," If you need a high dose of entertainment, TED is the right medicine for you.
","TED was a charming , quick-witted , hilarious film which is sure to keep you entertained with few comic scenes at bay.John wishes for his teddy bear to come alive and his wish is granted. The teddy bear becomes his best buddy since his childhood days. Eventually , John gets so attached to his best buddy that he never becomes serious in life which becomes a big hindrance for his girlfriend, Lori. John must go through an acid test if he wants to choose between his girlfriend or best buddy.Directed by Seth FacLane, TED sends a signal of the genre of the film from its trailer itself. It is hilarious , spooky , funny which is full of quick-witted humor and comic scenes. Right from the beginning , TED will give you dose of entertainment. The chemistry between Walhberg and teddy bear (voiced by Seth FacLane himself)is great. However, I felt some scenes were weird and yucky as well which could have been avoided. This is not a family entertainment at all. Mark Walhberg was good and dependable as always. Seth Faclane did a good a job both as director and as TED (voice). Mila Kunis was looking gorgeous. If you need a high dose of entertainment, TED is the right medicine for you. Good 3/5",7,0,3,16 November 2012

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Hardwork , Willpower and Dedication - For person with these qualities , the sky is the limit
","Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it is representing true incidents of a person portrayed on the silver screen. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag follows the trend and is thoroughly inspiring and motivating. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tells the real life story of former Indian track and field sprinter, Milkha Singh who is the only Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games.From the director of thrilling AKS and rebellious RANG DE BASANTI , Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra gives you another solid-punching true story of Flying Sikh which is also based on the book The Race of My Life. The movie begins with Milkha loosing the gold medal and refusing to participate in Paksitan as he had a troubled childhood during Indo-Pak partition where his parents were murdered. The movie goes into flashback mode showing his transformation from a innocent kid to a trouble-maker youth. Chance to meet his girlfriend changes him completely and he joins Indian Army for good where his racing skills are recognized and from this point , the movie begins to roll out. Couple of scenes will steal the thunder - Farhan Aktar running the race despite the leg injury in National Championship , the practice session shot in Ladakh will chill the blood and finally the beautiful shot climax scene. The screenplay do looses the steam due to avoidable songs , the romantic track between foreign girl and Farhan Akhtar. Editing could have been trimmed for few minutes. Also , I felt apart from 'Zinda' and ' Bhaag Milkha ' , none of the songs contributed much to the film. Despite these shortcomings , the film boast off some fantastic performances. Farhan Akhtar gives his best as he has trained hard to get into the shape and appreciable sculpted physique clearly reflects in the movie. He emotes so appropriately that it is difficult to think of any other actor in this role. Praveen Malhotra , Yograj Singh , Divya Dutta and Prakash Raj lends in good support.Overall , Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true tribute to real-life hero Milkha Singh and should be watched by every Indian.

The Town," Watch it .... highly recommended
","The Town was very engrossing , watchable and high octane drama that kept me glued to the screen. The film opens with a bank robbery in Charlestown. Ben Affleck (Doug) and his gang loots the bank and kidnaps the manager, Claire Keesey, as a hostage and releases her later. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. Doug tries to leave the job and start something new but it would not be easy for him as he other commitments. When I saw the trailer of this film , i thought it would be just an average flick but my curiosity rose up after hearing lot of critical acclaim and reviews of the film and my joy knew no bounds after watching the movie. Though it started on a slow note but later it turned out to be very engrossing and ready - to- chill thriller. The performances were really awesome especially by Ben Affleck , Jeremy Renner and Rebbecca Hall . The direction was very sharp and witty. Ben Affleck has shown lot of improvement with each films.

Life of Pi," Very nice film which was visually enthralling and asks a lot of questions to the audience. It is up to us to decide the answer
","Life of Pi was one of the most enthralling and visually stunning film that had brilliant story-line , powerful performances with decent screenplay.Pi (Suraj Sharma) is left alone on a life boat after his ship wrecks only to be in the company of a Bengal Tiger , a hyena , a Zebra and an orangutan. He must fight for survival in this adventurous and epic journey which makes him realize the ultimate purpose of life.Oscar winner director Ang Lee has taken one step ahead and done a fantastic job to adapt a novel and turn it into a beautiful movie. The movie is engrossing right from the beginning and certain scenes will keep you on the edge of seat. The brilliant portrayal of chemistry between the tiger and PI is the highlight of the film. You will feel that a man and a beast can be a good friends but ultimately the question might that can we make animal our best friend ? The movie begins with PI telling the story about his adventures in the flashback. The childhood of PI where he begins to believe in different religion , his search for truth and his journey from India to the ship has been executed brilliantly. The moment Pi encounters the ship-wreck and left alone on a life boat with wild animal , the movie takes a complete U-turn and depicts the relationship between tiger and Pi brilliantly. Soon , they develop a special bond which eventually breaks in the end. It is at this place where I felt the emotion content is missing and sympathetic feeling is mixed where Irrfan Khan expresses his concern for not receiving proper goodbye from the tiger. I felt this movie was great but not spectacular which would want me to see it again and again. However , screenplay is crispy keeping you entertained , art direction is heavenly , cinematography is awesome capturing the gorgeous locations and images , visual effects are the highlight of the film and is award-worthy. Suraj Sharma does a superb job as a newcomer. Irrfan Khan gives his best. Tabu is good.Overall , very nice film which was visually enthralling and asks a lot of questions to the audience.

Interstellar," Mesmerizing !!!!
","The director Christopher Nolan needs no introduction. With expectations always high for every movie of his, every movie has lived up to it and Interstellar is no different. Enough is already known about the plot of the movie. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA pilot turned farmer who lives with his two children and father in a world which is facing increasing trouble in the form of a condition called blight which threatens to wipe out the Earth's food supply. Cooper takes the task of finding a new planet for human beings to migrate before it is too late. The movie is all about the adventurous expedition while also depicting the emotional turmoil that each of the expedition member goes through. The visual effects are stunning and dialogues are excellent as always. This is the simplest way in which such a complex subject can be rendered and Nolan makes sure that the audience doesn't get bored for a second dealing with a subject not so widely known. All the actors have done an excellent job but Matthew McConaughey steals the show. Background score from Hans Zimmer is amazing and adds life to the movie. The only drawback of the movie is the set of assumptions that Nolan is forced to take when dealing with such a subject. The audience may have no clue on what the characters are talking about. If you want to enjoy this movie fully, read a bit on black holes, wormholes and what dimensions mean in a 3D world.https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk",9,0,4,15 November 2014

Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The beautiful nightlife of LA adds charms to the cinematography. Hats off to Jake Gyllenhaal who gets into the character of Louis Bloom so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a news reporter who can get into any length to achieve success. It is the evil character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet captivating.

Justice League," Good comeback from Zack Snyder and DC
","Justice League turned out to be more thrilling and exciting than Batman Vs Superman. It was definitely good but certainly not a ground- breaking super-hero flick.Batman is building a team comprising of Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman as the world is threatened by new enemy,Steppenwolf, who plans an attack on Earth by unraveling three mysterious Mother Boxes.Together, Justice League with new members must fight the evil to save the mankind. It would have been really challenging for Zack Snyder, director of 300, Man Of Steel, Batman vs Superman, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a pretty good job and turned this comic-story into an enjoyable fun ride. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The introduction of each superhero is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out - return of Superman, Flash getting a surprise of his life when he realizes that Superman is faster than him. Climax fighting is well executed. Screenplay is good along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It definitely misses the mark when you sky-high expectations but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5",8,0,2,19 November 2017
Man of Steel," A must watch for Superman fans !!!
","The movie boasts of an amazing team put together by Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder along with wonderful star cast of Russel Crowe , Diane lane and Laurence Fishburne.Man of Steel focuses on the evolution of Superman who is forced to confront his secret when the Earth is invaded by his distant relatives. He must fight back in order to save earth from falling into pit.From the director of 300 , Watchmen and The Legend of the Guardian , Zack Synder gives you a visual delight which is full of unbelievable and amazing actions sequences. Clearly, this is the best Superman movie in terms of special effects where Zack Snyder lives up to his reputation for creating visually stunning movies. The film has a very good storyline as it portrays the emotional struggle of Superman as he tries to control his powers and is very enthusiastic about using them for good.. What lets the film down is the narrative as too little time is devoted to the evolution of Superman. His transition to Superman under his Krypton father's guidance is shown very weakly and not enough time is dedicated to show the relationship between Superman and his Earth father as this relationship is one of the key factors which makes Superman who he is. Not much time is dedicated to highlight the plight of Superman as he feels more alien when he discovers his power. Instead the movie turns out to be a slug fest exploiting technological advancements in CGI. There is a double climax in the movie which proves to be visually destructive and violent which makes you feel that such large scale destruction was a bit too much. Nevertheless, there is a substance behind the destructive climax as two equally powerful superheroes collide but this may be a bit too much for audience to digest. Kevin Costner who plays the Earth father of Superman impresses in the few moments he has on screen. Henry Cavill, did a commendable job as Superman, but had was very little emotion on his face. Happiness, sadness, anger, love were all the same. Other actors did justice to their part.For people expecting something like Batman Begins as this comes from Nolan's production house, this movie may let them down. A must watch for Superman fans but the movie may not make a lot of new fans for this ageless superhero. If a next movie is being planned, we would suggest that a great villain be selected and focus be paid a little more to the emotional aspects of Superman and why he is the great character that he is, thanks to the upbringing of his Earth parents.Good - 3.5/5",8,1,5,27 June 2013
American Psycho," I have become a fan of Christian Bale after this movie.

Though the movie released some 10 years back but I got the opportunity to watch it now thanks to growing popularity of Christian Bale. I kept on hearing about the movie turning him into a popular star even before The Machinist and Batman Begin and I was not surprised a bit. The actor gets into the character of Patrick Bateman so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a serial killer , he is masculine and handsome as a playboy flirting with women , he is innocent when he confesses to himself doing wrong stuff. It is the character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet sympathizing for his mental illness. The climax is something similar to Inception where the director questions the audience that what is the conclusion. Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The movie has some disturbing scenes like where Bateman stabs the beggar and kills his dog by stamping on it , the scene where he narrates the feelings coming out of Phil Collin's song while two prostitutes are lying over each other and making out etc. This is certainly not for the weak-hearted audience. Screenplay is engaging , art direction is good along with superb dialogues. Christian Bale is the show-stopper. I have become a fan of this great actor after the movie. He emotes so accurately through his expressions and is complete natural.So overall , superb intellectual movie in all respect. Must Watch. Excellent 4.4/5",8,1,2,4 September 2012

He fixes mechanical gadgets and railways clocks which he learns from his father and uncle. Unfortunately, his father dies in a fire accident and only way to seek the message left by his father is to fix the automaton. In order to fix the automaton, he starts stealing from a toy shop in the railway station owned by a cranky old man , George Melies (Ben Kingsley). But Hugo is caught stealing and the only way to compensate for his punishment is to work in the toy shop.

Eventually , he gets the message from the robot but in form of pictorial diagram which gives him a clue about George's past. Along with Issabelle , Hugo sets out to find the truth. Hugo , directed by the legendary director Martin Scorsese , is his first 3D fantasy film based on a novel written by Brian Selznick. When I saw the trailer for the first time , the film immediately reminded me of Polar express which was of same genre. The film was shot completely in 3D made it more exciting to watch. I have always Scorsese's work and this film goes one step further to prove his versatility. The master director has captured each frame so beautifully that audience will fall in love with the movie. The visual effects and camera work is so enthralling that you don't want to miss out the movie even for a second. Story and screenplay has been handled so efficiently that you would not feel bored ever. Art direction is magnificent. Dialogues are superb and inspiring. The child actor who plays the part of Hugo does justice to his part. Same goes for Chloe Moretz. But it is Ben Kingsley who steals the thunder. The actor is effective and carries the part of George Melies with such an ease. So , overall , a superb movie in all respect. Hats off to Martin Scorsese was experimenting something unusual and making it a fun-loving flick to watch. Very Good : 4/5",8,4,8,26 February 2012
Dangal," If you are lying low in life, 'Dangal' is the right dose of medicine to motivate and inspire you. Go and grab the tickets now
","Movie Name : Dangal Genre : Sports / Drama / Biography Rating : Outstanding 5/5 There comes a movie in a while which you are awaiting with bathed-breath and after watching it, your joy knows no bounds. 'Dangal' is a perfect example that exceeds the expectations and would give you a right dose of entertainment with an inspiring message.'Dangal' is a biography-drama about the former Indian wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat (played by Aamir Khan) who dreams of winning a gold medal for India at the Olympics. He earns enough respect in the field of wrestling but disowns the sport due to money-crunch. However, he trains his daughters, Geeta (played by Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (played by Sanya Malhotra) who makes his dream come true.Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, who earlier made 'Bhoothnath Returns', 'Dangal' focuses more on the relationship between the Haryana wrestler Mahavir Phogat and Babita Kumari and Geeta Phogat. Unlike the Salman Khan's 'Sultan', the wrestling drama is an emotional journey of a father teaching his daughters about the wrestling sports rather than full-fledged action film. The film opens well with Aamir Khan wrestling with his colleague at office. The subsequent scenes where he teaches his daughters the art of wrestling is brilliantly portrayed. The wrestling arena scene where the young Geeta fights with a boy for the first time is eye-popping. Kudos to Nitesh Tiwari for keeping us engaged at this time. The second half tells how Geeta Phogat joining the NSA (National Sports Academy) but in spite of having a wrestling coach, gets trained under her father to win the gold medal at the Common Wealth Games 2010. The wrestling scenes are probably the best scenes you will witness on the silver screen. The semi-final and the final match for gold is the highlight of the film. Thanks to wonderful screenplay written by Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain, Nikhil Mehrotra and Nitesh Tiwari, 'Dangal' will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. Background score is rocking and gels well with the mood of the film. Art direction is effective along with efficient cinematography for capturing the charms of rural India. Editing is crispy. Special mention to Shyam Kaushal and Kripa Shankar Patel Bishnoi for executing the wrestling scenes effectively. Songs are good but definitely the pick-of-a-lot is the title song 'Dangal' which hair- raising.Coming to the performances, I cannot imagine any one apart from Aamir Khan playing the role of mentor to his daughter, Mahavir Singh Phogat. Aamir has chosen to put on lot of weight to look like an aging pehelwaan and his performance is impeccable. Just like 'Sultan' was not just a Salman Khan's film and had other characters well-defined, 'Dangal' boast off some brilliant actors as well. Zaira Wasim (Young Geeta) and Suhani Bhatnagar (Young Babita) are simply superb. Same goes for Fatima Sana Shaikh (Elder Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Elder Babita) who are spell- binding. Sakshi Talwar does well in her part. Overall, if you are lying low in life, 'Dangal' is the right dose of medicine to motivate and inspire you. Go and grab the tickets now.

The story and script is powerful with some high octane drama that is sure to keep you engrossed. However , this movie is challenging and is made for niche audiences that is sure to keep some folks at bay. Couple of scenes have been executed brilliantly - the scene where Pat tries to find his wedding video at 4 AM in the morning, the scene at the Diner restaurant between Pat and Tiffany and her sudden burst into flame is one of the best scene in the film. The film relies more on actor performing at the moment and that is the best part. Direction contains lot of gravity and is handled superbly. Screenplay is grasping. Editing is crispy. Art direction and Cinematography is good. Dialogues are punching. Story , based on Matther Qucik's novel , is well-written. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the soul of the film. It is their enduring performances which makes this film more watchable. Watch out for their chemistry as if they are playing real characters. They vehemently supported by fine performances by Robert De Niro and Anupam Kher.Silver Lining Playbooks is definitely a strong contender for upcoming awards this season for its well-executed direction, strong screenplay and more importantly powerful performances.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," If you are looking for some cool action scenes , you might dare to see otherwise skip at any cost
","Adapting a classic fairy tale into action, witch-killing which is gore and bloody is certainly absurd and Hansel&Gretel follows the path.Deserted by their parents in the dark jungle , Hansel & Gretel grew up to become witch-hunters monitor and kill witch all over the world. They face new challenge of an evil who they must kill before blue moon approaches and reveal their past.Directed by Tommy Wirkola and based on popular children fairy tale , Hansel & Gretel:Witch Hunters is a classic example of destroying the essence and theme of story and introducing vulgarism , blood, nudity. It is completely different from what you must have read in your childhood and I would recommend kids to stay away from the film. The new plot is more of using the latest equipment to hunt down the witches and you will see couple of good action scenes choreographed well. The direction is terrible with story going no where and screenplay becomes sluggish at one point. The dialogues are funny. The art direction and cinematography is outstanding. There is no performance to remember in this film. Jeremy Runner , Gemma Atherton and Famke Janseen leads the star cast and are just about OK in this average film.Overall , I did not like Hansel & Gretal: Witch Hunters. If you are looking for some cool action scenes , you might dare to see otherwise skip at any cost. Bad 2/5",5,1,4,19 May 2013

This is best among all the series and believe me you will enjoy every bit of it with an urge to watch it once again.The fifth part of the Mission Impossible series takes a different route this time when IMF is being challenged by its arch rival Syndicate on the verge of eradicating Ethan Hunt and his team.Stepping into the director's seat, Christopher McQuarrie makes sure you are thrilled and energized from the very opening scene - The plane scene where Tom Cruise hangs on to the door of plane at 5000 feet above the ground level.The jaw-dropping scene is one of the best opening scene in the MI series and Cruise should be lauded for his death-defying stunt.

It portrays the picture of pre-experiences of a soldier in the military camp and how he struggles to fight for the country. Direction is incredible but looses the steam later. Wish the second half would have been more impacting. Screenplay is decent. Cinematography is world-class , art direction and dialogues are good. Editing is loose.

It is very difficult to find such a hard working actor in the industry and Christian Bale went ahead and proved his mettle.

The Intouchables," So many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score
","The Intouchables had cult status written all over it. It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Omar Sy and François Cluzet, superb direction and astounding background score.Philippe becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident and is in search of a care-taker to look after him. Driss turns up for the interview , not to get the job though but to get a signature for the welfare trust. Impressed with his attitude, Philippe hires him as his care-take. Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.Directed by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions.

The Amazing Spider-Man," 'With great power, comes great responsibility ' is clearly missing !!!
","The Amazing Spiderman , a reboot on Spiderman franchises, was disappointing with nothing much to offer except for few good fight scenes and eye catching visual effects.The Amazing Spiderman takes you to the actual origin of what really happened before Peter Parkar turned into a web slinging hero for the New York City.Director Marc Webb(500 days of summer) does a decent job of re-booting the series showing the disappearance of Peter Parker's parents and what led him to become a Spiderman. But a bountiful of comparison will definitely come across from the fans who have already seen the scenario in Sam Raimi's version. First of all , the questions comes to my mind was why they decided to reboot , considering it got released just after 5 years.. they could have continued with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire ? Can it been even called a reboot , considering we have seen this before , right ? As I mentioned , the comparisons will definitely happen and I loved Raimi's version. I think he gave more weight-age to the story , character development, more fun-loving and Tobey Maguire was more charming than Andrew Garfield as Spiderman , frankly speaking. I did not understand few scenes here .. if Peter gained strength after bitten by a spider, his eyesight should also become strong, where as he is wearing specks even after becoming Spiderman... the character of Mary Jane and Harry Osborn is also missing here, the story of his parents missing is still clueless. May be all these will be answered in the next chapter for which we have to wait. Gosh, how many spiderman movies they are gonna make... in my opinion, they should have continued the next series. However , on the positive note - the visual effects are mind blowing coupled with fight sequences between Spiderman and the Lizard in the college was high-octane. Screenplay is tight. Camera-work is just getting better and better with each film. The famous dialogue ' With great power, comes great responsibility ' is missing. Andrew Garfield was just about OK as Peter Parker , I felt Tobey Maguire did better job. Emma Stone was not upto the mark. Rhys Ifans was impressive as Dr. Curt Connors but frankly speaking the character of Lizard was more funny rather than scary. Irffan Khan was there for few minutes.I had a high expectations from 'The Amazing Spiderman' after knowing how was it originated but did not find any difference from Raimi's version. It was a good but did not live quite to my expectation. Average",6,2,6,8 July 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club belongs to Matthew McConaughey who leaves no stone unturned with a brave performance
","Matthew McConaughey is one of most under-rated actor who has given some memorable performances over the years. With Dallas Buyers Club, he has proved his mettle and is here to stay.Dallas Buyers Club tells the story of an electrician who is infected with AIDS virus. He travels globally to find the right medicine for the disease and opens a Dallas Buyers Club to help the other AIDS patients. Based on true story of Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club is directed by Jean-Marc Vallée whose previous works include The Young Victora and CRAZY. The film will immediately grab your attention right from the opening scenes including the revelation of deadly disease to Ron. Every frame is executed efficiently after wards which makes it more interesting to watch. Cinematography is enthralling along with nice Art direction. Dialogues are witty. The best part of the film is of course Matthew McConaughey who has lost some 30 kilos to fit into the role of Ron Woodroof. This is perhaps the career best performance by the talented actor who has cherished with brave acting including A Time To Kill, The Lincoln Lawyer and the recent MUD. I also liked Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto in the supporting role.Dallas Buyers Club belongs to Matthew McConaughey who leaves no stone unturned with a brave performance.

Goon," Punching and boom-basting fight sequences makes it enthralling
","Goon was a feel good sports flick with lot of abuses , violence and blood but still it was punching and gritty.Doug Glatt is a bouncer at a local club and is disappointed with his life as he thinks of himself as stupid and useless guy when compared to his intelligent family. However , odds goes into his favor when he is invited by a coach of a well-reputed hockey team to lead the pack and fight whatever stands his way.Directed by Michael Dowse, GOON is based on a true story of ruthless and relentless hockey player, Doug Glatt. The story is simple but it is execution of the plot which makes it a compelling watch. The screenplay is written with conviction. Couple of scene do stand out- The scene where Doug gets hit by the ball in his face and fall flats on the ground not allowing opponents to hit the goal inspite of getting severely injured, the climax scene where Doug fights with Ross Rhea is the highlight of the film. The film however contains lot of bloodshed and abuses which unfortunately is required in the film ( generally shown in a Ice Hockey game). Sean William Scott completely surprises with his serious performance. The actor who is popular in comedy roles will surely been recognized for his performance as Doug Glatt. GOON is hard-core violent bloody sport movie which is more of GUY's flick with some cool punching and boom-basting fight sequences. Good 3/5",7,2,3,6 January 2013

Now you see me is the adventures of four magicians who come together and take the world for a ride calling themselves the 4 Horsemen.The movie has a great start with a trick displayed by Jesse Eisenberg which even impresses the audience. As the movie pans out, the group pulls of heists like a robbing a bank while conducting a TV show, robbing a man of his personal savings and so on. The movie keeps you engrossed throughout as Mark Ruffalo who plays the investigating officer keeps his chase with this group trying to bring them to justice. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine who are the heavyweights add to the star cast and performances with usual panache. The story is laced with magical tricks and twists as the four Horsemen take the people from one act to another for the final act. The twist at the end is predictable yet thrilling as the focus is shifted across characters.The drawback is the movie is that the magical tricks are left unexplained. The first and second acts are explained but the final act is not explained which leaves a big question mark. The end of the movie seems to be a set up for a sequel to come. One might be reminded of the movie The Prestige but this movie does not have the credibility behind the magic tricks that is so evident.A little more time devotion to the background of the tricks could have struck a chord with the audience and made it more entertaining.Overall , Now you see me is an engrossing crime thriller which is sure to keep you on the edge of seat.

The movie is catchy right from the beginning and you will be sucked into the stunning screenplay that you will not realize how the time flew. The highlight of the film is definitely the rescue scene of Erik from highly guarded security which is beautifully shot, introduction of Wolverine and Mystic and finally the climax parliament scene which is completely action packed.

It is difficult to point which actor gave the best performance as I believe equal justice was given to each character.

Captain America: Civil War," Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it.
","'Why do we need a war to solve a problem'. The question that will pop up in your while watching the Avengers follow-up. Captain America:Civil War was entertaining with high-class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performances which turned out to be a solid follow-up to the Avenger series.As the new Superhero Registration Act is proposed by the United Nations which lays out the plans to deploy Super-heroes only when required. This political interference by the government causes the rift between two good friends – Captain America, who believes that Super-hero should be have freedom to act and 'not obey order', and Iron Man who believes that Super-heroes should be answerable to a neutral body based on their actions.It would have been really challenging for Russo brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, directors of Captain America : Winter Soldier to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise they did a fantastic job and turned the comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path- breaking action sequences. The opening fight scene with Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow is pretty impressive, the introduction of each super- hero character has laid out accurately and fight scenes will keep you engaged. Second half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella.Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Captain America and Iron man, the new characters like Black Panther and Ant-Man are highly likable. But the most impressive is the introduction of Spider-man which is played by a Tom Holland. Climax fighting scene is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects.On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially. Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. The supremely talented actor goes deep inside a broken super-hero character who is left by his girlfriend. Chris Evans emotes better compared to the previous series of Captain America as if it is tailor-made for him. Scarlette Johanson does what she is best at – kick some ass. Paul Rudd will surprise you as Ant- Man.Overall, Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it.

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," 'M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story' pays tribute to real-life hero but disappoints as a film
","Biographies on sports folks have been generating quite a buzz. Films like 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', 'Mary Kom' and 'Paan Singh Tomar' have been able to make a mark on silver screen. Much has been talked about probably the best captain India Cricket ever had but nobody know the background of what made the legend which creates curiosity to see the film. With outstanding trailer making it an event film, is 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' worth your patience ? Well, let us check out ...'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' gives you account of the never-heard story of the most successful Indian Cricket Team Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (played by Sushant Singh Rajput) who shined with his admiring captaincy that led India team won the world cup in 2011.'M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story' is being directed by Neeraj Pandey who has given marvelous films like 'A Wednesday', 'Special Chabbis' and 'Baby'. The film successfully gives the coming-of-age drama of Dhoni's background, various folks involved in helping him and the opportunities he gets to move ahead. But when you want to realize the real character of the legend-in-making that is where the film falters. The first half of the film is stupendous which gives the account of real situations in Dhoni's life. The highlight definitely being the 'helicopter' shot appropriately played by Sushant Singh Rajput along with the never- heard story of what went behind the making of a great player. However, the it is second half which spoils the mood with never ending romantic love story which causes a speed-bump. To make it worst, too much of song will completely bore you and editing takes a back seat. Pandey loses the track and focus shifts completely. Even the climax which talks about the India winning the World Cup trophy against SriLanka should have been more thrilling. Music is another let down and none of the songs were impacting. Despite the shortcomings, 'M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story' is embedded with superlative performances which will keep you engaged. Sushant Singh Rajput goes into the character of Dhoni and you will like him especially in the Ticket Collector part. But again, he needs to work on his expressions which I see lacking him in his previous films as well. Anupam Kher as usual is splendid. Bhumika Chawla is just about okay. Rajesh Sharma is brilliant. Overall, 'M.S.Dhoni : The Untold Story' pays tribute to real-life hero but disappoints as a film. Decent 2.75/10<ul><li>Ketan Gupta</li></ul>",6,1,3,30 September 2016

Based on book of same name by J.R.Tolkeins, The Hobbit is enchanting , stupendous and grasping. Right from the beginning , the movie touches your heart with standardized cinematography and jaw-dropping art direction. The story catches on to you slowly and there are couple of flashback , each with its own unique tale to tell. It is difficult to point out any particular scene which is impressive but the best scene was the combat between thunderous rocks. The direction is amazing and hats off to Peter Jackson for handling such a difficult story and making it so likable. Screenplay is top-notch. Editing is tight. Dialogues are punching. Entire star cast has given a commendable performance but it is my favourite character Gollum ( voiced by Andy Serkis) who steals the show within short span of time.

","It Follows was a different horror movie with unique experience and one of its kind. The movie had limited release in US and was distributed by first time studio Radius-TWC. It grew well thanks to strong word-of- mouth and that made me curious to watch the film.It follows tells the story of a young woman who gets duped by her boyfriend after he passes a supernatural element which makes her followed by dead people in an attempt to kill her. First time director David Robert Mitchell does a fabulous job in creating haunting atmosphere from the beginning which creates tension and suspense. The movement of the film is slow and it takes time to build upon of each character. David succeeds in pumping up the adrenalin with what-will-happen-next surprise coupled with perfect background score and brilliant camera work. The screenplay is crispy but does falter in the 2nd half. The abrupt ending might sway away few audience. Also, it could have been explained what exactly is following and how it began ( may be they will come up with a prequel later). Nevertheless, the applauding camera work , haunting and yet tuneful background music by Rich Vreeland are icing on the cake. The story is definitely interesting with few spooky moments though not very scary but will hold your attention. Performances by new comers are worth-mentioning especially Maika Monroe.This one is sure going to be loved by ones who crave for a good horror movie.

A small incident changes his life but he does not lose hope. Jane is his pillar of support and helps him keep motivated. The screenplay falters little bit but bounces back with nice climax. The background score with gorgeous cinematography adds on extra charm to the film. Full marks should be given to Eddie Redmayne for fitting the role of Stephen Hawking. Hats off to Felicity Jones for the playing the role of Jane Hawkings.Overall, a wonderful movie in every sense. Watch it to know the actual story of Stephen Hawking.

Schindler's List," A master piece !!!
","Schindler's list was an astounding work of cinema which was depressing and emotional but at the same time was backed by powerful performances and intelligent direction. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film. It has all the ingredients to make a good dramadialoggood background score.",9,11,16,15 December 2010
A Quiet Place," Outstanding ... Electrifying... Magnificent !!!
","There comes a time when you feel the urge to watch a horror/thrilling that should keep you on the edge of the seat. A Quiet Place has right dose of ingredient to satisfy your quench for thirst.World has suffered a calamity where human race has almost finished and what remains have to survive the post-apocalyptic stage where they always have to remain quiet to avoid a monster-like creature who are sensitive to any noise.Brilliantly directed and equally portraying a role of a family guy who does everything to protect his loved ones, John Krasinki just goes a step ahead and gives a mindblowing and riveting thriller. The film will look weird in the initial scenes as the characters communicate with each other through sign language but eventually as you go deep inside the tale, the silence made lot of sense. Each and every scene has been beautifully depicted. My favorite being when Emily Blunt is about to deliver the baby and that is when she encounters the creature at her house. Performances are captivating from both John Krisinki and Emily Blunt along with the child actors. Overall, it is a perfect and taut thriller that will keep you engaged for 90 mins. Definitely go for it. 4/5",9,4,7,1 June 2018
The Hurt Locker," Watchable only once ........
","Hurt locker was a documentary kind of movie which tells an interesting story about bomb squad members but was too long and at times was very much dragging. In the year 2004, city of Baghdad is completely dominated by terrorist attacks from every part. The U.S army sets up a patrol on daily rotation to tackle these attacks. The story is about the struggle in life of bomb squad team members. After watching the trailer , I was very excited to watch the film but was a bit let down as it dragged a lot. The editing part of the movie could have been more sharp. The story was good along with the direction, sound effects , cinematography and performances especially by Jeremy Renner. The movie has something new to offer but sometimes it felt as if you are watching a documentary. It could have more convincing and entertaining. Its just worth watching once. 2.5/5",6,1,4,14 December 2010
Sultan," 'Sultan' is a well-made wrestling drama which delivers a solid punch. Good !!!
","There is something about Salman Khan. Either you love him for his charm, screen presence or bold attitude or you hate him due to his controversial remarks or brush with law but you cannot deny the fact that he is one superstar whose stardom and films are not impacted (morning shows were housefull at 8 AM everywhere for 'Sultan' .. unbelievable.. isn't it ???) at the box office. Now let us find out whether 'Sultan' (whose promo was aired one year before the film) lives up to its hype...'Sultan' is the coming-of-age sports drama which tells about the story of Sultan Ali Khan (played by Salman Khan), a wrestler whose life is like a roller-coaster rides going through various ups and down both on and off the ring. Though the trailer of the film looked promising but I had doubts about the director Ali Abbas Zafar who made an average film 'Mere Brother Ki Dulhan' before. However, I was in for a big surprise after watching the film. Ali has definitely made a good comeback with 'Sultan'. The film begins well in the present scenario showing the life of a wrestler who lost his family as well as his championship due to his arrogance. The wrestling-drama goes back into the flashback mode showing the reason behind the fall of a champion. Here you will encounter typical Bollywood romance coupled with song-dance routine and light humor to keep you enlightened. The opening scene of Salman Khan (which always is the highlight of his films) is electrifying with well-executed fight scenes between Salman Khan and other wrestlers (though the makers made it easy for a hero to defeat 10 wrestlers at the same time). The first half is fine but it is the second half which is amazing and the climax is highly effective. Couple of scenes do stand out - the hospital scene where Salman finds about his son, the training scene between Salman Khan and Randeep Hooda is intriguing and MMA fight scenes are pretty realistic. On the flip side, the editing is a weak point and the film definitely could go a long way to be trimmed by at least 15-20 mins. The fight scenes initially and when Salman Khan becomes the world champion is too easy to digest. Though the songs are tuneful to ears, the wrestling drama could definitely be more impacting barring few songs in the reel. Nevertheless, the screenplay is pretty tight and succeeds to keep you at bay. Background score by Julius Packiam deserves special mention. Cinematography by Artur Zurawski is good capturing the beautiful locales of rural India. Wrestling stunts are well-executed. I loved the folk song 'Tuk Tuk' and the tuneful 'Jag Ghoomeya' while others were ordinary.Now coming to the performances, it is Salman Khan all the way. Salman Khan is Sultan and Sultan is Salman Khan. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the character of 'Sultan' and that is where Salman proved his mettle. The actor deep dives into the character as if it was tailor-made for him and gives his best. Anushka Sharma as Aarfa is equally competent and shines in her well-defined character. Amit Sadh ( the guy from 'Kai Po Che') finally gets the opportunity to show his acting skills and the actor does well. Last but not the least, Randeep Hooda will blow your mind with impeccable performance. The actor who plays Anushka's father does a fine job as well.On the whole, 'Sultan' is a well-made wrestling drama which delivers a solid punch.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Golden opportunity gone wasted. This Sequel could have been better.
","When the Spider man series was re-booted in 2012, I was wondering - Will it survive ? Does it even require a reboot since last Spider man film released 5 years back only. Why do not they just continue with the same star cast and take it forward. I guess I was right !!!The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues the story of Peter Parkar and his battle petite against highly lethal enemies like Electro and The Green Goblin incepted out of the Oscorp company and the truth behind his father's sudden disappearance.I was slightly disappointed with The Amazing Spiderman as it was dark and shady on contrary to the comical version of Sam Raimi's. Fortunately, I was pumped up to see the sequel thanks to extraordinary and catchy trailer. The movie begins with Spider man fighting the goons with satirical humor embedded which was passable. As the movie progresses, the director loses the focus of the story and includes the romantic track which hinders the movement. The film picks up the steam as we watch the epic battle between ELECTRO and SPIDERMAN which was well executed with eye-catching CGI. The editing is really weak and the screenplay is a roller coaster ride. Though the 1st half is plain, second half gathers some momentum especially the climax fight scene which was well-executed and something to look out for. Cinematography is splendid with superb art direction. Dialogues are fine. Though the story is pretty weak, it is CGI which is highly driven and mesmerizing. Andrew Garfield does fine as Peter Parkar but still I would love to see Tobey Maguire reprising the role which made him famous. Emma Stone was not in form. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were good in their respective roles. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 could have better. Opportunity gone wasted. 2.75/5 Above Averagehttps://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk",6,2,6,2 May 2014

It does raise the question of right and wrong for a humanoid robot who is progrmmatically embedded to think like a human being. The movie is shot at the exotic locations capturing the minute details of beautiful landscape of Norway. Art direction is spellbinding. Background score is soothing.

However, the film will give a ray of hope when Theo agrees to shift the pregnant lady to a better place. From here onwards, there is no turning back and film will take you to the journey of hardship, struggle and hope to survive. Hats off to Alfonso Cuarón for creating a perfect scenario of post-apocalyptic world and keeping the attention till the end. Script is the hero of the film. Dialogues are punching.

Evil Dead," Bad attempt to remake a classic. If you are expecting lot of blood , merciless killings and violence , you will not be disappointed
","There different kind of horror films- one that scares you literally , one that thrills you with sudden twist in the end and then there are films which are meant to astonish you with gore violence and blood on the floor. Evil dead falls into the later category which has little substance but has more of slashing , spilling of blood like fountain.A group of friends visit a cabin in woods where they discover Book of Dead which unleashes evil when re-opened. A remake of Evil Dead with same name directed by Sam Raimi ( Spiderman series) , the new one falls flat on the surface. The movie begins with a witchcraft magic to kill the evil which is well crafted. However , there was not a genuine reason shown why people came down to the deep jungle as if was meant to take place. The movie is dedicated to all the slasher flicks with no actual stories and rely more on violence and blood. It is spooky at some point but has been elongated by few scenes. The good part is that it is gripping and you will not feel bore at any cost. Direction is decent. Screenplay is inefficient. Dialogues are good. Performance are nice by the lead star cast. Overall , bad attempt to remake a classic. If you are expecting lot of blood , merciless killings and violence , you will not be disappointed. Decent 2.5 /5",6,3,15,21 July 2013

How many of us have heard about Alan Turing ? Thanks to the wonderful script and direction, The Imitation Game gives a utter truth behind the great personality.The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing, the first person to create a computer with the help of which he cracks the enigma code during the World War II.From the director of Headhunters, Morten Tyldum gives you a story never heard and told before.

There is not a scene to loose with tight script and powerful acting. Art direction and cinematography adds to the charm making it more versatile. Full marks to Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley for pulling all the strings together. There is no doubt about who would have been the best person suited for the role of Alan Turing and with impeccable acting skills, Benedict Cumberbatch deserves a thumbs up.

The moment you are in the film , you will be entertained throughout. Of course , there are some silly moments as you expect from Sandler and James comedy but this can be compensated here. There is not much scope in direction as Kevin James movies are more of comic scenes rather than strong direction. However , story and script keeps you intact and hold your attention till the end. It is Kevin James's show all the way. The comedy actor makes sure you are glued to the screen with solid entertainment and that is where the movie is kept alive. Salma Hayek over-acts.

However , things turn topsy turvy when the program goes horribly wrong as he plans an attack on Earth and wage a war against mankind and turn humans into his slave. Together, Avengers with new members must fight the evil Ultron.It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity and the original Avengers, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The street fight between Iron man and Hulk is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Ultron and Iron man, the chemistry between the black widow and the Hulk. Climax fighting depicted reminds you of the first part which is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Scarlette Johanson as the Black Widow.Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It definitely misses the mark when compared to the previous part but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5",7,0,6,25 April 2015

A fisherman is captured and forced to work there. During one such operation , he finds a big piece of diamond which he hides at secret place. Leonardo Dicaprio is hired by mafia to find the man and search for the diamond. The Review Directed by Edward Zwick ( The Last Samurai ) , Blood Diamond is a path breaking film never attempted by any on silver screen. Right from the beginning , the film is hard-hitting and gives a sympathetic feeling for innocent fisherman and their kids who are brain-washed by the diamond mafia and turned into a terrorist. Leonardo's character starts off with negative vibes but his transformation into good human being is the highlight of the film. Few scenes do stand out. The jail scene where Solomon vents out his anger at the mafia leader. The interaction between Leonardo and Djimon in the beginning and how they become friends and help each is the highlight of the film. Hats off to Edward Zwick for making a brave film like. It really takes courage to showcase how a small piece of diamond can bring in a huge difference when it sold in European countries. Screenplay holds your attention right from the beginning and is crispy. Cinematography is awesome capturing the rough terrain of Africa with aplomb. Background score goes well with the film. Leonardo Dicaprio is superb. His transformation from a bad-ass army guy into a good human being with big-heart is captured appropriately.

Sinister," Mark my words- Watch Sinister to get horrified
","Horror movies should have a nice reputation with spine- chilling-with-a- twist ending something like Sixth Sense, Dead Silence, The Grudge and to some extent SAW franchises( might not come into horror genre) . As I was craving for a good horror movie, I noted Sinister directed by Scott Derrickson in 2012 and curiosity ran through me to watch this one and I was glad to get scared with the spooky thriller.A true crime writer shifts to a new place to get idea for writing a book. He discovers a 8 MM camera which plays the old record of killings occurred in that place which eventually puts his family in danger.Now this is some spooky thriller that has some hair-raising and heart- pulping moments. Scott Derrickson who has given some of good horror drama like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose and Deliver Us From Evil succeeds with this one as well. Nice background score coupled with solid story and attention grabbing screenplay, Sinister is one of best horror movies I have seen recently. The flip side is that screenplay looses the steam in the 2nd half and less spooky moments should have been more. Performances by the star cast is good and convincing.

He keeps audience engaged with each sequence in the film as the drama unfolds. I loved the flashback story portraying beautiful family of Maria Altmann. The screenplay will test your patience as movie does take time to build on you. As the main drama unfolds in the court begins, the movie takes an interesting turn and will definitely keep you tight till the end. Dialogues are worthy. Art direction is nice. Cinematography is good. Editing is crispy. The chemistry between Ryan Renolds and Helen Mirren is astounding and brilliant actors will mesmerize the audience with their heart-winning performances. Helen Mirren as usual is dependable. She is fiery as woman demanding her rights and emotional when she wins. Kudos to her brilliant portrayal of Maria Altmann.

When a film releases with Cruise's name attached to it , result will be either positive or negative. Frankly speaking , I've never heard of character Jack Reacher but thanks to film , i have started liking the character. Jack Reacher is unusual action thriller which does not have universal appeal and will be restricted to niche audiences.An ex-military sniper shoots five random victim at gunpoint. Case is passed onto homicide investigator Jack Reacher ( Tom cruise) who must work with lawyer Helen( Rosamund Pike)to solve the cold-blooded murder and motive behind doing this.Directed by Christopher McQuarrie , Jack Reacher is an interesting thriller which is gripping and intense. The movie begins with random killing of innocent victims but as story unfolds , the murders are connected to each other. The movie is like reading a fictional thrilling novel where each page leads to new clue and suspect. Christopher does a good job in handling few sequences but still has a long way to go. He could made the movie more fast-paced. The screenplay is crispy but loose s the moment in the 2nd half. Editing could have been more tight. Same goes for action scenes. Cinematography is OK. Dialogues are punching. Tom Cruise lends himself into the character of Jack Reacher. He is mind- blowing when it comes to dialogues delivery. He will be well-liked by his fans for doing something different. Rosamund Pike does a very good job as rebellion lawyer and gives a good support to Cruise.Overall , Jack Reacher is different action thriller which will be liked by Cruise's fan but it does have it share of flaw.

Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages.

Not thy acted their part very well they all went on to prove that more than their good looks they can act very well. Direction was poor. Action sequences were thrilling especially the care-chasing scene.So overall, just go and watch this movie if you are a Pitt and Jolie's fan.",5,1,2,15 December 2010

Love Actually," Get romantic ....
",Love actually was one of the best romantic movie I have ever seen till now. The concept of multiple love stories with one thing common 'LOVE' was very much intriguing and outstanding.

Background score by Hans Zimmer(reminds you of Inception) is soulful. Chiwetel Ejiofor is simply superb as Solomon Northup. He surely deserves accolades for his stupendous act. Michael Fassebender is enjoyable as cunning slave master. 12 years A Slave is enthralling and spellbinding. Highly recommended. Excellent 4.5/5",9,1,3,31 January 2014

The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonardo DiCaprio gives a knock-out performance which might turn out to be his career best
","When you have brand names like Dicaprio and Scorsese attached to a film, do you even have to think whether you want to see it or not ? Over the years these two personalities have given us wonderful entertainment and with TWOWS, they go one step further.The Wolf Of Wall Street tells the true story about rise and fall of a stock broker Jordan Belfort.From innumerable classics like Raging Bull, Casino, The Departed , Hugo to name few, The Wolf of Wall Street is another extraordinary attempt by master director Martin Scorsese. Though I would argue this might not be his best considering 3 pro-longed hours and a few definite scenes to be vulgar. Editing few scenes will further improvise the momentum of the film. The movie is astonishingly fast-paced, thrilling and dialogues are punching. Screenplay is tight. Art direction is wonderful along with eye-catching cinematography. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a knock-out performance which might turn out to be his career best. Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey were superb.Overall, a film definitely to be remembered for its incredible direction and stupendous performances. Good 4/5",8,0,6,11 January 2014
Dark Shadows," Coming from Depp and Burton's previous records , you will be definitely disappointed
","When you hear about marvelous actor like Johnny Depp and master- director like Tim Burton doing a film together , your joy will be doubled but then you watch them doing a movie like 'Dark Shadows', you joy will be cemented. A vampire , imprisoned for 2 centuries , returns back to his own home to find his family and business being ruined by a witch. He must act and protect before it becomes too late to get tangled by ferocious witch.Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow , Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland) is always a director to look forward to as his films are fantasy , adventurous , dark and humorous. Dark Shadows promises to fall into the category but is bogged down a weak screenplay and even weaker direction. The movie starts off very very well when Johnny Depp is buried by the villages after being betrayed by his ex-lover and then he returns back after 200 years only to rejuvenate his family business and protect his family but things gets out of hand in the middle and looses further steam down the film. In fact , it becomes so irritating that you might want to skip the movie in between and go and grab some free air. Tim Burton is not in form this time. He choose the right story but fails to make an impact. Screenplay is lousy along with poor dialogues. Art direction is wonderful with eye-catching cinematography and visual effects.The only thing , I liked about the movie was Johnny Depp's candy floss performance. The actor is always dependable and is fun to watch.Overall , weak movie in all merits. Coming from Depp and Burton previous records , you will be definitely disappointed. 2/5",5,1,1,15 September 2012

This is not the end but the beginning. He arises from death and people of London are once again plagued by evil spell of Blackwood Magic.

It will actually took f 1870's. A special word for an outstanding cinematography. The sound effects along with the visual effects were amazing. So overall, a fantastic movie to watch with some great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude law.",8,3,5,14 December 2010
Parasite," Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps
","The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5",8,22,35,11 January 2020
The Conjuring," James Wan goes one step further and gives a spooky thriller
","The best part of watching horror films is the chill that will run down your spine , the curiosity to watch what-happens next , the excitement it builds pumping up your blood level. The Conjuring gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments. Only I wish , it could have been more.Mysterious things begins to fall on The Perron family once they move into the house by lake. Sooner they seek help from the famous Paranormalist The Warrens to help them resolve the happenings and ward off the evil that is scaring their daughters to death. From the director of SAW and The Insidious , James Wan goes on step ahead and explores a complete new dimension with this taut horror . The story is based on true incidents and is powerful along with fantastic screenplay. I felt that there were some chilling moments in the film but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Couple of scenes will give you a jilt - The scenes where evil starts unraveling on the family , the moment Warrens enters the house and realizes the evil spirit latching on the family and finally the last exorcism scene has been filmed brilliantly. Cinematoography is good. Art direction is enduring. Editing is tight. It is Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are the soul of the film especially Farmiga. She is fill of expression and gives in a great performance as Lorraine.Overall , a spooky thriller which has some scary scenes to entertain you along with strong direction , powerful screenplay and outstanding performances.

Prometheus," Just enjoy the highly entertained film with fantabulous special effects , visually appealing graphics and good performances.
","Highly anticipated Prometheus finally arrives which is a dark, keeps- you-on-the-edge sci-fi thriller , was almost there but could not satisfy on the overall due to the unsatisfying climax.A group of explorers and scientist discovers a clue to the origin of mankind on earth. To find the hidden truth , they embark on a long journey at a distant planet's moon. However , things turn topsy-turvey as they discover more things than just finding the clue and must fight to survive till the end.Before reading the review , statuary warning :- Don't expect an alien movie here. True , it is a prequel to Alien (1985) but this flick is more of the actual story leading to evolution of mankind. Legendry director Ridley Scott goes back to his roots and delivers a knock-out direction. However , few people will be definitely disappointed with the ending same as me who strives for more satisfactory climax. I just came back after watching it in 2D and I must say I would love to see it once again probably to understand it better. But I was blown away by visual treat the film has given to the audience. The eye-catching cinematography , gorgeous sets , amazing art –direction and superb visual effects make the film worth watching more than once. Coming back to review , the film is entertaining from the start till the end and you would not feel bored even a second. The screenplay is crispy and tight that you will be completely involved in the film the moment you enter the theater. I have been an ardent fan of Scott's earlier work ( Gladiator , Black Hawk Down) and this one is no exception. He has done full justice to the script . However , it is the climax which has bothered me and I kept saying to myself if only something could have happened in the end ( or probably I was expecting much more out of it ). The film boast huge star cast but it is Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender who steals the show with their convincing performance. So , on an overall basis , a highly entertained film with fantabulous special effects , visually appealing graphics and good performances. Good 3.5 /5",8,1,5,12 June 2012
1408," A chill which will run down your spine and you will love it !!!
","1408 was a different horror movie with alternate endings. And one of its kind !!! Mike Enslin is a ghost stories writer who visits to the haunted places and describes about his sensation in his books. One such fine day he gets to know about evil room 1408 in Dolphin Hotel and decides to visit the place to seek the truth. He is objected and restrained by the manager (Samuel L Jackson)As he enters the room , he experiences the horrifying , gruesome incidents that he leaves his stone unturned and he changes his mind and tries to leave the room . But, he realizes that he cannot escape the horrendous situation and he fights back to see the light of the day. Mikael Håfström adapted the story written by Stephen Hawking. Though , the story is centered around one room buts it's the atmosphere inside the room which makes this film worth a watch. The CGI , the background score, the chilling moments makes it a perfect popcorn entertainment. You have to watch every reel carefully to understand the film and you will soon realize that it is worth interesting to watch. John Cusack carries the film on his shoulder. The actor shows immense talent in terms of his grandeur performs. He emotes so much through his expression that I would hardly believe if anyone apart from Cusack could play the part so vividly. Samuel L Jackson is effective in a minor role. There are two versions to the film ending. One , in which he survives the fire attack and gets up in the hospital with his wife beside his bed and the another one where he sacrifices his life by destroying the room and ends the supernatural era. This one is sure going to be loved by ones who are sucker for good twist and turns thrillers. Good– 3.5/5",7,1,2,6 February 2012
Taken 2," If you are big fan of Liam Nesson then it is certainly for you otherwise you might give it a miss
","Taken 2 was was an unnecessary sequel to the original breath-taking Taken but was a decent time-pass popcorn entertainment thanks to powerful performance by Liam Nesson and good old-action sequence.Rade Serbedzija(Murad Krasniq) vows to avenge his son's murder who was brutally killed by Bryan ( Liam Nesson) protecting his daughter from being kidnapped in the original Taken. This time he kidnaps Bryan and his wife in Istanbul. Bryan must communicate to his daughter to seek help and save his wife before the kidnappers finds his daughter and murder his family.Directed by Olivier Megaton(Transporter 3, Columbiana) , Taken 2 is a one-time watch with nothing new to offer. The plot is wafer-thin and has weak storyline. It had potential to be made into a big-film but weak screenplay and poor direction made it terrible. Despite these shortcomings , I felt Taken 2 is not that bad thanks to superb show by Liam Nesson. The legendary actor is the soul of the film with his husky voice and tremendous personality. He gives in all with his widely- appealing hand-hand combat and solid-punching dialogues. Similar goes for efficient action scenes, though original part had better action stunts. Camera work is good along with good back ground score. I felt Taken 2 took advantage of immense popularity gained by first part but it was no where close to it. If you are big fan of Liam Nesson then it is certainly for you otherwise you might give it a miss. Average 2.5 / 5",6,1,1,14 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Chilling !!!!
","Woman in Black , directed by James Watkins , based on a novel by Susan Hill is a scary , you-name-it horror-scenes thriller which is sure to keep you engrossed in each frame coupled with a very well written story. Aurther(Daniel Radcliffe) is a struggling lawyer who has been given a last chance to find out about the unknown will of a deceased woman Mrs. Drablow in a remote village. The moment he reaches the village, he finds weird thing about village and its inhabitants. The villagers don't want him to stay around when they realize about his investigation to the strange house, far away from the village, in the creepy island. Sooner, he is assisted by Simon Daily (Ciaran Hinds) who is the only person in the village to solve the mystery of killings of children due to strange appearance of a woman in black in that house The Woman in black , a remake of a 1989 TV movie of same name, was an outstanding thriller that is sure to give a chill down your spine. The new time director, James Watkins, handles the story very efficiently. The 90 minutes flick helps to keep your attention in each frame. I would like to mention couple of scenes including the one where Aurther moves to top floor to find about the movement of easy chair and the one where he takes a nap in a chair and gets up being shocked by the barking of his dog. The Cinematography is brilliantly executed displaying the European country side effectively. The background is haunting that gels well with the movie. The dialogues are impressive. Art direction is splendid. We have known Daniel Radcliffe for his Harry Potter series but believe me the actor has shown lot of promises apart from his magical tricks. He completely carries the film solely on his shoulder. Ciaran Hinds does good job in the supporting role. On the whole , The Woman in Black provides ample scary moments which will keep you on the edge of the seat and is sure to keep you engaged throughout the film.",7,1,4,22 February 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," It takes nerve of steel to watch this half-porn sleazy skin show !!!
","The Twilight film series was popularized and blown-out-of-proportion by fans of the book and result was headache and melancholy associated with each twilight film. Fifty Shades Of Grey follows the same step which is saddened by over-the-top performance and lame script.The life of an internship student changes when she meets big-shot and mysterious business tycoon, Christian Grey.The trailer of Fifty Shades Of Grey, based on immensely popular book of same name written by E.L.James, was catchy and interesting but when you watch the film, you will be flabbergasted to watch half-porn sleazy skin show with no convincing moments enough to bring out the romance and feel good factor. In fact, the movie will remind you early Twilight series which had immature actors and worst direction. Screenplay is weak with no sense of storyline. Cinematography is good. Art direction is nice. Editing is loose. First time director Sam Taylor-Johnson gets ample scope to bring the falling pieces together but fails miserably with unconvincing plot. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, apart from looking good on-screen, still has long way to go in terms of acting. Other actors are pathetic. Songs are the only silver- lining in this boring flick.Overall, I felt it was a waste of my time, energy and money. Given a chance, I would have watched Whiplash again .Poor 1/5",1,1,5,7 March 2015
The Wolverine," Expectations went downhill with not so engaging movie. Hugh Jackman was the only saving grace
","Starting with X-men series ( directed by Bryan Singer) , Wolverine is the sixth outing featuring Hugh Jackman which has certain improvement over others in terms of story and performance but falls flat with not-so convincing plot, action sequences , CGI and screenplay.Running away from the world , Logan ( played by Hugh Jackman) , leads a nomadic wild life until he is found by red-head Yukio who leads Logan to Yashida. Yashida must re-pay his debts ( he was saved by Logan during nuclear attack in World War 2) by trading Logan for the immortality he is craving for and giving death opportunity which Logan wants.From the director of 3:10 to Yuma, Identity and Walk the Line , James Mangold disappoints this time. One would expect Wolverine to excel more than its predecessor with a superhero touch but not just the story , even highly anticipated movie gives a thumbs down to tamed CGI and not-s- engaging action scenes which is an integral part of a superhero movie but just turns into a bland love story. The movie running time is 126 mins and there is not a single scene which would be remembered after leaving the theater. Background score is ineffective. Editing is loose. Cinematography is just about OK. Screenplay is uninteresting. The only silver lining is power packed performance by Hugh Jackman who gets into character of Wolverine with well-chiseled physique and emotes extensively with appropriate scenes.Overall , I did not like Wolverine and my expectation went downhill with not so engaging movie. Give it a miss. Average 2.5/5",6,4,10,30 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises turned out to as spectacular as it was promised , as exciting as it was shown in the trailer.
","The Dark Knight Rises turned out to as spectacular as it was promised , as exciting as it was shown in the trailer. The direction , the story , the performances and outstanding background score by Hans Zimmer made it a must-see film.It has been a good long eight years since Batman has come out of his whereabout.The city of Gotham is much calm and quieter now until the powerful,lethal and antagonizing terrorist Bane emerges and vows to destroy and conquer the city. This forces Batman to resurface and save the city of Gotham from falling into hand of dangerous Bane. As soon as I watched Dark Knight in 2008, I have been waiting for Dark Knight rises with my heart pounding and the thrill and excitement. Never before I was desperately waiting for any film in my life before like this one and my joy knew no bound when I went to see the film in theater today. The film contains the typical Nolan's twists and turns and you would not be disappointed with this one as well.The very first scene itself has been shot so well when group of mercenaries rescues Bane in high-octane plane hijacking scene. The clash between Bane and Batman has been depicted naturally with hand-hand combat and will go down well with the viewers. The scene where Batman rolls out his Batpod and is chased by the cops in the beginning is the highlight of the movie. The comeback of Bruce Wayne reminds you of Batman begins and is shot effectively. Nolan has joined the dotted lines between the Batman Begins , The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises which displays his superb skills as a storyteller. Of course , the movie has its share of flaw as well. The character of Bane was half-baked .. it did not have much impact as compared to the Joker. Probably , the voice of Bane damaged the mood little bit, though he stood out face-face with Batman in the combat scene. There should have been little more struggling scenes of Bruce Wayne in the prison where he fights to get back.The film definitely lacks the punch which The Dark Knight had. Despite these shortcomings , it has entertainment written all over it. The film is 164 minutes long but there would not be single scene where you feel bored. Hats off to Christopher Nolan for giving yet another exemplary Batman movie which truly stands out. His movies are generally more of what-happens-next thriller and this movie follows the same path. The screenplay is crispy. The art direction was good. Production designs are grandeur. Visual effects are enthralling. The film will be best enjoyed in IMAX screens. Coming to the performances , Christian Bale gets into the character of Batman yet again. As in Batman Begins , he is gets beaten down but comes back with a bang. I wish his struggling period would have been little more long. No other actor till now has represented Batman so truly and precisely as Bale has done. Tom Hardy as Bane does good but could have made his presence more felt. Marion Cottilard was charming .. she will surprise in the climax. Morgan Freeman,Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are usual dependable. However , it is Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon Levitt who gives in a sparkling performances. Special mention to the enthralling background score by Hans Zimmer.The Dark Knight Rises delivers as was expected with little hiccups which was compensated by stupendous performances , outstanding direction, strong storyline and superb background score that gels well with the film.

","The best part of watching an animation film is that it is full of vibrant,colors , cheerful and attractive visual effects. The Croods belongs to same genre with different story line.After his cave is destroyed in an earthquake, the caveman and his family must venture out on adventurous journey in search of a suitable cave for shelter with help of a genius boy.As the movie begins , you are introduced to the pre-historic times of a lifestyle of a caveman with fantastic introduction of each character in his family. The initial scene where they show how caveman's family finds food in midst of now where has executed brilliantly. The film captures some of best moments when they begin the journey of lifetime to find new home. The fantasy world , unbelievable animal characters and funny nature habits puts icing on the cake. Hats off to the directors for doing their job brilliantly. The screenplay suffers little bit and becomes sloppy but gathers momentum later on.

Black Panther," Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. Go for it !!!
","There is something about the characters created by Marvel Comics (thanks to Stan Lee). Every character has its own struggle to rise to fame and stumble down heavily. But as they say ' A hero must rise from the ashes of Phoenix' to become more stronger and wiser than before, Black Panther is one such tale that needs to heard.Black Panther is an enigmatic story of a Prince T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) who is on the verge of becoming a King after his father dies in terrorist bombing. T'Challa returns home to take control of the kingdom of Wakhanda, an isolated African nation which has the resource in form of Vibranium that can change the shape of the world. However, T'Challa is challenged by his cousin Erik Killmonger, who was abandoned in his childhood when his father was killed. From the director of marvelous films like Creed and Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler proves that he is one such fine young talented guy who can transform a script into a must-see film. The first half is fast-paced and makes you glued to the screen with high-voltage drama followed by superbly executed car-chasing scene in Tokyo. We are also introduced to new characters like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ulysses Klaw (brilliantly played by Andy Serkis). The movie takes a sweet turn and second half becomes little monotonous with fall of King Of Wakhanda. The length of the film takes a backseat while editing could have been better. The saving grace is marked by a good comeback of Black Panther a.k.a King Of Wakhanda with a strong climax scene. As usual, there is a scene once the movie ends and a final scene after the entire credit rolls out. Visual effects are superb while Cinematography is excellent. Screenplay is very good and should be lauded for keeping us engaged throughout. Ryan Coogler does a good job in defining each character with aplomb. Each actor has done justice their role which makes the movie even better. But I felt, Andy Serkis stood out as Ulysses Klaw. The brilliant actor was mind-blowing in a small role and I wish the makers could have kept his characters alive for some more time.Overall, Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. It turned out to be better than what I was expecting. Excellent 4/5",8,4,20,18 February 2018

","Flight brings two talents under one roof- Robert Zemeckis and Denzel Washington and when you hear their name out , you can exactly expect a wholesome entertainment with some power packed performance and superb direction.Known for his alcoholic addiction , Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington) fights the case for which he is accused of crashing an airplane and killing 6 people on board.After a long time , Robert Zemeckis returns to reality cinema , taking break from live-action animation movies, and gives us a path breaking film never attempted before. The premises of the movie about a pilot doing justice by saving 100 people on a plane but is unable to save himself is the highlight. Opening scenes have been directed gallantly with plane crashing scene to be among the best ( similar to the Cast Away plane crash scene). From high-octane action sequence , the film divulges into series of drama which has been performed very well by Denzel Washington and rest of the star cast. Couple of scenes still embedded in my mind after I left the theater. The scene where Washington tires had not to consume alcohol , the court room drama where he finally confesses to be alcoholic has been excellent. It is always wonderful to watch Robert Zemeckis movie and this one stands no different. The director has excelled in his cinema and result is fruitful. Screenplay is tight keeping you engrossed. Art direction is amazing. Dialogues are well-written. Cinematography is breath-taking. Editing is fine. Denzel Washingtion gives in yet another knockout performance. The actor is so natural that he smoothly fits in the role of Whip Whitaker. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing this part. Watch out for him in the climax where he meets his son. He is excellent.Flight is one of the best movie i've ever seen. Given a chance , I can watch it once again. Highly recommended 4.5/5",9,2,4,27 December 2012
Pitch Perfect," A very well made teen film in every aspect !!! must watch .....
","Pitch Perfect was one of the best college - going teen flick which had a very good content coupled with riveting performances.Pitch Perfect tells the story of a school singing competition at Barden University where a group of girls take on their male rival.Jason Moore takes in a very challenging of voice-over concept which is based on a book of same name. The very beginning of the movie is mesmerizing and the next moment you are into the film. Audition scene of Beca(played by Anna Kendrick) is simply outstanding. It would have taken good practice to master the voice-over singing and the girls were excellent at it. Hats off to the director for choosing a challenging script and directing to the perfection. Story is simple but it is the script and performances which makes it watching at least more than once. Anna Kendrick gives another stupendous performance. The actress of 50/50 and Up in the air is growing stronger day by day. She is the next super star. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part.Overall , a very well made film in every aspect. Highly recommended 4.5/5",8,4,9,29 December 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Entertaining
","If you have witnessed the first part of Hunger Games, the second installment of the book based on the movie proves to be an entertainer.The movie starts off where the first installment left with Peeta and Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) attempting a suicide pact. Having inspired rebellions in the districts, President Snow threatens Katniss to enact a drama that she is in love with Peeta in fear she might continue to inspire more rebellions against the Capitol which cannot be afforded. As Katniss fails to do this, Snow makes use of a special provision available in the 75th version of Hunger Games where the victors will be selected from the existing pool of victors.

Jennifer Lawrence steals the show by balancing emotion with action in her role. There are some very good moments in the movie as one by one, the true nature of several people is revealed.The movie ends with a clear indication of another installment.Hunger Games:Catching Fire is definitely an improvement over the first part.

Happy New Year," Time-pass if you have least expectation from the movie and ofcouse if you don't have anything to do !!
","Happy New Year was a typical bran-less , nonsensical entertainer which could be a time-pass if you have least expectation from the movie and ofcouse if you don't have anything to do.After his father is being duped by a diamond merchant, Charlie avenges the false charges implied on his father by pulling off a diamond heist with help of inexperienced yet brave laggards.Farah Khan does a decent comeback with Happy New Year after giving us the disastrous Tees Maar Khan. HNY starts off with routine song and dance with little melodrama embedded into it. Once Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone enters the scene , movie becomes interesting and hilarious. However , the film loses the steam subsequently and leaves no impact at the later reel. In fact , it becomes unbearable that you wish you could press the forward button . Direction is lame with minute focus on screenplay at all. Sometimes you feel that you are watching some old 90's cinema with typical masala ingredients to make a blockbuster movie. Cinematography is efficient. Action scenes are hilarious and larger than life. Art direction is good.Editing should be done efficiently. Dialogues are just about OK. Performances by the entire starcast is commendable. Sharukh Khan does fine job as the team leader. Boman Irani and Sonu Sood are good. But it is Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone who are the soul of the film and they make it watchable. Music by Vishal Shekhar is good. Happy New year is a movie which has decent story , no direction and simply no screenplay. As I mentioned , it is just a watchable time pass thanks to wonderful performances by the star cast. Above average : 2.75/5",6,4,9,25 October 2014
Looper," Looper is surely an unique film like its trailer
","Looper turned to be one of the best sci-fi time-traveling flick on par with 'Source code ' , 'Terminator'. It had a well-structured story line and finest performances I've seen in the recent times. 2044 is the year when time traveling concept was discovered in which a target is sent back from the future by mob to get killed by hired gunman called Looper. Joe is one of the looper who discovers that mob wants to close the loop by sending back his own future. Directed by Rian Johnson ( Brick) , Looper is one of the difficult and challenging movie to make considering the complex story and genre of the film but hats off to Rian for directing it with aplomb. The movie begins with narration in the background by Joe (Joseph Gordon Lewitt) and runs at a snail-pace until the appearance of Bruce Willis(Old Joe). This point onwards , film gathers steam and gives an interesting plot with twists and turns. Interaction between Willis and Lewitt is the highlight of the film with both of them trying to kill each other. However , the film looses the steam and becomes bit tiring that you wish you could speed up the motion little bit. Thank god ... the climax has been wonderfully shot and gives you what-will-happen-next feeling. Screenplay is good not great .. editing should have been more crispy .. dialogues are punching .. art direction is OK where as Cinematography is eye- catching. Performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt is brilliant. Levitt is getting better with each film.. I loved his make-up playing character of cool-lost-in-the-world Joe with honest and sincerity. Willis was awesome as usual. I wish he could have more screen space. Emily Blunt was decent.Looper is surely a different film like its trailer. Little bit of more editing will make it more watchful. Good 3/5",7,3,7,13 October 2012

The Hangover Part III," Unsatisfactory ending. It is easily forgettable once you leave the theater
","After winning over the accolades and warm reception from both critics and audience for the The Hangover , the 3rd in the series of Hangover has nothing new to offer with bland story and unsatisfactory ending.When one of their members is kidnapped by local mafia , the wolf pack must track down Mr. Chow who vehemently escapes the prison and is on run with mafia's gold.There was no point in continuing the 3rd series until you have a very strong script and story to support it. Hangover part 3 has nothing new to offer with few rib-tickling scenes. Direction is below the mark along with unengaging screenplay. Editing is crispy. Art direction is good along with cinematography. Story line is weak. Performance wise, all the actors play their part fine.Overall , Hangover 3 has nothing exciting about the series. It is easily forgettable once you leave the theater. Average 2.5/5Join me on www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk to read more movie reviews",5,0,1,25 September 2013
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," if you are an ardent fan of Madagascar series and the third part is like icing on the cake
","Madagascar 3 : Europe's Most Wanted was a fun-filled joy ride that was superb , hilarious , entertaining , exciting which was better than the previous two partsAlex , Marty , Gloria and Melman wanted to go back to New York Zoo where they came from and in between meets a circus group where each character is trying to re-invent themselves and save the circus from shutting down. Now I have been an ardent fan of Madagascar series and the third part is like icing on the cake. Not only the animation works wonder here , but even the characters are so lovable that you would remember them after you have left the theater and this where Madagascar leaves a solid impression. Madagascar 3 has new exuberant characters with each identity of its own adding colours to already famous franchises. Screenplay is good. Dialogues are hilarious. Animation is spell-binding with awesome 3D effects. All the characters have been very written so well right from penguins till king Julian .Ben Stiller , Jade Pinket Smith , David Scwimmer and Chris Rock as are usual superb with their voices. Rest of the star cast have done justice to their role. Few scenes like the chasing scenes or the circus scene where performs well have been shot righteously. A nice family watch and impressive animation and thorough entertainment. This one is sure to be enjoyed with your family. Very Good 4 /5",8,1,4,10 July 2012
Spectre," Spectre could have been better had the makers given more attention to the script
","The 24th James Bond film Spectre returns the collaboration of Sam Mendes – Daniel Craig who previously gave the blockbuster Skyfall (2012) which had strong characters, well-defined story and well- intentioned script. The actor-director's effort clearly shows in their latest flick but it far from being a perfect film.Spectre tells the events, people and pain that impacted James Bond's( played by Daniel Craig) life. As he digs deeper with help of Madeleine Swann (played by Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old villain , he discovers the criminal mastermind, Blofeld ( played by Christopher Waltz), who was behind all this.Now a James Bond flick is generally greeted with a electrifying opening scene and Spectre leaves no stone unturned. The opening helicopter action sequence is beautifully shot in the crowded city of Mexico with some amazing stunts followed by usual credit rolling in the true James Bond signature style. The interaction scene between Daniel Craig and Ralph Fiennes ( playing the role of M) followed by ravishing cars and cool gadgets is grasping. Things become more interesting when Bond sets out to protect Madeleine Swan which is added by great car chases, highlight being the train-fight scene between Craig and Batista ( WWE Superstar).Unfortunately, the film does not hold your attention and suffers from major blemishes. James Bond is known for utilizing the tactics to escape from his enemy. Spectre shows James Bond as larger-than- life character. In fact, he can do anything from flying planes and helicopters to dodging the bullets. Screenplay suffers in the climax which should have been the strong point. Christopher Waltz's villain character is half-baked ( it is such a shame to under-utilize such a talented actor) and his scenes with Bond is diluted. Editing is bad and you might feel bored in 2 hours 30 minutes film. Cinematography is eye-catching. Dialogues are fine. Nevertheless, it is the enjoyable at moment with some cool action scenes. Daniel Craig does his best to get into the role of James Bond and has done better than the previous film. Monica Bellucci is wasted in a small role. Léa Seydoux shines as Madeleine Swann.Overall, Spectre could have been better had the makers given more attention to the script. Decent 2.75 /5– Ketan Gupta",6,1,4,21 November 2015
Her," It feels great to watch a wonderful movie like HER. It is innovative, heart-warming and outstanding
","With the evolution of technology, things have become easy and simple to use. So much is the usage of the device that you develop a relationship with it and think of it as your live-in partner. HER tells the story of an isolated writer who is in the final stages of his divorce. To seek solace, he befriends an Operating System who almost becomes solution to his daily problems.Directed by Spike Jonze, who gave us abrupt and yet well-made Being John Malkovich, delivers a solid film which is out-of-box and well- conceived. It would have been really challenging to create a character out of an OS and touch base with realistic voice and emotions. Hats off to Jonze for pulling all the strings together. Script is powerful and will keep you engaged. Special mention to innovative art direction and splendid cinematography with tuneful background score. Joaquin Phoenix gives his career best performance as Theodore Twombly. His portrayal of a lonely writer will certainly win him accolades. Scarlett Johansson was superb as voice of OS.It feels great to watch a wonderful movie like HER. It is innovative, heart-warming and outstanding. Excellent 4/5",8,1,2,13 February 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely film !!!
","One thing I noted while watching Mad Max: Fury Road was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was over-stretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding script.Mad Max: Fury Road is a follow-up to the hugely popular Mad Max series in which Mad Max is captured by cult leader Immortan Joe. He gets the chance to runaway when Joe's imperator Furiosa rescues wives imprisoned to Joe. It has been 30 years since George Miller directed the high-octane Mad Max series and he switched to kid flicks like Happy feet and Babe. Probably the inseparable love brought him back to the popular franchises and he gave his best as both director and writer. The opening scene is probably one of the best scene with well-executed chasing scene will take away your breath away. The story unfolds showing the desperate post-apocalyptic phase with weird and crazy characters you would not even imagine in your life. Once the action rolls out, there is no turning back. This is probably nerve- breaking , ears splitting and eventful action stunts which is jaw dropping. Hats off to both action director , stylish camera work and astounding art direction capturing the rough and tough terrain of Namibia Desert. Screenplay is engaging and will not let you blink for a second. Charlize Theron carries the film on her shoulder. She is indeed amazing and will be loved for her tough role. Tom hardy as Max is wasted. An actor of his caliber should have better characterized. Nicholas Hoult was surprisingly good.A kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin. Astounding 4.5/5",8,3,10,21 May 2015
The Social Network," A smart .... intellectual movie
","Social Networking was an outstanding ... very much engrossing movie which keeps you thinking every sec of the film. The film starts on a heated discussion between Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend which eventually leads to their break-up. In the fist of anger , computer programming genius sits down that night and creates a website facesmash.com to take revenge on his e.girlfriend. The website creates miracle overnight among the Harvard students and faculties. This makes Mark a note of talent and is immediately contacted by the twin brothers who wants Mark to create similar social networking website where friends could meet and update their individual status. What follows next is the inception of Facebook and how Mark fights with his own friends. Social Netwrok is kind of blink-a-miss film.The movie will keep make you think on your feet. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is hard to imagine any one else apart from Jesse Eisenberg essaying the role the youngest billionaire. He is simply outstanding and gets in the skin of the character. The direction by David Fincher is flawless. He is growing better with each films. So , overall I loved the film. Definitely watchable more than once..",8,1,3,4 January 2011

The Fighter," Another true story well told along with a mind blowing performance by Christain Bale

Furious 7," Fasten your seat belt cause this one gonna blow your mind !!! A commendable watch
","Enthralling car chases , heavy-duty action stunts coupled with immensely likable stars like Jason Statham, Paul Walker. Rock and Vin Diesel is what defines Furious 7. Fasten your seat belt cause this one gonna blow your mind !!!Dom and team faces new challenge when they are contacted by Shaw who vows to wipe out the entire fraternity to avenge his brother's death.It is little surprising to see James Wan taking the director's seat this from Justin Lin. More surprising is Wan gives you yet another knockout core action film which is breath-taking and stunning and moves away from his comfortable zone of directing horror flicks like SAW, The Conjuring etc. The story is simple but it is execution part which is effective. Though the screenplay falters especially the climax action sequence ( which never ends :) ) but the gripping performance and well- choreographed stunts will keep you on the toes. I was entertained throughout the film and was almost on the edge seat while watching the car dropping down from 10,000 feet or jumping from one building to another building. Cinematography is excellent . Art direction is spellbinding. Editing could have been better. I think the entire star cast gave a captivating performance and were true to their character. Last few minutes paid tribute to Paul Walker and was well picturised. Overall , I liked Furious 7. It had high volatile action , cool car chases and strong performances by entire star cast.
