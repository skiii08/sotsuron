It," NO Spoilers as such but I am confused
","I believe I am generous in my rating and I am in minority here for sure. IT is overrated and too much hyped. OK let us come to the point.Is it a horror movie ? Is it Comedy-horror or horror-comedy.? No it is unintentional comedy with little bit of jump scares.Few points to ponder over as follows - 1. There are bullies in school who are beating up fellow students at will and no body complains and no parents are affected either. 2. Were American parents mostly evils or bad in eighties ? 3. Bully head boy has a sports car in eighties which twenty first century kids will be envious of. Who gives car to such young kids. 4. Why kids have to swear so much in the name of conversation or pleasing audience to smiles ? 5. Sewage is so much integral part of life in that town that every alternate scene is shot in sewage locations. 6. That Joker type entity is comic book. Movie has kids but to be viewed by adults. Utterly confusing. 7. Entity feed on your fear (flash too I guess) but young boy died in front of our eyes in first scene. Was not that real ? The blood in bathroom of the girl was not real ? All kids washed it together, though it was not visible to evil father of the girl, leading a pathetic life of an adult. 8. Bollywood is put to shame if you see the melodramatic tone of the movie at times. 9. Everything which Stephen Kings writes does not have to be great. 10. There is no police in town, even a policeman is murdered by family number. 11. Kids can be so fearless and can put adults to shame by their research work. 12. No adult is bothered by happenings in town except kids. 13. Be prepared for a sequel demanding more dollars from you.14. Can somebody return my 2 hours (money was not too much as it was a weekday with a descent crowd mostly college goers in a very big plush South Mumbai Cinema screen) plus 2 hours of commuting to the place because of hyped created so I wanted to enjoy the experience in an exclusive place. My friend could not complain to me much in shame or hesitation. There is a lobbying of reviewers in Film Industry of all countries. Movie was a bit entertaining if not viewed seriously. First 15 minutes are too good really especially concerning paper boat and young boy.",5,6,15,13 September 2017
