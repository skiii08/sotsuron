Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Why of The Sudden People Become So Righteous?
","Well I finally see what the fuzz is all about. It is truly a laugh out laud experience for me, after all I really have nothing to get offend by it but I can clearly see why some people will really hate this gag.I guess the name of the movie already summarize the movie so I don’t have to explain. The story is actually much better than I thought it would be, I thought it going to be like another stupid movie full of stupid gags like “Ali G In Da House”. But there is more than that, it was like a case study plus humor, and it has been written really well, very well cinematograph. The dialogue is also very funny at time, but it was the acting that brings out everything.Sacha is practically Borat so what else is there to say, he was awesome, his acting and confident is very believable, and his accent is brilliant. He makes Borat standout like anything, making him a very iconic figure.Well most of the gag is very much controversial in nature tacking topic such as racial, religion, female, social status, homosexual, and so on. I guess because most of the time Hollywood don’t really have the gut to bring those topic to lime light so when it finally came out it is pretty funny. Just like South Park. But unlike it this movie doesn’t seem to hold on anything and just go ahead with the gag; and that making it pretty refreshing.If you’re not the one that gets like offended (Jew, gay, etc) then I see no reason of complaining. People need to loosen up. This is all for humor. I see some people take this so seriously, I was very surprise. They should have known this is ain’t that type of movie that one can take it seriously, still they watch it and complain about it. Why of the sudden people so righteous? Last Words: I would recommend that people would loosen up and try to enjoy the movie; I still understand this is absolutely not for everyone taste. Do not expect any sophisticated joke.Recommendation: Yeah, It Worth a DVD.Reason To Watch: Awesomely Funny From Time To Time.Reason Not To: Very Offended Jokes.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B+)",7,0,1,2 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good concept, Bad story.
","Star Wars: Episode I, telling the story of that occurred before the first trilogy. The story of how little boy turns out to be the most powerful Jedi, Darth Vader. Not a bad concept, but how the story has been told is not quite impressive as the first trilogy. It was quite entertaining, but not quite up to the standard of the original. This would have disappointed many fans, especially when they have been waiting for over 16 years and after all the publicist and advertisement they have seen. And it last turns out to be just one simple fun movie. All we can do now is wait and see how it turns out in Episode 2 and 3.Max: 5.0/10",Null,2,4,27 November 2003
3:10 to Yuma," 6.5:10 For Yuma
","This is definitely not your typical type of western movie one would be expecting, and this definitely will not be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn’t have that stylish cowboy shootout or killing everyone senselessly; but it is more of a dramatic western movie which works to the certain levels.Three Ten started of very slow to the very point that I thought - well it actually be of any fun?, even with some gun fight it still felt very drag on, dull and unnecessary in the first hour, luckily the amount of pace start to catch up gradually and the last forty five minutes start to be something more like a cowboy movie. I don’t like my cowboy movie to go much off the track.I guess the present of Russell and Christian are the main reason I watch this movie, plus I read a whole lot of positive review about it. The two were just awesome, actually almost everyone in this movie is awesome, and some of them even give a very decent performance even with unexplored character. At first I thought Ben was more of a miscast but after the movie went along I realize he wasn’t all bad at all.The whole production was also pretty good, a very stylish wardrobe I must say, a very good lighting, good direction, brilliant location (not too deserted), and good editing. The only things that keep this movie from reaching its fullest got to be the uneven story and that unnecessarily overlong introduction. And that to me is the key point to any great movie.Lastly, with so many positive reviews I might have too higher hope for it, which leads to a mere disappointment when it doesn’t reach that expectation. It is still a good film none the less but don’t get high hope on it. The good thing is at least the movie is more or less rewatch-able.Recommendation: I Guess You Can Rent It.Reason to Watch: Russell and Christian were great.Reason Not to: First part of the movie is overlong and boring.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+) Please Rate Y/N Only After Read.",7,0,1,1 May 2008
50 First Dates," Don't Let The Cheesy Poster Fool You, This Movie Have Lots To Offer.
","Brilliant concept movie, probably one of Adam best so far. I did enjoy this movie and it quite worth your money in renting so.The story of the guy fell in love with the girl of his dream, the only problem was, and she got short-term memories loss and couldn't remember who he is the next day.Even the non Adam Sandler fan will like the movie. Adam and Drew really great together, and since they work together before it is no awkward. The movie did offer something new and that is the story (not that new, I know) but it is still really good Only thing was too sudden ending and not as funny as Wedding Singer.Overall: Recommended Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)",7,2,4,10 March 2005
Catch Me If You Can," The movie that made for the first time viewer only.
","`Catch Me If You Can' is an OK movie. Not so good but not bad either. But it is sure fun movie to watch (for first time viewer). The movie didn't bring out much of the feeling for the viewer, therefore it likely that you will watch it only once, just for that record. So after all you won't miss much even if you skip this movie.Max: 5.2/10",Null,0,1,26 November 2003
Iron Man 3," Good fun, but add absolutely nothing new to the franchise
","This felt more like a new episode of the Iron Man franchise because what you see here is what have already seen before (only with different villain). But none the less it is still is fun movie to watch.This time around Stark dealt with his personal health, his love for a girl, his obsession with the suit while trying to save the world. Like I said, this has been told since the first Iron Man. So what was the different between this and its predecessor: almost none (maybe a little darker and more serious – and that's good)The main reason why I went to see this was for the fact that they casted Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce, I love both of them. They did a nice job as a villain, only wish they have a cooler role and not Mandarin. This character is a little too comical. The good thing about this movie is they able to maintain good sense of humor/ more screen time for Gwyneth Paltrow/ very stylish / and more or less nonstop action scenes. Plus the scene where Tony stuck in a small town with a little kid who help him pick himself up add a little different to the seriesAnyway I do recommend this movie (especially for dull Saturday evening with your kids). It is still is fun movie to watch despite the story get a little stale. Rating: 6 /10",7,0,2,10 June 2013
The Ring," Very Satisfying Horror Film I Have Seen In Years
","This movie is somehow much more satisfying than the original version, but not as creepy.After the death of her niece, the mother request Rachel to investigate about the videotape that seem to kill anyone who watch it after seven days; that include herself, as she have to find the ways before it kill her in a week time.Just the plods are already creepy. Though compare to the Japanese it might not be that creepy (but don't think it is not creepy, because it is). And overall it is much watch able than the original, more enjoyable since you don't have to read the subtitle; bigger budget and makeup make the movie even more enthusiasm to watch.Reason To Watch: · Naomi look really great, · Brilliant acing by D.Dorfman · Amber Tamblyn, after all it is so hard to see her. · Very satisfying and money worthy. · Good remake and the director did capture Japanese style very well.Reason Not To: · Might be disturbing by the video, · Why is this movie was made even though the Ringu is still a new movie.· Might be very scary for some people.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,0,1,24 February 2005
Resident Evil: Afterlife," It Was OK
","First thing first I'm a huge fan of the first movie Resident Evil; I like the style and everything. Sadly for me that change over the course of the follow-up which they decide to make it less suspense and more of the action base. Which make me happy to know that Paul W.S. Anderson came back in the director chair to make this movie – unfortunately for me that don't really help, I felt as if I was watching Dawn of the Dead with guns (though After Life is a Whole lot better than the 2nd and 3rd) .Synopsis: Alice along with the few survivors trap themselves in an abandon High State Prison surrounded zillion zombies as they seek the way out to what they believe to be the last safe place known as Arcadia.The story felt like a comic now that there are already four parts into it as we slowly follow each journey of Alice and it very much felt episodic, luckily we finally get the chance to see the guy behind Umbrella Corp. There isn't much to say about the story really but bewared don't get too much hope on it; just watch it for action sequences.As for the casting, I thought it was so-so, with Milla look a hell lot better than in Extinction, lol. The castings of Welworth (Prison Break) do add a little status to this movie, though I hardly see his present really help this movie much. Shawn as Wesker has a lot of resemblance to the original but the bad part was doesn't really work out that great when in the movie Overall I don't really have nothing much to say about this movie, but I do enjoy it a whole lot better than Apocalypse and Extinction. The action part is pretty awesome especially the fight sequences between Axe Man (aka Executioner) though very very short. The heavy metal music work well in some parts. (Since I didn't watch it in 3D I can't say it has awesome effect). I say, hell just go and watch it when there is nothing on TV, you might enjoy it if you doesn't go too much on pin point the flaw ad loophole in the story.Recommendation: Worth A Rental from your local DVD store.Reason to Watch: You have been watching it the past three movies, just cont. watching it.Reason not to: It never seems to end, is it?

Fight Club," Thank you, David, Thank you!!!!!!
","I love this movie, that all I can say. Even though it have been extremely criticized by the critic. I love it. The movie is excellent. No comment. I wish I could express myself better how great the film is, but why should I do that when David Fincher already did. This is one of the best film of all time no doubt, and are one of my all time favorite. Every thing about this film is excellent from brilliant script, to casting, to acting, to every thing. `Thank you, David Fincher for making this film so great' this is what you will end up saying after you have seen the movie. This film is `Simply the Best.'Min: 9/10",Null,0,1,27 November 2003
The Rookie," Not That Good
","Another feel good movie from Disney. The Rookie is about a man who has been given a second chance to play baseball after getting injured and was ask not to play by the doctors, until (12 yrs later) he found himself able to pitch at 98 mile/hour and would like and try to get in Major League.The movie starts off very slow especially the introduction of his childhood before getting start with something. The location is very dried, bright, and sandy making this movie somewhat not very attractive and boring. There 3 parts to this movie 1st - His Child Hood, 2nd - His Coaching experience and 3rd - Him playing. Somewhat I feel the story is too long.The movie was OK, the acting was also OK not great and telling the truth, there is nothing great in this movie. Watch it not watch it really make no different. You wouldn't feel a thing.Rating: 5/10",5,1,3,27 January 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Good Remake, Surely Not A Disappointment To The Fans
","Dawn of the Dead (2004) is much more scarier than one could even imagine, if not for a fun type of music at the background this movie could be even scarier especially during the opening credits. The rating is even higher than the Original film and somehow after watching it you wouldn't have that doubt any more - yes it is that good. (Very entertaining, with load of - action, guns, zombies and running survivors.) The story is still intact as the original, and is having a brilliant casting leading by Sarah Polley. The acting is very decent and is very convincing. The camera work is brilliant with still base on the original film and with higher budget some of the scene are 'Woah'. With Zombies can actually run, the movie is in much faster rate than the original which make it flawless and keep you stick to the screen.This movie is no-doubt much better than most people have expected, and is there fore strongly advised for one to watch it especially the DVD version.Rating:8/10",8,0,1,19 January 2005
Lords of Dogtown," Great Start But Lost Along The Way.
","This movie didn't make it big in the theatre, but that doesn't mean this skateboarding movie is bad. In fact it one of the most decent I have seen in years. Though not even close to that good and also the middle of movie is way too brief, it doesn't really stop me from watching it.Story: Base on true story of the four legendary Z-Boys, as they earn they way to success before crumbling they friendship.The movie does have something to offer. And once watched, you get the feeling that you're in the 70's. The movie and the director create a really good atmosphere for the movie. Heath Ledger might star in it but he not what good about this movie. It is the characteristics of the three main characters that standout, even if, they acting are not that good.The story is entertaining but the way they friendship fell apart it is way way too brief and can be confusing. But the ending is pretty good but I'm not really sure if everyone will like it. The story gives a pretty good idea about skating during that time and the brief change in the material used to make board better.Recommendation: A Hard Core Skateboarder Fans Wouldn't Have Like This Movie, But For Everybody Else, I Guess It Pretty OK.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)",6,3,13,20 February 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Disappointment, But Wasn't Too Bad
","It's been over the decade since I saw the last Alien so I don't quite remember what going on in Alien3 but I guess it doesn't really matter since this movie took place 200 years later and there ain't much connection between the rests of Alien trilogy.Synopsis: Ripley was raise back to life after 200 years of her death by the process of cloning; where the scientist decides to take revive Alien that was in her for experiment. Things don't stay as plan when they escaped while the Queen is breeding a new kind of alien.Written by Joss Whedon, the guy who wrote Buffy, Firefly, Toys story and so on; this guy got his own fans – whatever he does or he touches turn into gold for them. Sadly it ain't me, I see movie for what it is. And despite the great potential in this movie – it fail.I do not blame Joss for this failure since there seem to be quite a change in the script and how it was executed. But overall there ain't anything much in the storyline to hold on to. It was kinda lame and predictable storyline (maybe in 1997 it was awesome, but in 21st century it wasn't – it was dated). The only memorable scene might be the underwater fight (still, it last only few minutes).What I suspect was there has been a great influence from the studio to change the feel of the movie (almost half of budget has been cut) and the story and production design has been change. The movie feels like an ordinary - man versus extraterrestrial movie and not an ALIEN movie. It is not much of a thriller ride anymore.Anyway I don't get why they always give to the project to the unknown director (first it was James Cameron, and then it was David Fincher, now this - Jean-Pierre Jeunet). (James only did Terminator and Piranha) (David only did commercial before that) (Jean can't even speak English – maybe that is the reason he can't communicate with the rest of the crews and casts).Overall the movie lacks the very ALIEN feel of the first three that very unique in its own way. This was very commercial. The story was weak and the execution wasn't very plane movie – nothing really stand out. Not even the newly hybrid Alien that suppose to be one of the most fearsome creature in the universe. It was disappointment.Recommendation: Sure why not, it wasn't all bad if you have low expectation and not compares it to its predecessor.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)",5,1,2,1 November 2011
World War Z," Decent Flick from Brad Pitt
","Decent, is what describe best for me for this movie. It is fun to watch and it has many suspenseful sequences and very fast pace story. Problem was once you saw it - it pretty much 'ordinary'.Well I can understand if people were disappointed. After all it is one of the most anticipated films of 2013 and for the past 2 years they have been giving glimpse of the movie. But it turn out to be 'so-so'.I think the whole Rated PG 13 destroy almost everything. Zombie movie with no bloodshed, who the hell think that? It turns into very mildly violence movie for kids. And while there is no violence they also decide to rewrite the story that everyone can understand. I heard that it was so different from the book that Max Brooks (Novelist) don't want to involve with the movie. Anyway it wasn't all negative. The movie is extremely suspenseful and if you don't expect anything at all it can be fun and a great time passer. While Brad still look great and give a decent acting everyone else was flat.The fighting sequences though not very grand as hope but still very much fun from start to end.I still do recommend it but don't have a high hope and you might actually enjoy this movie.

Shaun of the Dead," Funny Zombies, Funny Shaun
",Somehow I didn't quite find this movie as amusing as what people say it is. Actually it really did follow it tag line very well. A combination of 'romantic comedy' and this time with 'Zombies'.You do get loads of laugh from this movie though some of the stuff is really hard to understand (especially the strong British accent and the British jokes). Though this might be a comedy it did delivered some very gruesome and horrifying images and death than Dawn of the Dead and other horror movie does.Anyway the movie got a great pace and is definitely not even bit boring making it a joy to watch.Recommendation: Tried to watch it couple of time.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-),7,1,3,25 May 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good!!, As Expected.
","I have never read the book before but i heard this is million times better. Anyway from my experience this is without doubt one very satisfying movie to watch. As of expected, just like in the trailer.The movie is very constance in pace and is always something in the movie. I say the movie have been done pretty well. Especially the casting of the kids, it is marvelous. But despite all the goodness, i still feel the movie is lacking of something, and the story is a little too brief and concentrate on the younger audience. The CGI is very well done.Final Words: This is one very entertaining movie to watch no matter how old you are. But more on the kid side. And it sure make a great Saturday night movie to watch with family.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)Please Rate Yes/No After Reading, Thanks!!!",8,0,1,23 March 2006
Madagascar," Great Fun.
","This might not be the best animation, but one thing I'm sure  it is one of the funniest one. I mean hilariously funny. Especially with the scenes of imitation (of other films) and the soundtrack is awesomely done.King Julien and his squirrels' follower and the (gangster like) penguins are what to look for in the film cause they're so funny. So funny, that hardly anyone talk about the four main characters. Anyway it is not all that funny through out the movie. The first 15 min was quite boring (at least for me  particularly the scene in the subway).Overall the film did a very good job, and I don't feel cheated watching it. The only thing was  it is way too short (that you feel you haven't seen anything yet) and also it got pretty abrupt ending.Recommendation: You Don't Get Tired Watching It Again And Again.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate My Review After Reading (Yes/No). Thanks!",7,0,0,8 September 2005
The Girl Next Door," Very Funny Simi-Porn Movie
","Yeah, it got 'Elisha', it got the words 'porn star', and you think the movie will be mouth watering.The movie about a boy fell in love with the girl next door who has recently just move in, while having problem with her troublesome ex, he discover that she used to be a porn star and her ex is actually her agents.The movie is different from most modern teen movie and it seems to be base more of the 80s' style and that what keep the movie down. Anyway the movie is damn funny through out (more than you ever expected).The movie begins well and continues to do so. The only thing was the movie seems to miscast and it really didn't bring any characteristic to the movie or what the people could look forward to. (I know there is Elisha, but it is no use) Recommendation: Watch It With Your FriendsNote: Include After This: Damn they used the word porn but there nothing of the lead actress and that is a disappointment.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6,0,1,9 February 2005
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not Memorable but Fun for First Time Watcher
","Despite many negative reviews about this movie I still pretty much find it pretty entertaining, it is definitely not the best or as entertaining like Pirates of the Caribbean (actually it can't really be compared) but it definitely fun film to watch.Synopsis: A young prince was framed for the murder of his father; as a fugitive he must now tried everything to prove his innocent with the help of the princess Tamina and her time reversing sand dagger.Prince of Persia almost has everything to it – good casts, entertaining story, big budget, good director and so on; but what it lacks was charisma, humor and that 'wow factor' into it. And that what takes it toll on what suppose to be super fun film.The story is not something new (mind you I base my review on film, never get the chance to play the game yet), or you can say you have seen it zillion of time like Scorpion King or read it from Arabian Nights. But we haven't really seen anything that really base on Arab like this since Aladdin and You Don't Mess with Zohan (don't ask me how does it get into my mind) so it is nice to see some from Hollywood. I say go along with this 'pretty much' childish storyline and some flaws of it and try to enjoy one self.If you can't do that, then watch Jake as Prince of Persia – He fit the role perfectly (maybe a bit too muscular) but I can't see anyone better than him. Other people are also great too; thought due to the underdevelopment in their character people will not really recognize or remember them at all.Otherwise I think everything else was OK, the wardrobe, the score, CGI, the backdrop, though dialog and acting was a bit wooden from time to time, but all in all acceptable in some level. Though the lack of major 'memorable' scene make this movie just a one time watcher and after having seen it people will forget about it within two days.Overall, I think it was just OK. Worth a DVD rental from the store, but will definitely not be adding this into my collection.Reason to Watch: Jake, better watch on boring night (with friend maybe).Reason not to: A bit too happy, too predictable.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: c)",6,2,4,15 October 2010
Finding Nemo," Beautiful Film
","What makes this so special is about this is the story, the touching story about father and son; and also friendship. This is a great work of our beloved Pixar Animation, and once again they prove that they are still looking for quality rather than anything else.After his son was taken away by the screwdriver, a crown fish father tried to search the whole ocean for him, with the help of his short-term memory friend, and the entire ocean of sea creature.There is no doubt of how great the story is, it consists of everything - humor, good solid character, brilliant plots, good pace, and with great story comes great movie. There are also loads and loads of characters in the movie change from one place to the other, this make sure you'll never get bored. The action are also very consistence. Ellen did absolutely a brilliant job renting her voice, so is other actors.I love this movie and without doubt so is millions of people both adult and kids. It is so famous that nowadays people called crown fish 'Nemo'. From my experience this is definitely one of the best animation movie ever created. I have so much fun watching it, and definitely a must own movie.Recommendation: The World Best Animation Movie.Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+) Please Rate My Review Yes/No After Reading.",10,0,2,13 June 2006
Troy," What A Disappointment !!!
","Out of the entire epic and the historical movies, this is got to be the most commercial one of all. And after watching it --- I'm extremely disappointed with it.First of all, I think the movie has been done very commercially and cast whole loads of misfit actors for the role as the selling point. None of the actors even have the look of the historic people. The movie also has very bad dialogs, which sound extremely strange when listen to. And the whole loads of scene are just too cinematic for action movie lover about hero is untouchable. Plus it is a very inaccurate history epic. A really bad research of a scramble storyline written into a screenplay.I think the movie is overdone with the little knowledge of the history and research -- making this movie look very modernize and really abrupt and somewhat incomplete. All the good actors turn into bad (except  Eric Bana) and the whole action hero scenes is just a waste of time.Only good thing about this movie is the Battles Scenes which has been crafted and directed beautifully. But in the end not that convincing cause i sense too much fusion between the new and old technique of everything from screenplay to modern day dialogs to the the slow motion action sequences like in the Matrix.Recommendation: Overall It Didn't Work Out Well and I'm Very Unhappy With It.

Terminator Salvation," Pretty Much Ordinary, But You'll Still Watch It. --- Mr. Sensitive
","Finally – we got to see “The Future” of the terminator franchise and to tell you frankly – I think the flashback from the T1 and T2 tell you a whole lot more than this movie. Though this ain’t that bad of movie but seriously, the story and the plots are just plain and lifeless. For me this would have been just another man versus cyborg flick if it weren’t for the Terminator name. There isn’t much of anything really that make this movie to think about, but more of the question that came after having seen it. The story ain’t that confusing but there is a whole lot more explanation to do in the next film because this film didn’t quite make much sense. Don’t seem like a vital point of the “future” to be told but letting us know that John rescue his father.The tone of the film change quite a lot from the original since almost every scene is shot in the broad day light and in the desert, taking away a lot of darkness of the movie in my account. Remind me of Resident Evil: Apocalypse. But at least they explain why every battle has to fight in daylight.Anyway I thought the movie started out pretty alright, I like the part when John fought with T-600, and the score when well with the timing, but after that it felt so ordinary. As for the casting, I thought many of them didn’t quite do the job, C. Bale was not much of a John Conner, Sam was OK – but not so convincing Terminator, Bryce didn’t do anything at all, I think only Anton is only the only one to look out for. Also it was accompany by the weird and wooden dialogue and awkward situation. But apart from that McG did quite alright with his direction skill.Beside from complains (mostly on how the story developed – I don’t really care how much error it made) the movie is more or less fun to watch. There are load of action sequence – involve almost everything man vs. man, man vs. Terminator, Terminator vs. Terminator and so on.Oh and almost forget – the CGI is actually pretty good over here, Arnold face tracing technology is pretty darn convincing (though for few moment), but I’m impress.Overall it would be pretty alright if you watch the movie for what it is, but if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise (then you would have known that it was over with T2 – J. Cameron said it himself) you would be more on the disappointed side. Season To Watch: It is “The Future”, we always wanted to see what the future is like!!!Reason Not To: Judgment day don’t really existed, it was save in T2.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6,0,1,15 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Entertaining Yet Boring.
","This summer I got the chance to see every big budget movies that came out including this one, like everyone of them, it not really live up to standard. It wasn’t bad just not as I was hoping it to be.Synopsis: After eaten alive by the Kraken the crew set out on the journey the save Jack Sparrow from the land of dead before battle with Davy Jones and Lord Beckett once and for all as they tried to demolished all the pirates out of the sea.I thought the movie started out really slow and to the certain extent --- boring. The fact that the film is shot on half written screenplay taking its toll could be easily seen on the screen as from point to point there are major setback and complete silliness that is too hard to believe that it don’t even feel like pirates movie anymore, and also it was ways too complicated.There are many things that annoy like the fact that Jack Sparrow disappear half of the movie and when he is on screen, there are only Jack Sparrow. Most of the time there is only Elizabeth and Will. And also in this movie out of sudden they make Capt. Davy Jones and Mr. Norrington so incompetence when in Curse of black pearl and Dead Man Chest they are so good. Even though there are loads of characters increase and uneven distribution of screen time I thought it still work out pretty alright.The good part of the movie got to be the special effect and CGI which is awesomely done. It looks absolute stunning with lots of great detail from the beginning to the end of the movie (Specially the battle scene between Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman). In addition the score is also pretty awesome add the great mood to the movie.In the end the movie has it’s up and down. Ask if it was entertaining, yes it was but the land of the dead part was absolute boring. The jokes in this movie seem force. The end of the East India Trading Company is way too easy. It did wrap up most of the thing for the trilogy but it happen too easily.Recommendation: Prepare for some confusing story, still is very entertaining but sometime can be boring.Reason To Watch: Because The Second Left You Open Ending That You Have To Watch This.Reason Not To: Things Happen To Brief At The End.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: C+)",7,0,2,25 June 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Evil: Beyond Disappointment
","And once again I will start by saying I’m the big fan of the Resident Evil franchise both game and the movie, that is until what I saw in this movie. This is far beyond the most pointless sequel ever and has almost had nothing to do with anything.Synopsis: Even after the nuclear bomb the city in the previous movie, the Umbrella Corp still couldn’t maintain quarantine, this leads to the spread of virus throughout the world. Alice and her friends must now try to survive and help the other in need.The story, the plot, the holes is indescribably bad. There is no plot just people running around in the desert tried to fight zombie, and birds. There is no character development or hardly any situation development from the previous movie except they changed the location. The story also probably riffs off from many different movies that left you absolutely no way of finding it out. The story was just plan bad and there is absolutely nothing to it. Even after they have turned it into the action movie, the action part itself is rather boring, and out of the blue the zombie is much more aggressive this time.The new cast member in this movie doesn’t add anything in this movie even one bit. Only Ali Larter character seem to be walking around organizing this and that (food, petrol, weapon) which most of it nothing to do with anything but added more screen time to the movie.Lastly: I’m tired to writing.

Hotel Rwanda," I'm Not A Movie Basher But This Movie Was Overrated
","I'm not a movie basher but this movie was very mediocre. I don't really mind about it being PG-13 and not showing much of genocide and brutal killing (the movie only intention was to show about survival) but the story and the movie itself is very unemotional and flat. I feel so detach to it.Synopsis: A hotel manager Paul was force to housed over thousands refugees as there were genocidal and unrest outside of the hotel.The good part of this movie got to be it was quite entertaining to watch and there is something happen all the time. Plus I get to know the country Rwanda existed and thus have this entire problem. The sad part is when executed into the screenplay it wasn't that good and combine with really bad cinematography make this not such a good movie one hope to be. I guess if you watch it for fact it was fine but movie for movie sake it wasn't that good.I got to say the whole film is very flat, though there are like two scenes that are quite moving but the rest was very ordinary and forgettable. The casting of Don Cheadle was a smart moves (otherwise this wouldn't close to be this famous), though he was the best in the movie his acting is barely average and the rest turn out quite bad specially Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo. The direction is average and nothing special and could have been much better. The score was all right too.It was just an all right movie and that is all. I have the concept just because it was a true story and it is a drama people subconsciously think it is a good movie or saying that it was a good movie to make their taste look good on other people.Recommendation: Yes, It Was Quite Entertaining. Worth Rental At The Most.Reason To Watch: For The Facts.Reason Not To: Bad Cinematography, Didn't Managed to Bring Out Enough Emotion As It Suppose To.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: D).

Crash," Overrated But Is A Really Good Film
","This movie base on racial discrimination and probably the thing that made it so famous since people not normally talk about it either to see it on the big screen.Ask me if the movie is overrated, i would said yes. But i also would have said this is a really good movie too. The story and the characters has been written really well. The movie is very intense and it sure does have a great flow in the story from the beginning till the end. Though i was kind of surprise of how much recognition all the actors get, after all i barely see much of any character e.g. Matt Dillion got nominated as best supporting actor for 15 min of portraying the bad cop? Anyway this is definitely the film that one should watch for the story reason, not because of it has won Oscar or any other thing. The acting is great (espcially Matt and T. Howard), and the cast work well together. And another reason to watch this is, there hardly any good movie this year.Recommendation: Definitely Worth A WatchRating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B+)",7,0,3,11 March 2006
Fast & Furious 6," Like Watching Indian Action Movie
","I think this movie has met with its objective – a good popcorn movie. It was fun/ fast/ loud/and stylish. If you are looking for those things you will love this movie. If you look for story then look elsewhere.This movie is no longer related much to cars and engines like its predecessor but rather concentrated in action/ gun fight/ bombing. Through there are many cars chasing scenes it not really about the car anymore. (Don't they like assemble car anymore? all they do is went out to buy one) While the movie was really fun to watch many things that went on in here are just pure ridiculous that it turn to be so funny. It reminds me of watching Indian movie that no matter how beaten up or shot at - the guy is all he seem to get little bleeding at the side of his mouth. He is untouchable!!! And in the end anything will be alright. Even the dead are now undead (remind me the like of American soap opera like The Bold and the Beautiful)Another good thing about this movie is the set, it is freakishly huge!!! Involve the use of tank/plane/bike and so on. It is fun to watch that they don't seem to hold back the budget and bring about everything that they wish to get. Anyway while they did managed to make a really fun movie to watch the story and how unrealistic everything is just pure ridiculous. I recommended if you want to watch a mindless fast pace action movie.Rating: 5 /10",5,0,1,9 June 2013
Nacho Libre," I thought It Was Nice.
","Don't compare this Napoleon, I know they both have same sense of style and it was the same director but this is also different movie. I think the movie was quite all right despite there are quite a few trash talk just because it wasn't 'as good as Napoleon'.Synopsis: Nacho is a priest with a long life dream of becoming a superstar wrestler. That faded when was force to be a holy man. He got his inspiration back when there was a new nun transfer to his dirt-poor orphanage home. As he tried to win her affection he also have to conquer his dream and save the orphans.I like the overall movie and that all I can say, it also got Jack Black one of my beloved actor. And in this movie he has the total freedom to act really himself and that what really standout in the movie. He is bloody funny without having to say a word. Can't really imagine Nacho being somebody else.The movie is easy to watch with a basic storyline added with dry humors and lots of action. What I really like was the fact that he is such a loser full of silliness but at the same time full of faith and determination. I also like the soundtrack with is extremely catchy and blend in really well with the movie.The only part in the movie that I didn't quite like it that much was the ending I find it to be too brief. Otherwise it was good. The whole cast also did a pretty good job and the feel and pace of the movie was just right. It was a worthwhile movie.Recommendation: I Got The DVD And Don't Feel Riff Off.Reason To Watch: Nice Wrestling Movie, Jack Black.Reason Not To: If You Dislike Dry Humor.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate Y/N after Read, Thanks.",7,0,1,26 March 2007
The Town," Good But Not Great
","Despite many positive reviews by fellow movie lover which lead me to watch this, I rather find this film a mediocre at its best.Synopsis: A robber fell in love with the bank he just robbed while at the same time tried to distance himself from the crime business and the rest of the gang.The story is nothing new that we haven't already seen or heard. And this movie makes sure it stays that way. You can very much predict from scene to scene what going to happen next who die and who lives, but despite from that it is still mildly entertaining that two and the half hours went by quite fast with decent amount of action sequences.The casting was alright though for me not a single person was really stood out in their performance. Only two days went by and I hardly think about those characters and the movie anymore. I don't even understand how Jeremy got the nod from the Oscar, he hardly has any screen time and his performance was hardly remembering (despite the fact I watch the unedited DVD).As for the direction and everything else was also very ordinary. Ben tell good story but he has no artistic vision. Everything was very straight forward, man shoot a man, man kill a man, man love a women etc. Everything else is just bland.All in all it is another ordinary movie. I can't really understand why people find it to be very good drama/heist movie, to the point that they even compare it to HEAT. This film is not even close to HEAT and I don't think I will likely watch this again anytime soon.Recommendation: Sure, you might it more than I do. Worth a rent!!

Elf," I like Elf (I'm talking about movie).
","Elf is a nice, fun loving film for Christmas and if you still watch it other time of the year you still will enjoy it. The story follow a human baby grew up in North pole among the Elf, He thought he was also an Elf until one day he find out that he not actually an Elf and is therefore go to New York in search of his real family and save Christmas spirit among the people. The movie is great for everyone and can actually being enjoy at any age.

Lost in Translation," Wow!!
","You might know it because it is Sofia Coppola's work or because it won an Oscar and BAFTA; but this is truly one movie that is not famous for nothing. This movie does not only provide good drama and great acting, but also a great humor into it.Synopsis: Two strangers meets up at the most confusing times in their lives in the great city of Tokyo; forming a great friendship and understanding.From the great screenplay, directing, acting, and casting  this movie has the entire good thing in itself. Even with all that, the film is shot in Tokyo, making it even more interesting to watch and to see a different culture. The movie also provides consistence humor from Bill Murray.Final Words: Though this is one hell of a movie, it is also a very slow one. For those who like fast pase movie - you might not enjoy it. But for anyone else it is going to be surprisingly good.Recommendation: I Watch It Again and Again, And Still DOn't Get Sick Of It.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A-)",9,0,1,24 April 2006

","`Star Wars: Episode 2, Attack of the Clones' is the continued story form Episode I. Occurred 10 years later. The little boy now turns out to be fine young man but full of hatred. This is sure turn out worst than what people expected. It is so bad that it even can make the biggest of Star Wars fan lost his faith on George Lucas. To me, it is just another Ok pastime movie.

You will feel so good after watching it. I'm not exactly sure how. I couldn't explain but there is something about this film. You won't ever get tired even you have seen it tenth time before. It is so typical English. The film has been Brilliantly done, especially the acting of Julia Robert, Hugh Grant and his beloved friends and family. And the story line, the script, Brilliant! And it is really funny in some parts too. It also got one of the best soundtracks in the movie. It is a really recommended film to watch.

The Aviator," Matin Scorsese Prove Good Director Doesn't Mean Good Movie
","After seeing the movie I now realize why this movie didn't win an Oscar, I feel the movie lack something and it not quite working as it should. The movie is also a one time movie; it means you can't watch it again and again.The movie is not very well executed and the script, I feel the script is not very strong and well thought. Still the movie works out pretty fine but noting to hold on to, not even with the entire stars that are in the movie. Something is missing in this movie and it left the movie --- blank !!!. Leo didn't perform the best he can, nor is other actors.Watching this movie is pretty tiring since there noting much except clothing, makeup and how grand the set look but overall not very of the substance. The movie have loads of hole and the casting of Leo is kinda misfit for me.Recommendation: Should and Could Be Much Better. Not Satisfying At All.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)",5,2,3,31 July 2006
Oblivion," Not Really Satisfy With It.
","The main reason I went to see this movie was because of Joseph Kosinski and what he has done with Tron: Legacy (that movie was awesome by the way!!). This movie has potential to become really good but I think because of its story that lack substance it bring the whole thing down.This movie is more like a sci fi/ drama rather than sci fi/action that we mostly get nowadays but never the less there are still some action to enjoy. Yes, only some (very few to be precise). The story of a man left on the ruined earth with only one mission: to extract Earth's remaining resources and repair driod. Sound fun? Yes it is. But sitting in the theatre for one full hour watching Tom Cruise repair droid ain't much of a fun (it will come to the point when you will thinking to yourself – 'will there be anything happen in this movie?) The second part of the movie is when most stuff happen, when things get more interesting and clues start reveling and action start happening. Everything squeezes into this one hour that you hardly get to know and feel for the movie. I don't think I even get the name of Morgan Freeman.Anyway apart from the story everything is not bad. It got brilliant direction, acting (by Tom Cruise), CGI, music and the tone of the movie. But with weird choppy dialogue and the story that has been told a million times in other movie - this left me totally unsatisfied with this movie. If this wasn't for Tom Cruise and good CGI I think this movie going to fail. My recommendation: Worth a rental!!Rating: 5/10",5,5,9,22 April 2013

Burn After Reading," Burn After Watching
","For those who don't know this is a BLACK COMEDY (like myself) will be the real blow to you. Here on the Saturday night looking forward to some light comedy movie and it turn out to be a real massacre ain't my kind of fun. The trailer doesn't imply it to be black comedy either. I felt cheated and robbed of my valuable holiday.Synopsis: a man and women found an ex-CIA memoir that contains what they believe was a valuable national security. They next plan trying to black mail that ex CIA to giving them money. The problem arises when he refused to pay the money.What I believe is that - people are trying too hard having seen this is as Ethan and Joel's films they force themselves into like it. I on the other hand didn't quite enjoy it at all. The first 2/3 part of the film are complete pointless and only almost close to the end when things start to get interesting.Frankly, I watch this movie because of them (Ethan and Joel) having seen No Country for Old Men (and really like it) I wanted to see what movie they will do next. I also believe that most (if not all) watch this movie of the same reason. The cast also add to that. But that doesn't help one bit.The casting was probably the highlight of this movie with G. Clooney, F. McDormand, J. Malkovich, T. Swinton and Brad Pitt (even though he appears in like ½ hour or so). The actors of this caliber need not be said how good they are. Still that doesn't help me one bit.The movie do consist couple of humors though not kind of laugh-out-loud and not the thing you were going to look forward to.Overall, It left me wondering if it wasn't for the two brothers would it even be made let alone famous? If it wasn't for the two would any of the cast still willing to appear in the movie? If it wasn't for them would it have gone straight to DVD kind of movie instead of theatre? Anyway, this is probably the only time I will ever watch this movie. I count myself lucky this time having not going to see this movie in the theater, otherwise I would have been so mad.Recommendation: Sorry, but I can't recommend this to anyway one that do not enjoy black comedy.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)",3,1,3,15 October 2011
Hot Rod," Good For What It Is.
","You can say that this is another romantic comedy; and yes it is true that we have already seen this story more than a thousand times, it is also very predictable and stupid at time but I guess that what we actually expected from the movie that from the guys of Saturday Night Live.This movie is funny to the certain extent (not the LOL kind, but more giggle kind), consider the source of the gags the SNL team, the jokes is absolutely random, funny, stupid, and embarrassing from time to time. You will never know what joke is coming next. So I guess that what draw us all to watch this movie, oh and of-course Isla Fisher.It is story about the guy name Rod, a wannabe stuntman, his biggest adventure set in when he find out he need to raise fifty thousand dollars to save his dying step dad. Yeah that what I’m talking about the predictable part, the unpredictable parts involve a whole lot of wacky scenarios.This movie have the character of its own, but more on the line of Napoleon Dynamite, something that look really lame and yet fill with characters. Enough with those non-scenes, the movie consist of the soundtrack made almost entirely from Europe’s songs. Now that what I called character.Now the casting, it was awesome!!! They all fit like jigsaw, except for Isla – she is too pretty for this kind of movie. And they all gave a pretty convincing good-for-this-type of movie.Though as entertaining as it is, it was mildly humorous, no bursting into laugh. I must say not the type of movie that everyone will like, but most likely enjoy. And an absolute no-no to the serious movie watcher that tried to crack-code in the movie. What ever it is the movie did have a pretty location setting, very well editing and good direction.Recommendation: Rent It First, Might Not Suit Everyone Taste.Reason to Watch: Isla Fisher, Unpredictable Joke.Reason Not To: Predictable Storyline.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C) Please RateY/N Only After Read.",6,0,3,22 April 2008

","I haven't seen the original or anything but I have seen this and I got to say  it is more interesting than I thought. Really, I thought it going to be just another heist movie like Ocean Eleven or something.Anyway this is interesting and better casting (as: they all really suit for their role). The characters are very well distributed and there no left out make you feel very assuring watching it. Seth Green was hilarious and very convincing, also Charlize look at her best.The good thing was this movie has very believable action scenes  like the car chase, helicopter chase, boats chase and best of all it not overly done. Maybe also the changes of different places make this movie more interesting.So next time if you have doubt what heist movie to rent from the video store, I say this is it.

I don't fine it that interesting like the rumors that had been spread all over.It just some kind of a fairy tale (novel) written by J.R.R Tolkien.Even though the movie is not bad, I prefered like Stephen King movies like - The Green Mile, - It - The Shawshank Redemption Thomas Keneally -Schindler's List All these are good movies, I did not meant that The Lord Of The Rings is bad but I was shock to see it on the third spot on the TOP 250 MOVIES.

Man of Steel," Better Than Most Superman
","This time Superman get the real reboot with real director and production team, and because it was made in the twenty-first century the word 'reboot' mean that it has to pack with - shaky cam shot/ loud noises/ never stop action sequences/ a lot of CGI/ and choppy editing. It has it all except trying to write a better screenplay. Never the less the movie is still is fun to watch and the kid will love it.Don't want to get into much detail of the origin of Superman because more or less people already knew it. The story itself has great potential but somehow they didn't manage to put that well into the screenplay and all you have is a much underdeveloped characters and many scenes skip too fast that you hardly feel for the character.I must say the casting of Henry Cavill is superb. This role serves him well and he did a good job with it (A lot better than that pretty face in Superman Returns). Michael Shannon as General Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El was acceptable, but other than that was just not good enough. Even Amy Adams – she look so old and sloppy here (her character is so dreadful).The reason I went to see this movie was it is directed by Zack Snyder. I enjoy most of his work. And this Superman was leaning toward the good side (though not by much). What he did here was pretty good – cool villains with cool armor/ better Superman outfit / high amount of action to enjoy/ and great casting of a real looking Super of a man.Anyway I don't think this really add anything new to the franchise. If you have seen Smallville or other superman you probably have already seen it only this time it was a much better production. I think it will do great once it come out in DVD cause it doesn't matter if you see this or not.Rating: 7/10",7,0,0,14 June 2013

At least better than The Signs.Yes, the beginning of the movie actually not that interesting and could be quite boring. But this is M. Night Shyamalan movie, he only concentrate on twisted ending (is that the good thing  I don't think so). What make this movie better than I thought was - there is more than one twist, that what make it interesting.The casting is surprising good, somewhat better than the movie. I say Bryce Dallas Howard have done a brilliant job of all. Though I was expecting a twisted ending, there are some unexpected and it let you guess, so I say he really did what he wanted in this movie.Recommendation: Yes, Rent It.

Silver Linings Playbook," Nice movie; Lack 'Wow' factors
","The experience was great, it was fun/ heartwarming/ humorous at time/ and well written and executed. Yet for me it still lacks that 'wow' factor of many great movies. And at the end by a week or two I cannot quite remember or care about it anymore.I thought the movie was written really well but it was the actor's performances that really bring out the best out of this movie. The story of a man with mental illness tries to get back his life by trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things change when he met mysterious girl – Tiffany. I thought Brad performance as a mental patient was really good, much better than I give him credit for all this time. I thought he was even better than Jennifer Lawrence whom also did a remarkable job here (though not really an Oscar worthy). What they both did as for the rest of the cast is what really save this movie from going straight to DVD kind of movie.Apart from good cast/ great performance and well written lines and story I can't really pinpoint anything else that standout. It was fun to watch the first time, but somehow I don't quite crave for more of it. At the end it is just another good romcom.Recommendation: Worth rental, see if you will like it because I don't really see anyone will watch it repeatedly. Rating: 7/10",7,0,1,12 June 2013
Van Helsing," It Delivered What It Said To Deliver...A Really Good Action Sequences
","What drawn me to this movie is the idea of the movie, which is so imaginative especially the three story intertwine into one. I also am expecting a good action sequence just like Stephen did with The Mummy. And the outcome is more or less --- satisfying.Brief: Prof. Van Helsing, the vampire hunter was send to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula from his evil plan of taking over the world.Yeah the story is what I like and the style of the movie is just perfect. My problem is that this movie got a really weird dialogs and worst the accent of each characters have, it is so hard to understand specially Count Dracula that sound like an Indian guy. The used of Hugh and Kate is a smart move and it work out really well. What I like most of the movie is the detail they have put into the large Set and CGI and wardrobe and make up. All that has been done brilliantly. Though the acting is nothing special.The best part of the movie is what I was hoping to see  loads and loads of action scene, and they did deliver it and it is extremely fun to watch.Final Words: Excellent action sequences, though do expect an unexpected ending (but not the good one).Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)Thanks For Reading",7,0,1,11 September 2006
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Decent
",Even with no expectation this still didn't quite live up to anything at all. None the less it is still mildly entertaining and pretty well made. Good for the boring afternoon that you have nothing to watch.This is the retelling of the children classic book Hansel and Gretel and makes it darker for the adult viewer. I must say the story is pretty decent and not at all complicated. There is a good enough background story with loads of action sequences. Well that got to be the best part of this movie because action is almost non-stop and the fact that it is rated 'R' killing and slaying is delivered all the time. The casting of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bond's girl Gemma Arterton is probably the smartest move. I suppose this really drawn in many viewers (including myself) - Gemma Arterton really looks good here. The set is very small but they did a good job here (thought many scene look very setup). Overall the movie is good for the first time viewer. It is not all bad. Worth a try out.,5,2,4,20 June 2013
Collateral," It Was Alright
","With so many people talking about this movie I decided to watch it for myself. And I did like it. But one thing I hate about this movie is (not the fact the Mr. Foxx is a dominant character of the movie) the ending  tell the truth, to me it a huge disappointment.Anyway Tom and Foxx did provide with a brilliant acting and rich in characteristic personality, and great camera work making this movie a good feeling to watch. The story might be slow at time but there is some action interval from time to time (though not very long).But every thing comes down to the end (which I don't like). After all I find what Vincent said was right  he's a professional and Max is not, and how the hell it ends up this way. (It seems the story favor the main character than reality.)

But what do you expect when Paul Walker act as a cop (he not even suit the role) and stiff muscle guy like Van Diesel, who barely can't even walk himself but become an excellent speed driver. Only Jordana Brewster did look really stunning in this movie. After all, it really worth a watch, especially for the cars lover and for the person who love fun car chase movie and hot chick.

So that the film would not turn so bad in the eyes of the fan. Still. You have seen this million of times. And I heard they are coming with Ocean's Twelve. Hell. What next The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen robbing a Casino with their extraordinary power. A real disappointment from Brad Pitt, he should be in here.

After all it can't be exactly like the game.I think the movie is pretty cool from the very start, though you might not know what going on in the first but you will, later.

After all it is a totally different films and production team.I won't deny that the story is typical action movie and the characters are more or less shallow, but in the end it is very much watchable. What make this movie watchable are the action sequels that occurred from time to time and also the CGI also has been done brilliantly. The set also look great.On in All, I did have a quite a good time watching this movie. There are loads of stuff and action that keep on coming making it a good fun action movie to watch. Of my experience people that trash this movie have are stereotype and have a fix idea that the first Alien and Predator are good and nothing else can top that. Give this movie a chance and enjoy it for what it offer  loads of action scenes.Reason To Watch: To See Whom Will Win - Aliens or Predator? Reason Not To: Typical B Grade Action Movie Story.

No Country for Old Men," I Love The Character
","The main reason I went to see this movie was people won’t keep on talking about it. I love good movie. This also got one of the best reviews of the year and nominated for Oscar and BAFTA, so it’s pretty much an assurance. But what I didn’t expect was an instant classic; this will truly be talk about in years to come (unlike those Crash, The Departed, Million Dollars Baby, and Chicago) (I still wonder if people still remember that those movie actually won an Oscar for Best Picture too?)(Yeah, it was fun at that time, but no one talk about it anymore, so what is the point)What I like about this movie was the driven story with great flow and the character that has been written with so much enthusiasm and characteristic, it very rare nowadays to find things like this in the movie. As much as I don’t really see what happening much in the movie apart from the thrill we get from Anton weather he will decide to kill or not, I find myself extremely enjoying it. It was the character driven story so this is definitely not up for everybody.The casting and the acting got to be the best part in the movie; boys, those actors sure bring those characters out so beautifully. It was a superb acting – Anton was rough, destructive, outlaw, at the same time can be thoughtful and have his own set of rules. Llewelyn Moss is kind, thoughtful but at the same times a fighter, a survivor. Sheriff was old and doing nothing. Man, that Texas accent is really hard to understand.I also love the lighting in this movie, I thought it was clever and save the movie from looking too dry with most shot was in the deserted place. Also great cinematography, not this year best but it was awesome. I think it wills more easily if I say everything was awesome. The story also contains the metaphor that is quite hard to understand; specially the ending. Recommendation: Serious Movie Watcher Should Have It As A Collection. Reason To Watch: One of the best pictures of the year, Very well written characters, Awesome acting.Reason Not To: Desert, Personal dislike of this genre of movie.Rating:8.5/10 (Grade: A-)",8,3,7,17 March 2008
Batman Begins," Na Na Na Na Na Na Na .Batman!!!
","With so many impressive reviews from IMDbs, it kind has assured that this movie going to be damn good. And they were right. I really did enjoy the movie that I never thought it will be good again. Maybe also because the previous was so bad (Batman with nipples suit), it kinda make this look even better.This 'grown-up' version of Batman is what people have seen looking for. And there is loads of stuff to be praise about. Starting from the story  very solid and insightful (though I hope there were more connection between each character) , the casting and acting is superb (10/10), brilliant directing and editing and also a good villains at last.What makes me so sure that this movie is going to be good was Christian Bale, I'm a big fan of his, he always dedicated to his work and never goes after for Hollywood frames. And that make him so special, making this Batman very special.Because this movie is not cartoonish and fake like the previous four movies, it makes it an outcast, a really good outcast I meant and truly is a (New) Beginning.This is truly a Summer movie that one should not miss.Recommendation: Go And Kick Your Butts If You Haven't Seen It Yet!.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,0,1,6 July 2005

","I can't really tell the purpose of this movie at all, is it to sell Kate in swimsuit? How come there hardly any story into it? And or this movie is about nothing but just one of those girls kick-butt type of movie. Who knows? What ever it is the movie seem to make quite a name for itself and Kate. The directing are not that bad at all especially in the water and the waves. Though the acting and dialogue are not smooth and sometime even far from realistic.After most of the review you will find that the movie is watch able but don't have high hope on it.

Meet the Fockers," I Laugh So Hard!!!
","This is a movie that one can guarantee that the people you advised to watch will actually laugh. I don't really understand why many critics didn't like the movie. Maybe because they have no sense of humor. As far as I concern this movie did delivered what it suppose to  Humor.I really enjoy this movie, its jokes is a killer though not as sophisticated like the first. The casting of Greg's parent (Dustin and Barbra) workout better than I have expected, they were lively and add loads of joy to the movie.The story also work out very well that you'll feel very comfortable watching. After all we knew the characters of each character from Meet The Parents. Not only that Greg and Jack know each other moves (with all the hidden cam and everything), it makes the whole thing much funnier.What I tried to say is this is one comedy that shouldn't be missed and you have to see it for yourself.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks",7,0,1,8 July 2005
The Transporter," Looking For Bad Movie To Watch, You Have Found It.
","There no word to describe how bad this movie is. It is just another really cheap attempt movie.The story: The transporter broke his own rules by opening the package he has to deliver to the mafia. That when they decided to kill him and the girl in that package.It is a HUGH disappointment watching this movie. Frank acting was like bring a stuntman to make a movie; Qi Shu can't even speak right most of the time. The story is horrible, even worst was the score and the dialogue. All they do was adding fighting scenes from time to time. And how the hell is all the French mafias know Kung-Fu.Overall, it was a Hugh disappointment; Qi Shu can't seduce me to watch this movie anymore, it is just damn bad.Rating: 4/10 (Grade: D-)",4,0,2,3 March 2005
Seabiscuit," IMHO It Is Ain't That Great; Just Good
","I have a mix feeling about this movie after watching it. If it good? - Yes it is. But if Really good like all the people say - IMHO not really.Story: There is 4 parts to this movie, introduction of Charles life that took around 15-20 min, His first interest in Horse Racing and how he invest in it and gather all the necessity took around 30 min, Racing of Seabiscuit, and Comeback of Seabiscuit.Yep, before you even see Seabiscuit over 40 min is gone with Charles life and this and that of American History. Making this movie really lengthy. The movie did offer a lot of thought though. It is the movie that makes in-flavor Oscar style, thought most of the things is genuinely done the movie look a bit too much of cinematic.Over-View: The movie is quite slow and dry there fore not for everyone to watch. Recommended but not worth a buy. (Though it sold over 5.5 Millions DVD, Highest for Dramatic movie) Rating: 7/10 (Grade: C+)",7,1,2,11 March 2005
28 Days Later...," One Of The Best Zombie Movie Around
","What special about this movie was - it look more realistic than most zombie movie. Of-course zombies is not real, but this movie project it as ' what will actually happen to the survivors if the city is over run by the living-death.' It opens with breaking the code of zombie movie by telling the source of the virus, before concentrating on one-man wake up in the hospital 28 days later. The story is great and was told really well. The directing is awesome. And the acting is surprisingly good and though they are unknown actors (to me) I have no problem watching them.I've seen the alternative ending; it is not better than its actual ending.Though less action (compare to other zombie movie) and pretty slow pace  this movie did work out pretty well. Not to brag but this is one of the most interesting horror films I've seen in sometime.Recommendation: Excellent Zombie Film.

Django Unchained," You get what you expect, maybe more
","I will keep this short as I'm one of many who enjoy this movie through and through. I will say it right here in the first paragraph that I highly recommend it. It is highly entertaining with good substance and well written story. There are still some down part but overall it is just truly --- 'awesome'.Like most Tarantino movies the story is well written, rich in character and every second it can surprise you. Truly deserve its Oscar for best screenplay. My only complaint was 'the third act' it started to get a bit playful and out of place (when Tarantino make a cameo). Still I enjoy it thoroughly. The best part was the casting and acting. I read that Will Smith was actually the first choice but Jamie Foxx really nails it. I like him here so do the character of Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz. Overall - I love it. I need not say how the production is because it is good (simple as that) and very creative. High in action/ not that gore (easy on the eye)/ well written/ well act, nothing more could I ask for.Rating: 8.5 /10",8,0,2,4 July 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," More Quantity Than Quality
","As the big fan of the franchise I refused to listen to any negative comment on movie, until I see it for myself. And damn, some of them are right and many are exaggerated and some just blindingly watch movie. Anyway this is what I think: The movie is entertaining but more or less a disappointment and heartbreaking. I blame it on studio executives for not waiting for Bryan Singer and let him do his magic but let Brett comes and ruin the series. I'm sorry to say this Brett but the movie is not good. His directing and his ability to do everything are not even close to what Bryan can do despite having all the money to do anything he wants.Screenplay: Badly written despite having a good concept. Instead of developing the story all they do is cramp up tens of characters which none of it is even close to develop. Extremely disappointed with Angel and Cyclops, who have a scene only for 2 min, but they used him to promote the whole movie. Simon and Zak are to blame for this awful screenplay. Truly is horrible, they record show that. Couldn't believe this could be used to make a movie. The movie is very comic like, too a-like. The story concentrate on how to make it like a comic and overlook how it would it look like in movie. And the outcome is not good.Only the casting seems to be doing the right thing, otherwise I'm really sad to say this, but it hasn't live up to the standard. Everything seem to be cutting into chase and with every characters so shallow, it just didn't do it for anyone.If you're watching the movie blindly then you will see all action but apart from that there is nothing else.Recommendation: Do Not Compare To The First, Two To Have A Peace Of Mind.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C) Thanks You",4,0,1,13 July 2006

Expected a lot from this movie and sure it won't disappoint you, even though I personally felt that Fellowship is better. The movie continued with Flodo and his Hobbit friend cont' to move closer to the Middle Earth.

The Incredibles," Incredibility
","I'm a little bias when it comes to Pixar animation, cause I enjoy its animation so much with their previous work and the good thing is, and it never let your expectation down. With a high status the studio still care nothing but quality and produce only one movie a year, and The Incredibles is its'2004.The story is not very new but still base perfectly on the pop culture of the 60's cartoon of the super heroes who is struggling to save the world and the problem of they own, which most of the other cartoon never talk about. And also clear our mind of 'who design those (super heroes) outfit?'This movie is simply great with the powers that actually rhyme with one another (although it is not very original, but that didn't bother me) and the flow of the movie is so sooooo good and interesting. Added with great storyline, CGI and the classic look this movie is definitely up to your high expectation. (No matter how high it was) This movie is highly recommended by most people. (And don't believe the entire negative thing some people say - they are here just to annoying people).Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A+)",9,0,1,2 February 2005
The Mist," Pressure.
","Well, this is a presently surprise. This movie is not just a monster movie like the other after all. This is not a horror; it is more of a psychological thriller and it was awesomely done. But after all it was from the guys that brought us The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Miles. So it’s expected to be good.Synopsis: After a sudden mist covered the whole town. The customers in the small grocery store find themselves trapped. Tension increase as they believe monsters is lurking outside the store.Like its tagline this movie is solely base on fear and how human will actually react in this kind of situation. It’s more real than most monster movie that out there; Steven Spielberg tried to do it as in Wars of the World but didn’t come close to this. In this you will feel the fear and frustration.I enjoy how it cut he chase and find oneself in the store the next. The pace of the movie is awesome. But there should be more of a character development; I feel I hardly know any of them. But some character is beyond noticeable; you will feel everything and what they go through.Well, I was surprise at the casting actually. Thomas Jane, I love that guy since I saw him back in Deep Blue Sea, but for me frankly didn’t quite work here, and I feel the movie would be more dramatic if used more serious actor. The other actors are also, my opinion, not suited for this type of movie.I also love the score in this film, very chilling and go with the movie really well. As for the visual effect, this is utterly awesome, awesome, each monsters is full of detail and blend in with the atmosphere of the movie. Well I’m not getting much into directing and lighting, it’s Frank so it’s good; you know that I know that.Overall, it was a realistic psychological thriller that will drive you to the edge of your seat from the beginning to the very end. And if you are not very familiar with Stephen King work the ending will definitely stick to your head for days.Recommendation: Yes, It Was Awesomely Fun; Though Do Beware Its Stephen Work.Reason to Watch: When did Frank Darabont and Stephen King ever disappoint fan?

Kick-Ass," The Most Fun Movie Experience In Superheroes Genes.
","One of the most satisfying action movies I have seen in a very long time, so good that I actually forgot what other movies I have seen recently.Synopsis: Dave is a typical high school comic book nerd who one day decides to become a super hero, even though he has no powers. Things never go right from the start and only got worse when he got intertwine with the mafia who is out to kill him.What I love about this movie was it bases its story on reality. There are no super power, no nothing – just a simple geek pretend to be a super hero and basically everything that would happen if one pretends they are a superhero. Kick-Ass might not be the most original movie but it is among the best executed superhero movie ever created. I think the R rated really help bringing out the best of its story because it is so intelligence and so violent it is satisfying to watch (really tired to see this PG13 superhero movie).Anyway the casting got to be one of the highlight of the movie with the Hit Girl came out as the most lovable character with her sharp witted sarcasm and her ability to kill. By the end you seriously want more of her. Nic Cage did seriously surprise me here – Big Daddy totally rock! His solo fight got to be one of the best action sequences (Which later topple by a scene by Hit Girl save Big Daddy Scene). Dave (aka Kick-Ass) is one of the most realistic superhero. He is courageous but also very fragile.The movie also comes in with brilliant score and music that fitted perfectly with the mood and tone of the movie especially during the action sequences. I guess it is the good thing when the studio decides someone with great vision do the movie. Matthew Vaughn really turning himself into one of the most sought after director in Hollywood.Overall the movie fulfills my every expectation. One of the very few action movies that managed to do almost everything right. Totally fell in love with it. Recommendation: Yes, Get yourself a BlueRay !! Rating: A* Give it a 9/10 for too open ending.",9,3,5,30 November 2011

","`Coyote Ugly' is much more entertaining than I thought. Actually I watch this because I have nothing to do and after I watch it, it turns out pretty fine. A fun movie to watch. The girls look stunning and have done a pretty good job in acting and dancing. Don't expect much from the movie and you will have a great fun with the movie. The movie also came up with quite interesting soundtracks.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Rise
","Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is one of this year most awaited summer blockbuster and for me this got to be the most improvement of them all compare to Spiderman 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. Or maybe the first one was pretty bad that it make this one look good, but for what it was this one is pretty entertaining.Synopsis: Fantastic 4 have a new mission, stop the Silver Surfer who has been terrorizing the planet after they learned that which ever planet the Silver Surfer visited, the planet dies within 8 days.I thought the film was very entertaining. The story is pretty good specially there is more stuff going on, though not much more it looks a whole lot more. It actually kinda has a lot of content that are similar to first movie. I like the idea where they reintroduce Dr. Von Doom to create a tense atmosphere. Though, I’m kind of disappointed that not much of character development at all, except for they have girlfriend.Silver Surfer got to be one of the best villains out there, and I’m glad they decide to choose him for this installation because he just doesn’t only look awesome, his ability is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately in this movie he was not able to show much of his ability and the only time you will see him doing anything is flying away from Torch and fighting with the army, which both scenes lasted just a few minutes.Apart from that it was the same old Fantastic Four with a little more action that is not really related to its villain. Mr. Fantastic and Invisible girl look much older than before. Torch gets much more screen time but somehow not as funny and memorable as the first and The Thing, what does actually the Thing do in this movie? Not really the part of the team at all.Despite complaining I got to say the movie was fun to watch. It is the same old mindless comical movie like the first movie but with vast improvement in CGI and much faster pace action and with more budget they now able to fight in different part of the world which is more pleasure to watch. Good for what it is.Recommendation: Yes, Watch It, Compare To The First This Is 10 Times Better.Reason to Watch: Silver Surfer.Reason Not To: Too Comical (But That What The Movie Go For).Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate (Y/N) After Read.",7,2,5,3 July 2007
Garden State," Nicely Done For Newbie

This movie might not be to everybody liking since it quite lengthy and the pace is quite slow. Sam portrait by Natalie Portman is one of my favorite characters. She does a brilliant job here. Zach does also deliver a better performance than what normally seen on Scrub. And I also got to praise him on his direction, which has been done brilliantly for the newbie. The only problem is the ending, which is not being wrap up properly.Recommendation: Natalie Portman Fan Will Love This Movie.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B) Thank you for reading.",7,0,1,29 August 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," As A Fan I Have To Say  It Is Pretty OK (But Not As Good As Before)
","I'm the fan of the first movie and the game but this movie is nothing compare to both. It was sort of the disappointment cause it look so good in the trailer. This movie has lost its believable story and style that the first movie was built on.It is not all that bad, if you look in the action movie wise and not comparing it to the first. The movie picking up where the end of the first movie left off. They have done a good job with the Nemesis makeup and costume, really look like in the game. And Milla did look hotter than the first movie.The casting and acting of this movie is very average (though, much worst than first movie). This time there is hardly any dialogue. They concentrate too much on how the character in the movie should be like the game rather than trying to develop more realistic storyline.Anyway I have to warn that if you're planning to watch  expect more of an action fighting rather than zombie movie. Also expect the cheesy ending (unlike the first) and also tacky battle scene that you normally seen in Mortal Kombat and Kick Boxing movie but uses here between Nemesis and Alice.The most disappointing of all in this movie was - there're hardly any Zombie.Recommendation: Yes, But Don't Expect It To Be As Good As The First.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks",6,0,1,28 July 2005
Dumb and Dumber," I Like It, And I Don't Care
","Dumb and Dumber is one of the best comedy ever created and I can say it oh so proudly. I don't care what people say and how it was called stupid and comedy with toilet joke. It is supposed to be stupid and dumb, the name already suggests that and if you're still saying that it is stupid you are dumber than I thought.Staring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as Lloyd and Harry; the two best friends are on the road trip to see Lloyd dream girl Mary; along the way they face many adventures.This is without doubt one of the funniest movie, involving almost everything Â– kidnapping, stupidity, love triangle, friendship, road trip, girl, murderer and twisted joke. The cast is brilliant, I don't think it can be any better; Jim and Jeff are superbly funny and their acting is second to none. And the joke and the situation is a killer, the movie is consistently funny throughout the movie.Everything in this movie seems to be well thought and is a great flow and balance. And though the directing and all the technical work are averagely done it doesn't stop Jim and Jeff to delivered all that humor.I still can remember when it first came out in '94s and how hard I laugh the first time I watch it. I still laugh at it even 12 years later.

Clash of the Titans," Nothing Close to being a Classic
","I went to see this movie with an absolute high hope thinking it gonna be big!! It gonna be Hugh!! An Epic!! Somewhat like The Lords of the Ring. After all, the name itself already implies that –it is Clash of the Titans. But for crying out loud – this is nothing more than just a mediocre old age movie with really bad script and probably worst editing I've seen this year.It doesn't take me long at all for me to realize that this is not going to be the movie I hope for (about 5mins into the film). The script was plain flat, no character development no nothing – heavily rely on how the action sequences and how going to turn out. The worst part was it very chopped up and everything seems like a race. One minute you were watching this, next minute is totally different situation – it was so fast I don't even have time to absorb anything. (For Pete sake! How cans anyone put an epic into 90 min movie?) Plus this film got really weak dialogue and completely uninspiring lines.I'm really sorry but it doesn't really stop there. The casting was just awful (solely because of bad script) – I like Sam, but this movie make me realize –he doesn't have much personality or character at all, it is like he play the same character for every movie. The others are – you don't really care about them at all, much of their story and background have been omitted and so I don't really feel the connection or care how they're going to be.I can't really point out the good part of the movie at all – but maybe a couple of decent CGI of the monsters and some fast pace action sequences that remind me of Transformers 2. The wardrobe was out of place, out of the blue there is couple of white dude wearing something like an Indian holy man, and the army suit was weird (though I do like Zeus suit).Overall I'm quite disappointed with the whole movie and its story. But I guess the pre-teen boys might enjoy this with all the monsters killing, slaying the Medusa, and the quest to save the life of the princess he doesn't even know. No wonder it was release now rather than in the summer.Reason To Watch: If You're Looking For the Action and Nothing Else Then This Might Be the Movie For You.Reason Not To: Please Read the Above.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D )",4,6,9,10 April 2010

Big Fish," Flawless
","Of entire thing I got to say this - I love this movie. And it is really head to describe how good this film was.This movie is about life, love and friendship told in the most magical of way. A story of a son tries to reconcile with his dying father by trying to retrieve the stories that his father used to talk about himself and his unbelievable adventure.I must admit at first I have doubt if I'm going to see this or not since it seem pretty dreadful and also there not much of anything show or word of mouth saying much about this film. Three years later I finally got to see it, I feel like I was wasting all those times not getting to know how brilliant this film was.This film is great in everyway from the very second the film start to the very last second the film end. It will fill you with lots of emotion, dream, mythical adventure, and an art of storytelling. I must praise screenwriter John August to be able to bring all that into the screenplay making this one of those rare screenplay that surpass its novel.Another thing that really standout is the cast of the entire brilliant actor, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney was so believable that they will make you cry. And Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange is so look-alike and they are so good. And it is great to see Helena Bonham Carter with a blonde hair. That make up is great and the costume is beautiful. And what best is the acting that is very believable and very emotional that they will make you cry and feel for each and every character.What another point that I like about the film is the fact that this is unlike anything that Tim has done before but somehow he still able to make it his own. The magnificent set, the style of the film and mood are very much his own. Maybe also it has something to do with the great score that add lots of mood to the movie.The movie consists of great number of metaphor, which is another thing that I like about this movie. There is a meaning to everything and it has been written beautifully and directed brilliantly. This is a truly a must own movie.Recommendation: Yes, Worth Every Penny To Buy DVD.Reason To Watch: Imaginative, Brilliant Writing, Great Directing and Acting.Reason Not To: You'll Left Wonder How The Hell This Didn't Get Any Oscar For It.Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+).Please Rate After Read Y/N, Thanks.",10,1,1,2 December 2006

Keira Knightley does deliver a great performance, much more than I have bargain for.It feels really good to finally able to see a really good romantic movie after all there hard one nowadays. The directing and cinematography is a bit strange as every shot have photography flames, but it work out just fine. The dialogue is beautiful and the casting is brilliant.I think the movie has been written really well and the pace of the movie is quite soft and charming throughout the movie, making a great flow.

The Mummy Returns," A Worthy Sequel To The Great Franchise
","The second installment to the franchise this movie does live up to every expectation. And is the rare thing, but this movie surpasses its original. For the people that love an adventure movie this is a must watch.Brief: Set 10 years after the first movie, where Imhotep is being resurrected and this time he wanted to rule the world and be immortal. To do so, he have to kidnapped Rick's son who is the chosen one to guide them to the mystical place of Scorpion King pyramid.Though not very accurate nor sophisticated as the previous film, the movie is being substitute with more entertainment and more action, and it was an absolute blast to watch. The story is brilliant and the best part is there has been a characters development and the introduction of the new character adds more freshness to the film.What I like most about this movie is an endless action scenes, that is unlike 'don't talk, just shoot' kind of movie. This is fun from the beginning till end, though many parts of the movie are over done. What disappoints about this movie is the CGI of Scorpion King, which look absolutely fake and it was one of the worst animation I have ever seen and that really put me off. Why every single animation in the movie is awesome, the most importance character ends up so plastic like.Lastly, it is truly a worthy sequel to the great franchise.Reason To Watch: The Story Continue Brilliantly From The First Movie.Reason Not To: The CGI of Scorpion King is Horrendous.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Rate Y/N After Read, Thanks",7,2,4,29 October 2006
Super 8," Not Really Super
","I really try to like this movie because it was directed by JJ Abrams and I like his movies and all the stuff he produces, but this time I still can't help but feel barely disappointed.Synopsis: Unexplained events occurred in the small town after the train crash incident while a group of friend accidentally tapes the whole occurrence.I was expecting a whole lot more from this. But the story itself was very shallow and is the major letdown though I still think it is a great production. But in my account - the story itself count for more than 50% of greatness in movie, that is why I'm so disappointed.The story become very cliché after a while and by the time you met the reason of all the mystery you will end up feeling disappointed especially if you have seen Cloverfield. But in Cloverfield it was new at that time. This is like a repetition but a kiddo version. Even though it was suppose to be like friends bonding and all; I don't really feel connected with the characters.The casting and acting was in fact brilliant considering they are very young and new to the industry. Especially Elle Fanning, she was awesome. The rest of the cast also did the good job, but with the limited screen time they are the one we don't care.The set look great and have this mystifying experience. The mood and tone is very well delivered and cleverly shot with absolutely great lighting.Overall, the movie is still very much entertaining but wasn't living up to the expectation. I still think this will be really enjoyed by kids of age 7-15, or grownup that already have kids.Recommendation: Still - Yes, Have Low Expectation And You Might Enjoy It.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6,0,1,22 November 2011
The Last Samurai," Quite Impressive.
","Wow, this movie almost made it to my all time favorite movie. It is much more awesome than I could ever hope for. But whatever it is, this got to be one of the best western movies that projected the Asian culture in the more or less the collect way.I understand the fact that it rather tells the story of the movie from the white guy point of view because it is Hollywood movie, but it didn’t quite bother me. After all it was Tom Cruise, the guy never fail in any of his movie (maybe MI: 2 but that it), and in this also he was awesome.I like the fact that the movie seem to put in quite great research on historical fact than some lazy ass screenwriter that would stuffed in anything he thought of Asian culture would be like. The story did came out great to the certain point, though flaws but it still great with lots of emotional scenes and great fight (also some unnecessary and cheesy scenes).For me if this movie got a more profile director (though Edward Zwick does qualify for high profile director) I believe other can and will craft out the movie more beautifully. There are quite great room for improvement cause it feel too commercialize.Otherwise I truly recommended this film; I was having a good time watching it. The best thing is the film doesn’t feel to try too hard to look good. And it is very much re-watchable; with also great score and lighting and setting location. Great costume too.Recommendation: Worth HD-DVD.Reason to Watch: Great Story.Reason Not To: A Bit Too Commercial.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,1,2,29 May 2008
Up," Enjoyable --- Mr Sensitive
","Yes, another movie from Pixar!!! That name alone is a quality assurance. Though I must admit that I didn’t quite find this movie any improvement from their previous, but it is still very much fun to watch and enjoy myself.The story is brilliant as always - really moving and humorous. And who could forget that 5 minutes montages, visually explain the story of Carl’s life without words. This time around the Pixar decide to take a little turn as we look as life itself rather than other point of view like their previous film – Toys, Bugs, Monsters, and so on. But they still managed to keep all the charm by adding such a lovable character to talking dogs, and colourful birds.Anyway the story is beautiful, only problem was at the time I have already seen most of the funny stuff in the trailer; so many of the stuff didn’t come much of a surprise to me. The flow of the movie is just great and with Russell (Little scout) around, everything is so lively and very much cute!! Also his stoutness and little beady eyes, added to the cuteness. There is a pretty good chemistry between almost every character. Though, despite all the praise I have for the movie (maybe a little bias) I still the movie lack one thing that really woos me. I’m not sure what it is? Maybe it was set in the ‘60s, or did I find the colour a little old and not colourful enough, or the backdrop was just plain and almost empty - I’m not sure.But overall I’m sure I will like it a whole lot better after a while and re-watch it. I’m pretty much sure about that!!! And the kids will absolutely love it.Season to Watch: It’s Pixar!!! Russell is really a lovable character.Reason Not To: Personal Dislike of animated film.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,0,1,21 June 2009
National Treasure," Best Popcorn Movie
","Despite it got a pretty bad promo the movie is famous for a reason  it is one hell of an adventure movie and probably one of the best quest movie around. What I like about the movie is the story line is believable and not overdone.Ben, the treasure hunter is on the quest to find the mystical national treasure that is hidden in the back of the Declaration of Independence.A little problem is that the movie involve a little too much on US history, but apart from that the movie is freaking awesome. The movie got a brilliant story line and dialogue, and the action is really consistence and really entertaining to watch. And the cast is also good  Nic Cage is better than expected. Plus the rest of the casts seem to be really working really well together.This is truly is a great popcorn movie. The action is unlimited and the keep on discover of the new clues is exciting. My final words: Excellent!!! Recommendation: Get Yourself A DVD!!! Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B)",8,1,3,28 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," If You Like Action, You'll Like This.
","This installment got to be the most exciting of the four till now. It got loads of action and intensity; plus the kids are all grown up making it a little more present to watch for the elder.But it is not all that good when it comes to the real main story. The movie consist of only action and hardly any substance. Three major things that connect between movies are - the raise of Lord Voldemort, the feeling Hermione have for Ron and true identity of Lucius Malfoy.Anyway the movie does provide excellent special effect, with loads of scene from air, ground, to underwater fight. Making it consistently trilling to watch. Also in this installment there are also kids from other school which help to add more character to the movie making more present to watch.My final words: This is a much darker version than the first three, also with the most excitement. Making it a must watch, especially if you're looking for different kind of action that you normally seen on TV.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B)",7,0,1,11 April 2006
Thor," Mildly Entertaining; Nothing Wow About It
","Out of so many super hero movies that have been released quite lately I somehow find this to be pretty much the most ordinary of all - Very ordinary. Almost nothing here really entertain me. The flick felt empty without proper villain and without anything that is a major wow factor (scenes) to hold my interest too.I have never really care about character Thor in those Mythology stories since his stories has always seem so complicated to care about when I was a little boy, plus I don't really like his power that much –A Hammers with super strength? I never find it to be a 'cool' superpower.Anyway I don't think those things have that much influence on my thought on the movie. The movie itself does have a solid script and storyline but it still lack many things, as I have mention earlier. There is nothing really to hold on to the movie. Sure they got A. Hopkins, N. Portman, C. Hemsworth and that is a brilliant cast but there are no captivate scene. I almost had forgotten this movie just two week earlier.Otherwise almost all the stuff is great; the actors did pretty decent jobs for their role. The CGI is brilliant and the wardrobe is quite stunning. But the lack of action sequence make this movie seem much slower than it should be. The Destroyer is absolutely stunning, though it only appear for like 3-5 mins.Recommendation: Yes, it is still mildly entertainment. Kids will enjoy it.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)",6,0,2,23 November 2011

Enemy at the Gates," Enemy At The Gates Summary
","Though, this movie is being appreciated by most people, IMHO I found it to be an average war film and nothing much stand out in the movie. It is more like In Love And War (1996) combine with Shot Through The Heart (1999) of HBO After many German officers being gun down by the Russian sniper (whom the Russian consider him as the hero), the German bring their own sniper veteran to kill that one Russian sniper. Don't get me wrong; the movie is good and very enthusiastic. The backdrop is great and Jude Law and the other actors are great. But overall the movie is not able to capture the feeling very well.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Very Entertaining, But The Ending Suck Big Time
","Mr. And Mrs. Smith is the movie full of surprises. Both good and bad. But one thing I'm sure you don't expect was  Humor. It is very funny through out the movie.The movie is surprisingly good, except the ending which is extraordinary bad. It really got more of everything than what I thought. I expect action  and they did delivered loads of really good and new action. It got loads and loads of humor, also the chemistry between the two characters is better than I thought. Only that it now turn to PG-13, so you know what that mean. Yes, no hot steamy sex scene.Overall the movie has really surpassed my expectation, though do expect the abrupt and bad ending.Recommendation: I Got To Say This Is One Of The Best Husband And Wife Fight On Movie .Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It  Thanks",6,4,9,29 July 2005
War of the Worlds," It Is Ain't That Bad
","I really do get the mixed feeling after watching this movie  yet the movie is good, it is not even close to an epic (that it suppose to be), it didn't delivered enough satisfaction, worst of all I feel the movie has really weak story.This is definitely not the script to be working on from the legendary director but Spielberg did managed to direct very well (no bias here), though the angle he shot was very different from other movies (and different is good). Casting is alright, nothing great. (Though I feel other actor might be better choice for Ray). The CGI of aliens and tripods machine was nothing special. What I didn't like about this movie was the high amount of flaw, which can be seen very easily even if you tried to avoid seeing it. Come-on, which dockers has great looking muscle car, leather jacket (that Tom like to wear in real life), Omega watch, and a house with backyard!!! There load more error but don't want to mention it.Overall, Spielberg didn't manage to scare people like he said. The movie is good but I expecting something more (much more) - More fighting (the actual 'war'), more Tripods, more Aliens, more Destruction, more people running and screaming, more of everything. The whole movie seems short with abrupt ending (which people find it to be the most disappointing part of the movie) making it look cheap.

Love Actually," Lovely!!!
","This is one movie that actually delivers everything to every type of viewers no matter that one looking and is probably one of the most romantic movies ever created.The story of the couples lives four weeks before Christmas and how things could change by then.The story did deliver all types of emotion to its viewer including laugh, smile, tears, and so on. The dialogue is brilliantly good English and very charming. The casting is undoubtedly one of the best with brilliant acting. And the editing, lighting and directing is a joy.Recommendation: Buy The DVD and Watch It Again and Again.Note: Rowan Atkinson is a cameo as an angel in case you only see this movie because of him.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A+)",9,0,2,8 February 2005
Wedding Crashers," Ways Above Expectation
","At first i kind of doubt if i should get this movie, i don't really like Vince that much and the poster is really suck and the trailer is not that great. i brought it because it have Owen in it. And the outcome after watching this movie is - it is as awesomely funny movie. Definitely one of the most entertaining and funny movie i have seen this year. Synopsis: Two wedding crasher went to the stranger wedding to get lucky with the bride maid until everything went haywire when Jeremy sleep with a Treasury Secretary's virgin daughther and John falls hard on another daughter Claire.What surprise me is that Owen and Vince really did a great job lifting this movie and make a really brilliant buddy team. They are so funny together. This is one very delightful film with a brilliant story, awesome cast (Isla really look like goddess, and Rachel look great).

","Even though there is so much talk about the movie, it doesn't proof what it is. Certainly I don't really find this movie to be as funny like people said it is but overall it ain't that bad.Set in 1979, A State Champ Roy Munson got his bowling hand chop off by jealous runner up. 17 years pass by Roy a useless salesman came across an Amish man, Ishmale. Who Roy thinks capable of becoming his hand and play for him for a money prize. Ishmale accept the offer in-need of money for the family farm before road trip with Roy to various places to get the hang of it before the big competition.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Return of the Star Wars
","Revenge of the Sith have surpass my expectation and is zillion times better than Episode I & II. (I'm not exaggerating.) I can't deny that the story here are much more solid and refine than I thought, very touching story, yet very powerful in its own ways. The ways and the reason Anakin turn into Darth Vader was beyond imagination.One thing that can't be left unappreciated is the special effects, which have been done brilliantly (even better than LotR: Trilogy). Especially after a horrible CGI in Episode II. I wouldn't be surprise if they won Oscar for Special Effects.Not everything is that great though, the acting might seem out of place sometime. And the score is not very familiar, also most of the things here are much more advance looking than the first trilogy.But overall I say it is overwhelming watching it. It make me want to see more of it. Anyway this is a must watch.Recommendation: Do What Ever You Can To Watch It. Again and Again.Rating: 8.5/10 (Grade: A)",9,1,5,27 May 2005

If you have time to waste then this is not a bad movie to watch.But I have to want all the viewer that some parts might be irritated for youdon't even know what he's taking about.This movie is not even that funny. After all it is just another Adam Sandler movie as we all know very well what kind of movie he act (dumb, stupid,  also acting as a guy who never been educated and 10 million miles away from reality.)

Prometheus," Visually Extravaganza but Ordinary Story brings the whole movie down.
","I think people are too harsh on this movie. All I read was negative review after one another. It was so bad that I decide not to watch this movie. Several months went by I decide to give a try, after all it was Ridley Scott's film. I glad I decide to watch because I really enjoying this movie. Maybe because of the very low expectation but I truly enjoy it.Synopsis: A team of explorer travels the universe in search of the 'Engineer' the creator of human to ask them the meaning and origins of mankind. The journey turn fearful as the answer they seek is about to reveal.I thought it was a great idea to mix sci-fi with mythology and they managed to do that very well. I also like the way it slowly link itself to the Alien movies. The main problem was the lack of character development and the suspense that were there in its predecessor. I suppose that was the thing that people are most disappointed about. Not just only that most characters are so underdeveloped to the point that you don't feel for them whatever what happen to them; but also some of the scene are quite impractical and plain out silly.Now despite all that, even if you don't know if it was Ridley's film you will know that this is not an ordinary film. The art and craft are clearly showed this is not an ordinary direction because the visual, the direction and the production was stunning; and this cannot be don't if you don't have years of experience. Visually the CGI are just breath taking (especially the opening credit) As for the cast I thought they did a very decent job. Fassbender as an android steal the whole show and is by far the best actor. Noomi Rapace also did a pretty good job too. Apart from these two people I hardly see any reason for other character particularly Guy Pearce who appear for like 2 minutes and the other appear here and there briefly.I enjoy the whole film and wish it was a little longer. Yes, the story was not good it wasn't a real mess; it is still watchable and pretty much enjoyable if your expectation was very low.Rating: 7/10",7,2,4,16 November 2012
Carrie," Carrie Scary
","I'm sure you heard a lot about this movie, I did. And after watching for the first time it turn out to be some what B+ Grade type of horror film. Don't get me wrong; the movie is good especially the flow of the movie is amazing and the story (which is very bitter and depressing). And the characters is full of unique characteristic, going with good acting this movie make it very much thrilling and very memorable. For what it worth 30 years later people still talking about it when talk about prom.If you wonder whether one should watch it or not, just ask yourself this - 'How many time have I seen teen horror flick turn into one of the Hollywood classic?'

The Wolverine," This is 'The Wolverine' I Was Waiting For
","The Wolverine totally surprises me (in the good way). From what I saw in the trailer I'm pretty sure this gonna suck but after giving it a try I glad I did went to see it. They truly revive the franchise and now it is so much joy watching it.I love the story. They connect it well with the previous movies without trying too hard. What best was they decide to concentrate on develop a better story and does so by developing each character and overloading it with zillion mutant. It is basically 2 hours of fun and action and despite it is PG13 it is ain't soft.In-fact there is very little characters in the movie. The casting was not bad and the acting was better and well suited than some Hollywood big name that was in previous installment. Hugh is at his top physical form, Tao Okamoto as Mariko is just stunning!! Truly gorgeous!! And despite it is her first movie she did a magnificent job. Other characters are also suited well too.The action sequences and the fighting moves are just awesome. Add to that the change of location to the beautiful scenery of Japan really help the movie from looking very cliché. All in all I love the movie. This is just the Wolverine I was waiting for. Can't wait for the unrated version that they going to release on the DVD - will definitely adding that into my collection. Highly recommended while it is still in the theatre.Rating: 8",8,2,6,13 August 2013
Bruce Almighty," Not as funny as his previous films.
","I was really looking forward to see this movie, for it seem to be very funny in the trailer; but it end up not as funny as expected. Although there are some scenes that are funny, but after all the film are far too slow which make the film quite boring. There is nothing much happening in this film and most of the funny scenes are already in the trailer. And the movie only involve around him and his girlfriend, what I expected is he doing more great things rather than only increase the size of his girlfriend breast. OK movie. At least for time past.Max: 5.5/10",Null,1,2,25 November 2003
Monsters University," Highly recommended
","This is nothing short of Monster Inc.; I love it through and through. Yes, the story is not fresh like the first movie but it is still great with a very good connection between the two. Seriously, this movie is so much fun.I love the story – it is about friendship, competition, getting to know oneself, teamwork and so on; very much suitable for kids, as well as pretty fun for adult too. There are quite a lot of funny scene and a lot of cute characters too. I love the creativity and how they connect the two movies. Plus with so many characters you will enjoy it even more (somehow they managed to give perfect screen time to each character).So that is it. I love it and I highly recommend people see it while it is still on the big screen. It is fun, great animation, cute, good story, and really funny.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,12 August 2013
Casino Royale," You Know My Name - Bond, James Bond
","James Bond finally moves to its root and origin and to do so we take a look back in time at James Bond first assignment - to stop the investor from winning the casino tournament and used that money to fund the terrorist.This time around director Martin Campbell came back to make probably the most accurate of the Ian Fleming version of Bond and making it a bit darker and more gruesome than before making one of the most enjoyable version of Bond.This is the most controversial James Bond ever as they decided to bring in Daniel Craig as the new 007 to replace Pierce Brosnan. People were trashing him like hell as a guy that has no James look and having blonde hair. But despite all that Daniel does have his charm and he seems to blew everyone away with it. To me, he's over qualifies for the job and now that I really see him as Bond he is even more suitable than ever.Despite so much controversy the outcome of the movie is brilliant and everything seem to working out perfectly. The casting is stunning; Eva Green probably is the most beautiful Bond's girl ever. The writing is more evolved and is very satisfying to see Bond movie with thing more than spy flick with gadget and women. He has more feeling, he relies on his instinct, he is arrogant and more heart than ever before, and he can bleed!!! The story is much better even without trademark gadget and good-looking faces. Unlike most of previous movie I'm extremely excited to see some serious actor in each and every character. They make this movie much more believable.If you're looking for some great action sequences then you will be please with the movie. Casino Royale consist of numerous actions from every angle and the best part is the movie doesn't need to rely on CGI, which make the scene even more authentic and fun to watch. The score of the film is fit in the movie really well though the original soundtrack might not seem at first but it is pretty catchy and after hearing it couple of time - I like it.My only problem is that I feel the directing is that great and the editing is too sudden, but otherwise this is definitely the best-written James Bond movie ever. Though I feel with so much change in characteristic in the franchise some of the people who are so into the olden 007 movie might not like it that much.Overall, it is one hell of a movie that will sure entertain you in every way. I can't wait for the DVD to be release.Plus Point: Daniel Craig make debut as Bond, Most realistic Bond.Negative Point: Editing and directing.Recommendation: Worth Every Penny.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,2,5,23 November 2006
Toy Story 3," I Have A Great Time Watching This.
","Toy story 3, in my opinion got to be one of Pixar best since Finding Nemo. Everything about is just marvelous, I enjoy every moment of it especially how they managed to balance the story between being sentimental and humorous.The good thing about Pixar is that they put great consideration into storyline and for me that is the most important thing. The base of great movie is a great story and that what make Pixar always delivered good movie. This also applied to this movie. It has everything that one could hope for – sentimental moments, adventures, humor, and so on.I won't get into much detail because the first two movies have already proved itself how great this franchise has been. This movie will complete the trilogy and I must say the standard doesn't drop one bit, yet – it set it selves even high – meeting all the expectation for the entire fan.Since I watch in normal TV I can't really say how great the 3D version is, but I can say is that the picture and animation look much sharper than before; making it even more appealing to watch. Plus the great music from the previous film also doesn't get old.All in all, I have a great time watching this.Recommendation: Yes, I got the DVD and it all worthwhile.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A)",9,0,0,16 May 2011
Beowulf," Quite Entertaining
","When I go to see the movie I was bored and have no expectation of this movie at all, the trailer didn’t even look that convincing. I needed to see some movie so I went to see it; also it was directed by Robert Zemickis, for me this name is good enough for me to buy the ticket.Synopsis: When a small town was terrorized by a monster, a king ordered his men to trace a warrior that could save his town a greatest reward. That is when our hero came in – Beowulf.I have never read the books before so I will go by the story of what I see in the movie. The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it. I must say that extra money that they charge me for the 3D thing was worth it, the outcome, the animation and everything was breathtaking. It was crystal clear. They even gave the preview the different between 3D and non 3D.I thought the whole story was pretty OK, nothing great or memorable, seem like they put more energy in the making of this movie into 3D than the great storyline. The story is not that well distributed and here and there can be a little bit boring. The character is quite shallow and the dialogue in this movie was way too little. And there is so much gore that seems quite unnecessary.The good outcome was I don’t really get border by the fact that this movie is CGI like I felt as I watch The Polar Express; this one felt more like a normal movie. As I said before this movie seem to only concentrated a lot on making it a lifelike as possible so tried to watch it in a highly enhance Digital Cinema like I did and you will felt quite impressive at the new technology that everything look so clear and real.Overall it was a fun flick, don’t expect that good of the story but tried to look at that awesomely done CGI.Recommendation: Should At least Watch It Once.Reason to Watch: The Future of Film Making!!!! Reason Not To: Story is very shallow, and if not for CGI this movie is just average Mythology movie.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+).Please Rate Y/N After Read.",7,1,2,1 December 2007

","I haven’t seen any of the Die Hard movies for the past decade so I don’t quite remember anything but what I remember is watching this movie Die Hard 4.0 and it was very entertaining and I had fun watching it.Synopsis: As usual this movie will always involve terrorist. This time they are back for more as they planed to destroy and shutting down the whole security network of the USA.Well like most people, I didn’t plan to see it at first, my reason to see was I was force by my cousin. At first I thought it was going to be like those movie created to make money. But I was wrong; this is pretty damn good action movie, perfect for what it is! Die Hard! Bruce Willis has still got it in him as the detective John McClane, he is still great but his age is taking its toll as time to time he is not as hip and arrogant as he used to be. Surprisingly the casting of Justin Long was more than anyone has bargain for, he was awesome, play along very well with John, plus he added more youthfulness into the movie and some comedic situation. Plus this movie have Maggie Q and Mary Winstead, they both hot! Timothy Olyphant did a pretty alright job as a bad guy.As for story it was as any body expected, full of action!!! From the first minutes to the very last second, (though, not very realistic it was really fun to watch). I am happy with it; the only problem is the movie unlike the previous one they used some CGI to enhance the effect. And that CGI is horrible (talking about bridge scene), it does added more action but it didn’t quite work.Overall it did deliver what it supposes to delivered, a great fun ride of thrill and action. It worth every penny and it was it will leave you wanting to see more of John McClane.Recommendation: Must See In Theatre.Reason To Watch: Action and more action, John McClane and Matt Farrell.Reason Not To: Action Scenes Is Too Unbelievable Sometime.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B).Rate (Y/N) After Read.",7,0,1,13 July 2007

","Finally the best action film of this year has come out. I went to the theater 3 times to watch this great sequel of X-Men 2. Some how the movie is even better than the first X-Men movie and yeah that right, even better than the original. They are now even trying to introduce new character into the movie like Pyro, Nightcrawler, Kitty, Ice Man, and the best of all Colossus, man, I wish he could have more part. I really liked when he turned into iron. How could one resist this movie, go ahead and watch it and own it. The action is great and it's the movie that X-Men fan and Cartoon Nerd should not be missed. One bad thing is the last part when they confront the President, that too cheesy.

Flight," Trust no trailer, this is a good serious drama on alcoholism
","There are so many reasons why I wanted to watch this movie – first it is directed by R. Zemeckis, second it is starring Denzel Washington and third the trailer look pretty cool. And as usual R. Zemeckis's live action film never a disappointment though it might not be for everyone since the trailer is misleading and you end up expecting something else.Flight is about an alcoholic pilot who saves hundreds of live when his plane went malfunctioned. Though dubbed as 'hero' he is being after by the National Transportation Safety Board as they suspected him of his intoxication that led to plane clash.This is a drama of a man abused by alcoholism and how it affected his life. Not a thriller of CIA chasing around people trying cover-up plane clash. The story itself is pretty much slow but very well written (though a bit overlong). But it was actually Denzel performance that truly brings out the best of this movie and so is the rest of the cast. It is good to see a good old fashion movie rely on great acting, good script and great direction. It is really that good.Overall it was a good movie, very well done. But sadly it is not really the kind of movie you going to re-watch it again and again. A good film that you hardly watch it again like Sleeper / Seven years in Tibet/ Gandhi/ Master and Commander/ The way back etc. (I hope you understand what I meant)Recommendation: Worth a tryRating: 7/10",7,2,3,16 June 2013
The Truman Show," The Different
","This is probably one of the best script and movie I have ever read and seen. The idea is so different from other movies that I have ever seen.The casting is perfect, with Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank the guy whom the world is watching throughout his life, the guy who live among actors who pretended to be his mom, dad, wife, best friend etc. After a long years he started to notices something wrong; and this is the story of his great escape to REAL world. Andrew Niccol (New Zealnder writer) have done a great job. This is gonna be the best black comedy movie anyone have ever seen I highly recommended that everyone should watch this movie . I gave it 9/10 for this movie.O.K to prove that this is one of the best movie read this...'One of the most spectacularly original American movies in years'<ul><li>David Thomson, Esquire.</li></ul>'A gemlike picture crafted with rare and immaculate precision.'-Todd McCarthy, Variety'A satire of Orwellian proportions,cleverly conceived, masterfully executed.......with a knowing script by Andrew Niccol that evokes the caustic wit of Paddy Chayesfky.' - Michael Rechtshaffen, Hollywood Reporter",10,0,1,16 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Finally, I Got A Chance To See It.
","Finally, after 33 years of it first release I finally got the chance to watch this movie I'm dying to see for quite some time but somehow never really get the chance to see it. I wanted to see why so many people claimed it to be the most revolutionize and the most inspiring sci-fi movie of all time; and also I really wanted to see what happen after Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.If you were like me then you most likely wasn't born yet when this first release. But like me you will get a chance to watch all Episode I, II, III and Clone Wars. Which will intern will make you know what to expect and not very surprise like most people who did watch it in the '70s and '80s – there will be no surprise as, who is Obe-Wan and the Force that he brag about, you will already know that Luke is Darth Vader's son, and so on.In this fourth episode I got a chance to finally see Luke as a young man with a mission to save Princess Leia from the evil clutch of The Empire. The story was simple and not as complicated as it does with all political stuff in Episode II and III, I enjoy it. The only problem for me was the course of the movie seem to run too fast at time that I don't really get a chance to see or feel for some certain character, specially Obe-Wan/Uncle Owen/ and Aunt Beru.Otherwise everything else seems to be perfect (I tried to imagine it as if I was watching it in the '70s): the CGI – what can I say about it, it is even better than some movies that were made these day (or was there a digitally re-master CGI, that why it look so good). I also enjoy the casting, they work well and blend in together and give some what a much more believe able than what I saw on Episode I, II and III. I love Han Solo cynical character. I will not go into anything else it has been said I think zillion times. It was an awesome film; it is still an awesome film. Definitely a must watch.Recommendation: Got myself a DVD and it worth it.Reason to Watch: People claim it to be one of the most influential Sci-Fi of all time.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,0,0,26 December 2010
Fantastic Four," Despite The Story Is Shallow, It Is Still Watch Able.
","Out of the whole lots of Super Heroes Movie, this is by far the most cartoonish with actual cartoon like storyline. But it turn out not to be so bad.This movie doesn't have the actual story or villain or anything. Just an introduction to how they become Fantastic 4 and slowly discovered their ability and how to make the society accept them. That about it, really. The story is extremely shallow also the characters. And it even seems like rip-off from many places.Anyway I personally think people go to see this movie because of beautiful Jessica Alba (she looks so DAMN Hot!!!!), and maybe Christ Evan, who help to add some charisma and humor to the movie. And the other two was more of a miscast. Personally, I think they are too old and if they're not old they still look like one.This movie is definitely out of other super heroes movie league. But still this movie is very much watched able, if you don't expect anything at all. And there are chances you might enjoy it.Recommendation: The Hottest Invisible Girl Is My Reason To Watch.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It  Thanks",6,2,5,28 July 2005
Click," Totally Unexpected.
","This movie totally caught me off guard. Like everybody else I also was fool by its trailer thinking this might me another of Adam Sandler fun comical comedy that he is famous for. But this is a serious movie like his previous Spanlish and I must say he did a pretty good job in both of them.Synopsis: A mysterious scientist gave a workaholic architect a chance of a lifetime. A universal remote, that allowed him to fast-forward and rewind to any part of his life. A big problem come when it start to take control over his life choices.What I really like about this movie is total unexpected story, though quite predictable but the sad story was totally surprising. This film is quite meaningful but almost every movie of his do have hidden message like Water Boy - to stand and believe in one self, Billy Madison - to grow up and take responsible. So it is not surprise that this movie also has one - don't take family for granted. Nice.The cast of this movie quite awesome especially David Hasselhoff and his ultra ego womanizer is funny. One thing I don't really buy that much was Kate Beckinsale as an Adam Sandler wife, lol. And though in real life she is a mother I don't really feel mother wives from her on screen. And Christopher was great as creepy looking scientist.This movie has been Oscar nominated for best make up for fat suit that Adams Sandler wear and it is one of the best fat suit I have ever seen, specially that movement of his fat and stomach.This movie consists of many time changes that I find it quite surprisingly interesting. I did quite expect to see the 80s' but not the long future ahead. The change of the set and location make the make more exciting. Though as the film gone by everything seem so abrupt but consider the pace it was all right. If you gone for 2 min bathroom break you'll be missing quite a lot.I feel they should added more humor and I feel the movie was a bit too long but overall it is a very satisfying experience and worth every penny.Recommendation: Do Expected Sad Movie. Worth Rental If You Don't Like Sad Movie; If You Like Then Worth DVD.Reason To Watch: Nice Overall Movie. David and Adam Were Great. Kate Looks Really Gorgeous.Reason Not To: Really Sad Story.Rating: 7.5 (Grade: B-).Please Rate Y/N after Read.",7,1,3,25 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Love It!!
","Since this movie has been out like forever and there are over zillion of review on this I will keep my review to the minimum I could and try to review it as the person that watch this movie in the 21st century.I don't know if this happen to you but it always happen to me; whenever I watch a trilogy I always get that feeling the second movie (the middle) is just the movie they have created to make the movie longer and cash in some extra money from its viewer and I also find most of the sequel do not live up the first and the last. Luckily this is not the case with The Empire Strikes Back, I enjoy it even more so any other episode of Star Wars. There is so much transition between the first and this, and I mean the good one. I don't feel like I'm just watching another stepping stone kind of movie so that I could understand the third.The Empire Strikes Back has solved the entire problem that was there on the Episode IV, the best part was the storyline which has just the right pace of action and drama. We get the chance to know the character much better when compare to the first which everything seem to be in rush. You will get the chance to know many new characters specially the person that taught Obi Wan – Yoda. The bad part was, it is not really a surprise anymore since I watch it in the 21st century – I already know who Luke's father was, who is Yoda, who is Princess Leia and so on, but come to think of it, it must have been exciting and really surprise to know 'Luke I'm your father' one of the famous catch phrase.Anyway I wanted to let people to know that this is an awesome flick, and definitely a must watch. Man, this is 30 years old and still – it is a classic, never get old. The graphic is even better than some of the movie you can find today. Glad George Lucas has gut to let other people carry on his work when he knows he is not good enough to do it on his own.Recommendation: Definitely Worth Every Penny for Its Blue Rays.Reason to Watch: One of the Most Entertaining Sci-Fi of All Time.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A)",9,0,1,6 January 2011
Sin City," Better Than I Thought
","Since so many people talk so much about it, I decide to watch it for myself. And hell, this got to be one of the most entertaining and original comic adaptations I ever see. It was awesomely thrilling to watch.Brief: Sin City base on three different story intertwine in someway or other in the corrupted city of Basin. We followed the lives of Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan as they fought they way in the hellhole.Though it is in almost black and white, I enjoy myself watching this movie. It is brilliantly done and very much kept the sense of the comic intact. The good thing is the movie seems to accomplish what it trying to get - Loads and loads of violence, and people seem to be enjoying themselves watching it.Recommendation: The Movie Is Awesomely Done, And Definitely Worth Your Money Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B)",8,0,2,19 February 2006
The Social Network," 'Almost' There, But Not Yet.
","I had a great pleasure of watching this movie; almost everything about it was great. It has got a brilliant script and dialogue, spectacular director, well acted group of young actors and though I can't really find the flaw in the movie there was something missing which kept this movie from being a classic.Synopsis: Base on the true story of the man who created Facebook.com (the world largest social networking website).I love the story and how everything has been arrange out in the great sequences. What really amazing was they managed to make movie with all talk so much fun from the beginning to the end. There is no dull moment in The Social Network. The movie is well pace and the script is absolutely brilliant. I love the story but I also think it is the thing that kept it from being a classic – the subject of the story is somehow to me not very 'deep' (hard to say but I think that is the word I was looking for). Despite all the greatness the screenplay it's seem to lack depth and most character was all in the surface. I wish I could feel more. And also the fact that it was technology base movie, it will get dated sometime in the near future.Love the casting of this movie – they all happen to look much smarter than their counterpart here than in real life. Anyway the actors play their part well and it fitted the movie perfectly, love the character The Winklevoss twin and Eduardo. You got to give credit to Mr. Fincher for casting Mr. Timberlake and turn him into an OK actor here. Now, that was a lot of work.Who can question the ability of Mr. Fincher and his technique of movie making? This man seems to know what he is doing. Anyway what really standout in this movie is the editing and how they unfold and mix present with past in the movie really well without getting distracted. The score also fit the sequences well.Final Words: I enjoy watching is movie through and through. Love the pace, the fact that they concentrated on friendship part rather than on the legal term. And I will definitely adding this to my DVD collection.Recommendation: Not for everyone – but if you do enjoy well written fast pace drama, this might be for you.Reason to Watch: Get the chance to see the life of the world youngest millionaire.Reason Not to: Not Fincher best work.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,1,2,28 February 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," The Name Say It All
","Oh man, I say The Bourne Supremacy is much more thrilling than the first one. The first one was like an introduction of Bourne and now since we know the character, it is left with solid story and thrilled feeling after watching.The story follows after the first installation; Bourne fight back after being framed by the Russian mob and now the CIA is after him.What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.This is brilliant movie, somewhat surpass my expectation. I thought it is like a B grade but this is definitely an A.Recommended.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8,76,118,10 March 2005
Beetlejuice," It Was Good, But Not Enough Satisfaction.
","I like most of Tim Burton movies or what ever he does, but this movie is more or less 'nothing'. There is nothing to look forward to. It should have been better especially with a pretty good concept story.The movie base on life after dead, when two ghosts is trying to scare the new owner of the house but they were too weird and wouldn't even scared, so they tried to bring Beetle Juice to help them do so.It was a pretty good plot but somewhere along the ways I didn't quite keep my interest with it. It was good and very much original Tim Burton style just by looking at the animation.Overall this is worth another shot, because I don't like it in first watch.Recommendation: It Was Good, But Not Enough Satisfaction.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)",6,6,11,13 February 2005
The Simpsons Movie," What Ever The Outcome, You Will Still Watch It, Afterall It is The Simpsons.
","To me people are trying real hard to like this movie and their beloved character Homer, and so they rated this movie with a handsome review. But for me it was merely a decent movie experience – after 150 plus draft they have chosen this one to work on, seriously? That was really weak.Is this movie written by The Simpsons’ writers or Al Gore? This is not really the story you would expected from the good episode of The Simpsons. There wasn’t much plot at all. It felt weird and though I love the randomness but the pace is fast but it feel really brief and it keep on skipping. Sure it was entertaining but it was not funny ha-ha.The good thing is visually it look very stunning, I love it. It looks absolutely joyful and colorful, and the direction is great. But I didn’t quite find the story very compelling. Homer is too hypocrite in here.Tell the truth I had a pretty hard time writing this - it is The Simpsons; what is at you there in series that you haven’t seen it yet? This is like a longer episode of it. They even managed to put all the character even for a few seconds.Ask if it still entertaining, yes it is!! Not a fully let down. Maybe my expectations are too high on it.Recommendation: Managed enough for me to still buy its DVD.Reason to Watch: What More? It is The Simpsons.Reason Not To: Not a very good Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6,3,4,25 May 2008
Dodgeball," Ben Stiller Prove He Is Really Funny
","If you a fan of Ben Stiller then you probably know what to expect from this movie, and if you're not you better go and watch all of his previous works. Cause like all his movie  It Is Funny!!! Synopsis: After being bully to sell the Average Joe gym by the big co-operation, the group of men tries to raise money to save their sanctuary by entering the competition of Dodge ball.Yea, I know there is absolutely nothing new there in the storyline but the way it was portraying is funny and entertaining. Particularly the character of Ben; which is really funny especially the way he talk, and with all ego stuff going on. It is probably the best thing you not look for the good story here but to enjoy the funny man and his egomaniac team member with a funny dance. The movie also consist some of the meanest and funniest dialogue ever.Final Words: Rent The DVD If You Haven't Seen It, Great Afternoon Movie.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-) Thanks For Reading, Please Rate: (Yes/No)",7,1,2,2 September 2006
Atonement," Truly Moving Picture
","I have an absolute no idea when I go in to watch this movie, all I know it that it got nominated for Oscar and BAFTA, so that the reason I went in for. And by the end of the movie I was blown away, this is a truly beautiful and moving picture.Synopsis: Briony, 13 years old girls fell in love with her elder sister boyfriend couldn’t stand them together so decide to accuse him of raping her cousin. This incident changes the lives of everyone forever.I really love the story here, it was wonderful. Though quite slow here and there I don’t really get bored by it. I think the pace was just right. Only problem was that I don’t see much of Robbie and Cecilia romance. I wish there were more of them.Well as for the acting wise, the casting of James McAvoy is the best thing in this movie, he is utterly awesome, Keira Knightley only adds stardom to the movie but didn’t hold a candle compare to James. Saoirse Ronan also did a pretty good job, so do the rest of the cast actually, its all balance.As for direction, damn this guy is getting better and better. This is his second main stream movie and it still came out this good, damn he is good. Maybe he will be the next Sam Mendes. I also really like the part where the director tried to show us different angle from each characters so that we can understand their vision more. The movie also consists of brilliant score, and cinematography and lighting.Overall, I enjoy the movie from it’s begin to the very end. Oh I love the ending. I love almost everything in this movie maybe just a few bit of scenes that are quite unattached, but overall it was brilliant.Recommendation: Yes, Buy The DVD!!! Reason to Watch: Almost Everything About It.Reason Not To: Hard To Understand English Accent??.Rating: 8.5/10 (Grade: A-).Please Rate Y/N After Read.",8,3,4,6 March 2008
The Island," ''The Island' Is What Gives Them Hope'
","I have every movies of Michael Bay, and I got to say  this is probably his best. Though the story is nothing new and it has a lots (loads) of resemblances of his previous work; I really enjoy watching it. But it actually the actors (Ewan and Scarlett) who made this movie so interesting.Without this two actors I don't think I could enjoy it this much. They are perfect with each other (though they're like 10 yrs apart). The story is very believable and it also got great flows; though many parts are just too brief and too many actions scene. I have to warn you  the movie has a lots of gruesome scenes.Anyway, I like the movie. And I highly recommended for you to watch. Don't trust the US Box Office. As far as I concern it have done really well around the world. This might not be the best sci-fi movie, but it surely keep the audience ask for more pop-corn.Recommendation: Michael Have Done It Right This Time.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It  Thanks",7,265,450,3 August 2005
