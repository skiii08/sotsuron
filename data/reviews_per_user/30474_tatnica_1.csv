Sucker Punch," I don't get it...
","I do not get why this movie got a really bad review from the expert critics. I swear to God, what I saw in this movie is something inspiring and just defined what being human truly is. This whole movie is a jumble of metaphors. To me, if you approached it emotionally (leaving the fact that it's 'girls holding guns' and killing robot zombies and dragons), you can pinpoint the beautiful setting it showcases. Sure, the plot flawed to an extent, but maybe that portrays something; it is not perfect because that's what reality is, what life is. Most movies today can not portray imperfection as stunning, memorable, and all-time godly... but this one for sure has a lot of intricate ideas and communication that inflicts a sense of epiphany deep down our dignity: a struggle to win can be obtained, but it's never absolute... and when you've reached a point where you have to choose between two lives, a sacrifice is yet to conquer.I don't know if that whole made sense, but anyways, what I don't also get are 1.) Character progression. 2.) Unoriginal? 3.) Soulless and doesn't make sense.Spoiler: Clearly, every character in this movie progressed.a. Baby Doll lost everyone she cares about (i.e. mother and sister), and at the beginning she was gloomy and her facial expressionless. But she transformed into an angel, as described in the beginning of the movie. She fought for her freedom, but realize in the end that saving someone is better than her selfless longing.b. Sweet Pea, who at first reluctant about joining the crew, reveals that her love for Rocket is greater than being killed and decides to band together.c. Rocket longs freedom the most out of the five but has to give it up to take a knife for the person she cares ultimately.d. Amber, from an amiable, nice but sort of a coward girl, turns into a daredevil and collects two items needed for escape, fire and knife.e. Blondie, supposed to be smart, snitches that ends up with tragedy.f. Dr. Dorski becomes an individual from a puppet that started when she called the police on Blue.Unoriginal? This is not Inception. It's not a fantasy within a fantasy... This is is just a mere imagination. It's a escape from reality because it's dark and full of malice. The girls are not really experiencing it, it's just a conceit that helps them achieve what need be done. In Baby Doll's head, life happens as it's supposed to. Her 'fantasies' means this: when you feel that all hope is gone and that the whole world seems to bring you down, don't fret because you still have a mind, 'you have all the weapons you need, now use it and fight to survive.' You can control your mind... and Baby Doll used it.This movie is far from soulless. At the beginning, the narrator talks about an angel who will help you one day although you don't know what form it's going to take. We are fooled to think that an angel will help Baby Doll to gain freedom, but she is in fact the angel said in the very beginning. She surrendered escape for Sweet Pea to have a chance of flight. Sacrifice may be clich√©d, but it was heartfelt. And the bus driver in the end showed what human-beings can and should be.",Null,4,6,27 July 2011
