Casablanca," Casablanca-Greatest film of all time?
","There has been much written about Casablanca since it was released in 1942 and most of it is about the excellence of this classic film. You can't help but love this picture! You become mesmerized by the actors and the scenes they play. The story is interesting and the film in my opinion is flawless. After watching this picture your faith in humanity is once again restored. These people are the real superheroes, not the cartoon characters worshiped in today's films. 
Rick Blaine and Victor Lazlo where no Redford or Newman when it came to looks, but damn if they weren't sexier! Who knew after watching Bogie in so many 30's gangster flicks that he would be the epitome of love and romance in the 40's. And how can you not help but love and feel empathy for Ingrid Bergman as we watch her struggle with the love she feels for Rick and the pride and loyalty she feels for Victor? As always, Claude Rains, Perez Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, Leonid Kinskey and the remaining supporting cast are remarkable. 
If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor, grab a box of Kleenex, round up the usual suspects and watch this film. You won't be sorry.
