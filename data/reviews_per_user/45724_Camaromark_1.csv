The Longest Yard," Good movie, but too much like another???
","I have not yet viewed the original 'The longest Yard' but watched the new one just yesterday. I was overall pleased with the movie but one thing got to me. It was almost entirely the same as a movie that i saw a couple of years ago called 'Mean Machine' Now I'm not sure if anyone saw this movie but it was almost the exact same events happening on the movie as what happened in the longest yard! now what I'm not sure is, is if this movie ripped off mean machine, but...did mean machine rip off the original longest yard?? I'm not to sure. maybe somebody could shed some light on this one for me who saw the original.Peace Mark",Null,1,3,19 June 2005
