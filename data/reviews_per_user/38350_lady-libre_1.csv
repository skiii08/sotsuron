The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Loved, loved, loved this movie!
","Starting at the beginning, the movie omits that Edward sent Jacob a personal note along with the wedding invitation. That detail would have made the invite less like a slap in the face, I think. Maybe.Beautiful wedding, from Bella's stunning dress to the toasts, which were unexpected but hilarious, Charlie's especially! I think RobPat/KStew's awkwardness at times was a brilliant choice the actors made because of the wedding's subtext: Edward loves Bella but wants her to stay human. Bella loves Edward/wants to be a vamp but fears she'll never see her family again and hates hurting Jacob. The honeymoon ... my favorite part was Bella in the mirror the next morning, remembering their night. That was exquisite and sweet, and far more telling than how much furniture they destroyed. When Edward first appeared in the bedroom across from Bella, the way he looked at her was so tender. Then they met at the foot of the bed, realizing what was supposed to come next, and their nerves popped up, LOL. So realistic! From Jacob's POV, I wish the beach scene had more explicitly explained imprinting, especially on little children. I liked how Condon handled the imprinting scene – watching Renesmee grow up through Jacob's eyes – but the voice-over/imagery wasn't strong enough to overcome the incorrect notion (held by some people) that we just watched a teenage boy fall in love with a baby. Either that or showing Jacob's feeble attempts to imprint on random girls he met (when he drove away in the book after Edward betrayed him) might have been helpful.Jacob's emotions were quite simplified in the movie. When Edward and Bella reconcile about the baby, Jacob felt Edward betrayed him because he never believed Edward would support Bella's decision to keep the baby. But in the movie, Carlisle calls Jacob downstairs before he reacts. I don't know why Jacob's feelings were so minimized, but his angst would have added a needed layer of conflict. Edward's role after Bella gets home was also reduced, and I wanted more of his anguish, beyond facial expressions and posturing. That would have explained part of Jacob's softening, perhaps.More interaction between Bella & Rose and Jacob & Rose would have been great; those scenes in the book were hilarious. Edward's 'talk' with Jacob was also sanitized, perhaps in keeping with Jacob's overall simplification. Rose helping Bella bathe was a telling little scene about their relationship, and Rose closing the bathroom door in Edward's face also spoke volumes. Leah, Leah, Leah ... she and Jacob uniquely understand each other's pain. '... just to break the connection,' great line. Seth was adorable.KStew was amazing from start to finish, but especially after the honeymoon. I read BD twice, but I started wondering if she were really dead! She didn't blink, flinch, or move on that table, Wow. Edward's desperation and heartache were palpable while she was lying on that table. I missed the other Cullens as they were relegated to the background based on the story. I liked watching how happy Esme and Carlisle were during the wedding. More Alice and Emmett are always welcome, and I cannot wait for him in part two.The birth scene was graphic, hard-to-watch, and dead on with the gore in the novel. Bella's transformation was handled perfectly. Even though I saw the end coming – Bella opening her eyes to end the movie – I was still shocked and excited. She was stunning!Aro was a wicked delight as always. Flaws and all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and could watch it a third time. If you loved the books or the other movies, you will also love this. Great job, Bill - Bring on part two!!!",Null,2,8,20 November 2011
