3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma is 2 hours wasted
",3:10 to Yuma is not an enjoyable film. Script writer didn't do his job properly. The movie wants us to leave our brain outside and just watch Russel Crowe without asking any question. To many improbable scenes. The plot is fine. A criminal is escorted to justice. But the way this is done is just something that that not happen in real life. The film is unrealistic. It should not have been made. It gives bad name to westerns. The only good thing about 3:10 to Yuma is the deputy leader of the bad guys. He steals the show. He is actually the man of the match. The film is too long and boring. Photography is bad. Last one hour is simply rubbish. You wont remember it 3 days later.,2,8,13,17 July 2010
