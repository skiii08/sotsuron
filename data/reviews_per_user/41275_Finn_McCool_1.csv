Minority Report," Not so dark, please...
","I just finished to watch Spielberg's Minority Report.It wasn't bad, I was being entertained for a while. But I almost vomited when I saw the politically-correct, all-is-properly-restored, life-is-beautiful ending.Tom reunites with his wife, and she is pregnant again! The bad guy is exposed and destroyed in front of the high society (the one that has the power, that is), and mentally abused, all-time suffering pre-cogs suddenly are cured, and romantically dwell in a cozy cottage, reading books by the fire, while a warm light shines through the window...Steven, if you chose to make a film in the dark spirit of Philip K. Dick, have the courage to end it in the same vein. Or is Hollywood afraid that viewers might question the system outside the theater if the movie doesn't end in perfect equilibrium? Will you ask in your testament that someone please change digitally the guns for walkie-talkies in 30 years?Be consistent, Steven. You have the money, you have the power, and the reputation. Do you have the guts?",Null,0,0,16 December 2002
