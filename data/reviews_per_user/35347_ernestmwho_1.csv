War Dogs," Excellent Movie in general, totally worth the money
","I am actually kinda impressed by this movie brilliant storyline, great scripts and i love the video editing, too. From some shots i even felt like i am watching an action movie which apparently its not one of those The chemistry between the two actor awesome Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are really a good combination for audience , They work really well and i enjoy them a lot throughout the movie. Seriously Frozen is the only film that i can think of which has better quality than this movie. This movie also carries a very important message of everyone who bought a ticket to enter the theater and watch this film: Don't trust movie review:>",10,4,10,5 September 2016
