Vertigo," A very apt pupil
","Perhaps the best word to describe Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' is 'bizarre'. The film even gives this impression with the twisting imagery and hypnotic music of its title sequence. Next, John Ferguson is introduced as a detective that retires due to his inexorable fear of heights. An old friend of John's contacts him and asks him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, which he explains is a result of supernatural forces. John is skeptical and reluctant, but quickly takes the case and begins to observe a bizarre chain of events.James Stewart plays the role John Ferguson and is effective at portraying the transition from impartial investigator to an increasingly involved and even unnerving one. Kim Novak is also excellent as the enigmatic and sporadic Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is also memorable as Midge, particularly in the 'painting' scene.Most of the story doesn't rely on direct plot twists, but rather a methodical investigation of the mystery presented near the film's beginning and the interesting and peculiar behavior of the subject under investigation. The film is well-made such that it doesn't tip its hand early as to the solution to the mystery, but when the film's major twist does come it is brilliant. This methodical approach is effective, although personally I preferred other Hitchcock films that featured more twists over this one. The film's bizarre quality is developed with the help of eerie music and unorthodox effects sequences, including an interesting effect to represent John's fear of heights.",9,7,9,1 November 2007
Love and Death," 'The war? Dress warmly and have a nice time.'
","'Love and Death' is Woody Allen's film that parodies epic Russian novels set in the time of the Tsars. Specifically, this film is set prior to and during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. The sweeping cinematography and score are well-done and consistent with the epics that this film seeks to parody.Woody Allen is clever as usual as Boris Grushenko, a man not at all swept up in the fervor of defending Russia and quite ready to not fight at all. Diane Keaton is again the perfect complement for Allen as Sonja, a woman of infinite amusing facial expressions that Boris wishes to marry.The film has a lot of clever dialogue and amusing send-ups of the long-winded narrative style of epic Russian novels. The humor of this film touches on such topics as pacifism, warfare and mock highbrow philosophical debates. Battle scenes in the film are shot with the finesse of more serious war films of the 1970s, but are cast in a comical fashion. There is also Allen's final monologue, which is utterly hilarious, particularly his comment about God. 'Love and Death' isn't as funny as some of Woody Allen's other efforts, but it is worth seeing are highly amusing none the less.",10,2,2,23 October 2007
Spartacus," Inconsistently paced epic
","'Spartacus' has many scenes of note, but it unevenly paced. The first segment of the film shows Sparatcus' life as a slave. This part is engaging as we see the animosities that develop between Spartacus and the slave-masters and the camaraderie that develops between the slaves. The second part of the film, showing the aftermath of slave revolt, starts with a number of tedious scenes as the slaves slowly formulate their plans. Occasionally Herbert Lom's character breaks up the tedium in the slave camp with his dealings with Spartacus, but usually seeing the politics and machinations on the Roman side was more interesting. All of this culminates in a well-paced and well-shot final conflict followed by a strong ending.Kirk Douglas is solid as Spartacus, who turns from difficult slave to revolt leader with conviction. Jean Simmons is also excellent and strong as the female lead, Varinia. Peter Ustinov is notable as the somewhat timid yet resourceful slave trader. Charles Laughton is perfect as the devious Gracchus and Laurence Olivier gives an intricate and compelling performance as Crassus.'Spartacus' has a number of memorable scenes as performances, but is inconsistently paced and contains a number of tedious scenes.",7,2,5,21 August 2007
To Be or Not to Be," 'So they call me 'Concentration Camp' Ehrhardt?'
","'To Be or Not to Be' is about a troupe of Polish actors who become entangled in a plot involving a Nazi spy during the German occupation of Poland. The film's title is a reference to the fact that the troupe frequently performs 'Hamlet'.The egocentric ham actor and leader of the troupe, Joseph Tura, is played by that great, great comedic actor, Jack Benny. Benny plays is oft-played role of a man who overrates his own abilities with relish. Carole Lombard is also excellent as Joseph's smooth wife Maria and the rest of the cast is solid.This film features sharp humor that parodies the Nazis and criticizes them. The film is funny all-around, but especially so during the second half. My favorite scene is the one where Joseph Tura is told improvise in order to keep a professor working for the Nazis in his office, but he can't improvise effectively despite being an actor. The way Benny botches the improvisation by repeating the 'Concentration Camp' Ehrhardt line and following it with strained laughter is perfect. 'To Be or Not to Be' is another excellent comedy film from director Ernst Lubitsch.",9,0,1,24 November 2007
12 Angry Men," Reasonable doubt
","'12 Angry Men' is about a jury of 12 men voting on a death sentence case. Eleven of the men see it as an open and shut case with a clear verdict of guilty. However, one of the men thinks there is reasonable doubt.The majority of the film takes place in the deliberation room with the 12 men discussing the case. Even though the film takes place mostly in this single room and is singularly focused on the 12 men discussing the case, the film is never tedious. On the contrary, while a lot of films have slower moments, this one is gripping from start to finish.Each of the 12 performances is strong and each of the 12 jurors' characters is well-developed and adds to the film. Henry Fonda is inspiring as the one man who believes there is cause for reasonable doubt. '12 Angry Men' is a triumph of minimalist filming and highly recommended.",10,1,2,14 August 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Great C.S. Lewis adaptation
","'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is the long-awaited modern adaptation of C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel. Rumors of the film floated around for awhile, and no doubt the success of the 'Lord of the Rings' movies encouraged this film's production. The BBC produced three Narnia films in the late 1980s and 1990 that captured the stories nicely, but were lacking in quality special effects. This adaptation captures the story nicely and has the special effects to match. With modern CGI effects the filmmakers are able to render the creatures of Narnia to be more believable than the people in suits of the BBC movies. The film captures the land of Narnia beautifully and has a great score to complement the scenery.The casting choices for the film were appropriate. All of the child actors were believable, and so were the actors and actresses that played or voiced the creatures of Narnia. Liam Neeson is an apt choice to voice Aslan and brings the needed authority to the character. Tilda Swinton was also an excellent choice as the White Witch and is appropriately menacing in the role. I enjoyed Jim Broadbent's performance in his minor role as Professor Kirke.The film is faithful to Lewis' novel and develops the material well. The film's battle scenes were well-staged and paced. The story developed here is not an epic of the same scale of the 'Lord of the Rings' films, but is an exceptional fantasy story none the less. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' nicely captures C.S. Lewis' novel and I await the next film in the chronicles, 'Prince Caspian', with great anticipation.",10,2,3,17 September 2007
The Great Dictator," The Great Chaplin
","'The Great Dictator' is Charlie Chaplin's film set in the fictional country of Tomania, which is analogous to Germany prior to and during the rise of the Nazi party. Chaplin successfully blended humor with anti-fascist social commentary to produce a great film.Chaplin himself has a double role in the film. First, he is Adenoid Hynkel, who represents Adolf Hitler. Chaplin manages to make his representation of the nefarious dictator highly amusing. He also plays another role as a Jewish barber subjected to the repressive policies of Hynkel. The other performances in the film were excellent as well, and Jack Oakie deserves particular note as the showy and blunt Benzini Napaloni, representing Benito Mussolini.The film starts by showing Tomania in World War I, and there are some amusing scenes here before the end of the war and the rise of Hynkel. Hynkel is shown in a scene that mocks the platform speeches of Hitler. Admittedly I didn't find the speech shouted in mock German particularly amusing, although it was amusing how the Goebbels and Goering equivalents were named 'Garbitsch' and 'Herring'.After the platform speech, this film gains a lot of momentum. There is a variety of humor, including funny physical comedy scenes like the 'globe' scene and the portrayal of Hynkel's routine. There was a lot of great comedic dialogue too, some of which is darkly humorous given the full historical context. When this film isn't funny, it remains interesting with its anti-fascist message through depictions of repressions of Jewish people by Storm Troopers. The film's score is appropriate in both the comedic and political scenes. Chaplin's final plea against fascism at the film's end remains deeply moving and has lost none of its potency. The Great Dictator' remains strong as a comedy film and a political message.",10,1,3,13 October 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Story adrift
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' has notable performances, particularly from Chow Yun-Fat, Geoffrey Rush and of most notably Johnny Depp, back as the infamous Jack Sparrow. The film has excellent special effects, a great score, great moments of humor and memorable scenes and dialogue. The film has a number of notable battle sequences. The ending is interesting and satisfying given the direction the film took.However, this 'At World's End' has the same problem as 'Dead Man's Chest'; it has a long and dragging plot line that is contrary to the focused and engaging first film. The story of this film was more engaging than that of 'Dead Man's Chest', but it is still a far cry from the quality of 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. It is safe to say that if you found 'Dead Man's Chest' disappointing, you will also be disappointed by 'At World's End' because it similarly deviates from the style of 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'.",5,1,4,6 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," The greatest battle is for story development
","'Spider-Man 3' is the latest installment of the 'Spider-Man' superhero series. For me, this film represents the worst of the trilogy.The main problem in this film is its script. It has many threads, but never develops any of them strongly, so that the film becomes muddled and tedious. Rather than focusing on a jumbled array of side plots and three villains, this film should have focused on developing some side plots and one or maybe two of its villains instead. As it was, the plot developments that were put forth were mostly lax. The development of the 'dark Peter Parker' subplot was actually laughable as Peter suddenly decided on a more conspicuous and blackened hair style and makeup. Even the film's final conflict wasn't particularly exciting.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's roles in this film aren't on par with what they had to work with in previous films. James Franco is proficient as Harry and did have some notable scenes. Thomas Haden Church is effective as Flint Marko, but the character was very underdeveloped by the script. Invariably the best performance of the film was from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Topher Grace's character was developed as a trite 'office rival' and was unnecessary. However, Bruce Campbell's cameo as the Maître d' was amusing. Overall, though, 'Spider-Man 3' was a disappointing entry into the superhero genre.",5,2,2,5 October 2007
Knocked Up," Mostly inane
","'Knocked Up' follows a painfully simple premise as its title suggests. A respectable woman and an irresponsible man meet at a bar and after alcohol consumption there is an unexpected pregnancy. Apparently there's supposed to be humor in the fact that he didn't bother to use a condom and she didn't bother to check whether or not he used a condom.The 'hilarity' is supposed to ensue from there. However, it does not and the jokes are mostly inane with a lot of low-brow humor, profanity and random unfunny movie references mixed in. I found the characters in the movie to be simply irritating rather than amusing as was intended. The only exception was Harold Ramis' character, who has a decent cameo appearance.I was unfortunate enough to be subjected to 'Knocked Up'. Hopefully you will be more fortunate and avoid seeing this movie.",1,26,54,28 August 2007
Alien," In space stories can run out of steam
","'Alien' is Ridley Scott's acclaimed horror science-fiction film about a killer alien on a spaceship. It features excellent special effects and scenes and a clever use of lighting techniques. Sigourney Weaver is strong as the film's lead and Ian Holm is memorable as the ship's science officer. John Hurt is also in the film as the ship's executive officer, but is underutilized in the role.Where 'Alien' suffers is in its story or more appropriately its lack of. Characterization in the film is limited and there is only one interesting twist in the plot, which was enjoyable, but represented only a small part in the film. The story is quite run-of-the-mill and barely developed beyond the fact that there is an alien bent on indiscriminately killing members of the ship's crew. The lack of story development made 'Alien' seem long and mostly tedious.",4,4,14,20 August 2007
Taxi Driver," Are you talking to me?
","'Taxi Driver' chronicles the life of Travis Bickle, a misanthropic Vietnam veteran who takes to driving a taxi at nights to combat his insomnia. This film is not for those looking for a ray of sunshine; it depicts Travis' descent further into mental illness as he becomes disgusted by the night life in the city seen from his taxi.The film is engaging and thought-provoking from beginning to end. Even seeing Travis simply observing the streets in his taxi is immersive with the help of Bernard Herrmann's perfect score. The film's performances are all top-notch from Robert De Niro to the supporting cast. Robert De Niro expertly creates a subtle and memorable characterization in Travis Bickle.This film has many classic moments, particularly the famous 'Are you talking to me?' scene. It builds up slowly with nice touches such as the scrawled diary of Travis to an unexpected but satisfying conclusion. I recommend 'Taxi Driver' to anyone willing to see the film's grim atmosphere.",10,0,1,24 May 2007
Barry Lyndon," The rise and fall of an opportunist
","'Barry Lyndon' is Stanley Kubrick's film about a fictitious Irishman, Redmond Barry, who lived during the reign of King George III. This film manages to impeccably capture a sense of period with wide shots of lavish and colorful sets, scenes and greenery as well as impressive works of art and architecture. The film also includes an effective combination of classical pieces and marching music that comprise the score.This film's story is developed with a slow-pace intended to make the film more thoughtful than entertaining. This is reinforced by the inclusion of a narrative and the division of the story into two parts. Sometimes narratives are unnecessary for a film or even a hindrance, but in this case the thoughtful and clever prose was beneficial to the film. The first part of the story chronicles some scenes from Barry's early life and his military career. The military displays and battle scenes proved captivating even though the battles were brief and highlighted the inept tactics used in the Seven Years' War.The second part shows the troubled married life of Redmond and his interactions with the English nobility. Personally I found the first part to be the more interesting of the two, but ultimately both parts told an interesting story. Both parts show duels, whether with pistols or swords, that are engaging without being embellished.Ryan O'Neal leads the cast as Redmond Barry. O'Neal's acting regimen largely consists of speaking in low tones, casting lingering gazes and occasional bursts of emotion. None the less, he creates an interesting character that is despicable in many ways but sympathetic in others. The film also has excellent supporting performances. Marisa Berenson gives a fine performance as Barry's careworn wife, Lady Lyndon. Leon Vitali is also excellent as Lord Bullingdon, a bitter son from Lady Lyndon's prior marriage. The animosity between Barry and Bullingdon is well-developed and striking. Frank Middlemass was effective at showing palpable and perceptive disdain for Barry as Sir Charles Lyndon. I also enjoyed Leonard Rossiter's performance as the proud man of airs, Captain John Quin. Overall 'Barry Lyndon' is interesting as a slowly paced but well-developed period film.",10,8,14,21 October 2007
Glory," Glorious
","'Glory' is certainly among the best American Civil War films. It tells the inspiring story of the first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts. The script and cinematography are solid and James Horner's score was eerily appropriate for the film.Matthew Broderick and Cary Elwes, who people may not initially think of as being appropriate for the serious roles they play, are strong as the leaders of the regiment. Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher represent the soldier side with equal strength. I also enjoyed John Finn's colorful performance as the brutal sergeant-major in charge of training and Bob Gunton and Cliff De Young's performances as the two corrupt Union officers.The only improvement that could have been made to the film is in the battle scenes, particularly the first. A better sense of tactics could have been incorporated into them. However, overall, Glory is an excellent American Civil War film worth seeing.",9,4,6,9 August 2007
Top Secret!," How silly can you get?
","'Top Secret!' is a comedy that parodies spy films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team that created 'Airplane!' (1980) and later the 'Naked Gun' films. The story follows the exploits of Nick Rivers, played by Val Kilmer, as he gets tangled in a plot in East Germany. Strangely and amusingly enough, though, East Germany's officials deliberately resemble Nazis.Val Kilmer does well with the humor and musical numbers in the lead. Lucy Gutteridge is also appropriate as Nick's love interest. The resistance members and East German/Nazi officers were all well-cast as well. There are some brief but nice appearances from Omar Sharif and Peter Cushing.The film has a number of funny moments, such as the singing of the East German anthem or Nick's air duct escape. I also enjoyed the musical numbers, particularly 'How silly can you get?' However, I didn't find this film to be as consistently funny as 'Airplane!' or the 'Naked Gun'. 'Top Secret!' effectively mocks spy films, but isn't as amusing as other films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team.",7,2,2,6 September 2007
Fargo," 'Yeah. Oh yeah.'
","'Fargo' is the Coen brother's film of a salesman in Fargo, North Dakota that hires two men to kidnap his wife for financial gain and a subsequent police investigation. The story is said to be based on true events with the stipulation that the characterizations are exaggerated for comical effect. The film has an eclectic mix of drama, crime, humor and black humor. The film is well-shot and has an effective score.The film has solid performances. William H. Macy creates a compelling character as the desperate salesman Jerry Lundegaard. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are interesting as the quirky yet dangerous as the kidnappers. Frances McDormand also has a notable turn as the no-nonsense and practical yet simple Marge Gunderson.The story starts off well and the crime story generally retained my interest. However, I found that the script got diverted at a number of points and was less effective than it could have been. A prime example of this was the scenes related to the character of 'Mike', which were unnecessary and distracted from the main story. The film's satire of how trite people can be is clever at points, but becomes tedious with repetition. However, Chief Gunderson's speech toward the end of the film was well-written. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality of 'Fargo' to be up to its reputation despite its positive points.",7,0,0,22 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A long-revered story successfully comes to film
","'The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings' is the first of Peter Jackson's trilogy of films that adapted Tolkien's famous fantasy novels to film. The film features impressive costumes, sets and majestic New Zealand scenes that bring Middle Earth to life. To create the film's setting, the makers of the film used seamless models and CGI effects along with an appropriately epic score from Howard Shore.The casting in this film is outstanding. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan all are convincing as the carefree Hobbits drawn into a larger world. Ian Holm is memorable as an aged Bilbo Baggins, the main character of the novel 'The Hobbit'. Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies and Viggo Mortensen are all well-cast as members of the Fellowship. Hugo Weaving has a matter-of-fact manner as Elrond that recalls his success as Agent Smith in 'The Matrix' (1999). Christopher Lee proves adept again in a villain role as Saruman. Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler make memorable elves. Andy Serkis is appropriate and believable as Gollum. My favorite of the great performances, though, is Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf. He brings the right mix of geniality, authority and humor to the role and looks the part with the help of his cloak, beard and staff.The film follows a streamlined version of Tolkien's narrative and remains faithful to the original work. The result is an epic and exciting adaptation of one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time that remains well-paced despite its length. The extended edition of this film has some interesting scenes, but personally I didn't find that it added a lot above and beyond the theatre cut.",10,1,2,5 October 2007
North by Northwest," 'War is hell ... even when it's a cold one.'
","'North by Northwest' is Alfred Hitchcock's film about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent and becomes entangled in a web of intrigue. The film shows the world of espionage as dangerous yet glamorous, making this in some ways a precursor to the James Bond films which would come soon after. However, 'North by Northwest' has a stronger degree of intrigue and characterization than is seen in any Bond film.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill with all the necessary charm and Eva Marie Saint is likewise perfect as the enigmatic Eve Kendall and the chemistry between the two is extraordinary. The supporting performances are also strong: James Mason as the forceful Vandamm, Martin Landau and Vandamm's other lackeys and even Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's generally unimpressed mother. Leo G. Carroll also deserves note as his look and demeanor fit very well with his role as 'The Professor'.The story is effective at being enticing early with its tantalizing premise and developing with enough intrigue and characterization to keep it engaging. The action scenes, in particular two famous ones, are well-staged, tense and unorthodox to a degree that keeps them interesting. There is also a lot of well-placed humor injected into the film in between the moments of intrigue and action. 'North by Northwest' should satisfy those looking for those seeking a spy film with a strong amount intrigue and characterization and those seeking a spy film well-paced with notable action scenes.",10,1,3,18 September 2007
Duck Soup," Freedonia's going to war
","'Duck Soup' is the Marx Brothers' best movie and among the funniest movies of all time. The main source of humor in the film is Groucho Marx as Rufus T. Firefly. He never fails with his rapid insults and anecdotes. Sometimes his jokes don't even relate directly to the situation at hand, but they are always funny.Chico and Harpo are amusing too with their usual routine of slapstick and interspersed with quips, although not as consistently amusing as Groucho. The musical numbers in this film are better than most in Marx Brothers films. The songs about Firefly's administration and Freedonia going to war are well-done and highly amusing.There are too many memorable scenes in the movie to relate them all, among them the meeting with Trentino, the meeting with the representatives, the mirror scene or even Firefly's 'car'. I recommend 'Duck Soup' for those familiar with the Marx Brothers and those not.",10,1,2,13 August 2007
The Patriot," And now for something not historical...
","'The Patriot' allows Mel Gibson to portray a character very similar to his fictitious version of William Wallace from 'Braveheart' (1995). Rather than the medieval Scottish highlands, the action this time takes place in America during the American Revolution. Mel Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin, is similar to Wallace in being motivated to fight the English after a personal loss and lead a ragtag group of soldiers.'The Patriot' boasts great sets, shots and costumes supported by an impeccable score from John Williams. The only point against the film's cinematography is an exaggerated use of slow motion shots. As with 'Braveheart' (1995), the story of this film cannot by any means be taken as history. The film exaggerates the virtues of the continental army and the atrocities committed by the British. If you can get past that, it's possible to enjoy this film. The story follows a good pace and the action scenes are excellent and well-staged, even if some of them are over-the-top. 'Braveheart' (1995) exceeds 'The Patriot' for interesting story developments and characterization, but 'The Patriot' is still solid.Mel Gibson essentially reprises his role with William Wallace and does it with the same energy for another good performance. The members of Benjamin Martin's family are all well-played and as is Charlotte, the sister of Benjamin's dead wife. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel Tavington with smugness and audacity that would later be seen again in Lucius Malfoy of the 'Harry Potter' films and creates a great villain. Also on the British side was Tom Wilkinson, who was enjoyable to see as the gentlemanly and proud General Cornwallis. On the revolutionary side, the supporting cast was decent. Particularly notable was Tchéky Karyo as France's representative and Rene Auberjonois of 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' fame as the preacher. With this cast and its story, 'The Patriot' is an entertaining, though not historically accurate film in the spirit of 'Braveheart' (1995).",9,1,4,5 September 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Doubtless 'AvP' stands for 'all very predictable'
","'Alien vs Predator' begins with a contrived plot with one purpose: to bring humans, aliens and predators so that inevitable conflict may ensue. The filmmakers must have thought that the synergy of having aliens and predators in one tremendous battle would be overwhelmingly entertaining. However, 'Alien vs Predator' is an exercise in mediocrity and worse than 'Alien' (1979) and 'Predator' (1987).This film's main weakness is its story, or more appropriately lack thereof. Most of the story is limited to the confines of repetitive action sequences. There are some marginal story developments that occur beyond this, but they failed evoke my interest.Add to this formula clichÃ© characters and performances and dialogue that is easily forgettable and it becomes clear why 'Alien vs Predator' drags throughout its duration. Even the film's final conflict and the subsequent story development are flat. If you have not already seen 'Alien vs Predator', avoid it in earnest.",1,0,3,29 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Middle Earth goes to war
","'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in 'Return of the King' (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The 'Two Towers' book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut.",10,2,3,5 October 2007
Schindler's List," 'The list is life.'
","'Schindler's List' is Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film that explores the life of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved almost 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust through his actions. Spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film. Spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate Nazi gunfire and killings.Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler. Schindler is initially a war profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to shield Jews from the Holocaust. Interestingly the character was given an enigmatic quality and generally isn't explicit about his perceptions for a lot of the film. To the film's credit, it doesn't suppress the womanizing aspect of Schindler's character. Ben Kingsley is also excellent in a subtle performance as Schindler's invaluable accountant and assistant, Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great and frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac Amon Goeth.This film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it is never tedious during its length of over three hours. The film gains intensity from the graphic depictions of Nazi violence and the lingering sense that Jews can be killed at any time. It also shows us how the courage of one individual can have an important impact. Schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important number.",10,9,13,1 December 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," The funny heist gone wrong
","'Dog Day Afternoon' is about an inept bank robbery that leads to a hostage situation. It sounds like a humorless premise, but humor is the prominent element in the film with moments of drama and tension mixed in.Al Pacino is Sonny, the leader of the heist turned hostage situation. Pacino is perfect in his role as a nervous improviser. His character is multi-faceted and interesting, proving sometimes knowledgeable despite being engaged in an inept operation and sympathetic. John Cazale is also notable as the accomplice of few words, Sal. Cazale is at his best with his expressions during the tense final sequence. The hostages and police forces are well-played as well. It was interesting to contrast the styles of Moretti, initially representing the police side and trying to cobble a solution together and Sheldon, the organized chess-master FBI agent.On paper the hostage situation story sounds typical, but this film rises far above any clichÃ©s. The film gains strength from its humoristic approach to the situation, which uses irony and absurdity to great effect. However, there are a number of great dramatic moments as well and an interesting consideration of Vietnam, trans-sexuality and other social issues. I found that after the initial hold-up gone wrong I slowly calmed to the hostage situation before the effective and tense end sequence. I didn't find the film's second half aside from the ending to be as consistently engaging as the first, but overall this film has a novel and interesting approach to portraying a hostage situation.",8,1,2,22 November 2007
Amadeus," Rock me Amadeus
","'Amadeus' is based on the play of the same name by Peter Shaffer. It portrays a fictionalized account of the life of famous classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, emphasizing an intense rivalry between him and composer Antonio Salieri. The film creates a great sense of period with lavish sets and elegant costumes.Tom Hulce leads the cast as Mozart with great energy and he creates a memorable character. Mozart is portrayed as a man whose vices and juvenile conduct are only exceeded by his genius in creating music. My favorite performance of the film, however, is F. Murray Abraham's skillful performance as Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri. He convincingly creates a Salieri that narrates the story as a conniving and bitter man, but manages to elicit sympathy when he laments that he can never be as prolific or well-known as Mozart. There are excellent supporting performances in the film, too, including Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's patient wife Constanze and Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II with a matter-of-fact manner.The rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is well-developed and the film never becomes tiresome despite its length. In addition to the characterizations, the film appropriately includes dazzling segments of classical music and representations of staged operas. The end narration of Salieri is very well-written and touching. Truly F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is a champion for mediocrity.",10,1,3,1 October 2007
Annie Hall," An intelligent, tongue-in-cheek look at relationships
","'Annie Hall' is Woody Allen's acclaimed comedy about the troubled relationship between Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Intelligent humor and great performances secure the place of 'Annie Hall' among the top comedy films of all time.Woody Allen and Diane Keaton play there oft-repeated but never tiresome roles as an insecure couple. Both of them give perfect performances and create one of the best comedy couples on screen. There are also a wide range of memorable supporting performances from such people as Tony Roberts, Christopher Walken, musician Paul Simon and Jeff Goldblum.The humor of 'Annie Hall' touches on such diverse subjects as a troubled childhood, analysts, perceived anti-Semitism, driving habits, sex and 70s American politics, all with intelligently written and consistently funny dialogue. It's impossible for me to remember all of the great moments in 'Annie Hall' simply because every moment is amusing and clever. Even though this film takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to relationships, it manages to portray issues that are all too real, making the film not only funny but incisive as well.",10,0,0,16 October 2007
Singin' in the Rain," With a happy refrain
","'Singin' in the Rain' is a musical that explores the transition from silent to sound films. It also features the story of actor Don Lockwood, who is famous for his on-screen romantic pairing with Lina Lamont. Lina expects Don to marry her, but Don is more interested in Kathy Selden.Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Debbie Reynolds are all excellent in the lead roles. Hagen is especially amusing and her screechy voice functions perfectly as an impediment in the transition to sound films.There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended 'Broadway Melody' number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story.The storyline exploring the tumultuous transition from silent to sound films and the relationships between characters were clever and amusing. It helped that I watched 'The Jazz Singer' (1927) shortly before watching this one, as the film makes reference to its role as the film that ushered in the sound era. It is not essential to view it before seeing this, but it may help to learn of the song 'Mammy' from that film since some of the jokes in this film make reference to it. 'Singin' in the Rain' is not my favorite musical, but it is certainly one of the better ones I have seen.",9,2,5,25 November 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing dystopia
","'A Clockwork Orange' is Stanley Kubrick's film based on Anthony Burgess' novel. The story follows the life of Alex de Large, the leader of a gang in a dystopian Britain where gang violence has become an overwhelming problem, leading the government to use radical measures to placate gangs. The film raises questions of what measures are appropriate to deal with the surge in gang activity.The technical qualities of this film are superb. Bizarre imagery and sets are used to great effect. The score is a mix of synthesizer music and classical pieces and suits the film very well. Classical music is also incorporated into the script in an intelligent way because one of Alex's chief interests is Beethoven's music. The idea to set a sex scene to the 'William Tell Overture' was also an inspired choice.Malcolm McDowell gives a perfect performance as Alex de Large and creates an unforgettable character. All of the film's supporting performances were effective as well. This film's script is engaging and never failed to keep me interested in what turn Alex's life would take next. At times violence and rape are depicted in a deeply disturbing manner, yet this film never fails to be compelling and thought-provoking. Another interesting dimension of the film was that it had its own vernacular of slang terms used by Alex and his gang members. 'A Clockwork Orange' creates a world that is shocking yet provocative and enthralling.",10,2,4,30 September 2007
Where Eagles Dare," The eagles have landed
","'Where Eagles Dare' is the story of a group of Allied agents that are sent to infiltrate a Nazi castle during World War II. The scenes and sets in and around the castle are impressive and Ron Goodwin's score is a great addition to the film's atmosphere.Richard Burton leads the cast with a notable performance as the dapper Major Smith, the leader of the agent team. Clint Eastwood also delivers a fine performance as Lieutenant Schaffer, a young lieutenant assigned to assist the team. All of the supporting performances were solid as well.For me the best part of this film was the threads of intrigue it developed, which put it shades above typical action films. I particularly enjoyed the 'dining table' scene, which was a brilliant explosion of intrigue. The action scenes in this film were well-made and generally well paced, although admittedly at times I found myself yearning for more great moments of intrigue in the style of the 'dining table' scene. The film's end was very interesting and highly appropriate. 'Where Eagles Dare' combines elements of intrigue and action to make an entertaining war film.",8,2,3,4 October 2007
The Da Vinci Code," 'Witness the greatest cover-up in human history.'
","'The Da Vinci Code' is a film based on Dan Brown's famous and controversial novel. The book and the film have been criticized by Christians due to its plot which portrays elements of the Roman Catholic Church as being involved in a conspiracy. However, this never bothered me and it is clear enough that this is a work of fiction. The story follows Robert Langdon, a professor at Harvard, who becomes entangled in the aforementioned conspiracy. The film features an impressive array of locations, architecture, art and a notable score by Hans Zimmer as Langdon unravels the conspiracy.A number of people were dissatisfied with Tom Hanks' portrayal of Robert Langdon. Tom Hanks certainly isn't as well-suited to the role of adventurous professor as Harrison Ford, but I found his performance to be respectable. Audrey Tautou is also notable as Sophie Neveu. My favorite performance of the film was Ian McKellen in his over-the-top and charismatic performance as Sir Leigh Teabing. Every scene with Sir Leigh in it is a delight to see. The supporting cast is great too, particularly Jean Reno as Captain Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa.This film has been criticized for not meeting expectations based on the book and generally being dull. I have never read the book and hence can't compare the book and film, but I can say that I didn't find this film to be dull. Quite the contrary, to me this film's main strength is that it sets up an interesting mystery and pursues it vigorously with a lot of interesting twists. Any film that manages that will always get high praise from me.",10,2,6,4 October 2007
The Untouchables," The Chicago way
","'The Untouchables' focuses on the efforts of investigator Eliot Ness to topple crime syndicate leader Al Capone in Prohibition-era Chicago. The film exaggerates the role of Eliot Ness and his loyal sidekicks, 'The Untouchables' in disrupting Capone's activities and takes other liberties with history. The film nicely captures the look of Prohibition-era Chicago and Ennio Morricone's score is memorable and appropriate.Kevin Costner is decent as Eliot Ness, the man leading the efforts against Capone. Robert De Niro is seen relatively little as Al Capone, but makes an impression in the scenes he is in. My favorite performance in the film was that of Sean Connery as the street-smart policeman who tutors Ness on the 'right' way to fight Capone. The supporting performances were notable as well, particularly Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia as members of 'The Untouchables' and Richard Bradford as the chief of Chicago police.The story has enough turns to prevent it from becoming generic and is generally engaging. The action scenes are well-shot, although the scenes in the last half hour of the film were somewhat overlong. The film's famous action scene involving Ness and a stroller was well-done. Overall 'The Untouchables' is a worthwhile film about combating organized crime during Prohibition.",8,1,3,17 September 2007
The Godfather: Part III," The final offer
","I was skeptical whether the third installment of the 'Godfather' trilogy, shot 16 years after the second installment, could be on par with the first two. While it is not as good as the first two films, it is still a good film in itself and remains faithful to the look and spirit of the first two films. I had no complaints with the cinematography or score.The script is well-written and the ending was a very memorable and appropriate way to end the trilogy. I enjoyed all of the performances, particularly Al Pacino reprising his role as Michael Corleone, save one. The one is Sofia Coppola, who is awkward as Mary Corleone. Overall, this film is a satisfactory conclusion to the much-praised 'Godfather' trilogy.",8,0,1,9 August 2007
Die Hard," Dies hard
","'Die Hard' features Bruce Willis as John McClane, a police officer combatting a group of terrorists holding hostages in an LA office building. Willis makes a decent action hero as John McClane and injected a welcome humor into the role. Inevitably McClane gets into a number of conflicts with the terrorists. There are some notable action scenes and special effects, but a lot of the action is repetitive shoot-outs. This would be fine if there were more story developments, but the developments are few and far between.The most interesting developments in the film revolved around the twists Hans Gruber engineers to thwart the inept efforts of the police when they attempt to enter the office building. Alan Rickman's performance as the refined and calculating yet sarcastic Hans Gruber is the highlight of the film. Most of the supporting characters were either unremarkable or unnecessary, particularly the incompetent deputy chief of police. However, having 'Al', the one savvy policeman who showed some character depth and genuine concern was touching. Overall I found 'Die Hard' to be mostly tedious, contrary to the popular opinion of the film as a fast-paced thriller. The one strongly redeeming feature of the film was Alan Rickman's memorable performance as Hans Gruber.",5,10,24,21 August 2007
Psycho," 'We all go a little mad sometimes.'
","'Psycho' is undoubtedly among the tensest films ever created, if not the tensest. The film's story first introduces Marion Crane, but eventually leads to the Bates Motel, which acts as a vortex that sucks a host of characters in.Anthony Perkins gives an unforgettable nuanced performance as Norman Bates, and develops the character expertly with stutters and expressions as well as dialogue. Janet Leigh is equal to giving a critical performance as the anxious Marion Crane, who carries the first part of the film. The performances of Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and the supporting cast are also solid.Other than some brief pauses, this film consistently has heart-throbbing tension. Bernard Herrmann's famous score is an important contributing factor in the near constant tension. However, importantly this film also has an underlying mystery which ensures that the film is fascinating as well as tense.",10,1,2,4 November 2007
War of the Worlds," Bore of the Worlds
","'War of the Worlds' is an adaptation of the H.G. Wells' science fiction novel of the same name. Pairing director Steven Spielberg with material from a well-known science fiction author seems like a perfect match, but this film disappointingly falls flat. The film's premise is simple: aliens invade Earth to the terror of all. Its sets and effects are well-developed and John Williams' score is certainly notable, but these factors can't help this film much.I never found myself becoming attached to the characters, a rarity in a Spielberg film. The performances in the film aren't especially bad, particularly that of Tim Robbins, but the characters themselves simply aren't memorable.No doubt this film was supposed to gain depth from the consideration of society in chaos and the strain of the alien invasion on individuals and families, but I found these developments largely trite and uninteresting. Any developments that are interesting are eclipsed by the film's lingering focus on dull 'run terrified and hide from the aliens' scenes. The aliens themselves were none too inspiring despite being created with the best of CGI. This film bows out with an abrupt ending that tries to be clever but to me seemed contrived and an example of 'deus ex machina' gone awry.",1,2,6,29 September 2007
American Gangster," Disappointing but not completely awful crime film
","'American Gangster' is Ridley Scott's latest film that centers on the leader of a drug cartel and a detective dedicated to curtailing drug dealing. Though the story is based on true events, no doubt viewers will find parallels with other better crime films. The parallel that strikes me the most is with 'Heat' (1995), which also portrays a crime story from the perspective of a detective and a criminal leader, but much more engagingly. 'American Gangster' isn't an awful film per se, but it could have been better considering the talent involved.The film does feature solid performances. Russell Crowe is effective as a relentless and incorruptible yet womanizing and sometimes quick to anger detective. Denzel Washington is also effective in his role as a self-assured and tough criminal leader. Both actors are acting in familiar territory and I wasn't surprised by the characterizations, but they were effective none the less. The supporting performances were also notable, especially Josh Brolin as a despicable crooked police detective.The film's story is where this film could have been improved. The film's premise is a good one and it is well-developed initially. The ending sequence starting with an investigation of a plane is tense and effective. There is a memorable scene where Crowe and Washington sit down and discuss their situation which recalls 'Heat', though the scene in 'Heat' is superior. The way they incorporated reports of Vietnam into the film was effective and as were the scenes featuring the troubled family life of Crowe's character. It is the middle of the story that could have been improved. While there are some notable scenes in that portion, it seemed overlong overall and more tedious than it should be. Due to this, for me 'American Gangster' did not realize its full potential.",7,0,2,23 November 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," 'Have the lambs stopped screaming?'
","'The Silence of the Lambs' follows young FBI agent Clarice Starling as she attempts to track a serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill'. During her investigation, she solicits assistance from a psychotic yet intelligent cannibal named Hannibal Lecter.Jodie Foster provides a strong performance as the neophyte agent Clarice Starling, who is eager to prove herself yet haunted by her past. Anothony Hopkins gives a nuanced, refined and haunting performance as the unforgettable cannibal Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Heald proves the perfect person to play an imperious minor official as Dr. Frederick Chilton. Scott Glenn is also notable as Starling's superior in the FBI.The crime story developed is excellent and remains interesting through its various turns as it chronicles the investigative process of agent Starling. One of the keys to this film's success is the well-written dialogue between Starling and Lecter, which is like a game of chess because of Leceter's manipulative tactics. The film is also effective as a thriller, as it builds up a lot of tension throughout its duration.",10,4,8,20 October 2007
Blade Runner," Dystopia never looked so good
","'Blade Runner' is among the best and most influential science fiction movies of all time. It has influenced countless stories set in 'dystopian' futures with its depiction. It is not of the same stripe of science fiction as Star Wars or Star Trek, as its story is grounded in a grim Los Angeles of 2019. Some people may the film's brand of science fiction slow-paced due to its emphasis on slowly developing a story over action sequences, although the film does have a few well-placed action scenes. However, for those that can enjoy the unfolding of a science fiction detective story, 'Blade Runner' is great.The dim, smoky vision of Los Angeles in 2019 is mesmerizing and one you are unlikely to forget. Vangelis' score is very appropriate to match the setting and extremely memorable, and I particularly enjoyed the main title track and 'Blade Runner Blues'. Every performance in the film is excellent from Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard to the supporting cast. The engaging plot and characterization and the questions the film raises make the film suitable for repeat viewings.There is considerable debate between which is better between the two cuts of the film currently available, the original theatrical cut and the director's cut. Both are worth seeing if possible. Harrison Ford's narration in the theatrical cut fills provides interesting details and is worth hearing at least once, but is not strictly necessary. I prefer the director's cut because I welcomed the scenes not in the theatrical cut and found the ending more appropriate.",10,1,2,7 August 2007
Casino Royale," Casino Royale ups the ante
","'Casino Royale' represents a fundamental shift in the James Bond series. After the mediocrity of 'Die Another Day' (2002) the producers of this film decided that the series needed an overhaul. I've enjoyed other Bond films, and I liked Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Bond, but after 'Die Another Day' I welcome the changes to the series.Daniel Craig is the new James Bond. He still injects some of the conventional Bond humor into the role, but overall plays him with a harder edge. Craig gives a solid performance and successfully reinvents the character. The film tends to linger a little too long on Craig's shirtless body at points, but that's a minor complaint. Eva Green plays Bond's female companion Vesper Lynd. She creates an interesting, sassy and intelligent character. I only wish she would take off some of that eye makeup. Admittedly I was always ambivalent about Judi Dench's semi-antagonistic style as M, but she gets better as the film progresses. Unfortunately Mads Mikkelsen is not compelling as Bond's rival Le Chiffre. His acting is fine, but the character never amounts to more than a generic villain.At first I was disconcerted by the fact that this film blatantly contradicts the timeline established by other Bond films, but I accepted that this film has a new timeline for a new Bond. Many of the conventions of Bond films are missing: there is no Moneypenny, no special gadgets and no cars with missiles. While these elements were effective in Bond films of the past, I didn't miss them here.There are still plenty of action sequences, and they were well-done even if the first one is overlong. The film's poker scenes were staged with enough tension that they didn't become boring. A welcome change in this film is that the plot is more rigorous. The series' answer to the tedious story of 'Die Another Day' is more ambiguity and plot twists than the usual Bond fare. There have been more interesting Bond stories, but it's a good answer none the less, and I look forward to seeing future installments in this new Bond timeline.",8,0,3,14 October 2007
Rear Window," Rear window ethics
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' starts with a shot of its setting, a small apartment square compromised of bright Technicolor yet ageing brick buildings. It seems as though it could be the setting for an adaptation of a Broadway musical, but as this is a Hitchcock film it's not too surprising that no one starts singing and that darker designs lie beneath the benign surface. The people that live in the confined apartment setting have a captive audience, L. B. Jefferies, who is confined to his room in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg. Jeff occupies his time by scrutinizing the lives of those around him by peering through their windows. Eventually he sees what he deems to be suspicious conduct from one of his neighbors and conjectures that something sinister is afoot.James Stewart lends his usual charm to the role of Jefferies, but is appropriately also somewhat unnerving as well. We are frequently left with a sense that he crosses moral boundaries, yet we can't help being equally fascinated with what he observes. Grace Kelly is dazzling in her role as Liza and creates an admirably persistent character. Wendell Corey is well-cast as a cynical detective and Thelma Ritter also as the vocal Stella. Raymond Burr manages to make an impression despite performing largely at a distance from the principal characters.The mystery story developed draws in viewers as the main characters are drawn in, which is the film's main appeal. Various subplots are developed and are interesting without detracting from the film's overall story. The film also develops suitable tension, in particular near the ending. Impressively, 'Rear Window' manages to be consistently engaging though confined to a small setting.",10,1,4,4 November 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An epic ending
","'The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.",10,19,26,5 October 2007
Heat," Sifting through detritus
","'Heat' is Michael Mann's crime movie set in Los Angeles. It pits Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and the L.A. police against Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley and his loyal accomplices. The film captures both sides of the story exquisitely and features excellent cinematography and a well-made score.From the start, 'Heat' is a character-driven film. This is the film's main strength: it develops characters which are easy to become attached to and I became very interested in what fate the script had in store for each of the characters. My favorite of these characters is Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna. Hanna is the tough detective of old and Pacino has the gruff voice to match, but the character also gains depth from his relationship with his family. There is also well-placed humor injected into Hanna's character that was welcome. On the other side is Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, who is also effective and develops a character of depth. There are also notable supporting performances from Val Kimer, Amy Brenneman, Dennis Haysbert and a number of others.In addition to developing its characters, 'Heat' benefits from showing carefully planned and executed crimes and careful and methodical investigative work. There is also high quality action scenes mixed in, which are given extra meaning due to the film's rigorous characterizations. There is also the famous scene where rivals Pacino and De Niro sit down for coffee and reflect on their lives which is simply brilliant. Overall 'Heat' is a well-developed film which considers the consequences of crime on a public and personal scale.",10,0,1,22 September 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This will be a film long remembered
","'Star Wars' is not only in the upper echelon of Science Fiction films, but of all films. This original installment of the 'Star Wars' films and the rest of the original trilogy created a magic unmatched by the prequel trilogy. It is well known that 'Star Wars' has had a profound impact on moviegoers and has spawned an unprecedented amount of merchandise in the form of books, toys, computer games, etc.'Star Wars' has sets and special effects that are seamless and compare well to other Science Fiction movies and television shows of the time as well as the prequel trilogy. In fact, I found the models in this film were more seamless than the CGI effects used for the prequels. The special effects were used well to create fantastic space battles, aided by John Williams' unforgettable score. Many people know the premise behind the film: a young farm boy becomes untangled in a galactic civil war between a desperate rebellion and an oppressive empire. With this premise, the film's story develops engagingly from start to finish.Every character in the film is appropriately cast. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford give great performances in the lead roles. Alec Guinness brings his experience to bear in his performance which makes 'the Force', which might otherwise seem silly, a legitimate concept. James Earl Jones was the perfect choice to provide the booming voice of Darth Vader to aid David Prowse's physical performance. Peter Cushing creates a memorable character in the arrogant Grand Moff Tarkin with aristocratic airs. In short, every performance in this film is memorable and the dialogue is high quality and quotable.Several editions of 'Star Wars' have been released since the film's initial release in 1977. A 'Special Edition' was released in 1997 with added and altered scenes and a special DVD edition in 2004 with more changed. Personally I found that the added and altered scenes never improved on the original film and some of them were even detrimental (see at: Greedo shoots first). For me, the best version remains the original, available now on limited edition DVDs.",10,0,1,14 September 2007
300," Spartans fight for Greece, or maybe Middle Earth?
","'300' follows a format that resembles the Mel Gibson formula for historical films: Take historical events, adapt them so that one character that represents the fight for freedom against tyranny and hence is compelled to fight in large scale battles. Unfortunately, '300' is not as engaging as 'Braveheart' (1995) or even 'The Patriot' (2000).The film's casting was fine, and Gerard Butler stood out as King Leonidas. The film's cinematography was of high quality and the soundtrack was appropriate other than the segments of rock music. The film starts off well with some details about Sparta and King Leonidas' personal history before the conflict between Spartans and Persians. However, before the conflict can proceed, the film delves into unnecessarily long sex scene.As the Spartans march to conflict with the Persians, it seems that '300' will launch to great heights. It still seems that way as the first engagement proceeds, which introduces the well-staged battle sequences of the film. However, the film doesn't really ever soar from there.The film has a tendency overuse slow motion effects and sometimes linger overly long on shots or scenes. There weren't any great story developments to retain my interest for the film's duration. There are some semi-interesting plot developments back in Sparta during the conflict and some great speeches and moments on the battlefield, but overall not much. This would be more tolerable if the developments in the battles were interesting, but the battles become ridiculous after the first few engagements. I didn't expect perfect historical accuracy from this film, but it seemed like the Spartans were fighting Sauron's forces from the 'Lord of the Rings' movies rather than the Persians. This is because of the fantastic creatures that the Persian army manages to field. I half expected an Orc regiment to attack the Spartans as a final blow. Another odd point about the battles is that the film takes its time to iterate the importance of the phalanx, only to have a number of shots of Spartans out of formation.There are films such as 'Gettysburg' (1993) and 'Waterloo' (1970) that effectively capture a particular historical conflict. There are films such as 'Braveheart' (1995) or 'The Patriot' (2000) that embellish history to create an engaging film. '300' disappointingly falls into neither of these categories.",5,0,0,16 September 2007
Ran," Shakespeare in Japan
","'Ran' is Akira Kurosawa's film which takes the story of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and adapts it to be set in feudal Japan. The story begins with Lord Hidetora Ichimonji proposing to leave his kingdom to his three sons. The film appears in superb vivid colors and has majestic shots of fields and castles. Tôru Takemitsu's score also adds to the grandeur of this film.The performances of the film are also memorable. Tatsuya Nakadai is effective at showing the decline of Hidetora Ichimonji and making him a sympathetic figure despite his checkered past. The three Ichimonji sons are also well-portrayed and seeing the rivalries of these three strong characters is impressive. Also of note is Mieko Harada's performance as Lady Kaede, who is unnerving to the last. Shinnosuke Ikehata also plays the role of Shakespearean fool well and the supporting performances are commendable.The film is effective at developing its characters and story without seeming slow-paced. To punctuate the character and story development, the film has some battle scenes. These are well-staged and shot on an epic scale. In particular there is a siege and a major battle which are unforgettable. 'Ran' momentously recreates the tragedy of 'King Lear' with adept characterizations, exquisite color and grand scale conflict.",10,2,5,28 September 2007
Braveheart," Are you ready for war?
","The makers of the film took their history books and carefully tossed them aside so that Mel Gibson could have a free hand to portray a completely virtuous William Wallace and his struggle against the English. Despite this 'black and white' approach to history, it is still a highly enjoyable film.The film has great scenes, with majestic shots of the Scottish highlands and sweeping battlefields, castles and towns and an appropriate score to match. The film is well-cast, led by Mel Gibson, who is energetic as William Wallace and handles the action, speeches and drama well. My favorite performance is from Patrick McGoohan, who revels in being despicable to the Scottish and his meek son as King Edward Longshanks. Angus Macfadyen brings out an interesting character in Robert the Bruce. The rest of the cast is solid as well from both the Scottish and English camps.The story is paced nicely, first focusing on developments in character and then proceeding quickly into action. There are a number of interesting turns in the story along the way. This film is also notable for its large scale epic battle scenes, which are well-staged. 'Braveheart' is not history, but it is still an engaging film about a struggle for independence in the Middle Ages.",10,3,6,2 September 2007
Goodfellas," The wise guys
","'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorsese's movie about Henry Hill, who aspires to be a gangster from an early age and becomes involved with an Italian-American crime family over three decades. The film features interesting and effective cinematography and it was notable how the shots were filmed in the 'drugs' portion of the film. The soundtrack featured a number of notable songs like the end of 'Layla' and 'Jump Into the Fire'.The performances in this film are top-notch. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill effectively as he lives with the perks and dangers of mob life. Robert De Niro delivers an interesting and refined performance as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci is memorable as the erratic and disturbing Tommy DeVito. Lorraine Bracco is also commendable as Henry's wife and Paul Sorvino makes a convincing mob boss.This film develops an interesting story with surprising and interesting developments that keep the film well-paced. It explores the tightly contained lives of the members of the mob family. In addition, it has an interesting examination of the privileges afforded to the mob and the consequences of the mob's power. Also explored are the implications of mob life for Henry's relationship with his wife. 'Goodfellas' is an exceptional entry into the crime film genre.",10,0,0,24 September 2007
Jurassic Park," An adventure sixty-five million years in the making
","'Jurassic Park' is Steven Spielberg's immensely popular movie about a theme park with live dinosaurs made possible by replicating preserved dinosaur DNA. Through a calamity the dinosaurs escape their fenced confinements and run amok in the park. The park was created with impressive sets and scenes. John Williams' score is of the highest quality and greatly adds to the majesty and intensity of the film.On paper it sounds as though 'Jurassic Park' could be just another 'monsters attack' movie, but there are several factors that make this film far better than just another monster movie. There is some character development and importantly each part is perfectly cast, which means that each character makes a distinct impression and has memorable lines. Richard Attenborough is the perfect man to play the genial park owner John Hammond. The way Hammond mused about his dream of creating Jurassic Park even when the park was in shambles was great. Sam Neill and Laura Dern were apt choices to play the respectable paleontologists Drs. Grant and Sattler. Jeff Goldblum creates a memorable character in the eccentric Dr. Malcolm. I enjoyed seeing all of the characters in this film.Of course there are the film's famous dinosaurs, which are amazingly realistic. There is enough variation in the types of dinosaur encounters and the context in which they are encountered such that they don't become boring. The situations with the dinosaurs are created such that tension is created. 'Jurassic Park' manages to rise far above being simply another monster movie.",10,4,6,11 October 2007
V for Vendetta," 'Remember, remember the fifth of November.'
","'V for Vendetta' recalls elements of George Orwell's novel '1984'. This film likewise shows a dystopian Britain under a stringent totalitarian government and shares some other themes such as a concern for past events. However, there is one key difference between '1984' and this film, 'V'. In '1984' there was no force to challenge the primacy of the totalitarian government, but in this film V is a mysterious anti-government terrorist figure that inspires resistance.The story follows Evey, played by Natalie Portman, as she slowly makes the acquaintance of V. I have never been overly impressed by Natalie Portman's acting, but she gives a decent though not outstanding performance in this film. However, the rest of the cast is excellent. V's mask wearing character is one part action hero and one part over-the-top stagy actor, sometimes delivering rapid-fire dialogue. It makes for an effective combination and Hugo Weaving handles it well. John Hurt is well-cast as the leader of the totalitarian government in a reversal of his role as the repressed Winston Smith in the 1984 film of '1984'. There are also excellent performances from Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry.This film's primary strength is its intriguing story developed around exploring repression and propaganda from the totalitarian government, opposition to the government and the mysteries concerning the enigmatic V. Like in many films showing dystopia, the setting is appropriately mostly dingy and gloomy. Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture' was used great effect to accompany some of V's anti-government activities. Some will be averse to the way the film mixes overtly dramatic elements such as V's acting and the displays accompanied by the '1812 Overture' with dystopia, but for me the film managed to make the combination effective and interesting.",10,2,7,5 November 2007
