E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Extra Terrestrial Territory
","E.T. is a beautifully crafted piece of work.  In an age before the total eclipse of special effects, Spielberg brings a magical story to life via the camera.  The lightning, the score, the cast are all pure magic.
Many themes are visited in this poignant and riveting masterpiece.  Family ties, friendship, adventure, honesty, the list is endless.  The children are remarkable in their attempts to outwit the law and help E.T. return'home'. That bicycle ride across the moon and the takeoff right in front of the barricade is a flash of pure genius.  My heart never ceases to leap each time I watch that scene.Drew Barrymore who went on to become an accomplished comedienne is sweet in one of her first starring roles.E.T. takes you back to every magical yesterday, for every lover of lore, fantasy and good endings.  E.T. is the forerunner of all sci-fi epics but it's quality is in it's simplicity of storytelling, character portrayal and cinematic depiction.AN ALL TIME CLASSIC.",10,2,4,19 April 2003
Mulan," WE ARE MEN!!!!
","I like Mulan because it was simple enough to appeal to the child in me and powerful to get my adult imagination going.  
The humor was quite Western and a bit slapstick, it could have been toned down to make the movie a classic.  Even with that it's still a beautiful movie.  I appreciate the cultural themes which weren't downplayed but brought to light a culture that has endured long because of it's simplicity and deep values. The invocations/prayers to the ancestors, the burning of incense in their shrine, the calling forth of the guardians, the immobile face of the Emperor before the Hun leader(though he was at death's door)honor above all.  The dialogue and one liners were actually dramatic and memorable in these scenes.  'Though the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow before it' 'A girl like that does not happen every dynasty'But the music really brought this  picture alive; I'll make a man out of you is one of my favourites soundtracks ranking second to Let The River Run (Working Girl OST). A girl worth fighting for(hilarious).Mulan is simple but is a good story which has enough morals for every and anyone.  9/10",Null,2,3,31 August 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," A CRACKER!!!
","The scene that split me in this movie was the one where, Boo slips out of the the bag and jumps on one monsters'  back , he flips her off screaming and when she lands in front of other 'Monsters', she shouts boo and 'the supposed monsters' actually take to their heels.  I was laughing when I watched the video tape that I had to rewind time and time again.  Monsters Inc is actually cool and a good laugh as well. 
It's a feel good and the li'l Boo actually added another touch to the whole scenery.I'd love to see a 2 but if not it'll make for a classic anyday.",Null,0,1,7 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," AWESOOMMEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie and Harry Potter were showing at my local cinema on the same night.I had been bamboozled by my nieces and nephew to see HP, however my friend dragged seven of us(whining and muttering about the cost) to see LOTR instead and I came away thanking my stars.  The movie blew us away, what scenery, what acting! what effects.  The effects were so real.  Sean Bean's Boromir was tragically human, his change of heart or reversal to sanity(?) in the end when he dies defending Frodo and re-affirming his respect for Aragon is poignant. Mortensen's Aragon is a case in point but his humility is understandable in the light of history.  The other characters are rivetting especially Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett.  But I give cred to Elijah Wood for an outstanding performance. His Frodo Baggins is strong enough to survive, human enough to stumble and lose his way time and time again, weak enough to draw on our sympathy but brave enough to keep moving realising his mission is the ultimate goal. 
The characters do it for me in this classic adventure fest!!!10/10",10,3,5,10 July 2003
The Usual Suspects," OH' THAT CHEATED FEELING!!!
","I expected the end,I was so sure after the line up that I had it all figured out.  Keyser Soze couldn't fool me then the twists and turns came and I wasn't so sure and at the end , I guess I was plain mad.  But he was brilliant though I hated him but give him credit, Keyser Soze was brilliant. The Usual Suspects is a good movie simply because of an excellent cast. Each crook is a mastermind in his own right.  This isn't one of my favourites though, much overhyped methinks.  Kudos to Bryan Singer.",7,0,1,18 July 2003
Good Will Hunting," Good!!
","This is a sound satisfactory performance from all involved. For first timers, Damon & Affleck do well but the real chemistry sizzles between a laid back Robin Williams & Damon. Williams returns acting to the old Hollywood style of gestures and emotive expressions and says a lot more with his eyes, demeanour and personality. This is a defining moment for Williams who convincingly breaks from the slapstick comedy gamut to settle into a thoroughly serious role and gives the performance of a lifetime. The scene where he breaks thru Damon's chaotic personality with the mesmerising but calming 'It's not your fault, it's not your fault' just blew me awayI came away feeling enriched by the entire experience, with a lot of admiration for Affleck and Damon but with great respect for Robin Williams. He is indeed an actor's actor. Good Will Hunting delivers soundly. 10/10 Overall!!!!!!!!",10,0,2,11 May 2003
Coyote Ugly," COOL!!!
","A 90's musical/comedy/drama about music ends up being a love story.
When Vi Sanford heads up to New York, her dream is to make it big like so many before her.  She has many demons to fight though,like the fear of the stage like her mother before her used to have,like growing away from her father and winning his respect.  But she displays grit and wisdom in not selling out just to make it.   Along the way, she gets to work in the Coyote Ugly bar, and starts to learn a thing or two about the streets, the hype and the reality.  Love, loss, growing up all drift through in naughty doses.  The scene where she's finally on stage and starts singing in the dark before the super trooper blazes on her is a huge climax.  It just sweeps through you and makes the wait worth it.  Featuring a beautiful score and massive soundtrack. Coyote Ugly is anything but ugly.",Null,0,1,19 October 2003
The Hurricane," A WHIRLWIND PERFORMANCE
","I don't know who Rubin Carter was, never heard of him before the movie but think Denzel gave him life through this movie.  I don't know if he was a criminal or deserved to go to jail or spend the time he did but with the situations being what they were back then, his success might have sparked racist reactions to anything he did. 
No one is a position to judge the real life Carter, we'd have to walk twenty years in his shoes before we do.  He was sent to a reform institute by a racist judge, he paid and paid time and time again for any crimes committed.  Dignity is the only gift we are born with and Carter(portrayed by Denzel) had to fight for his.  Who wouldn't?!!TOP ACTING AS ALWAYS FROM MR WASHINGTON (An ICON!!)5/5",Null,1,5,18 July 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Summery
","This movie was entertainment, light summer entertainment. There wasn't much of a story but the action sequences told stories of their own, 2 skilled, highly paid assassins working for rival organisations, accidentally cross while vying for the same target.Unfortunately they happen to be husband and wife the Smiths who are in a sterile farcical marriage. They discover that they both lied to each other over a period of their six-year marriage and decide to end it, but while trying to take each other out (which they do brutally), they discover that their bosses want them dead or single i.e. 'one must die' They both combine forces to take on the bosses and their minions and it's one explosive fest of bullets, wits, anger and mind-blowing explosions.Pitt & Jolie pull enough chemistry on-screen to generate heat in this scorcher. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat or tuned in totally.Good Summer Blockbuster",6,0,1,5 August 2005
Ice Age," If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead? then doom on you!!!
","ICE AGE is a compelling animation which uses simple imagery, dark humour and quirky characters to pull a masterpiece together.  This is a movie for all ages:the belief that lesser beings should be helped or protected,that those in danger should be looked out for(cos that's what we do in a herd)that silly situations should be laughed off(dinner on a shelf), that you can redeem yourself by not lowering your standards (I don't eat junk food). The thrill of it all is that every situation is humourous(if darkly so), the morality stands out all through; never be surety for a stranger as you'll pay for it.  Which is what Manny & Sid found out with Diego though he developed a change of heart after Manny risked his life to save him. 
My nieces and nephew loved this picture and laughed all through it as did four other adults who accompanied them to see it(We laughed even louder and harder than they did).ICE AGE will definitely leave you with internal global warming(hint).

To Kill a Mockingbird," Simply Beautiful.
","I wanted to be a lawyer after I saw this movie. Gregory Peck was astounding ;now that is acting, letting your face, body language, silences and actions speak the entire gamut.I followed the stories here through three different generations, the older generation Atticus Finch's set; watching him try to be a good example to his children while integrating himself into their lives, teaching them values unconsciously while setting standards and boundaries for discipline is a delight to watch. Miss Crawford and the old lady who was dying and Jem had to visit her, these bring an extended family element.The middle set : Boo Radley, whose eyes and vision is what follows the children round the neighbourhood ; living his dreams through them and bearing their heartaches as well.And the children ; Scout Finch is a most poignant storyteller; she relates the most significant things with colour and life. When they find the wax dolls in trees, the importance they attach to it, the feeling that Boo is watching and when she gets to meet Boo, she isn't at all scared, it's been so long that the anticipation of meeting him turns into respect. We grow with Scout at Atticus' knee, with Calpurnia, with Aunt Alexandra, with Jem & Dill, and finally in that epiphany scene with Boo (when she walks him home), she ages and time stands still and even when she returns to the present, she has become an adult in many ways; love, honour, sacrifice and selflessness all hold new meaning for her. She was never going to see the world through a child's perspective again.Boo was supposed to be scary, I'm thoroughly thrilled to know that it was a very young Robert Duvall.The storyline is simple but gripping, racism & prejudice burn long and slow and it takes the honour and faith of men like Atticus Finch and the sheriff to diffuse this or deal with it. When Boo kills Jem's Attacker Tom Ewell, the sheriff fabricates a story to protect Boo's privacy and the fact that he acted in defence of the children. As Miss Crawford says 'it's a sin to shoot a mockingbird as they sing all day and give us sweet music' there are two mockingbirds; Tom Robinson and Boo Radley who have done nothing but try to co-exist and bring peace to their little world.The language belongs to the era; the settings are stark depicting the harshness, simplicity and 'beauty' of those times. The themes of racism, superiority/inferiority complexes, sacrifice, respect, integrity and honour all resound strongly. It is a lesson in morals but a picture; a signpost for the future!! To Kill A Mockingbird reverberates with hope, while there is injustice, there will be those who believe in justice. Racism may always exist but there also those who believe in free will and equal; opportunities. At times all it takes is the simple voice of a child to remind us who we are.!!10/10",10,7,12,29 June 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," 'A Redemption From Cynicism'
","I caught this movie close to the end just as Morgan Freeman was staring at the beam on the ceiling considering suicide. He plucks up the courage to go out look for a job and try to reintegrate himself into the system but he's been away for the better part of a century. Things have moved on and he's been pegged into that corner of existence known as Shawshank prison.When it ended, I vowed to watch it again and I finally caught it again last year. The message is strong and vibrant, it resonates throughout the movie; HOPE NEVER DIES!! It is our steel, our spine, it's what separates men from beasts. The movie was a warming experience, I have learnt from it that friendship has ties that can survive anything, time, stress, human failings, ANYTHING!! I wanted to walk tall and shout Peace and Love to everyone.The Shawshank Redemption liberated me from the fear of suffering.Morgan Freeman (who is my icon any-day) blows the screen away just like he did in 'Lean On Me'. Unlike 'Lean On Me' however, gentle persuasion and steady encouragement take the place of fiery enthusiasm. Red gives Andy the encouragement he needs to fight his way out of his situation but he teaches him to fight with his mind and heart.Tim Robbins' emotionless Andy is eerie to watch as he drifts languidly with that glint in his eye that tells of wisdom born of suffering. I watched as the innocence faded from his face and he 'grew' his plan. It is ironic that the person who was saved in jail for being spineless and weak, was the one who saved his friend from losing out to the world. When the warden shoots his own brains out, I yelled 'Justice' at the TV screen. The tag-line for me is 'Hope Is A Good Thing' It really is...",10,0,0,13 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," FULFILLING FOR ME
","Singer translates from comic storylines to actual cinematic feel. 
The X-Men actually lived in this movie!!!My eyes blazed along with Jean Grey's, I fell thru that bed with Kitty,and all the tornadoes that Storm called up left me seat gripping and gut twisted. I teleported with Nightcrawler, screamed with Siryn,and heated up with Pyro.  As a die hard X-Men fan, I felt this movie gave actual substance to my heroes.  I won't criticize the sub plots, the intros were worth it for anyone with a brain; figure it out.  A great painter never seeks to explain his vision, he simply invites you to stand in front of the canvas and see for yourself.   Singer has done a marvellous job and it's all I can do to sit back and wait for X3",Null,0,0,9 May 2003
Fantastic Four," Truly Fantastic
","I didn't know what to expect when watching this movie,but it established the origins of the FF in a solid manner.Never seen Gruffudd before but he delivered, Jessica Alba was sweet as a young Sue Storm, her invisibility trip thru the city totally won me (she's a seasoned actress having been around for a while), I loved the force fields and the strain she put herself through when Johnny went supernova. Chris Evans (new face for me) was funny as the Torch but he also came thru when he 'FLAMED ON', Mike Chiklis was the last person I expected to play the Thing, but he was not only entertaining he inspired sympathy or empathy as the underdog. The Thing is quite lovable and it's interesting to see him come to terms with his xter. Alicia being cast against type was totally exceptional and a touch of cinematic genius, The action scenes are expansive, the storyline is simple and down to earth, these aren't superheroes who are afraid to test the waters, these people want to live and be seen as one of us.The actors are young and leave room in their physical aspect for growth and consequently sequels.The Fantastic Four was truly fantastic",8,0,1,29 July 2005
Gladiator," WELL PUT TOGETHER
","Rusell Crowe might shine in this masterpiece but it's not entirely down to him.Gladiator surges along due to precise purposeful directing,powerful scripting, adept casting and a host of filmmaking factors.  Russell simply shines because that's what he has to do.All said his Maximus is one of the most, vibrant figures in film-making history along side Gables' 'Rhett Butler', Yul Bryners''The King Of Siam', Sidney Poitier's 'Sir' in To Sir With Love and Morgan Freemans' 'Red' in The Shawshank Redemption.  
The trials and rise of Maximus and burning quest ultimately lead along a path to glory but his calm burning desire for vengeance sets aside from your pathological killer.  He is a man wronged for no reason and the lives that were taken from must be repaid.  Gladiator rules 10/10",8,0,1,14 November 2003
