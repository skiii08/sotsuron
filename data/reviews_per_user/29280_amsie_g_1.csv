The Avengers," I thought I would love this movie..
","...but I didn't.Maybe I'm getting too old (33), maybe I expected too much, maybe just maybe, this movie was actually rubbish?I feel bad, I really do. Who am I to hate this mega franchise? I thought iron man, hulk and Thor were great. Captain America not so great but nevermind. I took my wife to watch it and she hates these kind of flicks. We were about half way through and I asked her 'Do you want to stay or shall we go?'. I cannot remember a time when I have ever asked her such a question, not even for crappy flick. At the end I asked her what she thought? she loved it! I was bemused - I actually got bored. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies. Back to the future, Brewsters Millions, Shawshank Redemption and Goodfellas are amongst my faves. But this just left me underwhelmed. So I ask the question again... Am I getting old or have I missed something?",Null,6,13,26 October 2012
