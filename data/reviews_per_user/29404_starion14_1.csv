The Blair Witch Project," *barf*
","This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  I wish there were some way I could get back the hour and a half that I spent watching this poor excuse for a movie.  I can't remember being in worse pain then when I was watching this film (and I've been in the hospital quite a few times in my life).  I think the movie studios should have paid *ME* to watch this, and let me tell ya, $8.50 wouldn't cut it.I can't for the life of me understand why people enjoyed this movie.  At all.  I've read scarier Dr. Seuss books.  Honestly.  I'm really amazed at all the hype this movie managed to generate.  Actually, I guess what I find more amazing is that there are apparently *A LOT* of people out there with awful taste in movies.  Oh well.Bottom line: Blair Witch vs. root canal surgery.  I'd take root canal surgery every time.",Null,1,2,9 April 2000
