The King's Speech," Excellent script
","The King's Speech is a lovely movie that is well worth your time. It could have been terribly plodding and dreary, but the writers inject so much wit and humanity into the story that it keeps you interested and entertained. It's possibly the best (the only?) movie made about public speaking,, and about people who are terrified of it. 
Despite being a 'nobody' Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) proves to be the perfect person to treat the stuttering King George (Colin Firth). As an Aussie, super persistent and confident, with an irreverant streak and with decades of experience, Logue is able to deftly analyse George's psychological barriers and figure out hiw to get around them.
Rush is typically brilliant in this role, but he's pipped by Colin Firth, for whom the King is the the role of a lifetime. 
Firth plays him as often whiny and needy. But in the end, unlike his playboy brother Edward (Guy Pearce) he did step up to lead the UK when it needed a steady authority. 
When the King is walking to the microphone to make his last speech, it's like he's walking to the guillotine. Lionel his therapist really seems to care and is not after some reflected glory.
As always, the sign of a good movie is the quality of the supporting cast, and here it's A-grade, including Helena Bonham- Carter as the King's wife, the wonderful Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, and a sincere Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill.",7,0,0,26 December 2017
Whip It," A great movie
","I love this movie because It's full of heart. The world of roller derby itself is very interesting. But Shauna Cross's script is so witty and full of life that even if you don't know much about the sport, you follow the action easily. The cast is outstanding. Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig are two of the classiest actors around, and they obviously love their roles as two key roller derby players - very unconventional, gutsy women. Andrew Wilson, who plays the coach, is fantastic. Basically he's the butt of all their jokes, pretending to be tough when he's really a softy. Of course Ellen Page as the naive newcomer, Bliss, is outstanding. Few female actors get the chance to play such a spirited, smart character who goes on a genuine journey of discovery. And Page nails it. And as her very conservative mother, Marcia Gay Harden is great with a character who is flawed in trying to make Bliss something into something she's not -- a straightlaced debutante - but who is also someone Bliss still loves, and who wants the best for her daughter. Drew Barrymore does a great job both as director and as one of the roller derby team. Above all, even while there's a solid plot and lots of drama, Whip It never fails to entertain and make us laugh. And it tells stories about women, front and centre, which is refreshing. There should be more movies like this one.",8,1,3,4 December 2016
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A genuine classic
","There are many outstanding features in Stephan Elliot's legendary examination of prejudice and triumph relating to Australia's queer community. Firstly, of course, those incredible costumes by Lizzie Gardiner and Tim Chappell - you can't take your eyes off them. The lush colour and attention to detail is astounding. Next, the stunning landscape (although stunning seems an understatement) of outback Australia, with the light and perspectives used to amazing effect in every scene. The acting, with Guy Pearce, Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving in the main roles, is impeccable. All of them inhabit their characters to such an extent that you forget they're acting. Terence Stamp, in particular, struck me as just perfect for his role. His character, an older transsexual, is brittle, yet witty and resilient, and later on shows she is supportive and empathetic of her friends. Guy Pearce gives an astonishing physicality to his role - he is so immersed in his character that he doesn't have to impersonate anyone, his IS the camp, flamboyant muscled up young drag queen. The role when he/she confronts the violent thugs chasing her in Coober Pedy is outstanding - it manages to be funny, disturbing, offensive, shocking and confronting all at once. The film's script is sharp and entertaining, although sometimes there is too much dialogue. Sometimes scenes are more like a play and the actors fall to reciting their lines, albeit with great wit. It's a very Australian film. There are many people who are encountered along the way who accept the three main characters, love them and help them, but also a lot of senseless hostility, and the film lays out those issues effectively. The film also shows how there are many grey areas with the characters, for example Hugo Weaving's character has a wife and child, and is conflicted in many ways in his sexuality. He's still working out who he is. He feels guilty and uncertain. It's a great portrait that the scriptwriters paint in his case. The films is amazingly assured and accomplished. A real landmark of Australian cinema.",8,4,6,15 November 2017
Black Swan," Dancing doesn't make you happy
","A rather intense, manic, over the top look at life inside an elite ballet's production of Swan Lake.
With all the bullying, jealousy, pressure to be perfect and no room to have 'a life', it's not that surprising that lead dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) is going insane.
She's certainly not happy, living with her crazy, suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey) who takes the hysterical Stage Mom role up several notches.
Mom still keeps her jewellery box and cuts her fingernails!
The piece is shot in dark, muted, claustrophobic corridors, studios and apartments and even though ballet as an art is supposed to be beautiful, there ain't much joy in Nina's life.
She's a nervous, flighty but technically perfect dancer, whose main problem is in convincingly trying to portray the coarser black swan twin in Swan Lake as well as she plays the role of the graceful white swan twin.
It's a crisply directed and written movie. The pace moves ahead at a rapid pace but there's not much respite from the doom and gloom.
Thankfully Mila Kunis, as boisterous new dancer Lily, who befriends Nina, provides some light relief.
Not really a movie for sweet ballet fans!
More of a dark indie drama.
I don't know exactly what it's trying to say - maybe that being an artist isn't all it's cracked up to be.",7,1,2,7 September 2019
Changeling," Wonderful film
","As director of this film, Clint Eastwood brings his passion for telling a story and his attention to detail. And it's an amazing true story that doesn't need any unnecessary effects added to it. Through cinematography and direction, the sense of menace and evil are very effectively put across, not just concerning the pedophile who calmly abducts and kills children, but from a corrupt police department that is more concerned about looking good and scoring political points than about the truth. John Malkovich is magnificent as the pastor who befriends the mother of the missing boy, played by Angelina Jolie. His character may be one of those media savvy, loud and crusading religious leaders, but you get a sense his heart is in the right place, and his speaking out, in this case, is effective in pointing out moral wrongs. Jolie is a little too glamorous to play the part of the grieving mother, I feel, but she does bring a certain quiet sorrow and empathy to the role. She is serious and committed to the character.",8,2,3,3 July 2014
The Sound of Music," Leave your cynicism aside and enjoy
","The beautiful music is at the heart of The Sound Of Music. Richard Rodgers' gorgeous and varied melodies, and Oscar Hammerstein's exquisite and witty lyrics don't just dazzle you - they move the story along. Even Eidelweiss, such a simple ballad, is a gem. The Sound Of Music is a wonderful (kind of) true story: a nun, Maria, wins the hearts of a sad, strict widower and his seven children who she is sent to mind as governess. It's a classic look back at the sadness of exile and oppression, the triumph of goodness over evil and the joy that just one woman, Maria, makes in people's lives. As Maria, Julie Andrews has great chemistry with Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The child actors are great. The choreography and the script are both a bit regimented - probably because this was a polished stage show before the movie. Overall, this is one of the classic movie musicals, possibly the best ever.",9,1,1,22 March 2020
Catch Me If You Can," An enjoyable film
","I loved Frank Abagnale's autobiography so I was worried what Steven Spielberg would do with the film, given he's known for giving his subjects the big Hollywood treatment. I was pleasantly surprised - I guess Abagnale's incredible true story suited the big treatment. Leonardo Di Caprio accurately captures Abagnale's immaturity and impulsiveness, disastrously combined with his fierce intelligence. He becomes a master con man living out every fantasy, as a pilot, a lawyer, a teacher, and even a doctor, and manages to swiftly dodge the consequences for years. It's comical, in a way, seeing the sheer audacity and inventiveness of the man. I love the scene where he strides across the airport with the air hostesses in their chic suits. It's funny to see how trusting and gullible companies such as banks and airlines and hotels were in the 1960s, and Frank just exploits it to the hilt. But also, as in the book, we see how terribly sad Abagnale is. In the end he has only his wits to live on, and it can't last if he's going to live a normal life. Things I don't like include how overblown the music score is. I hate it when the music tells you how you're supposed to feel in a scene. I don't like Tom Hanks as the detective -- he's too much of a clown. I love Christopher Walken as Frank's dad, also a bit of a sad character. Also the film does go on a bit long, but then there is a lot of Abagnale's life to squeeze on to the screen.",7,1,3,2 March 2015
Rocketman," Great depiction of an amazing life
","I had reservations about this film - Elton John himself and his husband David Furnish are producers, so I wondered, would it gloss over the tough and less savoury bits? I guess I don't know enough about the real story to say, but it did come across as a genuine and heartfelt yarn. And it's also an amazingly entertaining film - an element that too many biopics forget about. The director, Dexter Fletcher, and the writers take a risk in staging many musical and fantasy scenes, but in the end, they are very effective in telling the story in perhaps a more interesting way than a more conventional, linear film. Taron Egerton is fantastic as Elton. Chiefly, he has the energy and the vulnerability to portray the roller coaster of emotions Elton goes through, while he convincingly pulls off the showman element.
Although Elton is a superlative soul singer, which would be almost impossible to emulate. One of the cores of the film, to me, is the 'love story' of Elton's friendship with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) who is frankly the most stable, rational, constant presence in Elton's life. It's kind of lovely. The second element that stunned me was Elton's abusive parents, Sheila and Stanley. The characters, played with devastating iciness by the under-rated Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh, manage to damage, but not stop, their talented son's rise to fame through their lack of love and the mum Sheila's assertion, when she learns Elton is gay, that he'll probably never be loved by anyone. Her reaction to Elton's struggles with drugs is to ask that he pay her to move far away, so she doesn't have to cope with the terrible newspaper headlines. His Dad, meanwhile, starts a new family and heaps love and affection on his young sons, while not showing any signs he wants Elton in his life. They are two devastating portrayals, and the real life pair are no longer alive to defend themselves. But if true, it makes Elton's success even more well deserved and hard earned.",8,4,7,2 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Not as bad as La La Land, but not great
","I am not a Brad Cooper fan. But I do admire his courage here in playing a musician - and singing - and also directing this movie. And I also admire Lady Gaga, who is best known as a musician, for this major foray into acting. She does well. That said, this is not a great movie. For a big Hollywood production, it wasn't as bad as La La Land. It did have more of a story, and fewer gimmicky set up scenes. I like the idea that Ally (Gaga) is discovered in a completely random way when rock star Cooper stumbles into a gay bar she's performing in. I'm not convinced that, being such a bold cabaret performer, Ally would be terrified when Cooper invites her to perform her song with him on stage at a rock festival. She'd love it! Gaga's song, Shallow, is excellent and deserved the Oscar for best song. Cooper sings it well with her. The rest of the movie is pretty average. I wasn't emotionally engaged with it. It was more a melodrama.",6,1,2,15 May 2019
Argo," Not good enough
","The great production design is the best thing about this disappointing movie, which falls well short of expectations. The emotion is so muted it's non-existent. No one seems to show fear. On most actors' faces, it looks like passing indigestion. These are people facing imminent death!! The poetic licence taken with the real events is very disappointing. Why ignore the fact the Canadians were the ones who in real life sheltered the escaped US embassy staff? It's wrong. The plot, obviously, is thrilling, so why does the script plod so much? For once, the soundtrack is not intrusive enough, it doesn't help build tension. The dialogue between the fugitives is mostly flimsy. Their characters aren't clear. John Goodman is a great presence as the Hollywood special effects man. The Hollywood producer is great, too. Ben Affleck doesn't have enough gravitas as the CIA hero who goes undercover as a movie producer in Iran. He must have been too tired to think about acting. The visual look of the film is one positive - the clothes, hair styles and furniture are all beautifully restrained and look authentic.",5,3,4,18 March 2015
The Notebook," Not as bad as it could have been
","I stumbled on this movie on TV late at night and thought: 'Oh, no, this looks really cheesy.' But I kept watching (there wasn't much else on) and I think the acting really elevated this to something meaningful. Gena Rowlands, as Allie, the elderly, southern belle with dementia, is a real standout in her role: one minute sharp and wise, the next minute not recognising her own children. It's a really meaty role and Rowlands really runs with it. Rachel McAdams, also, throws everything into her role as the younger Allie, who must choose between two lovers -- whether to follow her heart or her head. It's a role that, under a lesser actor, could have been really pedestrian. But McAdams reacts and acts, rather than just reciting the lines and looking pretty. The scenes are sharply edited and the music isn't too overwhelming. The scenery is gorgeous and the costumes beautiful. Apart from the raunchy love scene, it's quite an old fashioned movie. Overall, it's good entertainment, and I even found myself bringing out the tissues at the end.",7,0,1,17 August 2013
Pirate Radio," A lot of fun
","The first time I saw this film I didn't like it. Supposedly a true story about a rebel rock radio station based on a ship, it seemed to have too much of that 'cool guys versus the establishment' cliché. Plus, I thought writer-director Richard Curtis had gone over the top with the feel-good vibe, like a hyperactive puppy. But on second viewing, I saw how much fun every single actor was having in their role. Working at a radio station on the boat looked like when you went to school camp - an exciting place where anything could happen. We see the place through the eyes of a newcomer - a young man who meets all the DJs, who range from nerdy weirdos to cuddly eccentrics to prickly bastards. All men except the lesbian cook. Interesting actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Rhys Darby attack their mad DJ roles with gusto. Special mention to Rhys Ifans, who chews up the screen as the enigmatic, inexplicable chick magnet DJ Gavin, who also has a funny rivalry with Hoffman's expansive Yank DJ character, The Count. Irish actor Chris O'Dowd plays himself, as usual, but as usual he is appealing. And you can't argue with the music. The sheer number of fantastic songs makes you realise how amazing the endless line of hits was in the 1960s. I love how the film also shows listeners all over the UK tuning in to Radio Caroline, and dancing along. It shows that the station wasn't just a hippie throwaway. It gave people joy and took them away from their sometimes dull lives. So just sit back and enjoy this weird, wonderful and very nutty film.",7,1,1,27 March 2015
Spotlight," Solid film, but lacks tension
","The acting is great in this well-executed account of the Boston Globe's award winning expose of the Catholic church's cover-up of widespread sexual abuse. But the film is a bit anaemic. The cinematography is seemingly deliberately drab and doesn't show much imagination. The film shows how important it is that journalists are given the time to make contacts, build trust and gather evidence. Also, I guess, how their work can be banal and far from glamorous and requires persistence in the face of rejection. The film is almost slavish in not depicting the journalists as heroes -- in fact several times they are asked by victims and contacts why they overlooked obvious evidence of rampant pedophilia many times in the past. The acting is good -- the film is well cast, with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci all possessing plenty of restrained intelligence. As editor Marty Baron, Liev Schreiber is so laidback he's almost comatose, but it does show that not all editors are fiery extroverts. It would have been improper, given the subject matter, if the film had have been too lively and dramatic, but drama needs tension, and in the script, too often dilemmas resolve themselves quickly and neatly. It's not an outstanding film, but quite a good one, and its themes, such as the need to have courage to expose painful truths, are worth portraying.",7,1,2,12 February 2016
Midnight in Paris," Lovely journey
","Just like Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), this is one of Woody Allen's most fun and entertaining movies, although this one possibly has more depth if you're looking for that. A successful writer called Gil (Owen Wilson) is drawing apart from his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) with different outlooks on life. They've come to Paris on holiday with her parents but she spends all her time shopping and eating with friends she runs into. Gil wanders the city at night, and on one of his jaunts is picked up by a vintage car that propels him into the 1920s. He finds himself in clubs with all his artistic heroes: Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso and Cole Porter. He also falls in love with Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Picasso's mistress, who actually pines to be back in the Belle Epoque turn of the century, and not the 1920s. The film is very firmly a comedy but it has something to say about nostalgia, wishing to be somewhere you're not, and choosing your own path. But like Vicky Cristina Barcelona, the film also works well as light entertainment. It looks and sounds great and like most Woody Allen films, is made with great affection.",9,0,0,14 March 2015
Once," I didn't like it
","I really wanted to like this film. I feel guilty for not liking it. But it felt over-rated to me. I like how its scenes and dialogue and locations are ultra realistic. It was obviously filmed on a very low budget, in that cold Irish weather. I like how The Guy and The Girl are struggling musicians. But I can't help compare Once to The Commitments. The latter was spirited, smart and sarcastic, and about 5 times better than Once. Once is very earnest and serious - where is that famous Irish humour? Its music is nowhere near as good as The Commitments, and its script and plot is rather dull. To me, there is no sense of tension or passion. I didn't find the songs tuneful and I didn't like the lead guy's voice when he was shouting. It is far more focused on the songs than the story or romance, so it seems more like a band documentary than a romantic film. It's a musos' film. It's far more focused on the guy's feelings than the girl's. Sorry but I won't be watching Once more than once.",5,2,3,10 October 2015
"I, Tonya"," I loved this movie
","This movie makes a good case for a re-evaluation of top figure skater Tonya Harding, who was punished severely, and crucified in the media, for being associated with the infamous bashing of rival Nancy Kerrigan. I went into this movie expecting to be confused about who did what, and expecting that Harding would come out looking bad. Instead, writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie offer us a mock documentary that, while funny in highlighting the redneck nature of the participants, gives a very clear account of what happened, based on actual interviews with them. And Harding, despite her many faults, emerges as a kind of hero. Not least because she rose from working class hillbilly who was so poor she had to make her own costumes, to US Olympic representative, with equal parts enormous talent, drive and hard work. We forget just how good she was - nailing triple axels when no one else would even attempt them. When she blasts the judges to their faces for marking her down for being the 'wrong kind of girl', i.e. not sweet or middle class enough to win, she is convincing in her argument. Also she had to contend with a monster of a mother, LaVona (beautifully played by Allison Janney) who believes praise and love of her daughter are weaknesses. Yeah, maybe LaVona's toughness did drive Tonya to win, but at what cost? Then Harding falls for the initially sweet and supportive Jeff (Sebastian Stan), who turns out to be a violent thug, bashing and even shooting her. If Harding knew what was good for her, she would have dropped him like a hot potato, but unfortunately he was her one source of support. And she needed support. The real villain emerges as Jeff's friend Shawn (masterfully played by Paul Walter Hauser), who initially comes across as a harmless loser, but whose delusions of grandeur lead him to translate Jeff's casual talk about sending death threats to Kerrigan, into ordering flunkies to carry out the eventual bashing of Kerrigan in the leg while at training. 
According to the movie, Harding may have known about the talk of death threats but didn't know about the plot to bash Kerrigan. Harding was also accused of not reporting what she learned about incident after it had happened.
You get the sense that Harding was punished enough. She was banned from skating for life - although it was her reason for being. Actor Margot Robbie is way, way too tall and glamorous to play the stocky, working class Harding. But Robbie does give the role an appropriately manic energy, and the skating scenes are very convincing, even if a stand-in must have done most of the difficult bits.
Harding later gets into professional boxing, which seems very appropriate - she was a fighter from way back. At the end of the movie, I was cheering for Harding, and I was glad from the credits to see she seems to have found some happiness in later life.",8,2,3,24 May 2018
Molly's Game," Quite a good movie
","Aaron Sorkin's snappy script and his assured direction make for an interesting tale about a young woman's foray into the tough, risky world of elite high stakes poker. I know nothing about poker, and am not interested in it, but Sorkin keeps you interested through multiple characters, camera angles and graphics. Often, narration in a movie can be bad, but it works here, as Molly (Jessica Chastain) reminisces back in time about how she became a wealthy hostess, and what went wrong, leading to her being charged in an FBI swoop on gambling houses.
As her lawyer, Idris Alba is great - trying to get to the truth beyond her tales of her past.
Woven through the main plot is Molly's troubled relationship with her Dad - when she was a rising skiing star, he was harsh and demanding of Molly.
Kevin Costner is great as the Dad.
They do find a bit of healing at the end. 
Molly seems to get off lightly, considering she did some questionable things - including hosting players linked to the mafia and running illegal gambling games. And watching gambling addicts play well beyond any sensible amount and lose obscene amounts of money. .
I doubt she was really as naive as she is portrayed in the movie. Also, for legal reasons, there would be many parts of Molly's story that we don't have access to. 
As well as drugs, Molly became kind of addicted to gambling herself - both to the money she made, and also the intoxicating power of directing elaborate poker nights, and socialising with, and manipulating the rarefied circles of super rich businessmen who played cards for cash. 
When she was pushed out of the LA scene, she moved to New York and flourished, but also attracted mafia thugs. 
Her life struck me as very hollow and cold. I guess she does realise this. It would be interesting to see what she did next.",7,0,2,10 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Could have been much better
","BlackkKlansman has a great cast, wonderful sets and costumes and raises some important social issues.
It's a shame that the script is so undeveloped. Many of the scenes go on way too long, or don't have much purpose, and there is too much dialogue. Generally the film isn't entertaining enough - too much talk and not enough action. Which is a pity, because the plot is great - a black police detective Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan by phone, and sends a Jewish fellow detective, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to go undercover to Klan meetings, under Stallworth's name. Washington is fantastic - intelligent, laidback, bold and sensitive. As is Driver, who must act like a white supremicist as the Klan grill him about his views on blacks and Jews. As the black student leader Patrice, Laura Harrier is fabulous, although often she's more the love interest, and her love affair with Stallworth seems more a series of cute scenes that don't amount to much. The film's ending is confusing, and finally cute, and isn't very smooth.
Stallworth deserves more recognition for his courage - there's a great scene where he applies to be his city's first black police officer, and the film does portray some of the immense danger of that, when even some of his workmates were hostile to him, and he had to straddle his black social life and the white police culture. I guess the filmmakers at least had a go at covering some of the myriad issues relating to racism in America. But if they had taken more time, they could have made a really good film.",6,2,6,30 August 2018
Begin Again," Not bad, but not great
","I like the acting in this movie -- everyone's quite sweet and sincere. There are some great scenes. Maybe the best thing about the film is that it doesn't go for the traditional rom-com ending. That was a bit of a surprise. However apart from that, the plot is quite predictable. Talented songwriter cum musician is dumped by her high profile boyfriend, meets new Svengali who's having a nervous breakdown himself, and they get together and make beautiful (platonic) music. Svengali heals rift with his ex-wife and troubled teenage daughter while miraculously curing his own alcohol problem. Girl finds solace with overweight and therefore platonic male friend who is prepared to do everything for her, and also provide comic relief. I guess I was in a cynical mood when I saw this film. It really is an inoffensive, light hearted picture, but it won't challenge you much.",7,3,6,17 August 2014
The Book Thief," Not bad
","This film was ultimately unsatisfying, although it did have a few things going for it. Despite the strange, fake German accents, Emily Watson, Geoffrey Rush and the other actors played their roles with conviction. The cinematography was good, and it was an interesting and unusual perspective for a Hollywood film to focus on a small German village during World War II being bombed by the Allies -- with characters who are mostly ordinary Germans and not evil Nazis. My main criticism is that not much happens in the movie. There isn't much plot. A girl comes to the village to stay with foster parents. And stays there. Not very exciting. The child actor playing the boy she befriends, Rudy, is outstanding in every scene he's in. One puzzle is: towards the end he's drafted in some way (into the Army?) and he almost runs away, but nothing becomes of his supposed drafting. He just sticks around. I thought the girl playing Liesl was miscast. To me, she wasn't animated enough. It was a part that demanded a lot of emotion, but she mainly looked bewildered, and focused on saying her lines. It may have been how the lines were written. I didn't like the narration by the character of Death. I thought it was too twee, and didn't add anything to the the film. I thought the ending was moving, and, of course, horrific.",6,2,9,11 January 2014
Blades of Glory," Fantastic fun
","A beautifully acted and directed film that will be hilarious to anyone who has ever watched an Olympic ice dancing competition. One wonders whether it's far from the truth! Will Ferrell is perfect as the hyper-egotistical superstar Chazz Michael Michaels who, rather predictably for a Ferrell film, has a spectacular fall from grace. He's barred from skating for life, for fighting with rival Jimmy McIlroy (Jon Heder), who is also banned. But McIlroy's nutty stalker, Hector (Nick Swardson) finds a loophole, in that Chazz and Jimmy could try becoming a male- male dancing pair. Almost stealing the show are Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as the Van Waldenberg siblings, the hysterically nasty, incestuous rivals to Chazz and Jimmy. They blackmail their Cinderella-style, sweet younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer) to do all sorts of evil things to Jimmy and Chazz, but Katie instead falls awkwardly in love with Jimmy. Poehler and Arnett are obviously loving their dastardly roles and I don't know how Ferrell and Heder were able to keep straight faces through all of their own ridiculously silly dialogue and routines. All in all, a very good movie.",8,1,3,12 April 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Could have been much better
","The camera loves Frances McDormand, and she gives a riveting performance as the angry, very stubborn and half crazy Mildred Hayes. Many of the things she does in trying to bait the police into reopen her daughter's murder case are almost understandable, if a little mad. But she later crosses the line morally and legally. Like drilling her dentist's finger. And destroying the police station. And yet she isn't arrested. Why not? Similarly, Sam Rockwell's police character is clearly insane, committing all sorts of crimes, and yet he goes largely unpunished, because it suits the plot. The change in his character he undergoes later is completely unbelievable. He's been Mildred's evil nemesis, and now he's her friend? The ending is quite underwhelming.
I found the nasty comments about the dwarf character, played by Peter Dinklage, offensive. The characters make joke after joke about how unattractive and freakish he is. In the 21st century, aren't we past being that nasty?
I guess they were trying to be daring but no, it was just mean.
The scenery in the film was lovely and the direction was good. Writer and director Martin McDonagh is clearly talented. It's just that he seems to rely on swearing and unnecessary violence to make an impact.
Which is just lazy.
I didn't hate this movie. But it needed much more work before it was made. Instead it's gone for, 'let's throw in a lot of the F word and people getting shot and punched, and people will love it.'
But it's no substitute for a great script,",6,3,7,9 March 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Good film
","I like this film a lot. To me, it's quite an old fashioned film, like a backstage drama of old Hollywood. As usual Meryl Streep nails the lead role as Miranda the editor of Runway. She is the heart and soul of the film. I feel that Anne Hathaway is all wrong as Andy, the wide-eyed personal assistant. While Hathaway looks great and tries hard, I don't think she's subtle enough here. I think the role would have suited someone new, and less of a superstar. Emily Blunt is very funny in her role as Miranda's more senior, snootier PA, but she does overdo the expressions a little. Stanley Tucci, as the magazine's art director, is wonderful as usual, very likable, however some of his lines are too deep and meaningful, conveying the all important moral Message. I thought the ending was way too candy-coated, but it's not the worst I've seen.",7,0,1,15 June 2013
Lion," Good, but could have been great
","The gorgeous cinematography in India, and the astonishingly natural performance of little Sunny Pawar as the lost child Saroo, are worth the price of admission to Lion. As others have said here, the second half of the film, set in Australia, is a let-down. It's almost like another film. In India, Priyanka Bose is fantastic playing Saroo's desperately poor yet very loving and dignified mother, Kamla. And special mention to Abhishek Barate, as Saroo's much loved big brother Guddu, who does his best to work, with Saroo, to scrounge coal from trains to buy food for their family. Guddu might be a thief and a hustler, but he's so loving and affectionate. Barate brings a lot of heart to his scenes and has great chemistry with the child. The scenes where Saroo gets lost, alone, on a cross country train and later in the streets of Calcutta, are beautifully shot, and not excessive in scripting or soundtrack. The child Saroo is not overly cute or streetwise; but he has just enough luck and instinct to survive - I love the scene where he sneaks in to an outdoor shrine at night and steals some food offerings (after making the prayer sign) while everyone is sleeping. When he arrives in Tasmania and meets his new adoptive parents, the Brierleys, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) I got the feeling they had no idea what Saroo had gone through, which they couldn't have. And the Brierleys' second adopted son, also an Indian orphan, is even more traumatised, although we never find out what his story is. But once we switch to the adult Saroo, the movie almost comes to a halt in its pacing. Dev Patel is quite good as adult Saroo, (although to me he doesn't resemble the boy Saroo), and his Australian accent is great. The trouble, I think, is the script, which is overly angsty, at the expense of advancing the plot. For Saroo to find an obscure village in India, using just his childhood memories and Google Earth, is a thrilling idea, but it's not well portrayed in the movie. For too many scenes, Saroo simply surfs the online maps, or moves pins around a paper map, but mostly he gets angry and frustrated and morose in his flat. And then one day, as though guided by a supernatural force, his computer mouse is directed to an obscure region of India, and in a few seconds, he's found his family home. I find this unbelievable. Maybe in real life he discovered things bit by bit, and that was impossible to portray on film? The search could have been portrayed in a more diverse way. Didn't he ask around at the orphanage he was brought to as a child? Weren't there some language and cultural clues he could have asked people about? Even the food. Couldn't he have brainstormed with his Indian student friends in Melbourne? Instead, Saroo is portrayed as working alone, and as mostly looking for the water tower that as a child he saw next to a railway station. But as a friend points out, there are many water towers in India near railway stations. Possibly thousands? The character of Saroo's love interest, Lucy (Rooney Mara), comes across as unnecessary and her scenes with Saroo are far too uninteresting. Lion is not a love story - it's the story of a lost child. Ditto Nicole Kidman's scenes. She's not bad, but she's not the focus of the film and she gets too much screen time. So to me, it's a respectable film, but falls short of excellent.",7,27,39,11 February 2017
Incendies," Great film
","One achievement of this excellent film is that it makes you think about war. It makes you think that many people who migrate to the West have complicated personal stories that influence their lives today. And that what we see on the TV news is a woefully inadequate representation of the actual human impact of war. The intelligent woman at the centre of the film had the bad luck to have been born into a brutal, inhuman time in history, even into a brutal family, and she tries her best to survive. You've got to empathise with her on some level. The film has many twists and turns in its plot, and even as I left the cinema I wasn't sure I'd understood which side she was on at a particular time and why she responded as she did. It made me want to know more about Lebanese history. It's a beautifully made film and well recommended.",9,3,7,10 March 2013
10 Things I Hate About You," Newsflash: an intelligent teen movie
","Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger elevate what could have been just another high school movie to something really interesting. Stiles' character is not just a bitter shrew: with some tough life experiences -- her mother leaving, a horrible previous boyfriend -- she has reason to be. Ledger's character, as the new boy in town, with nothing to lose, takes outrageous risks and is sneaky in his manipulation of his new classmates, but later shows a very tender side in trying to woo the Stiles character and not taking advantage of her. One scene I didn't like was Stiles' recitation of the poem at the end; it was too self-conscious and weepy and didn't gel with her earlier snappy, confident character. But overall, this is a beautifully acted and directed film. A great teen film, and it will make you smile.",8,1,1,3 September 2013
Rush," Pretty good entertainment
","Chris Hemsworth, playing playboy British 1970s Formula One driver James Hunt, is the poster boy for this film and sure, he is charismatic and really takes his role well. But the real star is Daniel Bruhl, who has the meatiest role as the forthright, stubborn, super-confident, ultra cool rival Austrian driver Niki Lauda. Director Ron Howard has a tough task, balancing the need to satisfy motor sport fans' need to see all that sweaty racing up on the big screen. But Howard also tries to portray real life events and people in a faithful and meaningful way, while keeping the scenes coming at a cracking pace. And he does a great job. The script is excellent. Apparently the writer dined with Lauda 30 times, and won his trust, and so the movie is filled with little details that make the characters seem human, as opposed to the two dimension, superhuman idols they could have been. It's really interesting to realise that Hunt and Lauda both rebelled against their families, and both had an almost insane desire to win. And the film also explores, very well, the extent to which both of them were willing to ignore the normal warning signs of extreme danger to their lives in exchange for fame and fortune. Hunt did it in driving in extremely wet conditions in the Japanese Grand Prix, and Lauda did it in the German track where he crashes and almost dies, and then, during his comeback, when he ignores the pain from his burn scars to get back into racing again. But as the film makes very obvious, to drive Formula One in the 1970s was very much to risk death. Everyone accepted it, and on any given day, either your number might come up and you die, or you win the race and get international praise and a big payment.",7,0,0,20 January 2016
Notting Hill," Not bad but too long
","I love screenwriter Richard Curtis's affectionate way of creating characters, and his witty scripts. Julia Roberts gets good directing support here, and puts in her best role since My Best Friend's Wedding. Unlike that movie, when her character was quite dark, here she is very much playing herself -- a rich movie star on vacation, albeit a bit down in the dumps at first. She must have found it interesting virtually playing someone in her own real life world -- doing press interviews, dodging the paparazzi, trying to have a personal life and making wry comments about plastic surgery and obnoxious co-stars. Curtis puts in interesting lines for her (and presumably Roberts didn't object) for her character, such as wryly stating she's earning $15 million for one film, which is very bold, but quite accurate for someone like Roberts. Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but hey, it is quite an attractive character, and he is believable as a book shop owner. As usual for Curtis, the supporting cast are not just bland faces -- they're real characters with their own good and bad points. However Curtis does tend to make them all a bit too lovable and winsome and kooky. But it is a comedy. I loved Grant's flatmate, the skinny Welsh eccentric. All in all, a very likable film. The big complaint I had was, it was too long. It was 'boy gets girl, then loses, then wins, then loses...' when it should have wound up in half the time.",7,0,1,29 January 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," This is a fantastic biopic
","I had low expectations of this movie. What could it possibly have to say that was new about Queen? Purists have criticised how it's not perfectly historically correct. But I found it very entertaining, and crisply directed, written and edited and with impeccable costume and set design.
The songs are beautifully slotted in to the story, either in the studio, being composed at home, or in live performance.
The writers follow the band from when they were formed in 1970 till 1985 when they performed at Live Aid. They somehow effectively choose what to leave in and what to leave out in Queen's sprawling history. The story flows well, although that means not always slavishly following what happened in real life. So what? It's not a documentary.
And what about the casting? Whoever was in charge of that should get a medal. The actors playing band members Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are so eerily similar in looks, voices and demeanour that you'd swear it actually was them.
But the actors do actually act their roles and don't rely on their looks to carry the film.
As lead singer Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek isn't an exact likeness. But Mercury was such an unusual person that that would be a hard ask. Instead, Malek does an excellent job in portraying Mercury's quiet determination to get into the band Queen, and to get his musical ideas taken up, no matter how weird they may seem at first, such as Bohemian Rhapsody.
I love the scene where he boldly approaches May and Taylor about becoming lead singer. Even though Mercury is quite shy and modest, he rustles up enough courage to sing to them. And he gets up on stage, can't use the microphone properly, but belts out the songs beautifully.
And the band are such an affectionate, respectful and tight unit that they generally support one another, although there are tiffs, such as over Another One Bites the Dust because some members don't like disco.
I love the scene where their new manager, John Reid, asks what makes Queen so special over other bands, and they point out that they're a group of misfits, whose audience are also outsiders. It's later pointed out that Freddie was an Indian Zoroastrian baggage handler from Zanzibar, Brian was an astrophysics student, Roger was a dental student and John Deacon was an electrical engineer. All geeks who were willing to try different styles of music, and who somehow stuck together for more than 20 years.
If there's a villain, it's Mercury's personal assistant, Paul, who (according to the band's version, that's taken up in the movie) kept Freddie in a partying lifestyle away from his friends and family, and who ultimately 'outs' Mercury as promiscuous and gay to the media. The latter did actually happen, albeit in newspaper interviews, not TV, and Malek probably doesn't portray quite enough how distressing this must have been for Mercury. Instead, Malek just watches, in total shock.
The Live Aid performance is spectacularly good. The directors try and convey how immersively fantastic it must have been to be in that incredible crowd, singing along to all the lyrics, and clapping and doing the movies to songs like Radio Ga Ga and We Will Rock You.
The movie is quite prudish with no drugs and no sex scenes - it just shows Freddie kissing a man, and going to gay discos, and wearing leather.
Malek doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Lucy Boynton, who plays Mercury's fiancee, Mary Austin. Austin doesn't get much character development, apart from that she works at Biba dress shop and her father is deaf. But I think it was well potrayed how Mercury gradually becomes aware of his attraction to men, tries to ignore and suppress it, then gradually walks towards it. I love the scene where Mercury tracks down a gay acquaintance, Jim Hutton, who years ago had made an impression on Mercury, but knew Mercury wasn't ready for a gay relationship.
Overall, this is a very good movie.",8,2,3,7 December 2018
Grease," Grease is great
","My high school drama teacher pointed out something that a lot of this viewers don't get -- it's a satire! People who hate Grease actually think it's supposed to be a true reflection of early 1960s America, but it's a comedy, a spoof, and it's meant to be fun entertainment. The songs are the best thing, from the pounding opening song, Grease, to the lovely Travolta showpiece ballad, Sandy to the dance spectacular, Hand Jive. There are quite a few silly bits, such as Jan singing the toothbrush song and most of Frenchy's dialogue, but you've got to remember that this is a movie about teenagers, for teenagers, although most of the cast were aged in their 20s and 30s. Highlights for me included Beauty School Dropout by Frankie Avalon, There are Worse Things I Could Do by Stockard Channing and Hopelessly Devoted to You by Olivia Newton-John. Grease was a musical we did at my high school, and it'sjust a quality production that's hugely enjoyable.",8,1,2,15 April 2013
Cast Away," Very good film
","For a big Hollywood film, this is good. As ambitious Fed Ex worker Chuck Noland, whose plane crashes into the Pacific and who washes up alone on a deserted island, Tom Hanks is great. The cinematography by Don Burgess is lovely. Director Robert Zemeckis keeps a tight pace and engages the viewer constantly, despite just one character, little dialogue and one location. The plane crash is shot brilliantly - just as you'd imagine it would be like. One minute you're doing something trivial, the next, the plane is diving towards the ocean. You feel like you're inside the plane, and you can see Chuck thinking, this it it. The film has a lot to say about how consumerist and shallow we are, and how utterly work obsessed and ignorant of what really matters Chuck is before the accident. On the island, he proves to be both incredibly vulnerable and incredibly resilient, as he learns to feed himself, find shelter, and even create an imaginary friend - Wilson the volleyball. It's to the credit of Hanks and Zemeckis that the volleyball Wilson -- yes, an inanimate object - - almost seems human at times. On second viewing, I understood the ending. I love the final scene. But most of the coming back scenes go on for way too long. Hanks and Helen Hunt don't have much chemistry. Maybe the situation of Chuck's resurrection after being dead is just too hard to act out. I like how Zemeckis is very serious about what a tragedy, what a loss his four years without human interaction have been. And he depicts well just how harsh, unforgiving and godless Chuck's life as a castaway is, The choice Chuck makes to leave the island is rightly seen as a momentous one. If he stayed, he could have continued to eke out a living, but it was a pretty paltry existence, with a poor chance of ever being rescued. By building a raft and paddling out into the ocean, he risks death, but also gains a greater chance for salvation. The most effective feeling the film evoked in me is 'what would I do in the same situation?' So it's a film with both empathy and sympathy for the enormous bad luck that befalls Chuck.",7,0,0,1 July 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," A solid film
","This film isn't brilliant but has lots to recommend it. I like how it's about deeply flawed people, trying their best to succeed in life with the few resources they have. I like how the central character Pat is portrayed as mentally ill but as being still human and worth rooting for. Not just the stereotypical loony. I like how Jennifer Lawrence's character is not just very vulnerable, but able to be very assertive in stating that Pat must reciprocate if he's going to be with her. I like how the film dares to portray suburban life, with the family's obsession with football. I like how Pat's father (Robert De Niro) is also deeply flawed -- he isn't exactly a criminal but he's a bit shonky in how he earns his money -- but he's still likable and a loving father. I liked how the film shows a little hobby like dancing can give meaning to people's lives. And it's so great that in the end, the dance performance was a long way from perfect, but it was funny, and touching.",7,0,2,24 February 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Pretty good
","Fans of gross out movies will find plenty of laughs here, but ultimately this film does have a lot of heart and substance. One of the big jokes is that although 40yo virgin Andy (Steve Carell) is supposedly the socially inept one, all his friends who are advising him have disastrous love lives and don't know what they're talking about. The movie does poke a lot of fun at Andy as a nerd and a prude but it does have empathy that he's been traumatised by too many bad experiences and has given up on love. But one piece of good advice he does get is to take a few risks. Enter Trish, the saleswoman who works near Steve. She's played with great energy and wit by Catherine Keener. She is perfect for this role. Trish is a single mother of three girls does her best and makes mistakes, but does put herself out in the world and helps Andy get over his many problems. The supporting cast includes the hilarious Jane Lynch as Andy's blunt boss at the electrical store who can generate laughs just with a facial expression. As Andy's friends, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd's characters are all sleazy towards women at times, which jarred with me. Maybe the filmmakers were just portraying how clueless and inappropriate they are. As hopeless dates for Andy (one a drunk driver and the other a ditsy sex maniac), Lesley Mann and Elizabeth Banks contribute memorable cameos. The movie sometimes descends to smut - do we really need all those porn and toilet scenes? - but overall it's an entertaining and well meaning film. And the final scene is a real joy!",8,0,0,19 April 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Great movie
","This movie has got a lot going for it. In Ron Woodroof we have the classic anti-hero -- an arrogant, hard-drinking, womanising electrician who has his entire world overturned when he is diagnosed with HIV. Instead of lying down and dying, he resolves to try to live as long as he can by finding the latest experimental drugs, forms a club to distribute them to others and becomes an unlikely activist against big pharma and the government. Matthew McConaughey is great as Ron -- he has just the right degree of swagger and determination. He doesn't go over the top. Ron never comes across as a saint -- he's got many faults and he constantly makes mistakes but somewhere in there is a good heart. Jared Leto, however trumps him in the role of the transsexual Rayon. Wily, steely yet at times vulnerable, Rayon is a great partner in crime and there are some great scenes, such as when Rayon is touched that Ron sticks up for her in the supermarket when they comes across a bigoted friend from Ron's pre-AIDS days. I love how the period detail such as music, hair and clothes aren't over-done. I love how the movie doesn't go too much for the schmaltzy, meaning of life scenes. To me it's about a quiet but awesome kind of heroism. Ron is someone who wakes up one day and is told he has 30 days to live. He has no one to support him and a very bleak future but he picks himself up and does something about it. I felt the movie was let down a little by a weakly written doctor character played by Jennifer Garner, who has little to do except frown and look worried.",8,2,2,15 February 2014
Yesterday," Perfectly pleasant, but nothing special
","I am a fan of writer Richard Curtis, but the movies of his I've loved (Pirate Radio, Love Actually) are rooted in (albeit kooky) reality - the first based on a true story, and the second a series of realistic love stories.
This time, Curtis goes for fantasy - an unsuccessful musician, Jack (Himesh Patel) wakes up from a road accident to discover that no one has heard of The Beatles. So he starts to perform and record all their songs, and becomes a massive star.
It's a cute idea, but what's the point? I suppose it does show how beautiful The Beatles songs were. It's a love letter to the Beatles. There are lots of songs penned by Paul McCartney, one of just two Beatles who are still alive.
But for me the movie, while well made, is too light and cute. Patel at least is quite a curmudgeon and does have some depth as a man not knowing how to commit to his possible girlfriend Elly (Lily Jones). He also feels massive guilt at stealing songs he didn't write, and comes to realise that the corporate side of the music business can be terrible.
Ed Sheeran, who plays himself, is basically there as a novelty but he does OK. Jones is portrayed as a pretty love interest, and as a character doesn't develop much. Comedian Kate McKinnon tries hard (and obviously has fun) as Jack's soulless, rude, money-hungry US agent, who I guess at least is honest about what her intentions are.
It's not a bad or offensive movie. The cinematography is nice and colourful. It's just not a great movie.",6,0,3,29 June 2019
The Commitments," A wonderful film
","One of Alan Parker's strengths is capturing young unknown actors performing music. Another is portraying everyday people's stories in an exciting way. And I guess, because they're not big-time actors, the acting in roles in The Commitments has an unforced, fresh appeal. Dublin's grey tones and the locals' dry wit is used to great effect - for example, a drab train is used as an exciting vehicle, for the soul song Destination Anywhere. Parker is good at trusting that the grittiness of each location, be it a shopping mall or a suburban back yard or a chip van, can be lyrical - many Hollywood directors would have to glam it up, and create something artificial. He also is not afraid to show how terribly people can stuff up their own opportunities. Here is an immensely talented and energetic group of young people, yet they throw it away because they can't get along. There is no cute ending, and I really like that. For me the spirit of this film is summed up by the veteran muso character Johnny Murphy's assurance to Jimmy Rabbite towards the end of the film, after the blues band Jimmy founded, The Commitments, has fallen apart due to in-fighting. 'You raised their expectations of life!' says Johnny. He's saying that Jimmy's mad dream - to create a smash hit soul music band from a ragtag band of poor Dubliners - was worth pursuing, even though it failed. Young people - who otherwise would have gone on to be buskers, or bus drivers or be unemployed - now have a whole other world opened up for them. It sounds corny, but that's what music can do. Or if not music, then someone who gets young people involve in a big project, that allows their individual talents to shine.",9,0,0,22 November 2017
Mamma Mia!," Not bad entertainment
","People who hate musicals will loathe Mamma Mia. It's cheesy, its characters burst into overblown ABBA songs for no reason and the acting is as hammy as the script. It is a strange beast -- a plot about a wedding on a Greek Island, built around about 30 ABBA anthems. Meryl Streep, as the bride's mother, goes right over the top, and belts out those songs while determined to keep it light and breezy, as do Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as her best friends. Sometimes the jolly dialogue between the trio, not to mention the dancing, gets a little too forced. As the bride's possible fathers, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth enjoy themselves immensely, camping it up, and they are all very likable actors. As the bride Sophie, Amanda Seyfried is a little wide eyed and angelic but she does fairly well in what is a pretty frivolous role. The Greek island location is gorgeous and ABBA fans will just love the songs being given a lush airing. A highlight for me is the scene when Sophie is led up to the chapel on a donkey, and Streep sings The Winner Takes It All. Also Brosnan singing SOS and I Do I Do I Do. Sure, Brosnan isn't much of a singer. But it's touching that here is James Bond trying to be a musical star. And he can laugh at himself. Let's face it, the renditions of many of the popular ABBA songs can never match Agnetha and Anni-Frid's original renditions (Chiquitita, for example). But I like how some of the lesser known ABBA songs are sung. Amanda Seyfriend and her three possible Dads do a lovely version of Our Last Summer while strumming guitars and on a yacht, and Meryl Streep gives genuine emotion to Slipping Through My Fingers, about a mother watching her daughter grow up. If I was home sick for a day and this movie came on the TV, I wouldn't change the channel.",7,0,0,14 February 2015
Liar Liar," Decent comic movie
","I think this is one of Jim Carrey's best movies. He clearly is ecstatic at being given free rein to express his physical, Jerry Lewis style comedy in every single scene. But he is capable of expressing the deeper emotional dilemmas underneath the character's manic facade -- the fear of losing his son, and the sudden panic that for some mysterious reason he can't lie. His whole life up until now has been a lie, so the movie becomes a fish out of water tale. It's like he has to deal with becoming a whole new person, and it is funny. As his world weary ex-wife, Maura Tierney is excellent. I like how the producers chose her -- someone capable of giving an individual, quirky performance -- and not some vacuous dumb bimbo. The character of Carrey's son is one of those factory line six year old boys -- bowl hair cut, cute little face, spilling out cute little lines. Which is no reflection on the little actor, it's just an annoying Hollywood 'type' that I wish they'd change. And the boy does have good comic timing. Jennifer Tilly, as Carrey's buxom, adulterous client, and Swoosie Kurtz, as the rival courtroom lawyer, are among an ensemble giving excellent acting support. To me, the best character is Carrey's secretary, played by the late Anne Haney. Haney came to acting very late, in her 40s, and when she played this role must have been in her 60s or 70s, yet she is a riot playing a strictly 'straight man' role, ridiculing Carrey's outrageous antics and utterings as he tries to lie, but can't. She plays that upright New England, morally correct personal assistant type to a T, and it's a pleasure to watch, and very funny. I think it's the quality and depth of the supporting roles that are often the most telling aspects of a film and so it is here. Even the judge, again playing it straight, shines as he takes many of Carrey's blatherings seriously, making them more funny.",7,0,1,14 July 2014
The Theory of Everything," This is a really nice movie
","When I first saw this movie, I couldn't watch it all the way through. It seemed boring, set in Cambridge in the 1960s, and the script and backdrops seemed quite monotonous. But on second viewing, I found it generally an entertaining film. It's the story of brilliant scientist Stephen Hawking's diagnosis with motor neurone diseas in his early 20s - and his subsequent persistence in getting on with life, and becoming a world famous celebrity physicist. The scientific aspects, to me, are still very weak. I.e. I feel they could have been explained in more detail, although still in a simple way, so we got some information about Hawking's work. However the acting, including Eddie Redmayne as Hawking, and Felicity Jones as his wife, Jane, is exemplary. Redmayne displays an extraordinary technical mastery and empathy with Hawking's disability, and Jones inhabits her role beautifully. Jane seems to have saved Hawking's life, several times, not least in how she convinced him, and enabled him, to not just exist, but to participate in life. I feel that their breakup was probably sanitised somewhat. Not much bitterness or sadness is portrayed, just a few tears, then getting on with life with new partners. The actor who played Jane's choirmaster love interest was great, and the relationship is portrayed in a tasteful way. I felt that this movie did justice to an extraordinary true story. It was well done.",7,0,4,8 April 2017
Good Will Hunting," Really great movie
","I have just re-watched this movie about 10 years after last seeing it. And I realise now what all the fuss is about. The script is fantastic. And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of 'the love interest' -- it's a pity. The plot hums along nicely and, all in all, it's a satisfying movie.",9,1,4,10 August 2013
Schindler's List," Has many flaws
","The most moving parts of the film are at the very start, when the candle is snuffed out in an Orthodox Jewish family, and the very end, when real life 'Schindler Jews' place stones on Schindler's grave in Israel. I found the last scene In the actual movie, of workers solemnly presenting Schindler with the ring they made for him, comes across as terribly schmaltzy and fake. Just the way it's lit, set-up, scripted and the music. It almost ruined the movie for me. Spielberg can't help himself when it comes to schmaltz. He needs someone to stop him!! I also am not a fan of the way Ben Kingsley's character, Itzhak Stern, is written. The humour of him scheming and pestering Schindler is laid on with a trowel -- I guess the writers felt they needed some light relief, but I found it annoying and contrived. The film does have some outstanding scenes. Such as when Schindler and his mistress witness the liquidation of the ghetto; the depictions of camp commandant Amon Goeth's normal family home compared to the squalor of the concentration camp; the Jewish architect arguing with the German guards over poor construction of the barracks; Schindler concocting a story about kids' tiny hands needed for armament manufacture; and the rabbi who isn't shot after several of the Nazi guard's guns don't work. The movie is paced very well, and the locations and cinematography are excellent. Perhaps most importantly, Schindler's List could be a source for education about the Holocaust, and also, to its credit, it doesn't depict Oskar Schindler as a saint. He profited from cheap labour and cheated on his wife. But he did save over 1000 Jewish lives, at risk of his own life.",7,1,3,30 April 2016
School of Rock," Great entertainment
","Critics despair at how many plot holes this film has and say it's cheesy and mimics films like Dead Poets Society. That's true - and when I watched it for the third or fourth time recently, I realised that some of the stunts that bogus emergency teacher Dewey (Jack Black) pulls off would be, er, punished rather seriously in real life. But I would advise viewers to just sit back and enjoy. The acting, the writing, the music and the kids are all fantastic. Sure, Jack Black is over the top but it really works here; you believe he really is a loser musician who is up for anything and just stumbles on to yet another scheme to try and improve his life. But he throws everything at it, despite having little chance at success, and you cheer him on. The film does have something to say about how parents who are obsessed with their kids' academic success, often don't value their kids getting into music, or even valuing them being happy pursuing what they really want to do. As the ultra-repressed, but longing to be cool, school principal Joan Cusack is very funny - a real standout of the movie, as she was in Addams Family Values. Dewey's roommates and even the kids have great timing, playing it straight to Dewey's wackiness. Little details such as Dewey assigning the kids roles in the band that match their strengths, and manipulating the class busybody to be the band manager, come off beautifully. For me, the highlight is Dewey's manic address to the parents. Good on them for keeping it in the film. And any film that showcases bands like AC/DC is OK by me.",8,0,1,3 September 2012
Gran Torino," Great film
","For me, only the prevalence of violence prevents this film gaining an even greater rating. It's one of Clint Eastwood's best roles, but the script is the real star, with most lines zinging off the page. While Walt (Eastwood) is, on the surface, an unattractive character - crotchety, mean, selfish, set in his ways -- gradually you come to understand him, and even love him. He has many good qualities, such as loyalty to his friends, honesty, and willingness to stand up for others and for justice. Underneath his biting wit is harsh experience, hurt and cynicism but also, eventually, a fierce affection for his new Asian neighbours. The film makers take a risk in running many lines about race, although it does highlight the many conflicted tensions of Walt's neighbourhood. And it demonstrates Walt's petty prejudices, despite being from a migrant background himself. I laughed and laughed at many of the lines but then at the end I cried fat tears. The ending was excessively violent but a startling concept, and not out of the realms of possibility, given Walt's extreme character traits. The actor Ahney Her, playing Walt's Hmong neighbour Sue, gives an outstanding performance - full of firey challenges to Walt's racist rants, ignorance, bullsh-t and bravado, even though she is much younger than him. It evolves into a combative but strong affection between them, as she realises there is a heart behind Walt's bitter and tough exterior.",8,0,2,5 September 2013
Hidden Figures," A classy film
","Director and co-writer Theodore Melfi and fellow writer Allison Schroeder keep a tight and confident rein on this interesting story that could easily have got bogged down in complicated technical terminology. Or alternatively, it could have veered too much into feel-good mode. Instead, it just tells the great story of how in the early 1960s, three courageous, super- intelligent African American women overcame massive prejudices and social conventions to succeed as important contributors to the NASA space program. Given that most of the audience is not into high level math and physics, the writers explain everything beautifully - way better than in A Beautiful Mind or The Imitation Game. The casting is near-perfect, with Taraji Henson giving an awesome performance as genius mathematician Katherine Johnson, who is not only smart and bold but has many other interesting facets to her life, like finding love again after her first husband died. Janelle Monae, as engineer Mary Jackson, and Octavia Spencer as computer expert Dorothy Vaughan, are both brilliant in portraying equally determined characters in their fields. Kevin Costner is great as their sparky but demanding boss, Al Harrison. Established stars Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst have the grace and humility to play quite negative characters in this movie, who blanche at giving the black women a chance, but who eventually do thaw a little in their attitudes. The clothes are a costume designer's dream, but as with the film's set design and music, everything is nicely understated. I was pleased to note that the real Katherine Johnson was still alive when this film came out. Hidden Figures is made with love and affection, and it's a fitting tribute to those pioneer NASA women.",8,3,8,16 February 2017
The Imitation Game," Great film
","Aside from the Nazis, according to this film, code breaking genius Alan Turing also had to fight his fellow Brits during World War II. Some of his colleagues and authorities not only persecuted him for being gay, but accused him of being a spy, were jealous of him, bullied him and had little faith in his admittedly outlandish plan to build a computer that would break the Nazis' crack, intricate mode of communications, the Enigma machine. As the actor playing Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch brings enormous compassion and empathy to his role: the gist is that Turing is a absolute genius and yet ironically he cannot communicate, or get on with his colleagues at the top secret Bletchley Park intelligence centre. It almost spells disaster for the Enigma project, and it adds a lot of tension to the film. It's very insightful for the scriptwriters to portray how Turing's good friend, fellow cryptographer Joan Clark, was a social code breaker for Turing. Clark, played by Keira Knightley, tells Turing that he won't achieve what he's aiming for in the project if the other team members don't like him, given how he often dismisses them as beneath him, and doesn't make an effort to socialise. The film is also brilliant at exploring themes such as how prejudice, for example against gays, is so brainless - think of the mind-blowing contributions Turing could have made to society, after the war, had he not been driven to severe depression and suicide by homophobic individuals and by a hostile community. The investigators who investigate Turing for homosexuality, which was then a crime, are like a cancer in threatening his existence. Though it may be grotesquely too late today, at least Turing is being recognised in this film for playing a big part in de-coding the messages that the Germans used to broadcast their military moves in WWII. An incredible feat. The excellent scenes of Alan as a boy being bullied at school for being a geek show how people who were shocking misfits can go on to be brilliant adults, because later in life their 'odd' interests and behaviour are an asset in their careers as entrepreneurs or inventors or intellectuals. This film obviously takes poetic licence and viewers have pointed out quite a few bendings of the facts. But overall it's a good hearted and entertaining film.",7,1,2,14 May 2015
Big Fish," A beautiful film
","I just saw this the whole way through for the first time on DVD. I laughed. I cried. I was enthralled. The actors are all perfectly cast, and are completely committed to this story, which points out that while the tall tales we tell may not be the whole truth, they are also the spice of life, and sustain us in good times and bad. We actually need them to survive. Much like we need movies. Albert Finney is possibly the most under-rated actor ever; as the dying Edward Bloom, he is a wonderful raconteur but also tender and loving. Billy Crudup does a sterling job as his bitter, very skeptical son, who is tired of his father never letting facts get in the way of a good story. As Edward's wife, Jessica Lange is luminous. She has long accepted his eccentric ways, and loves him for it. The scene of she and Edward in the bathtub is incredibly moving. As the young Edward, Scottish actor Ewan McGregor brings a nutty energy to his role. In the flashback scenes that the older Edward narrates about him, McGregor undergoes all sorts of wondrous adventures - from befriending a giant living in a cave, to fending off jumping spiders and a werewolf, to visiting a phantom village where no one ever leaves, to parachuting out of a plane in wartime and meeting beautiful Siamese twin women.The supporting actors are exceptional. Danny De Vito obviously relishes playing a brash circus ringmaster who Edward eventually befriends. Helena Bonham Carter plays an eccentric older woman who may, or may not, have had an affair with the younger Edward. Steve Buscemi, as usual, is entertaining and endearing as both a hopeless poet in the phantom village, and later an inept bank robber who once again crosses paths with Edward. French actor Marion Cotillard, playing the older Edward's daughter-in-law, is a key element in the story - as a newcomer to the family, she wants to understand and get to know Edward, so she asks him to tell her more about his life. Best of all, the film is made with great love by director Tim Burton. The fish metaphor might be a little overdone, but I think ultimately the film works beautifully, whether it's as a comment on humanity, a fairytale, an escape, or a fun lark. Whatever you want to make of it.",9,1,2,14 April 2017
La La Land," Not bad but over-rated
","It's a shame that this film, directed by the very talented Damien Chazelle (creator of Whiplash), has had so much praise heaped on it, and is favourite for the Oscars. It is not a bad film, but it doesn't deserve an Oscar. When it ended, I left the cinema saying 'it doesn't suck' and 'I didn't walk out on it'. But I didn't rave about it. With echoes of Whiplash, it does have deeper themes such as how two artists in a relationship can maintain their careers simultaneously, and also the importance of dreaming big and of being willing to fail and compromise. Also, it must be noted, this film's creators have dreamed big - by bringing a big time musical back to a Hollywood studio film. But maybe that's all the risk they were prepared to take, because much of the film is quite bland. The opening number on the jammed-up freeway is an excellent idea, but all we see dancing and singing are beautiful thin young people in multi-coloured clothes fresh from the studio wardrobe. It would have been so much fresher to have old people and obese people and kids getting out of those cars and doing their own thing. But for many of the film's scenes, we only get lithe young dancers in swimsuits or dancing clothes shaking their booty. It's boring. Or rather, it's nice, but not exciting. I feel Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are sincere in their roles as the struggling actor Mia and the earnest jazz pianist Sebastian. But they come across as very, well, pleasant. I.e. bland. They have no edge, they're not quirky. They're very WASP-ish. The film's soundtrack is nicely performed, but not that memorable. If you look at a musical like Chicago or Hairspray, there are about 10 killer songs that stay with you. Not with La La Land. I like how La La Land showcases some lesser-known Los Angeles landmarks. But the movie is also too conservative in sticking to a very rigid style. There are some tiny nods to modern times, such as Mia driving herself home from a date, and a cellphone ring getting in the way of romance. But lots of other films, such as Chef, which uses Twitter, or Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, with its drug-gang take on a modern city, and even the semi-animated Enchanted, set in tough New York, are willing to have fun with modern technology, even while they portray traditional stories and styles. Gosling and Stone are very serious and earnest. I feel they're wrong for these roles. La La Land tries hard, but ultimately I didn't love it. I wanted to, but I didn't.",6,5,9,7 January 2017
Woman in Gold," Good film
","This is not a masterpiece but it does have some important themes. Maria Altmann represents all those Jews who lost everything under the Nazis. They settled in countries like the US and lived quiet lives. They might have led incredible and tragic early lives in Europe, but their neighbours just know them as a sweet old lady or man. I guess many of them never told their stories and were happy to leave painful memories behind. This film is saying that the incredibly valuable Klimt painting of her aunt Adele is a symbol of the rich culture and community that was viciously ripped apart. Maria realises that she can never get that back, but suing for the painting's return at least is a reminder to modern day Austrians of her loss. It's an acknowledgement of her pain and a taking back of control over her life. Helen Mirren is great, if a little too much like Queen Elizabeth Ii, as Maria. But for me, Tatiana Maslany, as the young Maria, steals the film. The flashbacks to Maria as a child and then as a young bride, are beautifully done. The final scene of the movie is gorgeous and very moving. The acting and script in the Los Angeles scenes is a little wooden. Katie Holmes doesn't have a lot to work with as the lawyer Randy's wife. Positives about the film include that it doesn't shy away from stating the Austrian people were complicit in expelling the Jews and looting their property. And also the Randy character admits several times he is motivated to be Maria's lawyer by the money, as well as by his own Austrian Jewish heritage. I am glad Maria Altmann's story has been told - she sounded like quite a lady.",8,2,3,5 June 2015
Groundhog Day," Really great film
","This film works on two levels - as a wacky comedy, and as a deep meditation on life. We've all known someone like Phil (Bill Murray), the nasty, burnt-out TV weather man who hasn't got a good word to say to anyone, who is cynical about everything and impossible to get along with. Life has been bad to him, so he's going to be nasty back. In Groundhog Day, by having to live the same day over again and again, it slowly dawns on him that his life can improve, but it's going to take some effort on his part. For example, actually learning to be nice to his camera man. To me, the best scene is when Phil walks into a bar, and declares in despair that it's always the same day. A drunk at the bar remarks that that's what his own life is like. Like a lot of people in real life, I thought. Stuck in the same rut like Phil, self destructing, committing crimes, over-eating and running into the same old people, until they can find a way to break out and make the most of life. The only thing I don't like about this film is Rita, the love interest. She's great when she's producing his weather segment and telling him off for being such a slob, but I felt the romantic resolution was too twee and weird. It's like he finally learns how to manipulate a woman into going out with him. Isn't there something wrong with that? But perhaps I'm too cynical. Maybe it's just that he learns how to love someone.",8,1,2,15 June 2015
Love & Mercy," A lovely film of a miraculous recovery
","The most moving part of this film is the real Brian Wilson singing - in concert, as an older man - one of his most beautiful songs - Love and Mercy. When you think of how close to obliteration he once was, the performance is a miracle, and yes, a mercy. On first viewing of this film about Wilson's life, I didn't like it, but on second viewing, I've changed my mind. As the older Wilson, John Cusack doesn't resemble the young Wilson (a wonderful Paul Dano). But both actors capture Wilson's gentle, charming personality, and I warmed to Cusack. It's a very heavy role but the movie does hold together. The carefree early days and brilliant harmonies of the Beach Boys are beautifully portrayed, but the group is gradually tainted by drugs and money. The central two pincers for Wilson are his cruel father and his outspoken cousin, Mike Love. While both men initially push Wilson to do his best creatively, they fail to see their crushing effect on him. Like many young stars, without support, the ultra sensitive Wilson breaks down. Enter shonky psychiatrist Dr Eugene Landy (an outstanding Paul Giamatti) who keeps Wilson drugged up, and who becomes a power hungry monster, creepily controlling Wilson's every move. It's an unlikely stranger Wilson meets - the ultra cool and polite car saleswoman Melinda (an excellent Elizabeth Banks) who somehow disentangles Wilson from Landy's clutches, while loving him in a fantastically normal way.
You could not make up such a story. Dano conveys what a real gem Brian Wilson was and it's heartbreaking to think what Wilson could have done,0 had he got the right help and support as a young man.",8,4,6,15 January 2016
"McFarland, USA"," A nice, sweet film
","I like the idea of a film about how sport can transform lives. Kevin Costner does well as Coach White, who starts training a troubled group of Mexican boys in cross country running. The film makes beautiful use of light and makes the flat fields of southern California look stunning. The film is refreshing in portraying Anglos and Mexicans as trying to get along. The Mexicans might be poor, but their community is close and loving. There is lots of gentle humour and a bit of the coach being a fish out of water. But generally, the outcome of this movie is not really in doubt. But it's a well written and heartfelt movie, about teenagers trying to improve their lot in life. The message is, there is no way around working hard towards what you want to achieve, and doing your best. And the support of being in a team is amazing. Sure, it's a bit of a schmaltzy film at times, but it has moments of genuine inspiration.",7,1,1,16 April 2017
Les Misérables," Not great
","Part of the trouble with Les Mis is trying to sum up the entire French Revolution in a musical, which is a strange, even absurd idea. I still prefer the stage version - it has less pretension that this is realistic. As others have said, the CGI in the movie is over-done. The songs and characters don't need over the top design and effects - it's as if the producers felt they had to throw money at each scene and crowd the screen with people and buildings and objects. The Thenardiers' comic Master of the House, for example, was overly elaborate, whereas the lyrics and the couple alone are amusing enough without so many pranks. The casting is uneven. I am not a fan of Hugh Jackman, but he can sing, if not beautifully, and Jean Valjean would have been hard to cast. Anne Hathaway is OK as Fantine but it's a rather pathetic character and not a great stretch for her. Amanda Seyfried is a bit shrill as the older Cosette but again has a bit of a pathetic role. Eddie Redmayne is wonderful as Marius. Not the conventional hunk, but a lovely singer with a good strong screen presence. The other male rebels have those gorgeous rich voices required of all those revolutionary songs. The children playing young Cosette and Gavroche are great. The woman playing the older Eponine has a nice voice and her songs are done well. But she's not convincing in her death scene. Too healthy looking. The technique of the actors singing live is a stroke of genius. Witness brilliant songs like Do You Hear the People Sing or Red and Black and Drink With Me. They're lush and fresh. I had heard that Russell Crowe can't sing but that rumour was wrong. He's not Pavarotti but he acquits himself well in a demanding role as Valjean's nemesis, Javert. The barricade scenes take a while to pick up. They stop and start too much. Les Mis is a hard movie to film, but I felt it could have been done much better.",6,1,1,21 March 2015
Jersey Boys," Pretty good entertainment
","It's a tough task trying to compress decades of material about a real- life pop group into a few hours. I had no idea how complicated and frankly sad much of the Four Seasons' history was. Overall it's an entertaining movie and its heart is in the right place. It is good that the story is not all sweetness and light, but at times it gets weighed down by the bleak parts. There actually aren't as many musical numbers as you'd expect. Clint Eastwood's direction once again is full of humanity and humour, so thankfully the characters are much more than gee-whiz boy group clichés. The actors are excellent. Can I take a moment to praise Christopher Walken, who plays Gip De Carlo, the mafia boss? The man is brilliant. Such a cheeky, wry, heartfelt performer. Can someone please write a movie in which he is the star, instead of a scene-stealing side character? The actor playing the troubled singer Tommy De Vito is also excellent. The character is so destructive I wonder what the real man himself and his family thought of it. But he does have redeeming characteristics. He's forceful in getting the group gigs and dealing with problems, and of course there is his singing and guitar playing. Frankie Valli is presented as much younger than De Vito and finds a way to stand up to him. The actor playing Valli is a great singer and plays the early scenes beautifully, but I felt towards the end his acting was more wooden in the more emotional material -- it didn't seem to resonate with him much more than stubbing his toe when Valli's daughter dies and his girlfriend leaves. The Bob Gaudio character was portrayed as quite lovable, also able to stand up to Tommy and the brains and backbone of the band. The final scene when they all abruptly break out in song and dance in a city street is frankly a bit weird. Most of the movie was serious drama and then all of a sudden we're transported to a stage set with everyone who's appeared in the film twirling, singing and smiling, even Gyp De Carlo. I think this would have worked better by portraying a scene of the Four Seasons singing at a dance in their heyday in which teenagers get up out of their seats and just have a good time because of the band.",8,1,7,4 July 2014
12 Years a Slave," Good film
","As a non-American, I find it really interesting that so many reviewers here are uncomfortable with the explicit violence and nastiness portrayed in this film. How could it possibly be true? They seem to say. Surely Americans have never been that vicious and uncaring? But for hundreds of years, some of them were, and this film depicts it well. It's not a pleasant film but it does hold your attention and would make an excellent film for history classes. The film's creators depict Edwin Epps, the main slave owner, as an unapologetic bigot, manipulator, rapist and sadist. Generations of slave traders lived their lives like this. The slave of the film's title, Samuel Northup, did, at least, live some of his life in the relative comfort of the North, but it's sobering to realise that generations of slaves lived in total misery, with no way out of their situation. I found Brad Pitt's small role -- as the saviour who contact Samuel's friends and family, who rescue Northup from slavery -- as a little patronising. I.e. the white guy who saves the day for the black guy. But my companion pointed out that often blacks' only hope would have been someone helping them.",8,3,5,8 March 2014
Wedding Crashers," A difficult movie to rate
","I love the premise of Wedding Crashers but I've never been able to watch it to the end. Two friends Jeremy and John (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) spend their summers breaking into strangers' wedding ceremonies and parties to have a free good time, eat, drink and meet women. You'd better believe there are people in the real world who do this! But I think this movie veers too heavily in the 'gross out' direction, when it could have been a little less zany and more of a narrative. The men, as usual, are the stars and drivers of the narrative, and the women are more side-players. Which is a pity, because Rachel McAdams, as Claire, the bridesmaid that John falls for, is very intelligent and could have played a bigger role. On the other hand, I tired of Isla Fisher as Gloria, the kooky sister of Claire, who starts to stalk Jeremy after snaring his interest at her sister's wedding. Fisher goes way over the top in her obsessions, and it gets annoying. I really like Vince Vaughn and he has a ball with his 'strange guy serious about this bizarre lifestyle' schtick. I also like Owen Wilson, who always plays Owen Wilson, the happy-go-lucky slacker who is up for anything. It's a little disturbing to see how the friends lie to, charm and then bed so many nice women, then discard them - it gets a bit creepy, to be honest, and maybe wouldn't be portrayed the same these days. I'm grateful to the editors for casting Christopher Walken as the super preppy politician father of the bride - he's just a gem and loves playing this part. I also love the montage of all the different weddings that Jeremy and John attend - Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Irish and Hindu. It shows that they all have things in common - great food, nice clothes, music and big groups of people out to have a really good time.",6,0,0,31 December 2019
Wedding Crashers," Too long, not snappy enough
","I love the premise of the film - two men who avoid commitment have the absurd hobby of crashing the weddings of complete strangers. But I've never watched this movie to the end. I always get bored, and I get to the point where I don't care about what happens to the characters. It's a shame that most scenes go on way too long. Most could be cut by half and still make sense. Owen Wilson, as usual, is completely charming, and he's nicely complemented by sweet love interest Rachel McAdams. Vince Vaughn can be wickedly funny when his character feels out if his depth, but he needed a tight rein from the director in this movie -- instead, he can be really annoying, droning on while trying to be witty. I disliked Isla Fisher's wacky stalker character. It's just silly at times, it's as though she decided to play it over the top, but it jars against the other, more grounded characters. In the family mansion, scenes deteriorate into slapstick. The family just comes across as weird and scary rather than eccentric, which I suspect was the intention. The characters fall back on crude pranks, and the film loses focus.",6,0,0,1 December 2016
Downfall," Excellent film
","A very well made film that dares to present Hitler and those close to him in the dying days of the Third Reich as human. But it must be said, it's quite chilling to watch him dressing down his generals whose men are dying for Germany in the thousands, and criticising failed military moves of his own making, as his world literally falls down around him in the Berlin bunker. Also, when he's told that civilians including children are dying because he won't surrender or negotiate with the Allies, he doesn't care. The film effectively portrays the banality of evil, as Hitler lovingly strokes his dog, and as his girlfriend Eva Braun rather manically smiles her way through the crisis. It's strange to watch an impeccably groomed Magda Goebbels calmly poisoning her six sleeping children to death because she doesn't want them to live in a world without National Socialism. It's so surreal it's hard to believe it actually did happen in real life. The film also dares to present some of the generals, secretaries and senior Nazis as having compassion and emotions. I found that quite confronting. Special mention here to the searing intelligence and courage portrayed by Christian Berkel as the apparently good-hearted Professor Schenck who finds himself confronting rogue death squads and amputating limbs on the frontline in the dying hours. The film doesn't shirk from the utter bloodiness of the destruction of Berlin that Hitler is bringing down upon himself. The film is wrongly promoted as narrated by Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, although it is based on her riveting book describing her time working for Hitler. In the film, Junge is very much a side character, and doesn't seem to do much, other than react with horror to what's going on. I guess the film's subject matter overwhelmed that angle.",8,0,1,19 April 2015
Whiplash," Excellent film
","At first I feared I couldn't relate to the world of elite jazz musicians at one of America's top music schools. But through the psychopathic teacher Fletcher (JK Simmons) and his protégé, manic young drummer Neiman (Miles Teller) this movie explores issues such as the role of mentors, how far talented and gifted student should be pushed, and push themselves, and just the painful life of a young musician who is quite lost, and who believes that becoming the next Charlie Parker - being someone - is the answer to his problems. When it's pointed out that Parker had a short life of addiction and pain, Neiman says that maybe it's better to have fame and die young than live a long life and be forgotten. It's one of the many nutty but interesting things in this film, which has a great script, tight direction and great acting. It isn't afraid to go over the top, and interestingly, the story continues well after the film's climax, but it works. You get the feeling that many real-life elite artists and their teachers have some sort of mental condition, in pursuing perfection to an extraordinary degree while ignoring their own health and welfare. The scene where Neiman breaks up with his lovely girlfriend, because having a relationship would affect his drumming, is priceless. Ironically music is for pleasure but in the world of Whiplash it's soaked with pain and sacrifice.",8,4,7,2 May 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not as good as it's hyped up to be
","I get it that the creators of this film are trying to portray disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort's unabated, untethered debauchery, but I felt there did need to be some balance.
Maybe a character with some moral compass?
Or what about a few scenes portraying the investors who Belfort ripped off?
Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine did this better by telling the wife's story, and her encounter with her sister's angry ex husband, who was financially ruined by a Belfort-like investment character.
I just fear that some viewers will watch Wolf of Wall Street and think that Belfort didn't do too badly from his practices, apart from a short stint in jail. He had a fun time and made a lot of money. They will laugh at his drug fuelled antics.
There was one speech Belfort makes to his workers where he says something like, 'this is America' and that making a lot of money is why they are here. It's a strong message - asking the audience, are these really our values? But my guess is that the message would have gone over most viewers' heads.
I was also appalled at the depiction of women throughout the film. They're disembodied bodies. Sure, Belfort's strippers and hookers may very well have been like that.
But I just found it degrading, and always from the male point of view. And why was Margot Robbie so nude all the time when Leonardo Di Caprio was dressed or seen from behind?
And again, there was no balance - what about a scene in how the women involved felt?
I really hope most people who see this film see how appalling Belfort is, but I'm not convinced.",6,0,1,5 March 2020
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Good but not great
","This movie is a cinematographer's dream, and Zac Nicholson does a great job of capturing the beauty of an English Channel island under Nazi occupation during World War II. Director Mike Newell sets a crisp yet patient pace, and not a shot is wasted in moving the story forward. The scenery was lovely, so I was very disappointed to learn that this is the North Devon coast filling in for the island of Guernsey. The plot is interesting enough, with two heroines - the writer Juliet (Lily James) who visits in 1946 to find out more about the strange literary society, and the second heroine being Elizabeth (Jessica Brown Findlay), seen in flashback during the war on Guernsey who rebels agaiinst the Nazi invaders and helps shelter slave labourers, at the risk of her own safety. Elizabeth also has an affair with a Nazi doctor, Christian (Nicolo Pasetti) who turns out to be a nice man. The movie is much more watchable and substantial than some British period films such as Their Finest. It does have some good points to make about people in the war not being all black and white in their allegiances, about how books can be saviours to people in times of trouble, and how a motley crew of unrelated people can form strong bonds. I love the scene when the Society eats an illicit roast pig. Such a simple indulgence but they really savour it, as a shared, rare luxury, and as a simple victory against oppression. I feel that the movie focused too much on Juliet's love life, and her life in London. We don't see much about the Nazi peril to Guernsey natives. The invasion is given about 10 seconds of screen time. Yet too much time is given to filming Juliet gazing longingly at her love interest, the farmer Dawsey, or furiously scribbling research about the island. I don't think Lily James is a great actor - too many furiously wrinkled brows, and she's not a great kisser, but she tries hard. Huisman, as the farmer Dawsey, also isn't that great, but his role is a bit soppy. The film does seem to approve of very good looking people. If you are a little different looking (i.e. the actually beautiful Katherine Parkinson as Isola) you're dismissed as plain and lovelorn. 
Also the script's attitude to Chriistian, Elizabeth's Nazi lover, is confusing. In real life, you'd expect that the locals would regard Elizabeth's carousing with the enemy as a grave sin, that could endanger lives under occupation, a time when they rely on a united front against the enemy. But in the movie, the characters who disapprove of their relationship are painted as nasty. I guess the film is trying to say that love is love, and that not all Germans were bad.
Some reviewers didn't like the character of Juliet's American fiance, the wealthy officer Markham (Glen Powell), but I thought Powell did a great job, and even when he's rejected, he behaves understandably. 
Juliet's gay literary agent character, Sidney (Matthew Goode) was almost identical to Rupert Everett's hyper-supportive gay best friend character in My Best Friend's Wedding. Still, he's entertaining. 
I liked the ending, although I don't quite believe that Juliet would her give up her glamorous life in London to be a pig farmer's wife.
It is more picturesque, however.",7,3,7,8 May 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Outstanding
","If you want a good laugh, this will do the trick nicely. Many, many highlights, but just the words 'jazz flute' can send me into hysterics. The talking dog. The office barbershop quartet singing Afternoon Delight. Steve Carell's amazingly stupid character, Brick, who he obviously enjoyed playing. The bear scene at the zoo. The mass fight of rival news crews. You get the disturbing feeling that the world of 1970s TV that Anchorman was parodying isn't too different from reality. The clothes. The sexism. The bizarre idol worship of newsreaders, who in reality just have to read an autocue and look good. All the supporting actors play it very straight and as a result are hilarious, for example Tim Robbins' small but effective turn as the nasty public TV reporter who pushes Veronica into the bear pit. The whole movie was very well done.",9,0,0,30 June 2013
Ray," Good movie
","Generally a very good biopic of a truly gifted artist. The cinematography, locations, lighting and costumes are lush. Even the grotty hotels are richly-lit and full of character. Charles's childhood in Florida, seen in flashback, comes across as a bit of a movie set, but it does clearly put across how very young, but strong and determined his mother, Aretha, was. Even when Ray goes blind at age 7, she urges him to never be 'a cripple' - to think of himself as a worthy person and strive to make his way in the world. She only sends him off to boarding school from a passionate belief that education is the key to his success. And she was right. With acute hearing and memory, he could get around without a cane or a guide dog. Still, when he travels right across the US to Seattle to join a band, you get the sense of how very brave he was. Fortunately, that amazing talent was a force to be reckoned with. Jamie Foxx is the perfect actor to play Charles - convincing in every way. Of course a big highlight is that muscly soul music. I most enjoyed the live concert scenes, big and small, where the audience and the musicians feed off each other, everyone having a wonderful time. The drug use and the womanizing are given ample screen time, but the characters involved are always depicted as human, i.e. very flawed, rather than evil. Overall, Ray Charles triumphed in life. His mother would be very proud.",7,0,2,19 June 2017
Bring It On," Excellent film
","High points of this very cool movie include the snappy, witty script, the brilliant cast, excellent choreography and, above all, not taking itself seriously. It centres around a year in the life of all-American schoolgirl Tor (Kirsten Dunst), who is elected head cheerleader. If you just saw it as being about the 'difficulties' she faces -- boyfriend trouble, being accused of plagiarising routines, bullying, injuries, annoying sibling and parents -- you'd laugh, because this is not exactly Afghanistan. It's rich, white LA. But the film sends this up mercilessly. It presents, you suspect, a fairly accurate rendition of this strange sport, and manages to be both affectionate towards it, but also to poke fun at all its conventions. Tor's new friend, the gymnast Missy, openly laughs at the sport, before realising it offers her the chance to make friends at her new school. But basically most of the scenes are highly entertaining, from cliquey princesses Courtney and Whitney's bitching about people auditioning for the squad, to the poorer East Compton team cajoling an Oprah-like talk show host to fund their trip to the finals. The characters are all well developed and everyone gets at least one scene in which to shine.",9,0,0,16 September 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," What's it all about?
","The cinematography, the setting and the acting are all fantastic in this movie. But in the end, it didn't move me. It struck me as being very much an actors' movie, with too many inside jokes and meanings to really reach the audience. Michael Keaton really tries hard as a former action movie hero at the end of his rope, who is prepared to gamble his entire career on an avant garde Broadway adaption of a Raymond Carver novel. Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts all try even harder as the central character's daughter and fellow actors. The special effects such as flying and Keaton's ability to move objects around his dressing room struck me as more about wowing the audience than meaning anything. There are some amusing and interesting scenes, such as Keaton getting locked out of the back of the theatre and having to go to the front doors, running the gauntlet, half naked, of the crowds in Times Square. But there are too many scenes where the characters simply emote for no good reason -- most of Stone's scenes fall into this category. The ending was rather distressing and I felt it was a cheap resolution.",6,2,7,3 January 2015
The Queen," Solid movie
","I feel that kudos should go to the producers and directors for even attempting to depict both such a high profile event and the royal family. It risked being too crass, too superficial, too weighty, inauthentic, or even (gasp) a parody. But it was pretty good overall. Including real-life footage from the era was another huge risk that paid off. I didn't see the end of the movie on TV because I guess I wasn't that personally interested in the story (and I know how it ends) but overall, the acting was great, particularly Helen Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair -- the latter role, in particular could have veered into parody if he hadn't got the slightly effeminate voice right, but it didn't. It was one of the biggest challenges facing the royals in ages and it was intriguing seeing how they handled it from the inside, in the modern world, as opposed to how we normally see period pieces involving Henry VIII, George III et cetera.",7,0,0,5 January 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," It's not so bad!!
","Oh you guys! You love to hate Fifty Shades. It's fashionable to trash and sledge it. I thought it was all right. Dakota Johnson was perfect for her role. Jamie Dornan was not as good, but he is really committed to the role and is watchable. The lighting and direction are good. The script has nice elements of humour and largely avoids clunky soap opera dialogue. It's wrong that Johnson has most of the nudity of the two leads. The sex scenes are quite tasteful, if a bit slick. The movie tries hard with a believable plot about Christian Grey shying away from real intimacy due to abuse. The supporting cast including the lovely Marcia Gay Harden as Christian's mother, are great. One objection I have is that the abrupt ending is so blatantly left open for a sequel, it's ridiculous. But overall, a surprisingly good film",7,0,1,1 February 2017
La Vie En Rose," A tale not told through rose coloured glasses
","If you thought the life of Judy Garland was tragic, the life of French singer Edith Piaf is 10 times sadder.
Surprisingly, given she's such a legend, this movie does not romanticise Piaf at all, but in being so tough, it is hard to sympathise with her.
Marion Cotillard really does throw everything at the role, but the movie didn't move me hugely.
In some ways, Piaf's life is too nasty and sad to portray. Born into poverty, raised in her grandmother's brothel and then travelling with her acrobat father as a teenager, Piaf sings for her supper on Paris streets, gets involved with gangsters and murder and somehow finds fame as a singer.
But her dependence on alcohol and pills send her health spiralling until she's an old woman, washed up, at age 45.
Most of the time, Piaf is a tough broad, and the only time her outlook aligns with the title of the movie, as in 'seeing life through rose coloured glasses' is when she's infatuated with a married French boxer.
Two key events the film ignores is Piaf giving birth at 17 to a girl who she neglected and who died at age two. Also her alleged collaboration with the Nazi occupiers of Paris during World War II.
But generally, the director goes for an ultra realistic style of storytelling. The costumes and sets are immaculate. The cinematography gets right up close to the participants of the parties and the concerts - sometimes dizzyingly so.
The most moving scenes are as Edith as a child, sweetly praying to St Therese to help her.
Cotillard players Edith as an impulsive, brittle, childlike figure, who gets swept along with whatever's in front of her and who has few coping skills and not much charm - given she's in showbiz.
The scenes when she dates the boxer are brilliantly done - Piaf allows herself to fall for him, and be happy, in one of the few instances where she lets her guard down.
It explains why she's so devastated when he dies in the plane crash.
I guess it's a miracle that Edith survived as long as she did, and was so famous for so long, but fame did her no favours and she belongs to the long canon of artists who lived fast and died young.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Great entertainment
","I have seen a lot of Woody Allen films and this is among my favorites. Mainly because the script is so tight and witty and all the actors are brilliant and perfectly cast. My favourite scene is the very last one, in which Vicky and Cristina can look either profoundly changed or indifferent at what they've gone through, depending on your point of view. The film can be seen either as a fun bit of fluff or quite meaningful. I don't think the film has a message, but it is interested in what each character gets up to. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) must choose between her impulsive Spanish lover and her safe, boring husband. Javier Bardem's character realises he loves his troubled, fiery ex-wife Maria Elena, despite how chaotic and even violent she is. I don't know what Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) realises, but she is entertaining, as an open minded artistic woman who is up for everything. The scene at the restaurant in which Javier Bardem propositions Vicky and Cristina at the restaurant, and the women have vastly different responses, one prissy, one flattered and flirtatious, is a classic. Basically, Allen simply has fun with the beautiful setting, the art, the artists and the social milieu.",8,1,2,14 April 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Not a bad film
","Not an easy film to make and overall, I felt it was done well. The scenes of Pamela as a child were my favourite. As an Australian they felt authentic to me. The acting was beautiful and the cinematography was gorgeous. Pamela's father isn't made out to be a terrible person just because he's an alcoholic. He's a real charmer and a loving father, someone with an artistic soul who is obviously very unsuited to being a bank manager. Making the adult Pamela out to be such a vicious old hag is confronting: was she really that bad? Emma Thompson is perfect for the role and she is very funny, but it's an unforgiving, sometimes one dimensional portrait, much like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Admittedly, the Americans are also mocked mercilessly through Pamela's eyes - not being able to make tea properly; the flashiness of Disneyland; LA people preferring to drive and not walk; the terrible food Disney's assistant keeps serving. Tom Hanks does Walt Disney quite well. Several scenes are really interesting, such as when Disney talks about his childhood, and reveals he was, early in his career, in a similar position to Pamela in not wanting to hand over creative control of his characters. The film can be enjoyed on quite a superficial level, but it did also have a few things to say, such as how things that happen in childhood can stay with us the rest of our lives; and how Mary Poppins derived from Pamela trying to deal with her sad childhood - to reinvent it and resolve it. The film also depicts the tensions surrounding how films are made -- the Mary Poppins composers the Sherman brothers saw the project as a way to express themselves, by building their own creation, based on Pamela's story but not following it slavishly. Whereas Pamela expects her work won't be changed, and both parties cannot understand the other side's point of view.",7,2,4,11 January 2014
The Sixth Sense," A lush, absorbing film
","Gorgeous cinematography, rich historic Pennsylvania locations and a tight, intelligent script are what elevates this film above the ordinary horror flick. It has plenty of interesting ideas. Such as, how old buildings have a human history we may not realise, for example the boy Cole's school theatre where there was once a terrible fire, and the three colonial people he sees hanging from a rafter. Cole's kitchen is taken over at night by a battered woman who shrieks and opens all the drawers. It made me think about who used to live in my house. I like the scene where the young couple shop for antique rings - who knows who once owned them? The central affliction of the film - Cole sees dead people - has parallels with sexual abuse. Cole is frightened and disturbed and he can't tell anyone what's wrong because he thinks they won't believe him. He develops little routines, like his figurines and going into a church, to get comfort. The psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis) hits on the idea of Cole asking the ghosts what is wrong and offering to help them. It makes you think about angry or sad or disturbed people in the real world. Maybe if someone could get down to the root of their problem, they could get help. Cole discovers that the little girl ghost who keeps vomiting is trying to tell him she was poisoned by her mother, and that no one suspected it. I thought the film could have showed more of this - Cole helping the ghosts out. Malcolm's violent former patient, Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg) is a good reminder that sometimes people's pain is so great they can't be helped. Or maybe Vincent represents what Cole could be like in the future if he is not helped. The twist at the end is a great one. Willis is allowed to demonstrate his cerebral side, and Malcolm's scenes with his estranged wife are a poignant exploration of grief, and of a couple drifting apart.",8,1,1,15 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Haters gonna hate but great entertainment
","Haters are gonna hate this big time. Sure, on one or two occasions I was reminded of the old Mad Magazine spoof, I think of Return of the Jedi, which depicts a cinema audience wearily reciting the Star Wars formula of how the resistance fighters will attack the Death Star (or its latest equivalent). But ultimately, George Lucas and JJ Abrams have created a stirring, absorbing film, which is snappily edited, has great scenery, and, of course John Williamson's still superlative soundtrack. And it's a kick-ass film for women, with Daisy Ridley (looking spookily like Keira Knightley) doing brilliantly as the central character, the scavenger turned warrior Rey. For an inexperienced film actor, she does extraordinarily well. And with Carrie Fisher reprising Princess Leia, that makes two female leads who more than hold their own. Hooray! Harrison Ford still takes your breath away as the charismatic Han Solo. And it's great to see Chewbacca get a meatier hero role here!! The other male leads, Poe and Finn, are also well cast and the guys playing them can actually act. The enemy characters were a bit tiresome and predictable. And I felt it was unbelievable that Rey and her friends could get behind enemy lines so easily without detection. I admit I had low expectations of this film, but ultimately really enjoyed it!",9,4,21,19 December 2015
Unbroken," Great film
","A lovingly made film, Unbroken (as it was called when I saw it on a plane) is an excellent account of Louis Zamperini's incredible life. Jack O'Connell is perfectly cast as the athletic, charismatic young man whose chance to win gold at the Olympics is destroyed when World War II intervenes and he goes through several forms of hell surviving 45 days on a raft when his plane crashes into the sea, and then is singled out for severe treatment, seemingly for years, by a sadistic guard in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. The early scenes in which Louis is a juvenile delinquent saved by his brother's encouragement of him to be a runner are simply but movingly portrayed. The scenes in the plane with his air force buddies are incredible. Japanese midget planes, bullets and bombs whiz by from all angles. The guy next to you could be joking with you one moment, and the next shot through the head. The scenes in the life raft are truly gripping, with sharks, storms, the sun and gunfire from a Japanese plane all seemingly determined to kill Louis and his two fellow survivors. The detention camp scenes were very realistically stark and brutal. Uncomfortable viewing, and the Japanese actor playing Louis's sadistic, deluded tormentor 'Bird' is outstanding. I found the ending quite moving. Overall, for a big Hollywood movie, it was very well done.",7,0,1,2 May 2015
Pitch Perfect," Not good enough
","This movie is a big letdown. Here you have a good cast, a lovely college setting, good costumes and camera-work and great music. I feel the problem is the characters and the script. Intentionally or not, the characters come across as very white-bread and narrow minded. At first I though they were denigrating anyone who was 'different' as a way of highlighting that such behaviour is wrong. But actually I think the script is genuinely making fun of anyone who's not a blonde bimbo or jock. Anna Kendrick is sweet but too serious for the lead role of Beca. And her character is too dark. The plot is air thin - guys you've got to give the audience something a bit meatier to chew on. But all that seems to happen is that a group of shrill young women stand around messing up their rehearsals. The End. Great teen movies like Bring It On and Ten Things I Hate About You have some depth and meaning and feeling to balance the goofiness. This movie is pure sugar and that's not good for you.",4,25,40,9 February 2015
Green Book," Good film with a good heart
","Director Peter Farrelly succeeds in making his first serious drama. It's not perfect but it is captivating and entertaining. Viggo Mortensen, always an under-rated actor, is wonderful as chauffeur Tony 'the Lip' Vallelonga, who is from working class Bronx stock, and who has an amazing ability to deal with trouble as a night club bouncer. And as the very posh black concert pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali is also great, in portraying an emotionally repressed artist, who during his tour of the Deep South comes somewhat down to earth. Both men have their eyes opened and have something to teach the other. Some of the characters' darker sides, such as Tony's resorting to violence, and his mafia ties, are shown, and not glossed over, which is refreshing. There are one or two scenes that were a bit preachy, but overall it was a nicely shot and edited, and lovingly made film.",8,1,2,2 February 2019
Click," Still waiting for a good Adam Sandler movie
","I like Adam Sandler. But why does he always have to be the centre of his movies? Sometimes I feel that he would be better off on an ensemble cast. He can be overpowering. The supporting cast here is excellent, when they're allowed to shine. Christopher Walken, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and a surprisingly good David Hasselhoff. It's also annoying that women, once again, are sidekick 'babes' whose lives revolve around their men's needs. In this movie, like so many others in Hollywood, the middle aged white male is front and centre, and everyone else is incidental. This movie tries hard to be entertaining and witty, and it does have its moments. But there's too many self indulgent Adam Sandler moments for it to be totally enjoyable.",6,0,1,5 January 2020
Jackie Brown," Classy picture
","The movie Jackie Brown, adapted by Quentin Tarantino from the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch, is full of style and for me the best thing is that the actors and their characters all shine with intelligence. They might be doing dumb things, but at least in the case of characters such as flight attendant Jackie (Pam Grier) and police detective Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) they mull over their choices and try to do their best in life. As the wily small time gangsters, Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson provide ample comic relief, and even Bridget Fonda, as the gangsters' floozy, plays her part with petulant flair. The opening scene has to be singled out here as one of the most fabulous I've seen -- in which a determinedly steely Jackie, who is smuggling drugs, walks the length of an airport hall in her air hostess uniform. Pam Grier is surely one of the most under-rated actresses in history, and here she finally gets to shine. She is so smart, sassy and glamorous it's frankly criminal she hasn't had the breaks in the industry she deserves. She definitely has the X-factor, and Tarantino shows her off in almost every scene. Robert Forster, playing Jackie's prospective romantic partner and bail bondsman Max Cherry, is similarly under-rated as an actor. As Jackie tries to get herself out of the double-crossing criminal entanglement that is the film's premise, Max is there, first as an objective justice professional but eventually as a true friend who has fallen in love with her. As Max, Forster beautifully conveys, just with his facial expressions, his affection for Jackie, and Tarantino picks up on this and lingers on Max watching Jackie. It's all the sweeter for the fact that these two people are 'older'- - it's not a conventional love story but it's funny and touching.",7,1,3,20 November 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," Interesting film
","This wasn't a great film, but interesting enough. It's quite refreshing to focus on someone who doesn't triumph against the odds, someone who continually fails both as a person and in his career. In the end Llewyn doesn't come out of it looking wonderful; in fact the film gradually displays all his faults. And he doesn't appear to have many good points. He 'takes' a lot from others and doesn't give much in return. It's a light comedy in which we follow one week in his bumbling journey through life. The New York and Chicago weather is terrible, as if mirroring his bleak existence. I personally didn't love the folk music portrayed here. It seemed a bit bland to me, but it did seem to reflect the sort of songs that were never going to reach the heights of, say, Dylan's, but obviously attracted a solid local audience in their day. On the surface, the film says that maybe if Llewyn was a stronger character, went out and sought work and took notice of good advice and didn't miss so many opportunities, he could have made some kind of living and rent his own place. But was it just that he had bad luck? A bad agent? Friends and family that weren't supportive and encouraging? How much is a man's life his own effort, and how much is luck, seems to be a theme of the film.",7,1,2,31 January 2014
Joy," Not that great
","I like the wry humour of the family in Joy. The pacing is good. And Jennifer Lawrence is a very appealing actor, who is good at playing the steely, independent female hero. It seems to be all she plays. But although Joy is inoffensive, I don't think there's enough passion in the story to elevate this film above others. For one thing, it's way too similar in setting to Silver Linings Playbook. Of course Robert De Niro, as Joy's Dad, and Bradley Cooper, as the TV shopping channel manager, were also in Silver Linings with Lawrence. Fun for them, but a bit boring for the audience. The character Joy has a very caustic, critical family who rely on her for everything, but they do love her. But the film seems to say that in order to succeed in life, you have to be spectacularly successful in business. It's quite a materialistic view of the world. The garish, money-soaked TV shopping channel world here is seen as something quite normal. I guess for Joy it was the best way of getting her products to market, but it's not very heartwarming. The film is about how anyone living in some working class suburb with a lot of obstacles in her way can succeed with a lot if hard work and determination. It's kind of like a long advertisement for the American dream. But maybe Silver Linings Playbook was more convincing because it was about people who succeeded on a more humble, realistic level.",6,1,2,29 January 2016
Her," Interesting and original
","While I wouldn't say I was moved by this film, it's still a great achievement by Spike Jonze, who wrote and directed it. Shanghai is an amazing and refreshing choice in which to film a city of the future, in which there are so many people around and every convenience at our fingertips, but human connection is still elusive. The film asks many questions such as: what is a relationship? And, if loving a computer is delusional, then aren't some human relationships also contrived and delusional? And unlikely to last? Theodore goes on a date early in the film with a beautiful (real) young woman, but she cuts it short, disappointed with a perceived slight he made, accusing him of not looking for a relationship. It's really unfair, and totally random as well -- she acts just like a computer. Theodore's friend, Amy, confesses that like Theodore, she has made a computer friend, and she asks him, isn't any joy OK? Isn't it still joy? Theodore gets immense joy from a little computer generated hologram in his computer game, who is funny and crude. Who's to say that that joy isn't real? And if Theodore's job is to write fake letters for people unable to express themselves, is that morally questionable? Is it a sign of society's disconnect from our emotions, or is it, in fact, a sign that people care about one another and want to connect?",7,0,1,22 February 2014
The Wedding Singer," Great entertainment
","This is probably Adam Sandler's best film. You get the impression he is comfortable in this suburban world, and his character is not a total idiot; more an Everyman who's frustrated by his situation. It's a solid plot about how a wedding singer is engaged to the wrong woman, and who pines for unrealistic stardom, not valuing the great life he already has in his small town. The hairstyles and clothes are suitably bizarre. But for me, as a teenager of the 1980s, the real star is that glorious music. As well as pure pop, there's indie cool (Elvis Costello's Every Day I Write the Book), pounding disco (You Spin Me Round), and traditional Broadway (That's All). It's not pretty, it's not cool, but you marvel at how silly but catchy all those tunes were. I love the scene where Drew Barrymore bops along to David Bowie's strange hit China Girl on her Walkman. I like how this movie is very suburban. It doesn't pretend to be high class or pretty. It pokes fun at ordinary lives but it also celebrates them. There are some weird aspects -- the grandmother character and the Boy George lookalike -- but they are fun. There is never any serious doubt about the film's ending, and although the final scene is very cheesy, it's fun. What better symbol of the 1980s could you have than the real Billy Idol, as an unlikely matchmaker?",8,1,3,22 November 2016
Up in the Air," I like this movie
","I really like this movie. At first I found the locations -- airports, airplanes and boardrooms -- jarringly clinical. But I guess they do serve to make a point. Here is a world in which humans are expected to detach from their real world and from their soul and family and act like robots in the service of company profits. The acting is great but it's the script and direction that shines. To me, the scene that sums up the movie is when George Clooney's character, the businessman who flies around the world firing people, is ecstatic to finally meet his goal of massive frequent flyer points. And all he wins are a few trinkets, and a meeting with an airline executive clearly amused at how anyone would be excited by such a feat. It's obscene how meaningless the achievement is. Yet many of us pursue such marketing trifles as meaningful goals in our lives. Hilarious, when you think about it. The George Clooney character has charisma, and he is smart and resourceful and yet he has this horrible job that devastates people he doesn't know, and he is a master at repressing any empathy, at not seeing them as human beings. And the move shows how he pays a heavy price, personally, as well. But does he, himself, realise that? The final scene, to me, is a masterpiece, because it shows how he does have a choice in this bizarre world. And what is he going to choose? It's a choice all of us have -- to engage with the world, or detach from it. To act ethically or unethically. To try to put down roots, or stay up in the air.",8,0,0,1 July 2014
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Great comedy
","The excellent cast go all-out to be as silly as possible in this great Will Ferrell vehicle (excuse the pun). Ferrell plays his usual outrageously spoiled man-child (as in Anchorman) who is forced to grow up when his hi jinks catch up with him and he's cast out of his successful world. For me, though, the funniest character is the French racing star played by Sacha Baron-Cohen - a hysterical portrait of a pompous snob who reads Camus and sips coffee in his car while casually overtaking the Nascar field, and who freaks out everyone in the bigoted, good old boys racing scene with his gay lifestyle. But like Anchorman, there are so many great scenes, such as when Ricky Bobby's bimbo wife switches to his best friend (John C. Reilly) when Ricky is losing; any scenes Jane Lynch is in, as Ferrell's mother; or the way Ricky unashamedly advertises everything from cake mix to tampons. The movie is just full of steady, reliable laughs.",8,1,1,23 February 2015
