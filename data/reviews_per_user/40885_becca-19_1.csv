Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," bored throughout...
","i 'hoe-hummed' throughout the entire movie...  the characters(human) were not allowed to develop... too much time was spent with the 'virtual' creations... i like my emotions to 'ride' with at least 1 heroic person/or underdog... here, there was no time to get to 'know' even 1... it was a movie full of 'flash' and no 'substance'... making it a waste of my time and money... (side note... i went home after seeing this, and watched the original 3 episodes, just to help 'undo' the mood this new movie put me in... but... only time will help me now...).  GIVE ME MORE CHARACTER DEPTH IN THE NEXXT FILM !!!!!!!!!",3,0,1,5 July 1999
