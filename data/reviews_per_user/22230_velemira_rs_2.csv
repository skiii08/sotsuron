Blade Runner 2049," I got lost
","It was like when you're reaching for something in the dark. You know it is there, you reach for it but could not touch it. And you get lost. It was too misty. Like the idea in the director's head wasn't clear enough. The acting was amazing. But it couldn't compensate the missing point. I'm sure some people would love it but it's definitely not my kind of movie.",3,3,5,7 January 2018
Watchmen," Didn't get it
","One of the worst titles I have ever seen! The story was lost in all the blood in it. I didn't get it (may be it is my fault). I like films about super heroes, but not this one. The end was unexpected (I admit that), there are some good sentences that people can learn, but... I didn't like the director's point of view. There was too much darkness. Like forgetting for the script and redeem it with battles and killing. Too much pessimism in a story about heroes. This is my point of view. It was different from other super heroes pictures. Different in a way I didn't like. It was like watching a storm on the sky, you see sometimes rays of light, but after all it still remains an awful storm, leaving you in bad mood. Sorry!",2,4,8,28 February 2014
