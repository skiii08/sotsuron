Ford v Ferrari," Into racing or not. MUST SEE!!!
",I dont write many reviews but when I do it's either because a movie was an absolute waste of my time or the movie was so good I had to try and let other people know! Luckily this is one of those movies I want other people to know about! To start off it doesnt hurt that I love cars and auto racing but that is beside the point. This 2 and 1/2 movie had mine and everyone else in the theaters attention from beginning to end!!! 2 and 1/2 hours felt like 30 minutes and even though the ending was very good it left me wanting more! That being said from the casting to the script writing and action scenes this movie is amazing and definitely worth the watch!!!,10,1,3,18 November 2019
Green Book," A Fresh breath of air we all could use!
",I only write reviews on movies when I feel they truly earn it and this movie truly earned it. A movie of true friendship not bond by a cruel society. Not everything has to be or turn out negative in this world and this movie just goes to show that. Truly a great movie and a must watch!!!,10,1,3,24 December 2019
