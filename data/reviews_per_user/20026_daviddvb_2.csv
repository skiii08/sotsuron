Ali," the best director of his generation has outdone himself once again.
","The best director of his generation has outdone himself once again. Mann's unmatched skills in image composition (is there any director who is more skilled in working with wide-screen images ?)reached a peek with the brilliant THE INSIDER. As impossible as it may sound, Mann has even improved since then. The stunning acting performance, delivered by the whole cast, combined with Mann's talent, deliver what will easily be the best film of 2002 (In Belgium Ali was released in march 2002).",10,0,0,12 March 2002
Donnie Darko," the biggest surprise of the year
","This year's biggest surprise, an excellent cross between 'grand tour - disaster in time', 'Welcome to the doll house' and 'Twin Peaks'. An intelligent, well-directed and gripping experiment. This young director's name is one to remember.",8,0,0,19 April 2002
