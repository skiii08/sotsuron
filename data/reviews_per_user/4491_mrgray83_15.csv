Spartacus," The most unKubrickian Kubrick project......but it still delivers.
","Spartacus follows the time of the rebel Spartacus' life starting with his life as a slave, then gladiator, then rebel, and finally leading up to his crucifixion. This film was directed by Stanley Kubrick, but if you're a hardcore Kubrick film like myself, you'll have a hard time believing it. Is it beautiful? Yes, the photography of the film is pretty top notch. Is the camera work Kubrick? To a certain degree. It's not full force Kubrick. I interpreted this as a laid back Kubrick style of filming. And the fact that he didn't write the screenplay had a lot to do with it I'm sure. Can I praise Kirk Douglas enough for his portrayal of Spartacus? I don't think so. Kirk gives one of the best performances of his career that I've seen. I still can't place his acting here above his acting in Paths of Glory though. Another great actor here is Jean Simmons, who is a hottie for real. She is absolutely beautiful. Another thing about the movie is that even though, it's over 3 hours long, I found the pacing very well done. I never found myself bored because the film has powerful dialog, which is another big plus.10/10 Highly recommended.",10,3,6,1 May 2005
Casablanca," Here's looking at YOU kid.
","I had heard that phrase quoted on countless warner bros cartoons for countless years, but I never knew it came from Casablanca. And I've made it almost to 22 years old without seeing it. Now that I have I wonder what I was thinking putting it off for so long. Casablanca is a story about a club owner named Rick. He at one time had a love thing going on with a woman who thought that her husband was dead. Upon learning that he is alive she leaves Rick abruptly and tells him that he can never see him again. I'm not gonna go on and on with the story because it just spoils it and plus this is a review not a plot summary. The story is spellbinding, and we have some of the best dialog in the world displayed here for your listening pleasure. I'm a sucker for a film with just overly exceptional dialog.10/10(What else?) If you haven't seen this film, stop kidding around and go give it a look see. If you have seen it, go see it again.A Kiss is but a kiss..........",10,2,3,19 February 2005
Constantine," A Rambling Mess of a film.
","Constantine is my new candidate for the worst film of 2005 until someone comes along and takes its place. Hopefully no one will come along any time soon. This film suffers from pitiful character development for one. We don't even really care for the hero. His job seems to be something in the line of battling demons and satiring The Exorcist(1974). Though I was happy to see him in a film, Pruit Taylor Vince's character didn't serve any purpose. I was laughing at his death scene and I was happy when it was over. The other problem with the film is that there are plot holes everywhere. I guess the movie was aimed at fans of the comics and no one else because there are a lot of things that aren't quite explained.My synopsis. 4/10 This film is a complete and total mess with some cgi thrown in.The only reason it got a 4 from me was because of the direction and the cinematography, both of which were pretty impressive. Everything else on the other hand, nada!!!",4,2,6,15 March 2005
Ed Wood," One of the best movies I've ever seen.
","And quite easily one of the top 10 of the 90's. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, Jr in Tim Burton's Ed Wood, which is a recreation of the now famed director's early plight into getting his films made. His films are shunned in Hollywood when they are made because they mostly contain stock footage and Ed Wood seems to have an obsession with doing only 1 take in his films no matter how atrocious the scene goes, telling everyone that 'It's Perfect' when it's anything but. As I've stated, I think that this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's doesn't feed you a lot of nonsense like most of the films do these days. It tells what is pretty close to how I perceive Hollywood really works. I'm pretty sure they took some artistic liberties with parts of the story, because some things seem a little far fetched even for a film about Ed Wood's life, but all in all, I liked it. It's very well made. And Martin Landau should be applauded for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Absolutely amazing. I recommend this film to any and everyone. Knockout cast. Knockout story.I rate it 9/10",9,1,1,10 February 2005
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick takes on the Vietnam War and the duality of man.
","This film will endlessly be compared to Oliver Stone's Platton which was released the year before it. I place Full Metal Jacket above Platoon only marginally. There's something about the way Stanley Kubrick shot that makes it stand above other films based during war times. One scene that sticks out in my mind is the one where the platoon is standing around the dead bodies of two of their fallen comrades in a circle. Kubrick places the camera in the middle of them so that it shoots a low angle shot looking into their faces. He then has them to say a single farewell statement to the fallen soldiers. The beauty in this is that the statements express each soldiers personification. I'm reminded of Citizen Kane, where the entire dialog of that film reflects each person's personification. Every time a word is uttered it reflects their personality and yet the dialog is as believable as they come. What Kubrick did in the scene I just mentioned is a simplified version of that method but it works wonderfully. He proves that it it possible to develop characters with few words and with even fewer actions.This film is magnificent. Is it Kubrick's best? No. Is it his most beautiful? No. 2001 will always have that spot in my heart. Is it a classic? You'd better believe it.10/10 Highly recommended.",10,2,4,30 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Without a doubt, the best installment in the series.
","I'll never understand why there is so much hype placed on the other installments of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The Fellowship of the Ring gives us the most interesting characters. An untouchable story line. It's the closest to perfection that the lotr series has come. One thing that makes The Fellowship better than the other installments to me was the shortage of fight sequences. The fight sequences killed The Return of the King for me. They just went on and on. It seemed that Peter Jackson just used them to unnecessarily fill up time in the film. However, Fellowship sticks mainly to it's characters, not a lot of cgi battles. We get the best character development in the fellowship, the best acting, best story. The only thing I don't like about Fellowship is that it seems to be a rather poor adaption of the book. The first time I read FOTR by Tolkien, I couldn't even finish it because it was so far from the film. I guess what I was feeling was disgust. I'm going to finish the book one of these days, but as for now?? Fellowship 8/10 The other installments 7/10",8,0,2,27 January 2005
Armageddon," Mindless Summer Blockbuser. But still entertaining.
","Armageddon is the story of a team of oil drillers who end up becoming a space crew that must destroy an asteroid the size of Texas which will destroy the earth. There, I just gave you the whole film synopsis in a nutshell. This is one of those flicks where you just have to sick back and enjoy it. You have to throw some of the things you expect from serious filming to the curve because it is obvious that the directors did the same thing.The film defines what a summer film should be. Mindless and more mindless while making the audience laugh and cry. There is a saying that the majority of the nation's moviegoers go to the movies to get a break from reality. Moviegoers want to be shocked. They want to laugh. To cry. To have their life changed. But I digress. On with the review. We have explosions. Explosions. And in case you missed it the first time, more explosions. There are plenty of laughs, witty lines, and funny situations. And unless you're some stone hearted person, the ending of the film will get a tear or two from you. I thought the montage of Harry Stamper's daughter's life(which is in turn his life in a way) flashing before his eyes before he blows up the asteroid(and gives his life as a result) is one of the most touching moments of film I've ever seen. It always makes me emotional. I highly regret not seeing this film in theaters.7/10",7,1,2,7 April 2005
"I, Robot"," How can the amazing cgi of a film be it's primary saving grace?
","When the film in question is I, Robot starring Will Smith. I'm inclined quite heavily to compare it to Terminator 3 at times. Both T3 and I, Robot have something dear in common. They are both summer movies. While entertaining and sometimes visually captivating, summer movies tend to suffer greatly from subpar acting and laugh-out-loud bad dialog. I, Robot is no exception. Let's look at Will Smith, who basically plays the same character here that he played in The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I really saw no difference. If you hadn't seen Ali, you would think this guy had no acting range at all. Of course he has his usual overuse of bad jokes and the director feels the need to get a close up shot of him delivering them. The movie seems to almost depend on Will Smith, as if the writers and directors knew it was a less than substantial movie, but it didn't matter because they were getting Will Smith to be the lead, and let's face it, Will Smith draws crowds. Another thing, the only character I really felt for was the robot that dr lanning had created and programmed real feelings into. Everybody else was so busy spitting moronic dialog and telling lame jokes to even care what happened to them.On a high note, the CGI here is very impressive. Now when you're praising a film's CGI more than you're praising it's actors, Hollywood is in serious trouble. *snicker* I give it a 6/10 IMO it's good to see once but no more than that. Will Smith does his usual routine. There are some nice special effects done with the cgi, but that's the highlight of the film.",6,0,0,19 February 2005
Spider-Man," Big Budget B Movie
","This film has raked in a truckload of cash and a score of great reviews. Well, it seems that I'll have to be the exception. I didn't contribute one cent to this film's theatrical release and I am not about to write a glowing review of it.Spiderman is without a doubt one of the funniest unintentional comedies I have ever come across. This film has some of the most unbelievable dialog that has ever been put to film. It doesn't quite border on Ed Wood quality but it's the thing that keeps me laughing through the whole thing.The acting was so so but I don't blame the actors too much. With dialog that bad, the script couldn't have been much to jump up and down about.I wouldn't recommend this unless you like the 'so bad it's good' films like I do. And also there are some nice shots of Kirsten Dunce scattered throughout.6/10",6,1,2,30 April 2005
American History X," Strong Subject. Strong Film.
","American History X follows the life of a man who becomes a nazi skinhead after his father is murdered while putting out a fire in a run down black neighborhood, so you can see where he develops his prejudice. I don't think he is justifiable in his prejudice, but that's what caused it. He has a younger brother who looks up to him very much and hangs on to his every word. The older brother is sent to jail for murdering two blacks who were attempting to steal his vehicle and while in jail he learns the error of his ways and how much heartbreak he has caused his family. Upon returning back home, he finds out that his little brother is following in his footsteps.This is a wonderful film with strong acting, primarily Edward Norton as the lead. Highly recommend it.10/10 obviously",10,0,1,24 February 2005
Saw," A lot better than I expected.
","Saw is a thriller about a sick minded individual who kidnaps a person who has a disregard for life and subjects them to a game in which they have a set amount of time to save themselves, or they will be killed. Only the sick minded individual won't be the one to do the killing. Pretty good flick. Not that much blood and guts in this one but it's not necessary to go overboard on gore to get a good thriller film made. I saw in the trivia that Saw was going to be sent straight to video, but it got a positive screening so it was given a theatrical run. It does have a straight to video feel to it when you watch it, but nonetheless it delivers. As in any straight to video film, you don't expect much from the acting, but the acting in Saw was pretty much on point. Pretty neat twist at the end as well. I didn't see it coming, and maybe you won't either. If you haven't already, give Saw a day in court so to speak.8/10",8,0,1,19 February 2005
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Film, Story, you name it.....
","A Beautiful Mind covers the life of master mathematician John Nash starting with his tenure in college and ends with his winning of the Nobel Prize in 1994. I almost didn't watch the whole film, I'll admit. The beginning seemed a bit too slow to me and the story was almost on the brink of boring. So I just rewound it and put another flick in. I had no intention of watching it again because I didn't see what the big fuss was, except for Jennifer Connely. But after a while I decided to watch the whole movie all the way through. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe turn in some truly outstanding performances. This movie was the first time that I saw Crowe in a movie and he did a brilliant job. Connely is always great(she was the real reason I decided to watch the film in the first place. Without giving too much away, John Nash suffers from some truly disturbing schizophrenic hallucinations.He does some decoding work for the government and then afterwards thinks he's being followed by a guy in a suit and tie(played by Ed Harris in another of the film's outstanding performances), a roommate who moves in with him, and the roommate's niece. All of which are figments of his imagination. The hallucinations never leave him throughout his life, but he learns to deal with them, due in part to the patience and love that his wife(played by Connely) for him. She stood her ground and held out when a lot of wives would have thrown the deuces.Amazing film. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT.10/10",10,0,1,3 April 2005
Psycho," Hitchcock has yet to disappoint me.
","I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10. A definite classic in my book.",10,4,7,19 February 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The number one Stephen king adaption of all time.
","Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.",10,3,6,15 March 2005
Rear Window," You could tell Hitchcock was missing from the screenplay, but other than that....
","this film is still top notch. Hitchcock isn't missing from the directing chair for one second. A man is bound to a wheelchair after a runway accident and spends the better part of his days viewing the many happenings of his neighbors across the way from him, thanks to his rear window. It's a perfect view of everyone their. There's a very attractive young lady who's very much into dancing. An older couple who have developed a simple little system so that they can allow their pet dog to be 'let out' so to speak from the 3rd floor balcony, and there is a couple who constantly seems to be arguing about something. This is the couple that become intricate to the story. Eventually the wife disappears and the wheelchair bound man becomes obsessed with the idea that the wife has been murdered. What follows is a buildup which is Hitchcock all the way. Nobody builds suspense like him, and even though I was disappointed by the ending because I was kind of hoping for more of a twist, it's still pretty powerful. I highly recommend. It was pretty obvious to me that Hitchcock didn't write the screenplay, and I kind of wish he had, although what we have is still one of the best ever written. Highly recommend this film.9/10",9,1,3,14 March 2005
