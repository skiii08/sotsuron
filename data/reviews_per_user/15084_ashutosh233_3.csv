Iron Man 3," Not half as good as the last two.
","Just went to watch Iron Man 3...I gotta say, I am rather disappointed.I won't give away any of the plot (there isn't much of one), but overall, you're only likely to be satisfied if you're expecting mindless action and admittedly superb, stunning visual effects throughout. The 3- D is OK, but it's the type where not much seems to change (except you only seeing 40% of the usual photons you would). The score is typical of such films; as for the acting, Ben Kingsley is a great actor (as far as his role allows him to be), and the rest just about manage to keep up. I was mentally comparing Mandarin to Bane in that I expected him to be a great presence on screen, and a menacing, worthy opponent to Tony Stark. However, I was sorely disappointed. The main villain in the film has such a typical, immature backstory that I could have written a better one in my sleep. Literally. I can type with my eyes shut.RDJ does not disappoint, but once again, his full talent feels restrained in this one. The storyline is rambling and incoherent, and ultimately dissatisfactory.The movie itself is full of tropes and typical scenarios; the humour is not as genuine or natural as in the previous installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job on The Avengers 2.All in all, you're only likely to enjoy this motion picture if you thought The Avengers was a good movie. And if you're the type that can say 'The Avengers (the Marvel one) was a good movie!' without being sarcastic, well, you'll like Iron Man 3 just fine.",7,11,22,29 April 2013
Life of Pi," An aesthetically dynamic motion picture, lacking in quality.
","The Life of Pi.An average motion picture overall, it is not a story to garner much critical acclaim. However, the cinematography was above par, and the 3-D effects, for once, were truly worth it. Sadly, the actors were either not too skilled, or were given roles that did not allow for much creative expression. Most of the shock and awe of the film were delivered through the use of sublime CGI and visuals.The score was beautifully rendered, and the journey of the young boy through the mighty oceans can be seen as being metaphorically deep, but it lacked in substance nonetheless.Watch it once for the beautiful vision of one man, nothing else.3.5/5",7,1,4,11 December 2012
Man of Steel," A fairly excellent summer blockbuster.
","Man of Steel. Without any spoilers, this is how it was for me: The non-linear storytelling is a nice format; though it's not particularly well done, it serves the purpose. The visual effects and overall CG are the best I have ever seen in any motion picture or video. Any motion picture so far, hands down. All the fights and flying scenes are hyper-real, and whenever lasers were involved, I found myself audibly gasping. However, after a little while, it tends to get a wee bit tedious. The relationships in the movie are not particularly well developed, and some people are stupid/helpless enough at times that you want to scream at them. -_- Especially unconvincing is the 'bond' between Superman/Lois. Though there are no plot-holes per se, the story is fairly predictable, but then it is Superman after all. :) The dialogues serve their purpose but are OK at best. The score by Zimmer is excellent, though nothing new for him. My only main complaint was that this movie, in a way, compromised Superman's ideology of maintaining peace and order while stopping his villains; not once in any previous movie or graphic novel has he deliberately or otherwise caused this large a scale of random destruction. Sure, his enemies were overpowered and what not, but he should have been shown to try and be more cautious is all. Overall, quite a visual treat; some scenes could have been cut, but it's well worth the money either way.",7,1,5,17 June 2013
