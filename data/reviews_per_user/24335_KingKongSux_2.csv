Marie Antoinette," Oh my god...
","I watched this movie during a long 12 hour flight from Tokyo to Detroit, and afterwards I wanted to jump out of my seat and into the Pacific Ocean.This was soooo boring.. I don't understand how anyone could rate this thing above a 1.The only reason I watched it til the end was to see Kirsten Dunst get her head chopped off.. And that didn't even happen..Awful.. Just awful.I never thought anything could be worse than King Kong, until I watched this..",1,6,10,29 March 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Pros and Cons
","Pros:(1) Oompa Loompa's and their songs are actually pretty cool.(2) Visuals are stunning!Cons:1) Acting VERY one-dimensional. Neither parent seemed to care that something horrible had befallen their kids. And Johnny Depp's character was just plain boring.2) Script very boring. Dialogue was dumb and unnecessary to a point. Movie would be just the same, if not better, if no one even spoke. If not for the amazing visual effects, it would be hard to keep any kind of interest.Overall:O.k. to watch if nothing else around. First 30 minutes and last 30 minutes of this film are very uninteresting and really boring. If nothing else, watch the Oompa Loompa sequences which are great.",4,1,4,25 January 2006
