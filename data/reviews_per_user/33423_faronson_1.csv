Ghost," Highly Overrated
","I saw this film when it came out, as it was being recommended by everyone I knew.  I found the 'romance' to be forced and contained little to no chemistry.  It was nothing more than a poorly constructed and thinly veiled 'who-done-it.'  I knew 'who done it' half way through the film and there was really nothing left to watch after that.  I won't even get into my opinion that it wasn't particularly well acted.  That this film made it to the top 20 of the American Film Institutes 100 Great Love Stories is a sad commentary on our culture.For a truly passionate romance that contains some of the same elements without the muddling influence of a murder mystery, see 'Truly, Madly, Deeply,'  which came out around the same time.  Among other things, the acting is magnificent.",1,10,26,12 June 2002
