The Ring," Crazy People
",I've never seen a guy weep.... until I saw the ring with a couple of friends. I couldn't sleep normal for a week and I still lay at night thinking about that nasty face of her's.... This is the scariest movie ever made (I hope I spelled it right),7,1,1,12 January 2004
The Last Emperor," eminent
","A real masterpiece. It really grabs you by the wrist and pulls you back to the old China. I was amazed by the size of everything and it makes you want to go to the forbidden city. I need to see it myself! Although the end was very sudden and unexpected, I enjoyed it very much!",8,1,1,13 October 2003
