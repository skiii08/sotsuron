Moneyball," Slow, Poorly Directed, Poorly Acted
","This movie is a dud. It's not a baseball movie, nor are there deep insights into the stats-based approach Beane made famous. Numerous plot lines go undeveloped -- Bean and his daughter; Beane and Howe; Bean and the Red Sox offer. There are scenes that make you want to scream 'cut' because they go too long with nothing happening. Pitt's performance is skin deep.Beane's approach to the game was based on Bill James' early work in statistical analysis. We see a photo of Bill James in the movie, but that's it.",2,6,14,4 February 2012
