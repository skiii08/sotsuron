Marie Antoinette," What were you hoping to see?
","I wonder if the low rating on this movie has to do with peoples' expectations. If you were hoping for an accurate, crystal clear historical drama, then you ought to look somewhere else. If you were looking for a well done piece of cinema, then come on in. I'll break my review down into a few different categories. Cinematography: 10/10 this film was beautifully shot. Ms. Coppola was very skillful in her use of colors, angles, clarity, and whatever other magic she invoked to make this movie so visually pleasing. Script: 6/10 The film came off as fairly taciturn. There's nothing wrong with that, but when characters did venture to speak, they didn't say anything particularly profound. Realism: 6/10 I gave it more than a five because I think that the point of this film's seeming disconnect from reality was deliberate and employed for the purpose of expressing the queen's own selfishness and obliviousness. I was bothered by the fact that the film showed little of the struggle that the lower class citizens of France faced -- until I realized that was partially the purpose of the film.Acting: 7/10 I think all the supporting characters did very well. Kirsten Dunst was a good Marie Antoinette, although some of her speaking scenes were less convincing :| I think I'll come out and say it, I don't think she's very good at speaking parts. She is lovely and uses facial expressions to tell her story, but as far as verbal execution, there is much to be desired. Sorry! Jason Schwartzman did an excellent job. I loved his and Dunst's scenes together. This film had many familiar faces and I really enjoyed their performances. Music: 8/10 I haven't checked other reviews, but i imagine that there were some boo-hooers that disliked the director's choice to include rock music. I liked it because for the modern day viewer, rock signifies rebellion, fun, youth and carelessness. WHICH PERSONIFIES MARIE ANTOINETTE. Also, there's a violin piece that's comically used several times which I appreciated. Summary: I think this film is excellent for anyone like myself who enjoys beauty. I would have liked a little more introspection by Marie Antoinette, but I think that the director/writers were trying to keep the film somewhat unbiased by not imposing too much of their own interpretations on the viewer. While not a perfect film, it is a lovely one.",8,0,1,21 November 2016
