First Man," Incredible film charting the life of an incredible man
","Just been to see this film about Neil Armstrong and his incredible journey and eventual stepping onto the moon. The cinematography was spectacular as was the score, it brought tears to my eyes and an amazing feeling of accomplishment for mankind. Yes i know it wasn't me that stepped onto the moon but mankind did and This film was reasonably untouched with regards its content to actual events which i might add were nearly 50 years ago. This film is a keeper and i rarely rate a movie a 10 but this film warrants it for many reasons including Acting, Content and the score. It certainly did not feel like i was sat there for 2 hours and 20 minutes, it kept me very much entertained and i left the cinema feeling uplifted.... Go see it, its fabulous",10,3,13,12 October 2018
Home Alone," hilarious fun film
","How old is this film? well the day i'm writing this its actually 28 years old but it really holds its own in the world of big cinematic releases at this time of year. Actually i cannot really think of any recent Christmas orientated films that come close to this.Its Child star is Macaulay Culkin is a very good actor who with his funny expressions and fun characteristics make it a 10/10 for me. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern really do add a very comedic side to it all.Story is a family all rushing to get to the airport and what happens? they leave a kid behind Home alone, meanwhile the street they live on is having a spate of burglaries and when they get to the child's house they are in for a big surprise.This really is side splitting funny, maybe a Laurel And Hardy take on things will give you some idea of the capers that occur... great film with a laugh a minute.",10,1,2,20 December 2018
Black Mass," Acting was just incredible and the film matched it...
","Firstly i won't fill an A4 page of telling you all about the film for you to then go and watch it know every twist and turn. a review to me is a outline and small snippet of info with regards acting and content and so what about Black Mass? well it tells the story of James 'Whitey' Bulger, an Irish Mob godfather and a true story. Films based on true events are usually enthralling and pull you into it if they are well written and this was an example of great writing coupled with good directing. The Acting was out of this world, i mean Johnny Depp always pulls an audience but this was a much different role to his normal acting parts and he was the best. Not only credit to Depp is Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson and Kevin Bacon who all made a great cast and a film i would recommend to anyone. its a 2 hour film but would have gladly sat in the cinema for another hour it was that good. i gave this film a 10 star but would give it over that any day. just go see it or get on the Bluray.",10,1,4,20 February 2016
Doctor Strange," Doctor doctor
","Well it's unusual I must say but visually Great, unlike the many reviews on here slating it as it's just not like the 'marvel they know' I think as stories go it we good.It's a lot different to previous marvels as it's not a superhero saving people or the planet as such but I got that from the outset. It's only similarity to other mavel films is the fact of the main character getting hurt bad and through magical healing he gets supered up.Take it on its own merits, don't compare to others before and after and you will like it.Overall an entertaining print, great cgi and visually exciting",9,0,0,23 October 2018
Full Metal Jacket," A war film to beat them all
","Firstly I have to tell you two things...Firstly I rate this as my all time top film so I may be a tad biased and secondly this year is really the first year that I became a reviewer and this review marks my 100th review so reserved this for my top film do it.Well the film is spit into two with the first half we are at marine training and the 2nd half actually In Vietnam.Directed by the fabulous Stanley Kubrick and with many not so famous actors but some of the best acting around, you could not have seen a better film. The first half has you laughing in part but incredibly sad at the way some of these marines are brought up to fighting status. In particular we see one man totally broken by it and this takes us to a harrowing scene and the beginning of the second half.What we get in the second half is not a massive amount of action and it kinda follows around 5 main characters that have survived the humiliation, gutsy training and sheer brutality in the first half. They with their patrol come across an isolated small battle for their life and that's both physical and mental and for me with the score one of great mental horror...a simple scene but so damned powerful and strong.This film was actually 98% filmed around 3 miles from my home in London England along the Thames in Docklands where a regeneration programme to build new homes was taking place...I could actually hear the bombs going of when they were filming it and didn't know what it was till I saw it mentioned in local news.It's frickin awesome, powerful, sad, angry and as I said one of the best war films there are....",10,1,2,21 December 2018
LÃ©on: The Professional," Masterpiece
","Absolutely marvellous masterpiece and a high IMDB rating to prove it. I have over the years seen this a few times and it just gets better with age. You could put this film alongside any modern thriller and it's stands the test of time and although 24 years old it's not dated at all.Jean Reno is excellent the the role of assassin and the very young Natalie Portman plays the orphan child so so well which I guess added to her repertoire would serve her well for future film casts and has.It's a great thriller which is on medium burn and coasts along just nicely. The story is great and has a little twist or two and an explosive start and end.Overall a truly great film, great acting and a feasable storyline given the location it's set in.",10,1,1,28 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Who wants to live forever
","Just been to see this and i have booked to go see it again next week, why? because it is absolutely spellbinding. I grew up in the days when Queen was at its peak and although not the biggest musical influence in my Life (David Bowie took the top spot for me) they were a much loved band. I Went to see them at Wembley Stadium for their 'Its a Kind Of Magic' tour and that blew me away and this movie did the same to me.I wont go over the entire synopsis like others seem to do but just give the review... The film is a Biopic of the Band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury and it gets it right. The story looks after itself and the humour and drama lead on from that. I had tears several times as it reminded me of an era in my life where Aids was in the headlines a lot. The laughs are good and this is seen throughout. The people starring as the band are incredibly similar in looks and by the end of the film i had forgot that they were not the real band.overall the music was great, the acting was very good and the story well acted out to facts. i gave this title a 10 but it would deserve higher. if you can go see this film it has made a wowie of an impact for me.",10,33,55,25 October 2018
Bird Box," Don't look....
","Saw this film advertised a while back and being a horror/sci-fi lover just had to see it and last night I saw it and it was as good as I thought it would be.The story follows a small group of people that come together over a short space of time who are looking to survive a strange unseen presence that has occurred worldwide that forces people to take their own lives should they go opened eyed anywhere.This group first hide out in a house and shuttet all windows to block out the daylight and secure themselves in. They make trips out In certain ways and get supplies but generally they stay hidden. One day a walkie talkie of theirs springs to life and a man tells them there is a safe place but to get there they must fight for survival and blindfolded all the way.The group it whittled down slowly and it ends up with one woman (Sandra Bullock) and two small children to make that journey.It's similar to the film 'The Happening' and it's a pretty good story. It's not very fast paced nor boringly slow, it trickles along nicely and kept my attention.Overall a good story and some great acting all round.",9,1,4,28 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Goodbye Hogwarts
","The end is nigh....part of me was sad to find out that the final story was to be split in two, I had religiously followed the series from day one at the cinema and thought it so cruel to make us all wait to see the end. But then looking back I am so happy they did, there would have been so much cut if not split as this is a long ending, not really complex but long.In this penultimate part we see Harry, Hermione and Ron make the split from Hogwarts as they seek further Horcruxes that they need to destroy to weaken Lord Voldemort and hopefully end his hold. Voldermort now has control over Hogwarts and the ministry of magic. Things are at their Darkest point now.The trio travel alone foiling those after them at every opportunity and it's harder on them with personal challenges that affect them.greatly. nowhere is safe and they must have their wits about them.This film sees many things that we have seen used before brought to the fore including their mode of transport holding hands to travel fast and far. What surprises me is the fact that the invisabikity cloak is not around anymore as that would prove a useful tool to have.There is some loss of characters in this one and we are witnessing the end of a wonderful series....there are sad times ahead for sure.",10,0,0,9 December 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," She's good
","Watched this tonight and at first I didn't see the connections nor where it was leading us as the audience but then it all clicked into place and the film excelled all my expectations.It's a tad horrible to see any woman violated in any way but the nasty scenes were rewarded with the revenge. What I don't want to do is tell you the whole of the film and reams of why the Swedish version is better...da da da...I watched this film on its own merits and I am so glad I did, it's got a great story, some good action and with good actors it won me over.Overall a great film with content and character.",9,1,2,1 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Even wizards go to jail
","Ok it's pretty hard to review each of the potter films as I am a firm believer that a review is not content of the entire film but a mere glimpse and critique of the story and actors. With there being 8 what can I say when I love them all equally, but here goes.This is the third instalment of J K Rowlings wonderful series and it's pretty darn exciting. It's based around a character named Serious Black who may have had a hand in the murder of Harry's parents some 11 years before.There are many things that Harry and his friends have to get through in this including the Dementors and a creature that looks like a huge flying turkey. Throw in a werewolf and a demonic tree and its fun fun fun.As usual we have an incredibly huge all star cast and a story which unfolds and from start to finish a great many special effects to wow you.A film of pure fantasy and not just for kids, I for one will always treasure these films and continue to rewatch them year after year.Overall a great story, great acting, a film that sets your imagination free.",10,1,1,19 November 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Civil war between two?
","Well the title of this film with 'civil war' is a bit over the top, I say this as I am not a massive follower of Marvel having only started watching marvel this year but civil war it isn't it's between a few of the Marvel characters and headed at the realm of each team is Captain America and Iron man.Having said that the film was filled with CGI generated action. The story is one of politics within the Avengers being that the government want them to have them only avenging when they want them too. You know kinda like any government lol. The avengers are split and war breaks out. It's well worth a watch and as marvel films go it's one of the better ones. Acting great, good (kinda how governments interfere) story visually perfect",10,0,1,18 October 2018
Ocean's Eleven," What a Line Up
","I confess that i Have only seen this today for the first time and its 17 years old and i really liked it. It was through recently going to the cinema to see Oceans 8 that i thought it a good idea to see its humble beginnings all be it with an all male version. This film is about 11 guys carrying out the impossible, robbing 3 casinos simultaneously using clever wit, skilled technical work, Brut force and charisma.Well they pulled it off, there are some mini twists and some Humour along the way. Its just short of 2 hours and its just the right length, an hour to get to know those involved and see the plans coming about and the next 50 minutes to execute it, just perfect.Overall a great film and well executed, great all star cast and not too involved nor hard to hard to understand.",8,0,1,19 November 2018
Batman Begins," Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it's Batman
","Ok so I write this today some 13 years after it's release, I saw it upon release back in the day and rated it a 9 and would give it the same today and this being my 4th time watching it I still love it.I did scan other reviews and I found so many that must be written by younger people than the actual film as they probably only ever had super CGI in their lives. I also saw some hugely long reviews telling us the whole film from start to finish. A review is not a synopsis, it's a bit about what you like or dislike about the film. Having said that here is my little review.This is the birth of Batman, his beginning and the start of a journey that takes us through 3 films and it does it so well. The cast is huge and the A list is vast. The actor that shone out for me is Michael Caine. Not because his scenes were big but because I class him as gold, one of the best.The film has a great story from the start to the finish, it has good actors, some great CGI and wasn't too long. It got us to knowing the roots of this trilogy. The good overcome the bad in the end but that's to be expected. Well worth a purchase or watch",9,0,0,24 October 2018
The Dark Knight," Kapow
","What can I say about this print.....well firstly it's a great 2nd film in a fabulous trilogy about the man who suffered loss as a child and became our superhero...i watched Batman on TV as a child and thought that he was so cool and a hero and now some 4 decades later I see this Batman and he is still my hero. The film leads on from the first film but could stand alone from that.This has another great actor in Heath Ledger who plays the Joker and he plays it so well. This is a film that is full of action from start to finish, never a dull moment and a film that if you leave the room for a minute you miss a key point. Having said that it's easy to follow.This film bridges the three films nicely, overall entertaining, great acting and it's cat and mouse between Batman and the Joker all the way. A great action flick.",10,0,1,27 October 2018
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," He is back I tell you
",It's year 5 at Hogwarts and another increase in the darkness we begin to feel. There is also further growing up of our Harry and friends with romance taking a small instep.The film begins with Harry carrying out a magic act outside of school which sees him getting into trouble but he escapes being expelled by the skin of his teeth and the film then whizzes through with most not believing him that Voldermort is actually back....Will they see sense? What we also have is a horrid new head at Hogwarts who is so nasty she makes hell seem more inviting.As usual we have a great fantasy story and lots of CGI and new challenges for our students.If you love Harry potter you will love this again and again,10,0,0,28 November 2018
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Laugh A Minute
","So you've seen The original Home Alone right? we if not you need to and if you have you will know the fun and pain Machauley Culkin has alongside , Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, this really is similar and i gave it an 8 as opposed to the first film which lies firmly at the top of my Christmas List. This time around Kevin is lost in New York as the family trip to Florida goes completely awry and Kevin takes the wrong plane. Somehow the two characters played by Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern escape from prison and guess what? they are in New York and Kevin bumps into them and hears that they are going to steal from another place and he sets about trapping them and this ends up with plenty of pain for them and every brick thrown gives us a laugh. Its Totally Slapstick and once again Machauley Culkin and his facial expressions are simply legendary, those alone make me laugh and its from end to end. a great Christmas film and again in my top ten.",8,0,0,26 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Hogwarts has a new Pupil
","I have watched the entire series of 8 films around 25 times and i am just on another run. i am a film buff and just watch movies as opposed to terrestrial TV which i feel has run its course, so i can quite accurately say that i love films and more importantly i see a film whether its had a criticism or not. I make my own mind up and often of not critics get it wrong for me. seeing many bad reviews on here humours me, i mean its the usual suspects, people that love the books all say that its not the same as the books, people into magic say its not proper magic dah dah dah. Having said that what do i think of this spectacle?well i Love it from start to finish, its fantasy and CGI at its best, the story born as a book but then put on the big screen and its so warming. you can escape the hum drum life for two and half hours, its Child stars mixing with old and older veterans of the big screen and a little magic thrown in. Its got humour, Adventure along with the fantasy and has me giggling every time.A great film to watch and follow on through all 8, immerse yourself in a world of fantasy and Magic.",10,1,2,22 October 2018
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Coming of age
","Here we Have the fourth instalment of this most fabulous series about the wizarding world.In this one it centres around a tournament between Hogwarts and other wizard schools. There are challenges each contestant has to overcome in order to win. Harry in one of them, his recurring nightmares continue to haunt him about he who should not be named , will we finally get to see him?This 4th instalment is busy and lots to see, what we as an audience see at each instalment is the coming of age of our three main characters and at 14 they are becoming adult like. We do see relationships grow and this film does seem a little more darker as we drive midway through the book series and beyond.As always a fabulous cast of many, great and some special effects and a cracking story",10,0,0,20 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," All aboard the Hogwarts express
","I am privaledged to say I have watched the entire series of Harry Potter around 25 times since release and I say that as a potter head. I am just beginning to review the films I watch so as to help others with a honest insight before watching it.First I must say after reading some of the other reviews on this second installment i am shocked. Are people not aware that this is pure fantasy? It's a film series that allows one to escape from the general hum drum of drudgery for two and a half hours. It's not a book it's a fun film.This 2nd film is again set around Hogwarts and has the usual subjects. It flows as always with a touch of humour, magic, excitement and adventure. There is no need to explain the entire contents of This film as so many have but to say that it's entertaining, magic and with some great actors both old and new...even the score is pretty good.If you've not seen the Harry Potter series get it, it's not just for kids, its fun",10,0,0,27 October 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," Fantastic conclusion
","Well we arrive at this the third film in the series and it's where it left off in the 2nd. Batman has retired 8 years prior and become a sad recluse, Ill and has lost almost all his fortune.This third film has Bane (Tom Hardy) as the baddie and it's set around the end of Gotham as we know it. Obviously Bruce Wayne has to come back as batman to save the day and Gotham through many challenges.This 3rd film winds it all up and has a fairly big twist towards the end. It's well written and makes for a fabulous conclusion.The usual action and adventure in this sequel and has some great supporting actors...I somehow feel that they could make more in this series but guess that it's now 6 years after this film I doubt that will happen.",10,0,1,29 October 2018
Black Panther," Here comes the majestic panther
","Firstly i am not someone whos life is in a book about superheros and I am not one that lives for it by waiting for the next chapter. I don't visit comicon or collect comics I am however a lover of films.This I didn't get to see at the cinema as I did for infinity war and ant man and the wasp so rented the DVD and I liked it. It wasn't as good as the last two in this series but standing along it was good. It had a solid objective and the story took us through that.A good cast and overall a well made film with the usual CGI effects, it lacked in making it more real by not having many normal earth scenes (buildings, normal people doing normal things) but a good print.",8,1,3,20 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Wow what a finale
","I firstly need to say this...reading so many reviews on this and any film that people always forget a few things...1..any film made after a book and based on said book is just that 'based on' so it wouldn't be the same.2...a review is a little about what you enjoyed and how and why you liked it so others can with an open mind watch the film for themselves and make their own judgements.So the film...it for me was fantastic, I have seen the series around 25 times now and at least 4 times at the pictures for all 8 and I love them every time. I can remember seeing these as they came out every year and as we approached this final film I was scared, sad, excited and thrilled for its release and like many I left the cinema in tears and sad that it was all over.In this final part Harry and friends have to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes and many things are learnt about some that will shock you and at the same time make you sad as you would now see that certain people were actually Harry's friend not foe. We then see an epic battle and it's all centred around Hogwarts with virtually the whole cast from all the films returning.It's exciting, sad and thrilling to watch and the ending wasn't needed in my eyes but it worked.I do think that this series of Harry Potter is the only series of films that either remained as good each sequel or got better. Warner and J.K. Rowling deserved to be knighted for such a spectacular set. Well done",10,1,1,16 December 2018
Annihilation," all will be revealed at the very end
","I liked this film for the way it was set out but in the first 30 minutes i had to really concentrate on the film to figure out the content but was pleased i did. That's not to say it was way to difficult but i do find some films difficult to fathom out.Basically the film is centred around an area of land where a meteor has crash landed and something very strange has occurred where a group of Soldiers have been killed and the story opens with Lena (Natalie Portman) at home and her husband returning from that mission and all seems fine, then he's health deteriorates and he is rush to this facility for observation and immediately put into isolation. while they investigate what is wrong Lena volunteers to go in with 4 others to see what is happening around this piece of land and ultimately the lighthouse at the centre of it all. so we have these two events in the film flashbacking to the first and then it splits again into the after she gets finished with her investigation and finally we have flashbacks of her husbands time in there and what actually went on.it is hard to follow but its a great sci-fi film and in the last 30 minutes the parts all stitch together and we are presented with the reasons and all is clear. it really is one them films (for me at least) where i will need to see it again knowing what i know to enjoy it more. i did like this and gave it a 9 because it was a great watch... i am holding back a little on what goes on because it will give things away but it does have a great story and content to enjoy",9,2,4,10 January 2019
