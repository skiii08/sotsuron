The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Big disappointment!
","I was surprised today when I red newspaper's critics about this film.He wrote that Twilight Saga is for youngest teenagers!?! Well I am almost forty I love the books.Also I love the first film. Twilight was so refreshing, something totally new.It had a few little mistakes, but that couldn't ruin the impression.I felt great desire of all members of movie crew for this film to revive.It worked for me. New Moon film was pretty bad.The dramatic scenes were so pathetic that I wanted to vomit.Special effects were good. Eclipse was good action movie.So much better then second but worst then first. Breaking Dawn Part 1 I watched just few hours ago.It is so bad.I am angry.The whole story is happening around Bella.Her character is full with details.But Edward and Jakob are like shadows.Director threw at me scene by scene,like he retell the book without author seal.Some scenes are so long and boring.For those who didn't read the book it's going to be confusing.",2,12,25,18 November 2011
