Skyfall," A good move has to be about plot not action
","I tried to like it but the plot had more holes than Homeland and that is saying something. It is as if it was written by the Baddie (Silva) as he seems to know every move and every turn in advance. When he pops out of the tube station a car just happens to pull up for him right on time. There is more chance of him winning the lottery. Everything is just so right on time. If he was that smart why didn't he go straight to his intended victim instead of wasting two hours of my time in the cinema! How come we have a Spaniard working for M15, for Queen and Country? Maybe his parents were British! If you have seen the movie, just think about it. There were bits of plot just stuck in there for the sake of action all the way along. If you were going to assassinate somebody you would not kill everyone you met in the building on the way to your target. Not very professional. It is the last Bond movie I will pay to see.",1,14,27,14 November 2012
