It," A King Mishmash
","This movie seems to get rapturous praise from a segment of the population, a segment I suspect that has never seen a Stephen King adaptation made prior to 2014. I never fell in love with the book the way that many others have, and was not expecting much from this adaptation. I got what I expected.
Let's see.....a group of early teens calling themselves the 'Loser's Club' bullied by psychopathic older teens....The Body/Stand by Me.
Sadistic parents who the Losers Club have to contend with every night....Carrie.
A creepy abandoned mansion that overlooks the town and is the center of the evil....Salems' Lot.
An evil plaguing a small Maine time...take your pick of any King adaptation (from Pet Sematary to Needful Things to The Mist).
And just to make sure the Loser's Club is politically correct, we have an African American teen and a Jewish teen.
At 2 hours and 15 minutes, the film fails to develop many characters clearly. It prefers to dwell on set pieces. It all seems to be a set up for 'Chapter 2.'
This apparently is the most successful horror film of all time. I'll stick with pre 2014 King adaptations. Except perhaps Maximum Overdrive......",5,0,0,24 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," QT's best since Pulp Fiction
","Tarantino is getting older and his movies are becoming a bit more reserved. Following the much-maligned 'Hateful Eight,' Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is a treat, especially for movie buffs familiar with the history of the summer of 1969 in Hollywood. Some have commented on the lack of pure 'QT' dialogue that made his other movies so entertaining (along with the stories and action). Others have complained about the length of this movie. You need to enter this world, and not only the worlds of the two leads (played by DiCaprio and Pitt, and they are both relaxed - for the most part - and hilarious i spots). You are transported to Hollywood, August 1969. And Tarantino gets everything right, from the look of Hollywood at the time, the movie marquees, the music, the clothes, the attitudes.
Like some of this other films, the movie takes many liberties with historic events. The last shot of the film allows audiences to fill in the blanks as to what happens next.
For those who love slow-burn movies, and Tarantino, this movie is a must-see. I've seen it twice and could see it again tomorrow.",9,19,30,24 August 2019
Elysium," Misunderstood
","Neil Blomkamp's follow up to District 9 is another science fiction/action hybrid that contains social commentary aplenty. District 9 was praised (or condemned by the right wing) as being a statement against Apartheid-like policies still being practiced in the world by countries like Israel. Elysium rattled the cages of the right wing media when it came out (Limbaugh ordered his listeners to boycott the movie and Matt Damon). The science 'eventuality' in this movie must have hit too close to home. A not-so-distant Earth, basically destroyed by nuclear  and global warming, where the lower 98% lives and works in jobs that serve the top 2%? This is not an unlikely scenario in a nation where we have greedy narcissistic failed businessmen and Evangelical science-denying crazies controlling the Government.
The top 2% have evacuated the planet to live in a deluxe space station that looks upon a dying planet. Again, not hard to believe - especially given the recent news about the elite planning to colonize both the moon and Mars.
The action in the film concerns the plight of the disenfranchised to get to Elysium in order to use their high tech medical device that cures all types of cancer (a device only for the top 2%, of course). A psychopathic agent of the space station on Earth is called into action to stop them, especially the radiation-infected former worker played by Damon who leads the group.
Sharlto Copley plays the deranged Earth-based protector of Elysium and it is a truly frightening performance. He is all-out insane and provided with all weaponry needed to stop the heroes. Copley also played the hero of District 9 and his transformation into a Van Demme-esque physical presence with no morals and a psychotic urge to not only eliminate Damon and co., but also take over Elysium with this goons, creates one of the best action film villains of the decade.
Great entertainment, whether you watch it for action escapism, its social commentary, or both.",8,1,3,24 August 2019
