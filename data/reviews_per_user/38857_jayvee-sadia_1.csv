Skyfall," James Bond Is Back!!!!
","SkyfallThis is easily the one of the best Bond flicks ever. Driven with love of the series, Sam Mendes, with the cast and crew have made a great treat for the the Series' 50th anniversary. The story is involving, the script is great, and Javier Bardem as the villain is very menacing & creepy yet amusing and a delight to watch. But top that with Daniel Craig's Amazing Performance along with the beautiful visuals make for an extremely awesome movie. Heed not the trolls that give this movie 1/10's. Even if the strongest Bond Hater rated this movie honestly, it wouldn't go below 6. Heck, i thought it was gonna be a 6. But Skyfall is a salute to one of cinema's most enduring hero and an optimistic glimpse of its future. James Bond will return....",9,2,10,9 November 2012
