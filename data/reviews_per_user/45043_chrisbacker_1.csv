Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie I've seen this year
","I was a fan of the Borat clips on Da Ali G show but they weren't my favorite part of the show. However now, seeing it uncensored, it is absolutely hilarious. I laughed so hard that I was crying and my stomach hurt later that night. My wife and I found ourselves laughing days later about some of the scenes. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD because I can't wait to see the deleted scenes and hopefully the outtakes. SBC is an awesome talent, but I have no idea what his personality is like outside of the characters he plays. I hope he does some interviews as himself as the press for this movie dies down a bit.",9,2,7,5 November 2006
