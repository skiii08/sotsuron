Deepwater Horizon," Rewriting history using movies
","Notice how the script writers work so very hard to make all of the oil rig workers seem so caring, loving and kind. No partiers, no drunks, no one greedy for money any way they can get it. I think British Petroleum paid good money so this movie could influence the public and worked hard to put oil rig workers in a good light. I would never work for any oil company ever. I despise the whole oil industry for dominating the transportation industry for 100 years and counting. Damn the oil.",1,0,5,25 August 2019
