Lucky Number Slevin," Aggravating
","Lucky Number Slevin started out as a very likable, well written movie but disappointed me with its only motive being revenge. The movie first starts out as a tragic, the beginning is always a crucial moment in movies and this one really sets a great pace, flashback where several people are killed. My sole problem with L#7 is that these two rival gang bosses who hate each other get killed for a motive that we really don't recognize until its to late, i found that revenge as a motive never works. First we're cheering for a this character who seems to have gotten himself into a predicament, but only lenient. You then realize that his whole life as a fake one we were lead to believe. Bruce Willis is as stiff as usual, barely making facial expressions, being the 'cool' sly specialist who aids Slevin in his quest for revenge. It leads you down the same road as 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' but turns sharply and ends up in a dead end. Both had great writing, being quite funny at times, but KKBB withstood everything to come out on top while this one fell. Can anyone relate to this? I believe revenge isn't the answer and this is why this movie disappointed me, maybe i was looking for a character to follow and i guess i felt lost.",7,4,9,11 February 2007
