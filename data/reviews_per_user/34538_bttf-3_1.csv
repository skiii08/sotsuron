Ford v Ferrari," Pure cinematic and aural joy
","Definitely one of the best race movies ever, but with a buddy-friendship story ode to Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby plot as well as little guys against the big establishment that any non-car guy could enjoy, so your wife will enjoy it too. My wife loved it, but she does drive a 429 hp AMG E53 cabriolet, so she's definitely an honorary car guy.See it in a good theater with a full sized screen and top sound so you can experience the amazing race cinematography and feel the roaring engines in your chest.Christian Bale gives one of his his best Oscar worthy career performance as Ken Miles, from a long list of career Oscar quality performances in movies like Vice, The Big Short, The Fighter, and American Hustle.A must see future iconic movie right up there with James Garner's Grand Prix and Steve McQueen's LeMans.Now, every time I get into my 2009 911 C4S, I want to wind it out in second gear to over 7000 rpm's just to hear the engine scream.",10,3,8,17 November 2019
