The New World," Expensive Documentary
","The set, wardrobe and makeup departments should win an award. However, an extreme use of voice overs, the endless use of beauty shots of Smith and Pocahantus walking and caressing in the forest, in the fields, by the river make this film about 45 min. too long. If you're a history buff, its a great view into what life must have been like at this particular time and place...no Hollywood glamor or stylized sets. It's gritty, dirty and raw. But in the end, it seemed like a very expensive documentary. With a degree in history and a love for Native American culture, I had really looked forward to the release. I got a good glimpse into that culture, but in the end, was disappointed in the story line and a large use of piano music for the score.",3,3,8,21 January 2006
