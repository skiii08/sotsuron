Iron Man 3," The actors are all game, but even they can't save Iron Man 3... or is it Avengers 1.5?
","'Iron Man' was one of the best superhero movies I had ever seen & 'Iron Man 2' was a worthy sequel, despite many disagreeing. But some of the early information regarding 'Iron Man 3' surrounding it's new, darker tone & the eventual trailers got me worried. It felt like the creators of 'IM 3', like those from 'The Amazing Spider-Man', wanted to go 'Dark Knight' style too much.But like 'The Amazing Spider-Man', the darker tone didn't really distract from the actual film. Still, 'Iron Man 3' doesn't live up to it's two predecessors.Ben Kingsley's talent is just wasted as his potentially larger then life villainous character known as 'The Mandarin' is subjected to a quasi 'Batman Begins'-style twist & reduced to a drunk actor who doesn't know what's going on. On top of that the real Mandarin, Aldrich Killian (a very good Guy Pearce)is interesting enough to hold your attention, but his motivations just aren't there. They just aren't. So his plan is to kill the Vice president & then take over the US government? Really? Is this the Avengers version 1.5 or something? Loki's ambition on a smaller scale? Ah, whatever...I was also surprised by the more graphic violence in relation to the two previous films. I don't mind graphic violence when it's done with caution & wit, but it just seems out of place in an Iron Man/Marvel movie.Redeeming factors are the solid performances of the actors (especially Robert Downey Jr.)& the well staged action sequences, but at the end of the day I'll probably watch Iron Man 1 & 2 more then this one.",5,7,14,3 June 2013
Alien: Resurrection," 'My mommy always said there were no monsters, no real ones. But there are...'
","The above sentence sums up a recurring theme that is featured throughout the Alien quadrology; the aliens/xenomorphs aren't the only monsters. And they aren't, the antagonist human characters in each Alien-film are just as big of a monster as the aliens.In this 4th entry, we see how far such human antagonists go to get their hands on the xenomorph species yet again. 200 years after Ripley's death, she is revived through a cloning process. In a pivotal scene, it is also revealed Ripley wasn't the first clone. Sigourney Weaver's acting in this scene is nothing short of amazing, as she witnesses the horrors that came out of the many attempts to bring her back. It is definitely the movie's highlight...The film is also more gory then the previous installments which, along with the fact there are a little too much and underdeveloped characters, makes it come off like a typical horror/adventure movie and as a result fails to fully satisfy. Though you might get a kick out of the more primal Ripley, since her genes are mixed with xenomorph DNA because of the cloning procedure.It's good entertainment, but don't feel guilty for skipping it.",7,3,4,29 May 2012
Point Break," I got what I expected *SPOILERS AHEAD*
","This film was being slandered from it's announcement, simply because it was perceived as being a pointless remake. So many remakes of different genres were done that had no point & yet turned out to be good. It is the same case here.The makers clarified it would be more of a reimagining of what was already seen, rather then a full on remake. In general, the acting is decent. The only rather flat performance I'd say came from Ray Winstone, mumbling through his lines. I love the fact most of the action is real time, rather then CGI. CGI is prominent in waves these days, it really feels refreshing to see some real stunt work. The cinematography is near outstanding as we follow the characters over various continents.Especially positive about this film is that it shows the antagonists aren't idiots & figured Utah was a cop early on, a clever addition. The twist involving Samsara is sure to surprise viewers as well. Also loved how they had Bodhi rescue Utah from the wave, a nice homage to the original film & there are a few more in there :). What blends surprisingly well is the already familiar anti-establishment mentality of Bodhi's group & the new eco-terrorism angle. The dialogue concerning these state of minds is written in rather expositionary, but good enough substance.Negatives involve some scenes & character introductions feeling rushed. The character Chowder (Tobias Santelmann)suffers the most from this flaw & his early demise makes his character a complete waste of screen time. Also the scene where Utah empties his gun in the air could have been handled better, & if that wasn't possible, should have been omitted from the film. Lastly the CGI during Bodhi's last wave looks rather sloppy, as it's clear the actors are standing in front of a green screen most of the time. And ironically, like the original film, the scene concerning Bodhi's last wave feels tagged on.Nonetheless I really enjoyed this film & recommend you watch it with an open mind.",8,0,2,13 May 2016
Doctor Strange," Stranger things
","Generally I regard most of the Marvel's shared universe projects as fun, but ultimately filler entertainment for the most part. My favorites are Iron Man, The Winter Soldier & new addition Doctor Strange.Expanding on the more magical aspect of the Marvel universe, - introduced in the dismal Thor: The Dark World - we are introduced to alternative/reality bending powers & dimensions. There is no character better suited as a candidate to go on this journey with then Doctor Stephen Strange. He is the master of magic, regardless of which medium the audience/readers find themselves in.Played suavely by Benedict Cumberbatch, a lot of people draw comparisons with Tony Stark. They do share some personality traits, however Stephen Strange set himself apart - at least in the film - by being more reserved in his attitude.Supported by a strong cast who give good - Rachel McAdams (Christine Palmer), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) & Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) - to great performances, - Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) - Doctor Strange proves a strong addition to Marvel's shared universe despite it's fairly rushed by the numbers story. Also kudos to the team behind the amazing visual effects and their well deserved Oscar nomination!",8,1,1,23 February 2017
Logan," Disappointing
","Most of the negative complaints surrounding this film are well covered by other reviewers, mostly the overall predictability, excessive violence + cursing & clich√©d villains. Offcourse there are more issues that I won't mention.The main problem is the emotional impact you SHOULD have seeing beloved characters perish, just isn't there. Because we know one character has the consciousness from the original timeline & a second character is an alternate version due to the altered timeline from Days Of Future Past.I didn't dig the Children Of Men-style plot, the super soldier-esque serum, X-24 & the exaggerated healing abilities of the former.The first half of the film was good, but started to fall apart with the introduction of the family & X-24. I had hoped for a better final outing for Hugh Jackman, rather then a partial rehash of The Wolverine (the subsided healing factor, the clinic scene!!).Regardless despite some of the X-Men & stand alone Wolverine films lacking in quality, I truly admire the commitment Jackman gave to this role. I do give an extra point for some of the best live action Wolverine asskicking we've seen yet (the part where Logan goes berserk in the forest). I'll surely miss him in the role.",5,6,16,3 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Refreshing take on a heroine's journey
","Wonder Woman's first ever solo film is a home run for me. Due to stellar to good performances from the cast, - in particular the amazing chemistry between Gal Gadot & Chris Pine - I was there with the main characters all the way. Especially Wonder Woman/Diana is the one character we feel & support through the ordeal she & her company endure. She needs no reason to help any being, it is just who she is.An already old tale is told in a very refreshing way, exactly what superhero movies needed. This film delivered supported by a strong emotional center, adequate humor & good action sequences.This is not a superhero film, it is a FILM. A strong recommendation, I give no less of a reason to go see this movie!",9,7,15,16 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The one that started it all and eventually, the franchise I grew up with!
","This film is simply put pure nostalgia for me. At a certain day my dad just decided to watch his Star Wars VHS tapes (the original trilogy), because the prequels weren't even announced yet. After watching 'A New Hope', I was hooked. This was the best thing I ever saw, certainly in sci-fi.The sequels that followed didn't lie, this was certainly one of the best sci-fi franchises out there! The stars, production, special effects etc... I could go on forever. These movies, along with the Star Trek franchise, defined what space sci-fi was all about! Epicness, action, adventure, romance, drama, oh my! Do not miss this great film and it's sequels. You won't be disappointed!",8,0,0,17 July 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," Very enjoyable, but in slight danger of becoming stale
","John Wick: Chapter 2 continues on the strengths of it's predecessor: interesting cast of characters, visuals, intricate action/fight choreography & blasting soundtrack.This time around although most of the cast give good performances, Keanu Reeves was a bit wooden this time around. No idea if it's the direction, Keanu's approach to the role or the script's dialog, just something that struck me slightly & maybe a detail that needs to be looked into.Staleness is also on the edge of flowing into this new world of assassins as seeing John Wick go through hordes of disposable bad guys starts to feel tired already. Surprising as the action started out quite inventive, but seemed to run out of steam by the final act. I hope the team behind the action & fight sequences up their game for John Wick 3.Still a fun ride nonetheless, despite the little issues mentioned.",7,0,3,24 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," Solid addition to a good saga
","After the alright Prometheus & the so-so trailers I was apprehensive about Covenant.I liked the performances especially Michael Fassbender (in a dual role), Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride & Billy Crudup. The visuals were stunning, as is contemporary for a Ridley Scot-film. Kudos to Darius Wolski especially, who's been Scott's collaborator since Prometheus.The more bugsome parts of the film are the expendable characters & the surprisingly underused alien city on Paradise. However, along with the aforementioned performances these factors are redeemed by David's & Walter's interactions surrounding past & current events on & off Paradise.This culminates in an intriguing climax where David essentially tests his new creations (a welcome return for the Xenomorphs). At first the swapping with Walter seems predictable, but it's clear on repeated thoughts & viewings there should be no surprise. It's made sublety clear David is now the android aboard the Covenant & is somewhat disappointed yet pleased with the outcome. His first 2 creations have perished, but he gained excellent hosts for his morbid plans.Alien Covenant is an enjoyable film & earns it's spot among the Alien-films with class.",8,3,7,13 September 2017
