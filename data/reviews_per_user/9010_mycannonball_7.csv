Ford v Ferrari," You don't to be into race car driving to be into this movie
","I didn't think that I liked race car driving... until I saw this! The first half of the movie is interesting, but not as gripping as the second half. The first half focuses more on the business aspects of how Ford wanted to remake their image and ended up in an intense rivalry with Ferrari to make the best race car (and win an acclaimed 24 hour race). The second half feels more like a traditional sports movie, with the emotional pay-offs and suspense and heartache and twists and turns. You don't have to be into sports cars or be a fan of race car driving (I'm not) to appreciate this movie. The performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale were superb as usual.",8,0,1,28 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Disappointed
","Slow at times. Some great original songs. For a movie about fame, it wasn't explored very deeply. I didn't see this is a true love story so much as story about a woman who was able to achieve dreams by entering a relationship with a man, and a man who was able to find comfort within a co-dependent relationship. Nothing wrong with exploring that relationship dynamic but I find it weird when people see it was a love story of soul mates. I wish Lady Gaga didn't have so much work done on her face because I find it distracting when an actor is feeling so much emotion and their face will not move. :-/",5,0,3,3 February 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great action flick practically ruined by crazy directing/camera-work
","The first ten minutes of this movie I practically felt car sick. I kept wondering, 'Are they ever going to stop shaking the camera and swish-panning so I can focus on these characters' faces?' Then when Jason Bourne is sitting completely still on a couch opposite another character and the camera is shaking all over the place just for the sake of shaking, I started to laugh out loud.This is a sad example of a movie that is so stylized that the camera work is distracting. I do like hand-held work when it is done well (i.e. Children of Men). But I do not like it when it is does to the point that: 1) I can't always tell what is going on, 2) I get distracted by it and pulled out of the story because I am well aware a camera is capturing all of it, and 3) Even in still, calm moments the camera is shaking all over the place.I'm being generous when I give this a 6. I give it a 6 only because Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne and the story/writing is good. Also, there are two action sequences that have good suspense and fantastic stunts/fight scenes despite the poor camera work  the train station & the chase involving Julia Stiles. The overall story is good, but the telling of that story is completely hampered by the style of the director.My favorite of this trilogy was definitely the first, because I could enjoy that one without taking Dramamine.",6,8,14,7 January 2008
The Favourite," When everyone wants power...
","It had a bit of a slow start and I wasn't a huge fan of some of the 'creative' camera work (fish eye lens??). BUT, then once the story got underway, it was very good. The rivalry between the Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone characters as they vied for the Queen's attention and ultimately the security she could provide them was very entertaining. It was also sort of dark and sad and twisted. And just when you found yourself rooting for one woman, you changed your mind and felt for the other woman. It's a story that shows throughout several story threads what a dark world it can be when everyone is trying to gain power. The performance by Emma Coleman as the queen was fantastic. The ending left me feeling a little letdown, but ultimately it also felt like a fitting ending in some ways.",8,2,4,19 November 2019
Rudy," Good Again and Again
","There aren't a lot of movies that I watch more than once, and there are very few that I watch many times. This is one of those movies that I have seen almost a dozen times over the years, and I never get sick of it.'Rudy' is the classic underdog story. Rudy, played with strength and vulnerability by Sean Astin, is an underdog in football because of his small size, and he's an underdog in school because he has to work twice as hard to get the good grades. He'is a hard worker with a big heart whose had his share of pain in life, so an audience member I celebrate when he does & feel sad when he does.This film has all the right pieces  a great story inspired by a true one, beautiful directing, a fantastic musical score, great football scenes, and emotional punch. This is definitely my favorite sports movies, and it is one of my top 10 all-around movies. It is inspirational and moving, AND it is entertaining!",10,4,4,7 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Characters and random situations alone do not make a great story
","I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I am shocked it has such positive reviews and raving fans. I give it a 5/10.My biggest complaint is about the overall storyline, which I felt was lacking. There seemed to be a bunch of characters ranging from very interesting (Heath) to not as interesting (Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman felt like non-characters this time around). And then there was a bunch of scenarios, some very tense and cool (the joker pitting the two boats against each other), and some very tired (didn't the hostages wear the masks in INSIDE MAN?). But there wasn't a great throughline to pull me through.In my opinion, a series of miscellaneous scenarios, a villain vs. a hero, and a smattering of people with assorted agendas does not make a solid storyline where from scene to scene I wonder what's going to happen. I got bored at times. It felt like a fantastic premise, but no story.I also don't feel much for Bruce Wayne/Batman character this time around. I haven't seen Batman Begins in awhile, but I'm pretty sure they show us his human side and that his laziness/womanizing/partying is just his Bruce Wayne cover-up. In this movie, he was cold. The kissing scene was ridiculous. He kisses Rachel then strides away with one hand in his pocket like he doesn't give a care at allwhich pretty much makes me not care about his character at all either.",5,5,10,3 November 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," A very fun, action movie
","I was just complaining to a friend that there aren't enough FUN movies being released (not counting animation). It seems like there are so many sad endings and dark message movies out there lately. & The fun movies that are out there have way too much CGI. I missed the good, 'ole fun action movie.So I was so happy when I rented 'Live Free or Die Hard' and I got taken on a fun, action ride. There is a great mix of chase scenes, fight scenes, and humor. The relationship between Bruce Willis' character and Justin Long's character is perfect, and it was probably my favorite aspect of this film. I had no opinion of Justin Long prior to seeing this, and now I think he is very funny and talented.There are plenty of stunt-packed action sequences too. My only small criticism is that the action is almost too over-the-top. I understand that when watching a great action film, you usually need to suspend disbelief and go with it. However, some of the crashes and falls that characters lived through were SO enormous. It was like they had nine lives. So I would say that it did detract from the suspense of it a touch because I had no frame of reference as to what would actually kill a person or what qualified as true danger...But that really is a small thing. Just go into it expecting a fun, thrilling ride and you will definitely get it!",9,4,8,1 January 2008
