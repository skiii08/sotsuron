The Benchwarmers," Is what it is....if you like these kind of movies see it if not please don't complain after you see it.
","I saw this movie the other day. And I was pleasantly surprised. It amazes me that people come on here and complain about these type of movies like it is the worst movie ever. I like Rob Schneider and David Spade. I have liked many of the Adam Sandler movies also. This movie is from the same production companies of Sandlers movies. And I must say it is better than most of their recent offerings. I laughed out loud about 10 times and laughed silently many more times. Laughing out loud is something I generally don't do.My review is mostly for those of you that have liked some of the Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, or David Spade movies. I think this movie was better than Anger Management, Mr Deeds, The Longest Yard, The Animal among others. It was very funny at times and it was cute also.Rob Schneider was the man of the group. He played it is the athlete in the group and the leader of the team of misfits. David Spade played a nerd in David Spade style. And Jon Heder was good as a Napolean Dynamite guy with a little more energy.Sure this movie has it's flows especially in the storyline. Like if Rob Schneider is so much better than Heder or Spade why did the other teams not just walk him.....things like that. But take this movie as it is.....it is better than most Happy Madison productions of late. Schneider, Spade, and Heder fans don't ignore this movie because of comments by people who don't like them to begin with.",7,12,23,17 April 2006
Finding Nemo," A kids movie
","I am in my mid-thirties and have always enjoyed the Pixar movies. Can't say i didn't like this movie but I was expecting more. I thought Ice Age for example did a better job of entertaining adults. Had more humor and was better executed for adults - and also satisfied children. Both movies also were out of this would visually.As for Nemo, Visually A+. And I did think it had it's touching moments. I didn't find Dory all that funny. Okay she has short term memory loss. Didn't amuse me.After leaving the theater I recalled how my mom wanted my dad to take her to see this movie. My wife and I thought would he enjoy it. And I thought no, I don't think he would. It was too much of a kids movie. And don't get me wrong it was supposed to be. I just wanted to offer a different perspective of this movie. It is not flawless. It's not for everyone as reviews seem to indicate.Actually I enjoyed listening to all the little kids reacting to the movie. My daughter is too young for this one yet - a baby. One thing I was thinking was that this movie might be a little too scary for some of these kids. I would say there were at least 6 times when 'the fish' almost died. There where some scary predators - including humans. After all these are little fish - little fish make good food for big fish. Which would be fine but the predators were also very scary looking. Geez, when I was a kid the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz scared me, that is nothing compared to the creatures in this movie.Also, when watching this movie I could already see a sequel. I would bet that Dolphins have a very big role in the second one since they were almost ignored here.",6,0,2,9 June 2003
Thor: Ragnarok," I really enjoyed this movie
","Personally, I felt the other Thor movies were too dark and too boring. I was somewhat hesitant to see this, but the commercials lured me in. This one reminded me more of the Guardians of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. It was funny and very colorful. Chris Hemsworth is a funny guy- he has shown this in other projects. Here they decided to make use of it while having lots of action. This movie was Avengers meets Guardians. There is a team of 'Avenger' type characters here also. While viewing movie I found myself smiling throughout. Just a fun popcorn movie. If you like the other Avenger movies and don't need a straight from the comic lift definitely go see this and Enjoy.",10,4,9,13 November 2017
Final Destination 2," Scary??????
","This movie wasn't scary. In order for a movie to be scary there needs to be suspense. When the movie gives the order of the deaths before they happen you know who gets it and when. Where's the suspense?This movie was just an excuse for gore. Nothing scary, funny or intelligent in this one. The writers of this movie thought they were clever but were far from it. I hated this movie so much.The plot was totally stupid. I got it after reading the box or hearing the characters say over and over that you can't cheat death. If you are supposed to die you are supposed to die no way to beat it. But even here they are inconsistent. So many plot holes in this one - the premise at least needs to work and it doesn't. Why was one character not able to comment suicide yet and another was? Answer: because it was convenient for the story.This movie was just an excuse to show as much gore as possible. They would try to scare you that one gory thing would happen but another did. Very tasteless excuse to be as gory as possible. Why couldn't death just make someone stop breathing? No, they had to torture someone by having them go through hell at the dentist office then squash them like a tomato - a kid none the less. They had to totally drag out a decapitation. Even the crash scene at the beginning was way over done - everyone had to die a gross way in the crash.My stepson said it best: I've seen this movie before. It was called Final Destination 1. I myself didn't see Final Destination 1 before, but believe it because nothing in this movie seemed clever even watching this sequel to an 'original' movie I hadn't seen.At least in Friday the 13th there was Jason, in Night Mare on Elmstreet there was Freddy, in Halloween there was Michael Meyers, and even in Childs Play there was Chuckie - there was no visible bad guy in this one.This movie was total garbage even by horror movie standards. I felt disgusted with myself for even watching this crap. A friend borrowed me this DVD - thank god it was his money not mine. If you want to see horror and be scared see Freddy vs Jason instead of this piece of garbage. Did I say I HATED this movie yet???",2,2,6,3 September 2003
Lost in Translation," Over-rated
",Bill Murray being nominated for Best Actor? Huh????Bill Murray just played Bill Murray. Except he had less lines than in any movie he has been in. I saw this movie one day before the Academy's just to prep myself. Did you watch the clips of each actor as they showed best actor clips? BILL MURRAY WAS BEING BILL MURRAY! No show of emotion. Just dry deadpanned line delivery. And don't get me wrong I like Bill Murray. But he did not deserve to be nominated and neither did this picture. Also this picture won like best comedy at the Golden Globes and it wasn't even a comedy.It was very very slow. Actually I think Scarlett was better than Bill. Really all I have to say is that this movie definitely shows that their are politics in the Academy. My mind it flabbergasted why Bill and this picture got nominated. Are they trying to push Sofia Coppola as the next big director? Or is it something else. Who has naked picture of who???? Also 8.0???? WHAT?!?!?,3,13,28,1 March 2004
Bohemian Rhapsody," I enjoyed it until I read about the Historical Inaccuracies
","Can a movie like this have spoilers? It's not like we don't know what happened to Freddie and Queen.I will make this review short. I enjoyed it until I read about the BIG LIE of this movie. Freddie did not find out about him having Aids until 2 years after Live Aid. They made it look like they got back together after he found out he had Aids. They also made it look like he was struggling through rehearsals for Live Aid with Aids. Then at the Actual Live Aid Performance they made it seem like he pushed himself beyond his deadly disease and delivered an inspiring performance as he was dying. ALL THIS WAS A LIE. I told people after I saw this movie about that Live Aid performance and it was all inaccurate.After hearing all that I wonder what else wasn't true. And if you question what you see as being real or not than what really is the point? Now I see the whole movie as a lie. I was hoping for an history lesson about Queen and Mercury. It was not that.There were some slow points and Freddie was definitely a flawed person. So was Roger Taylor, but Brian May and John Deacon came across as saints. I know this in not totally accurate either.Some people also complain that there was not more early life story to Freddie and nothing after Live Aid. Freddie died 6 years after that performance..I was ok with that I did not need to see him die. The movie starts up when Freddie joins Queen.So in the end, sad that this movie was not as true as I had hoped. Other than that the performances were amazing. The guy who played Brian May was incredible...looked just like him. John Deacon also. All four guys had the mannerisms nailed.",5,10,20,7 November 2018
Justice League," A better video game then movie
","Believe me I wanted to love this movie. I grew up on the Justice League. I love the Justice League. This movie was exactly how I would not do it. Let me begin my review.CGI – I also love CGI. I think we've made some great movie magic with CGI. Here the CGI was so distractingly bad I could not stop wondering how could they do such a bad job with such a huge budget? Let me start with the bad guy – Steppenwolf. The Character looked like it was lifted right out of a video game. He did not look real at all. Honestly this movie looked like they took the Human Actors (plus half and half Superman – I'll get to that) and plopped them right into a video game. It looked like these actors all stood in a sound stage and punch and kicked and jumped. The CGI was so bad the movie lost all sense of realism. It did not help that the directors of this movie has no idea how to put more than 2 characters in a fight scene at any time. Again this took away from the realism also – how do our super heroes fight the alien villains in the middle of a city and not one bystander is in any of the scenes. The world is being destroyed but no one is watching or no one tries running away. Its funny because at one point in the middle of a big fight scene Lois Lane just shows up but no one else including Police or Military does. I sat there in total shock thinking how could some one make such garbage fake scenes. But the most laughable part of the CGI has to do with Superman. I sat there looking at him the whole movie thinking what is wrong with him, he looks off. So afterwards I read that Henry Cavill was filming another movie at the same time as this and in that other movie he was required to have a mustache and beard. So they filmed all his scenes with a beard and CGI'd them out. And it was a terrible job of CGIing the beard out. His face looked off and at points I wondered if it was even Henry playing Superman or a look alike. It was bad and for a movie this BIG it should have been so much better.As for the other Heroes here are my thoughts, but first let me comment on something that bothers a lot of Justice League fans, why did they take all the color and make these movies so dark. This is a big factor on why Marvel makes much better movies than DC. Look at the costume of Batman (all black), Wonder Women/Aquaman/Superman colors dimmed to the point of their outfits are basically black also. Flash looked OK.Batman – Ben Affleck seems to be sleep walking through this movie. He is boring boring boring. Enough said about him.Aquaman – was Aquaman even in this movie? I recall Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and some cyborg guy, but was Aquaman in this movie? Cuz there was some dude that says Bro and Bruh with long hair and a bunch of tattoos. Jason Momoa was not Aquaman. Not only in persona/appearance, but Aquaman did not use his Aqua skills the entire movie. It was like the director has no idea how to pull this off. He was in the water at the beginning a little when he wasn't drinking his big beer and acting all tough like a pirate/surfer at some pub. But not once did Aquaman used his Aqua skills in this movie. In fact, both of the Justice League fight scenes there was no water around. I am not sure what was worse the CGI or Aquaman.Flash – I hear some liked him but I could help wondering was Woody Allen not available at the time of filming? Because the guy who played Flash was trying to be Woody Allen the whole movie. Flash was supposedly the funny one – either him or Aquaman, but neither made me laugh once.Cyborg – Actually Cybrog made me laugh when Steppenwolf pulled off his arms and legs. I laughed out loud at that one. Actually I never knew who cyborg was but from watching this movie he was a fish out of water just like Aquaman. Cyborg apparently deals with Cyber-crimes. Only problem Steppenwolf is from the past and doesn't use computers so Cyborg was useless.Wonder Woman – The best thing about this movie. No complaints here other than her black Wonder Woman outfit.Superman – touched on him earlier. I like Henry Cavill and like his Superman portrayal. He wasn't the best here as he wasn't give much to do. He had a couple heart felt scenes (with Lois and his Mom) and CGI withstanding he looks OK for Superman although he looked small in this one.As for the plot, bad guy from the past wants to destroy the world. Typical but not executed very well.After seeing this movie I could not help but wish they would blow this whole thing up and start over. They hint of the next movie and I just thought – too bad. DC needs to look at what Marvel is doing and copy, please copy. I also saw Thor's movie and that movie was 1000 times better. Take my advice and see Thor instead. A bad movie like this does not deserve to make the kind of movie it is making.",2,242,407,28 November 2017
Over the Hedge," Best CGI Movie Yet
","Honestly, I have not had so much fun at a movie in a while. This movie was cute, fast paced and funny. Dreamworks once again creates a movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. In fact the theater I was in was uproaring with laughter from patrons of all ages.I have seen most of the CGI movies and a lot of other animated movies as of late considering I have a young child. I think I summed it all up in the first paragraph, but I REALLY ENJOYED this one as much as my child....maybe even more. Each animal had their own quirky personalities. The raccoon is the ring leader. He convinces the other animals to go 'over the hedge' to humanland and get exciting food not bark or a few tiny berries which they have been dispersing in tiny portions. Afterall there are around 10 animals in all. The most comedic is the squirrel. The skunk has a few moments....really they all made me laugh. The turtle who is very cute is the one who is skeptical of the raccoon. The raccoon ulterior motive is to get replacement food for the bear who's food the raccoon happened to destroy.I highly recommend this movie if you are at all on the borderline or like me would like to see it but where do you get the time. Run out and see this one. Haven't seen Cars yet, it may very well be good but this one is as good as they get. Enjoy.",10,0,0,22 June 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Over-rated Big Time
",This movie is about a punk ex-con who is bitter about losing his girlfriend to someone more successful than himself. I personally didn't care for anyone of the characters.  Carl Reiner was the best of the lot.  They were way too bland and because there were so many involved in the heist they didn't have enough time to develop the characters.I expected more.  There was hardly any action or suspense.  Basically a dialogue movie.  And the only dialogue was 'are you in?'  ZZZZZZZZZ. Did any of you think for one second the plan would fail?  Personally I wished it did.  Clooney's character was a punk.  Get over it you are a loser ex-con and lost your girlfriend to someone who was more successful than you.3000 Miles to Graceland was a similar movie that didn't get the positive reviews this movie got and was far more intense and action packed.  The performances were better too.  NO ONE can say that Clooney was better than Costner.  NO ONE.  This movie got great reviews because of two things:  an excellent cast and Soderberg the director.  In my opinion go rent 3000 Miles to Graceland if you can take a lot of violence and foul language (the only reason for poor reviews).,3,2,4,3 January 2002
The Love Guru," Austin Powers IV
","Seriously folks, I really don't understand the hate for this movie. I rented it this past weekend. After watching it I felt I was watching an Austin Powers film with a different set of characters. The humor and style of the movie were very similar. Honestly for the life of me I wonder how Austin Powers could get great reviews then this one not get the same reviews. Maybe people don't like the middle eastern character with a goofy bready look....I can not believe peoples sense of humors changed so much. One thing for sure many of the reviews for this movie happened either before or shortly after this movie came out. Makes me wonder if people actually watched it.My recommendation is that everyone who has seen and liked the Austin Powers movies to give this movie a chance. If you never even liked Austin Powers then skip this one. But don't come here and reject this movie off of the reviews on this site. This movie was a lot better than Zohan.",7,8,14,14 November 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Very unpredicable
","Let me first tell you how I watched this movie, but it will probably be too late for you to get the same out of this movie that I got.I was up late one weekend night and I just turned on my cable movie channel and started to watch this movie I had no idea what it was called or what it was about.I started watching it and was getting very into it.  It starts off as 2 bad guys hi-jacking a camper driven by a father and his two kids.  I was curious as to where it was going and how the family of three handled the situation.Well they get lead to this 'bar' out in the middle of no where than all of a sudden this movie turns into another movie.  My eyes nearly popped out of my head.Great casting, great directing, great acting, great action suspense.  I loved this movie.  It was so unpredicable that I had no idea where this movie was headed or what would happen to each character.I have since recommended this movie to other.  I have told them if they had never heard of it to rent the movie and do not read what it is about.  Just watch it.  And it never falls, they get half way thru the movie and my phone rings.  Great movie.  I will remember this movie experience for the rest of my life.  One of my all-time favs.",10,0,1,17 May 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Definitely Not Flawless
","Here's the story in a nutshell, a group of 6 gangsters' perform a robbery (which is never shown).  Those that survived the robbery are shown debating which one is a cop.  There is a lot of blood and some shootings.  And there is also one torture scene that is hard to watch. Quentin Tarintino has always been a master of dialogue I will give this movie that.  I just found this movie too long in spots.  Sometimes the characters tend to go on and on. It's one gangster talking to another.  One says `I think this @#$@%! guy is the cop' and than another gangster says `I think this guy is the ^$#&@ cop'.  That's the story. I was a little disappointed that most of the movie takes place in a garage with occasional flashbacks.  But what really disappointed me was with all the flashbacks how come they could not flash back and show the actual robbery?  I gave it 4 out of 10 stars.  Definitely not a movie for women - it is one for guys only.",4,2,5,9 October 2001
