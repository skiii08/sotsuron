The Ring," This was a good movie
","If I had only one complaint it would be that the end was a little predictable and that the movie dragged on just a little bit, but its hard not to drag when youve got a complex story to tell and unravel.I thought that this was a horror movie with elements of mystery that really surprised me, I was excited initially to see this movie and I was not disappointed after I saw it.",6,0,0,6 March 2003
X-Men," X-tremely Fun
","Everything about this movie makes me want more (that and the fact that the running time is a little over 90 minutes) The characters are wonderfully cast (with the possible exceptions of Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry) special effects were excellent, script was decent for a comic book film, My favorite line ' I thought you lived in a school' makes me laugh every time. cant wait for the sequel",8,0,0,6 March 2003
