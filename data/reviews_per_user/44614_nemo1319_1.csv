The Ring," Ring Me Up Baby!
","This movie has to be an ultimate classic, the way that they used an innocent girl and made into a grungy well crawler was magnificent. When I was watching I could see the genius at work, the close ups of Samara's ripped fingernail beds, and her water logged toes. Oh and don't forget the tape! The disturbing objects in her 'loft' and the insects were just the best cinematography I probably I have seen in my life. Also the fuzzy television was lovely, and killing people by scaring them, brings a new freshness into the movie world. I just have to say that no movie makes me want to be smothered and pushed down a well like this one!!! Samara Morgan will become one of the classic horrifying murderers with her counterparts: Michael Meyers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Leather Face. Everyone should experience this amazing work, it is the best I have seen in years. All I want to say is that wearing a stained white gown and having Maryjane's that are too tight is the hottest look, of the season, can you say Fall 2008! This Movie is life changing and everyone should see it before you die! 7 days!",10,6,10,29 May 2007
