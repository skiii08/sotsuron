First Man," Boring, fell asleep!
","I heard that Neil Armstrong's son declared that this movie accurately depicted his father, so based on that I saw the movie. It was a terrible disappointment, so boring that I fell asleep! Also depressing. I thought that surely if Ryan Gosling played the main role, it would be very good, but I was sadly mistaken. Even the special effects seemed cheesy. I should have read the movie-goer reviews more closely... once again the critics' reviews didn't jive with what I saw.",4,9,15,20 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Atypical Tarantino film but worth watching.
","Started slow but Pitt and Dicaprio's star power kept my interest. Certainly not the typical Tarantino film but a welcome change. Definitely an Oscar contender for acting and directing. Very enjoyable, a must-see!",7,2,4,9 August 2019
The Lion King," LOVED IT!
","To the folks who didn't like this movie... I don't know what movie you saw, but I absolutely loved everything about it! Many younger folks didn't see the original, and even though I did see the original, I loved this as much, if not better than the original! The music and visual effects were awesome, and of course Beyonc√©'s singing is on point as usual. A MUST SEE in my opinion, for folks of ALL ages!",10,1,9,25 July 2019
Green Book," Excellent movie on a difficult subject
","I was disappointed that this movie isn't doing well at the box office but after seeing it I understand why, and knowing that it's based on a true story. People don't like to be reminded of the difficult past, the discrimination and prejudice that our country has suffered in the Deep South many years ago, and still exists in some places today. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially seeing the dynamic between the two primary characters, Tony and Dr. Shirley, and given some of the awkward and challenging scenes. Both actors deserve Oscars, and this is a must-see movie for all ages of adults.",9,9,20,7 December 2018
