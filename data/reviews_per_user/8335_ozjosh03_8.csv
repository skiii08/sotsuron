First Man," Over-long, over-hyped, over-rated
","The only real distinction of First Man may be that it's the first over-hyped and over-rated film of next year's Oscar crop. It's a film that is dismally defeated by its own subject matter at every turn. First it wants to be an illuminating, insightful study of Neil Armstrong. But on the evidence of everything it offers, Armstrong was simply not that interesting. If the most startling discovery about your hero is that he was sad about his infant daughter's death, then you're already in deep trouble. Nor is it hugely surprising that a guy who is dedicated to preparing for a mission to the moon isn't exactly a well-rounded, socially adept human being. But many a fascinating film has been built around a cerebral, emotionally-distant, socially awkward character, right? True enough, but it takes an actor with a much greater skill set than Ryan Gosling to make such a character interesting. First Man is essentially two hours of Gosling mooching around trying to find some way of making Armstrong's interior life compelling. That he fails isn't entirely due to his own shortcomings as an actor, but to a screenplay that does little more than rely on his good looks and the 'glamour' of the space race to make Armstrong interesting. But the second big fail of First Man is that it doesn't offer us anything particularly new or interesting about the moon mission. Chazelle's strategy is to eschew the cliches of space movies - the focus on technology and the astronaut's eye view - and stay close on his heroes through interminable sequences in juddering space capsules. There's nothing new about this, other than it being the main, sometimes sole focus. Unfortunately, it becomes tedious long before we get to Apollo 11's trek to the moon. Even the ultimate moon sequence offers little that we don't already know from the grainy footage of the real event that everyone has seen hundreds of times. In short, the term 'epic fail' could have been invented to describe First Man.",4,314,505,16 October 2018
A Star Is Born," It's a man's, man's world, eh Bradley?
","Bradley Cooper's take on this classic fable should really have been re-titled A Star Is Dying because his film is far more focussed on the collapsing career of Jackson Maine than on the rising star of Ally... err, what's her name again? ... oh, that's right, we never learn her second name. Cooper's film reverses the focus and the dynamic of all previous versions to make this primarily a story of addiction, self-destruction and family tragedy, only slightly leavened by the lead character's new romance (albeit doomed) and his girlfriend's new stardom. Thus Cooper gives his character far more screen time than was ever granted to Frederic March, James Mason or Kris Kristofferson. Now, let's be fair: Cooper may be right; perhaps the fall from grace of a big music star is inherently more dramatic than the rise of a self-doubting singer-songwriter. Perhaps he is also a better actor than Lady Gaga will ever be, and therefore more capable of carrying a movie. Perhaps it's also just a good way of wringing a new twist on a much-told, somewhat cliched story. But even if all this is true, I still wonder why Bradley Cooper making the film all about him has attracted only good reviews and Oscar buzz. Nobody has attacked him for rampant egomania. Nobody seems to be questioning the amount of screen time he gets, or the number of juicy ('hello, Oscar voters!') close-ups. Or suggesting that even when drunk and dishevelled he is still styled, lit and shot to look better than poor Gaga, who is scrubbed of all make-up for most of the movie and often dressed in the kind of gowns bitchy brides bestow on their bridesmaids. In short, Cooper has done everything and more that Barbra Streisand was accused of with her 1976 version of A Star Is Born - yet, I would suggest, rather more egregiously, and certainly to the much greater detriment of his co-star. Even when Jackson Maine is dead and gone and Ally finally (or so you might think) has the spotlight to herself, Cooper can't resist superimposing flashback shots of Jackson in happier times over her performance. He even chooses to cut off her final notes for a silent shot of her teary face. So where the finale of Streisand's film takes grief and turns it into art, Coopers' takes art and reduces it to grief - again, making it about his character's death, not about survival and transcending tragedy through music.Cooper's egomania aside, I still found his movie less impressive than the glowing reviews led me to expect. Yes, it's well enough directed, Cooper's performance is excellent (probably Oscar-worthy), and Gaga acquits herself well. But it's no masterpiece and I seriously doubt that Gaga's performance will stand alongside Garland's or Streisand's in either film history or moviegoers' affections. She's great in the few musical moments where she is allowed to shine, but none of her musical sequences have the dramatic impact of Woman in the Moon or the With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now finale from Streisand's movie. Nor do they come anywhere near the sublime musical heights of The Man That Got Away or the Born In A Trunk sequence from Garland's movie. I'm also inclined to think Gaga is sabotaged twice over in the film - first by the drab, make-up free, girl-next-door look she's given in the first half, then, rather more seriously, by the utterly hideous star makeover that lumbers her with an unflattering red wig that could have come from the drag bar featured early in the film. Without the make-up she's vaguely pretty if you're being generous. Post-makeover she looks like a cos-play fan at Comic Con. Even worse is the musical makeover Ally gets. Say what you like about how Streisand never meshed with the rock setting of her film, at least her musical numbers showcased her unique talent and she was thrillingly herself. Gaga, on the other hand, is required to morph into some gyrating Beyonce/J-Lo hybrid that does nothing to highlight her real and genuine talent.And here's where I have another serious issue with Cooper's film. In all previous incarnations the heroine fights against attempts to package her as something she's not. She becomes more herself through the rise to stardom. Esther Blodgett becomes Vicki Lester, but she baulks at any extreme makeover. Esther Hoffman defiantly keeps both her name and her style. Ally, in Coopers' version, submits to both a musical and personal makeover without any real protest - and with seemingly no awareness that the physical makeover makes her look ridiculous. In the final scene she's ditched the red hair, but that's the only sign she might be standing up for herself. Ally is also more submissive generally. Jackson is already pretty far gone when they meet, so she knows he's doomed. But she goes there anyway, which makes her something of a masochist and rather more of a victim. And when she's not trying to keep Jackson in line, Ally is running around cleaning up after her widowed father. There's no mention of Ally's mother, only a passing mention of Jackson's mother, but a great deal of talk about his father, and much screen time devoted to the tortured relationship with his older brother. All in all, it's a very male film, more concerned with male characters and male relationships. Ally gets a male best friend too. And the only 'women' in her life are drag queens. This movie sure doesn't pass the Bechdel test. Indeed, it offers up a classic case of female erasure. So where Streisand's film is consciously feminist, with points to make about women's place in the world and in relationships, and a determination NOT to depict Esther as a victim, Cooper downplays Ally's strength and independence in favour of a narrative about men and their problems. In fact, if it weren't for the 70s fashions you could quite easily believe that Coopers movie was made in the 70s and Streisand's was made today. To that extent Streisand's movie has a sense of social purpose that Coopers' entirely lacks.In short, I'd suggest Streisand's A Star Is Born deserves to be very favourably re-assessed in the wake of Cooper's film. Yes, the Streisand film was a vanity project. But hardly more so than Cooper's. Yes, her film was flawed and compromised, and copped a lot of flak. Cooper's film is, in my view, rather more seriously flawed, yet has attracted mostly unstinting praise. It sure pays to be a man in Hollywood.",4,13,27,24 October 2018
Darkest Hour," A pile of old tosh
","I've grudgingly allotted four stars for three of the leading performances. Gary Oldman certainly pulls out all the stops to deliver a performance that is convincing, colourful and entirely unsurprising. Yet he's also acted off the screen by Ben Mendelsohn every time Winston meets King George, for Mendelsohn gives a performance that is more under-stated, more human and less obviously manipulative. Oldman is also out-charisma'd whenever Kristin Scott Thomas glides into view as Clemmie. So for all its earnest Oscar-worthiness, Oldman's performance isn't even the best in the film. Acting aside, there is almost nothing to recommend Darkest Hour. It's burdened with clumsy plot exposition that sounds precisely like it's been cut and pasted from a history book. It's undercut by cheap, unconvincing special effects. And, most remarkably of all - even if you've somehow been sucked in by the amateur dramatics - it has one spectacularly ill-judged scene that instantly sinks the entire enterprise. You won't have any trouble spotting which scene I mean. You'll probably be laughing out loud or reaching for something to hurl at the screen. It's when poor anguished Winston takes the advice of the King and determines to ask the British people what to do. So he heads for the London Underground and - travelling just one stop east on the District Line! - chats with a cross-section of plucky Brits who all urge him to fight on. It couldn't be more ridiculous if one said 'fight them on the beaches', the next said 'fight them on the landing fields' , and the next 'fight them in the fields'. It actually couldn't be more ridiculous if they all then simultaneously broke into a song titled 'We Shall Never Surrender' and Winston danced merrily with a couple of pearly kings and queens. It's a scene so mind-bogglingly awful that any respect you might have had for the film drains completely away and you spend the rest of the running time pondering just how something so awful was ever contemplated, much less actually staged and shot.",4,46,67,14 January 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," For the record...
","In the interest of balance (and as a clue to the filmmaker's intentions), it's worth noting that many friends and associates of the real life Ron Woodruff have attested that he was not remotely homophobic and worked happily alongside gays. Some even thought he was gay, or at least bi. (Interviews with these people can easily be found online). In choosing to depict Woodruff as a redneck homophobe Dallas Buyers Club rather self-consciously opts for an unquestionably straight hero, while almost entirely airbrushing gays out of the picture. It also defames a real life hero who has nobody left to defend him. The truth, of course, is that the Dallas Buyers Club, like many similar ventures at the time, was largely run by gay activists. But they are nowhere to be seen here. Instead, we have the titillating composite figure of Rayon, the transvestite with a heart of (Oscar) gold. Again, interesting that the filmmakers opted to replace all those real life gays with a star turn for an actor in a dress. Many reviewers have been happy to describe this movie as sensitive or daring or brave. In fact, it's just another piece of Hollywood exploitation, as timid and untruthful in its way as Philadelphia, and far more concerned with being a showcase for actors than with the truth of the story it purports to be championing.",6,42,70,20 February 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Entertainingly self-indulgent
","It's easy to see why Tarantino's film has been such a hit with film critics and film buffs. It's an ode to the movies. It weaves a story around showbiz icons and showbiz trivia. It is crammed with cute cameos. And it revolves around masterly performances by a couple of genuine screen legends. There's also something undeniably mesmerising about the era and the events around the Manson murders in LA. And the film positively oozes with Tarantino's enthusiasm for vintage 1960s Hollywood, and for all manner of sub-genres, from westerns to cheesy television to martial arts. But can we at least acknowledge that, for all the intoxicating nostalgia and quirky revisionist history, Tarantino doesn't really deliver much in the way of narrative drive. The film ambles along like a cowboy with three-day blisters. It shifts between scenarios that are almost devoid of dramatic tension (Sharon goes to the movies; Cliff fixes an antenna). And if it wasn't for Charles Manson and his crazies hovering over the proceedings there would be precious little in the way of suspense or dramatic tension through much of the movie. To that extent, Once Upon A Time is often a bit like a trip to a museum. It's often diverting. Occasionally fascinating. And you glimpse various different stories along the way. But it falls some way short of being a gripping, wholly engaging ride.",6,4,5,14 December 2019
Marriage Story," Phone rings, door chimes... in comes Company!
","Maybe it's the relative dearth of movies about real people and real life that has critics and amateur reviewers falling over themselves in praise of Marriage Story. Maybe it's the sheer novelty of being drawn into a story that unfolds on a human scale, without magical powers, cataclysmic action and layers of CGI. Or maybe there's just something about this movies' attempt at a raw and visceral examination of divorce that has pushed buttons on both sides of the gender divide. Marriage Story certainly deserves praise for all those things, even if it doesn't deserve maximum stars and unqualified acclaim. The film's main virtues are the central performances. Driver and Johansson are strong enough to make you care (or almost care) about two not overly likeable characters, and they're real enough to (again, almost) overcome some of the more contrived aspects of the story, dialogue and direction. Even more so, Laura Dern and Alan Alda embody the best, but mostly the worst of the legal system, playing wildly different divorce lawyers - from well-meaning but ineffectual (Alda) to malevolent and toxic (Dern). If there's one aspect of Marriage Story that's truly great, it's the way it totally skewers the legal profession. Aside from that, it's a rather patchy affair. Obviously an acrimonious divorce calls for a flawed couple and some entrenched, unreasonable viewpoints. Even so, it becomes increasingly hard to buy some aspects of the irretrievable differences on show here. Charlie goes on believing that he and Nicole still live in New York, long, long after it is abundantly clear that this isn't the case. And Nicole is just too easily swayed by her rottweiler of a lawyer for us to believe that she's anywhere near as well-intentioned as we're supposed to think she is. The final showdown between the estranged couple - and the big acting tour de force for both leads - is both tortuously contrived and clumsily written. It takes everything Driver and Johansson have to (almost) make it fly. Thereafter Marriage Story becomes quite nauseatingly mawkish and sentimental, so much so that it's almost like another director has been brought in for re-shoots. The lowest point is an extended Sondheim homage that starts with Nicole and her mother and sister in a weirdly slapdash performance of You Could Drive A Person Crazy (they're all playing professional actors, so one has to wonder why it's so bad) and ends with Charlie giving an impromptu and supposedly gut-wrenching piano bar performance of Being Alive (both songs from Sondheim's Company, a show about marriage). It's hard to feel anything other than befuddled when a movie that has spent two hours trying to convince you that it's virtually a docudrama suddenly bursts into song. But if you can, the only conclusion is that Noah Baumbach has failed to come up with any original conclusions about the pros and cons of marriage, and has instead resorted to quoting Stephen Sondheim. And he's not necessarily wrong - there's as much wisdom in those three minutes of Being Alive as there is in the other two hours and twenty minutes of Marriage Story. So, to summarise what Baumbach seems to be saying: divorce is hell, divorce lawyers are evil, nobody really deserves either, but if you're looking for a take on marriage that is both profound and uplifting you should probably get a DVD of Sondheim's Company.",7,6,8,19 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A limp, tame, not-particularly-original attempt at satire
","Let's cut right to the chase: Jojo Rabbit is every bit as original and effective a satire as Hogan's Heroes. It takes precisely the same approach to the Nazis, broadly caricaturing them as bumbling idiots and two-dimensional bullies. So it's no surprise that JoJo suffers from exactly the same problem as Hogan's Heroes: there's nothing real or threatening or genuinely sinister about these Nazis. They're just buffoons. Perhaps JoJo is marginally more daring in going so far as to depict Hitler himself, but Waititi's Fuhrer is as flimsy and fey as Mel Brook's take on him in Springtime For Hitler - only without the biting, derisive satire and the consistent hilarity. How funny you find JoJo Rabbit will likely depend on whether you also find The Three Stooges and Road Runner cartoons laugh-out-loud funny, for that's the level of most of what passes for humour here. If this is what passes for 'comedy genius' and 10 out of 10 film-making in the 21st century, then heaven help us all.",4,80,176,28 December 2019
Joy," Joy-less
","It's not hard to see why this movie divides people. Some will always find a tale of an under-dog's trial over adversity compelling, no matter how clumsily it's told. And some will find a story about the manufacture of a mop dull, no matter how charismatic the characters or inspirational the telling of the tale. The problem here is that charisma and inspiration are in short supply. David O. Russell doesn't make much of the real strengths of the story. And he can't resist imposing his trademark style on characters and a story that really don't either warrant or suit it. So the characters are more than a little grotesque around the edges; the situations are all heightened, even given an absurdist spin; and the facts are never allowed to get in the way, even when they might actually strengthen the story. So much of Joy is desperately predictable, which makes for dispiriting viewing. And the real moments of surprise or pathos are just so much grist to the Russell mill. Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead, and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's about where the positives end. For the most part, Joy is a tedious mess. While it's a story that would probably never have been told without David O. Russell wanting to enhance it with his schtick, it's a story I wish they'd entrusted to anyone other than David O. Russell.",4,179,302,27 December 2015
