The Ring," Unnecessary but better than expected
","'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' was sold out so I grudgingly went to see this. Usually I hate supernatural horror but I enjoyed the original Japanese version of 'The Ring'. Despite its inherently implausable premise (a haunted video tape) the Japanese movie had enough atmosphere and interesting scenes and characters to make it a worthwhile piece of film.Surprisingly, the American remake is not a total disaster. Of course, it has been Hollywood-ized greatly and, needless to say, it doesn't improve on the original, but it is not without merit.There is some interesting imagery and some chilling moments (though most of the scares come from unexpected loud noises). Funnily enough, I could detect an influence from the trashy horror movie 'Final Destination' -particularly the water motif and a sequence towards the end.The writer and director have tried to explain the story of Samara more than the original did. This works in some respects but really could have been developed further (and the CGI used near the end was not necessary).The worst change is the new version of the video tape which is crap. Not scary at all -it looks too professional and well made. Also, the soundtrack throughout the film is too overpowering -a bit of subtlety would have been nice.Naomi Watts has had some bad press for her acting in this film but I thought she was fine. The actor who annoyed me most was the one playing the little boy -he just did a poor impression of Haley Joel Osment in the 'Sixth Sense'.The more you think about the film, the more stupid it seems, but whilst you're actually watching it, it is an effective and quietly disturbing movie. Still, see the original!5/10",5,0,1,23 March 2003
City of God," Stunning gangster movie
","If I had written this review as soon as I came out of the cinema I think I would have given it 9/10. However, having had a week or so to reflect on the movie I don't think I will be quite so generous.CITY OF GOD has many good points: the directing, the acting, the locations, the interesting storyline. But I can't help thinking that it's all a little hollow. The central theme of the movie is that violence breeds violence -true but trite. Perhaps the worst thing about it is that, despite the violence, the slums in which the film is set don't seem like such a terrible place to live. The people there have a strong sense of community and, as long as they don't step out of line, all seem to be fairly happy. As a piece of social commentary, I don't think the movie really pulls it off.Regardless of these flaws, CITY OF GOD is stunning to look at and a joy to watch. If you like action or gangster movies then this is the film to see.7/10",7,5,10,30 January 2003
Coyote Ugly," I only managed 50 minutes.
","After 50 minutes of this I had to leave the room -I just couldn't sit through it anymore. Everything about this movie is mediocre: the plot, the script, the acting, everything! Not one scene managed to look authentic or believable. The story is just the usual teen movie drek about someone reaching their dreams, blah, blah, blah.Sometimes everyone wants to watch something a bit trashy that doesn't require you to use your brain, but this is just too moronic. I suggest you only watch this if you are very unintelligent or very young and easily impressed.1/10",1,3,5,1 February 2003
