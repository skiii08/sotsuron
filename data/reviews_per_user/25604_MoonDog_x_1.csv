Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A thrill ride for all ages
","I had the chance to see The Phantom Menace (TPM) in Toronto, Ontario last week. I'll get right to the point. The effects were unsurpassable; from the scenery to the characters themselves. Darth Maul gave the audience shivers from his visage alone, and Anakin Skywalker, brought a warmth to the audience, even though most of them know what he'll turn into. I had one problem with this movie. Jar Jar Binks, the amphibian Roger Rabbit-like creature was sometimes hard to understand with his accent at first, but eventually I got used to it. The Pod Racing scenes had everyone on the edges of their seats; and to make a long story short, I urge you all to see this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars, go see it. The special effects will blow you away.",10,0,1,16 May 1999
