Hereditary," Satanic worshipping
","Two hours of my life I can't get back. Slow, boring and ends with a satanic twist. Don't waste your time.",1,0,2,9 September 2018
Hugo," Worst Movie I have seen in years
","I took my wife and 6 and 11 year old to see this film. I love Martin Scorsese and the reviews were good so I was excited. While the 3D effects were nice, overall this movie brings nothing to the table. The child actors were not convincing and the story line was incredibly boring. There is no adventure or excitement, even though the actors keep promising to take us on an adventure. When the movie was over I was scratching my head trying to figure out what had just happened. From reading other reviews it appears to have something to do with film preservation?I usually agree with the ratings on IMDb, but not this time. I looked at my watch more than the screen, and my 6 year old fell asleep!!! If you decide to see this film bring lots of caffeine or be sure to have your smart phone so you can play Angry Birds(or your App of choice).Do not waste your money or two hours of your life on this horrible movie.",1,22,42,5 February 2012
