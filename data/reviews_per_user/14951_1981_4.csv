The Blair Witch Project," A classic.
","I have never seen a feature picture quite like this one. Everything about this is intelligent, the $25,000 budget, the acting, the open script, the secrecy with the publicity. I am very impressed. The photography is different and the tone of the picture is very effective, it truly is a student documentary that has been well edited. The acting is superb because it is realistic and intimate, no one was coaching, they had an open script and had to rely on each other. This is very intelligent and a true money maker!",10,1,2,2 August 1999
American History X," A good film, but limited in scope.
","I would imagine that this could make a very fine book because the issues that the script attempts to address are fascinating and infinitely complicated. However, in a two hour time frame it is very difficult to attempt to understand how the human mind and psyche operates as well as how family dynamics are constructed and/or break down.This movie is primarily concened with the effect racism, loss and hatred have had on Daniel and Derek Vinyard. They lost their father in a racially motivated killing and the stress and tragic results this event had on their family led both of them to turn toward hate, particularly the older Derek who, under duress, vainly attempts to fill his father's shoes after his death. Derek's decision to turn toward a local skinhead organization has a significant impact upon his younger brother who is in need of a father figure.While Derek is in prison he begins to try and reform his ways and through the help of a former teacher, begins to see past the intellectual and logical confines of the racial-hatred he had adopted. His experiences with skinheads in jail only further solidifies his feelings that something is very wrong with racial hatred. Without a doubt we could devote a lengthy picture to studying Derek's character development, his motivations and how his decision making leads him to the different stages in his development. This movie mistakenly attempts to both briefly accomplish this and examine the development of the younger Daniel. The two hour format does not allow more than a cursory attempt at character examination and furthermore, we find that the social tensions and racially motivated hatreds that are so prominent in these two main characters, are not evenly remotely addressed from the point of view of persons on the other side, notably minorities or other poor or lower-middle class whites struggling with similar economic difficulties. The movie leaves us with another equivocal point, what about the racially motivated killing of Derek's brother Daniel. What is the purpose of this action in the story? While on the one hand racial killings occur on a regular basis and for apparently simple reasons, how does this relate to the trajectory of the story? To me it seems like a very simple and Hollywood way of ending a story that is too complicated to resolve in so short a time frame. Is this God paying Derek back? That too seems extremely sophomoric an ending, a very biblical explanation to a question that, by its very nature, is challenging conventions and demanding that those who are willing to entertain its implications, rise above simple answers and their own assumptions and prejudices. The ending is a disappointment because it does not acknowledge the very difficult and complicated causes which led to its very occurence. I have to admit, I walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied. While this was a good film with excellent acting, I must add that the script seems as though it either falls short, or loses its resolve.",8,0,0,11 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Visually stunning. A sensory masterpiece.
","I believe the crafting of music with visual image and motion makes this movie a masterpiece, a unique event in western film. My one criticism, a small one at that, is the story lacks the subtlety and complexity that demands masterful acting, however the images and score quell my complaints. Nowadays a masterpiece comes in many forms, there is no one guise for evaluating film.",10,0,0,24 May 2001
Where Eagles Dare," An excellent, laconic adventure film.
","My highest praise is reserved for films that, with little ornamentation or pretense, accomplish their task. 'Where Eagles Dare' does so with few one liners and special effects that are a part but not an overwhelming part of the script. In other words, there is little or no room for gratuitousness in this picture.It is interesting to see Richard Burton in a role that demands little or no dialogue, especially considering this is a man who has rendered dialogue most exquisitely beautiful by the particular lilt of his voice. In this role he is frank and only speaks when necessary, therefore, seeing as how most of this film is action, he says very little. Some purists would fault Burton for taking a role that seems devoid of the usual acting challenges he appeared to enjoy attacking early in his career, but I disagree. This film is a departure from the normal Burton 'oeuvre' and yet he does pull of the role of Major Smith convincingly. One does not expect this man to be either audacious nor flamboyant and Burton, whose very presence suggests a call for histrionics, executes this role quietly. Now it is well known that Burton was not seeking a challenge by taking on this project, his primary concern was revamping his potency in the box-office by staring in a blockbuster. And he got it. But we cannot fault him for that because he possessed the facility as an actor to pull it off. Burton could be both a dramatic performer and a daring sex symbol. Besides, standing alongside a veritable 'tough-guy' like Eastwood, Burton needed to be able to hold his end up because the movie going audience had already identified Eastwood as the quintessential tough guy. Had Burton not been up to the task, this film would not have been a success.The script is entertaining and has a few notable twists in it, a testament to the skill of screenwriter and adventure novelist Alistair MacClain. Character development is not of particular importance in this story and yet one does come away with a palpable sense of Major Smith, a fact that I again acknowledge is the handywork of Burton, whose presence is auspicious regardless of his role. Overall, this film appears to be able to balance the rhythmic quietude of action while interjecting enough personal flair to make the film memorable and not another futile exercise in on-screen action and viewer instant gratification/escapism. This movie is one of the best in its genre and is worth a good viewing.",8,6,7,18 June 2001
