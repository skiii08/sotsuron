The Hangover," Fat Jesus has left the building.
","Not since 1984's Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks has a good old bachelor movie come along like 'The Hangover'. Doug (Justin Bartha) is getting married and heads to Vegas for a low key bachelor party with mates Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis aka. Fat Jesus).The night doesn't turn out as planned and they wake to find their hotel room trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and the groom missing. With no memory of what happened the rest of the movie is a hilarious trek through Vegas trying to put the pieces together.There are no big name comedians, instead a chemistry that develops quickly between the guys which makes the comedy work, especially from Zach Galifianakis who really shines. Heather Graham is as hot as usual, and Mike Tyson has a cameo which is the only part I didn't like. A lot of improvisation can be felt through out the whole film and there are some great photo's at the end credits that looked like they really did go on a wild night in Vegas.",Null,1,3,13 January 2010
Sherlock Holmes," DIDOMAN: The game is a foot
","Guy Ritchie has conjured up some black magic, and given us an exciting, fun and mischievous Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) with Dr Watson (Jude Law) at his side forever getting him out of trouble. The two are great together, playing up to each other like old school room mates.Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is a serial killing Satanist and London is in fear of his dark powers. Holmes and Watson are hired to find the truth behind the mystery, meeting up along the way with classic characters like Irene Dunn (Rachel McAdams) and Inspector Lestrade. In Guy Ritchie, lock stock and barrel style, the action is calculated and logical, and compliments Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' vision of Sherlock Holmes as the avid boxer and martial artist, along with his powers of observation, deductive skills and master of disguise.The recreation of 19th Century London is amazing, especially with the attention to detail as Holmes walks around a busy, bustling and growing city landscape. New fans will take to him and old fans wont be disappointed as the movie keeps to the canon set by Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' novels and stories, although there is no mention of Holmes darker side of experimentation's with drugs, but maybe that comes later, along with newer foes to catch in the franchise to follow.Being a big Sherlock Holmes fan I loved it, but I would say even new fans who know nothing of the famous character will like this fresh update on the old Holmes, and hopefully get some kids out there to pick up a book and delve deeper...
