Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest movie I have EVER seen...and that's saying something.
","I will need about a week to process everything I just saw. Good GAWD! (once you've seen it, you will know what I mean) Sacha Baron Cohen is out of his mind, and he's a genius. I laughed harder than I have ever laughed in a theater. I will have to see this movie again so that I can catch all of the parts I missed while trying to recover. This movie absolutely ruined me. It is 12:30 am here now and I imagine I will be up until about 4 laughing. What a maniac. I am not sure this film will remain intact in it's present form when it hits theaters. It is too insane. They will probably censor the hell out of it which would be a real shame...Oh my God this movie is funny.",10,9,28,20 September 2006
