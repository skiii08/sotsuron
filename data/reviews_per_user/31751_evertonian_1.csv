The Blair Witch Project," Oh dear. hardly a classic chiller was it.
","I have never seen a cinema manager barracked by the audience before. Sadly the night I watched this drivel the audience did queue up for their money back. The amazing thing...some of them actually got half price vouchers for another film. I'm afraid this is not a case of an audience missing the point of a classic horror movie but rather quite the opposite. As I waited, heart pounding, hot dog and popcorn at the ready for the movie to start, all the talk around me was the same 'At last were gonna get a good old fashioned chiller instead of those ridiculous slasher movies'. My personal all time favourite movie of this genre was 'The Changeling' an early 1980's film with George C Scott. I wondered could Blair Witch do the same as that film did?. I didn't want bloody scenes of some ice hockey masked looney slashing up every heavy cleavaged long legged bimbo in town and thankfully i didn't get that. What I did want was strange noises and happenings. I wanted to spend this film with the hair on the back of my neck standing to attention while I scanned the background of the shot to see if something was lurking there. Nope didnt get that either. I watched for 90 minutes waiting for a single moment that would cause my body to tense up. I watched these three characters stumble through the woods arguing. The last thirty second promised something close to a chilling moment but by then I was too numb with boredom to properly react. My advice. If you love a good old fashioned chill as opposed to blood and gore slasher movies, Blair witch is not the film. True it is an alternative to the slashers and i applaud the directors for their attempts but I suggest that you leave this out of your halloween video list. Rent out 'The Changeling [George C Scott], What lies beneath [Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfieffer] and Ghost Story [Fred Astair, Douglas fairbanks jnr...it was made in the 80's so dont let the actors put you off] These three are truly chilling movies.",Null,0,0,22 October 2000
