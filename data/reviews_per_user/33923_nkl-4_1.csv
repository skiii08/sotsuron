Deja Vu," I loved it
","I am a big fan of time travel themed movies(I even liked Bill and Ted's excellent adventure) , Back to the future being my favorite. And Deja Vu is one of the best. It combines Adventure, Action and Science Fiction well with a romantic theme. Tony Scott and Jerry 'the lightning tree' Buckheimer have done well.Denzel as usual is excellent,Isn't he getting better and better?, well supported by Val Kilmer and the rest. And I LOVE Paula Patton. I hope to see lot more of her in the future. (No pun intended!)This is my first ever review in this site, any comments and advice welcome.",8,1,2,20 January 2007
