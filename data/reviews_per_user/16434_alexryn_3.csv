The Blair Witch Project," And here we are 20 years later
","When this movie first came out it was cultural phenomenon. This was, I get it, since this is a pioneer found-footage genre movie. No one has actually done anything like it before. But what is the main principle of this kind of pictures? Realism. We have to believe it's true, the camera is not outside of the story, taping it - it's basically one of the characters.
Hence we get what we get - this genre was in fact very timely. Being just a way of cinematography language nowadays it's completely left its predecessor, its founder behind.
The Blair Witch Project could only be made twenty years ago, when it was possible to make it look credible enough for us, viewers, even if just for a second to believe that this all might have actually been true (or forget it couldn't). It helped that the actors were all no-names and the Internet was long way from where it is now.
Of course if you look close enough and are picky enough you'll find tons of inconsistencies, but we have to treat it for what it is - cultural phenomenon.",5,1,3,8 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Goes and goes merry-go-round
","It became a sort of new hobby of mine. 'Reviewing this title', this specific one, since for some reason they won't post my review. Anyway, back to it.
The 8th episode is the best of the sequel Star Wars trilogy. Unlike The Force Awakens it's not indulging ridiculous fandom by copying the original trilogy, instead The Last Jedi introduces new concepts and ideas despite of hateful fanboys who ridiculed even George Lucas' prequels which had nothing wrong with them.
And the 9th... don't get me started on the 9th. Clusterfrick (to put it mildly) is what it was since J. J. wanted to compromise and destroyed not only new good things but all the old as well turning Star Wars into cartoon basically.
Lots of viewers complained how some things Rian Johnson included were 'wrong' and 'corrupting the lore', but you know what? No. If you worry about the lore and integrity of the vast universe collectively created by tons of books, games and so on you should blame Disney that destroys everything it touches.
However it makes sense they ignored the majority of 'uncanonical' stuff leaving only the 6 movies to work with. It's easier, wider audience to get to buy the tickets etc.
Here is the thing: what I personally like about the first 6 episodes the most is the personal approach. Yeah, it's epic, there is the prophecy, the chosen one..., but (even though the force is strong in Skywalker family) the characters didn't seem like omnipotent demigods/superheroes, they faced their fears and we believed them. The 8th is trying just that by making Luke broken and Rey all alone and confused. Plus, not everyone should be someone's daughter/son/grandparent, sometimes heredity is not all that important.
And it's like Luke said to Rey 'the force doesn't belong to the Jedi', same goes for the story, this magical world Lucas created long time ago.",9,0,5,31 May 2020
Midsommar," Imperfect, but talented attempt in deconstruction of horror genre
","I'd like to start by saying that Ari Aster is great artist, in my opinion. Hereditary for instance was a true revelation for me. A new word in horrors and a proof that they are not necessarily need to be shallow and can be truly scary and artsy (in the very best way possible) at the same time. I'd like to think of his debut as a deconstruction of horror genre (successful, unlike this one), more specifically: movies about demonic possession. Not to get into details: it was atmospheric, scary, clever and even funny towards the end - all the aspects of horror, in other words. Besides it had some great character development, deep psychological take on family drama and many more. Why do I get so much into the first one? Well, let's have a look how Midsommar fails by comparison.
Being, again, in my opinion, an attempt of deconstructing horror genre (here - about cults) it also, like in previous one, has really cool insides and analysis of romantic relationships, dealing with trauma and personal take on the family as a concept. Again, great cinematography, the actors are all top notch, interesting story even, exciting conflicts established etc. BUT! Like his characters-anthropologists Ari Aster here is not able to finish his thesis. Why? Because the movie is getting lost eventually in all the genre features and attributes. It's all in the bad (in my opinion) finale: character development? Forget it, the main character becomes just a simple offended girlfriend and not a complex character worth sympathy as she was introduced at first. Deconstruction of a genre? More like typical example, representative of one if you will. Deep analysis of psychological family drama? Try just a precursor of this banal horror story to reveal itself in the most ordinary fashion.
All the more disappointing it was for me that all of this could have unfolded beautifully since the movie had it all. But for the ending. However I would recommend watching it due to the talents involved and most probably will watch director's cut myself if it ever arrives.",6,0,1,21 July 2019
