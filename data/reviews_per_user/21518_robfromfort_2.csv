The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not worthy of any stars
","This should have been called Twilight: Boring Yawn.Nothing happens and then some more nothing happens, followed by more of nothing finished with a little more nothing.The other three films were all pretty good in their own right but this was frankly not worth the lost hours of my life.My guess is this was just made reaaaaaalllllllyyyyyyy loooonnnnnnngggggg so they could rip it into two films and make double at the box office when the last one comes along.Avoid this film at all costs, if you need to know what happens to understand the next film I've added the plot below.*SPOILER/ TIME AND MONEY SAVER* She gets married and preggers, Jake gets angry a lot and she dies. Then she becomes a vampire with red eyes. Credits roll.",1,6,7,26 March 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Could have been worse...
","Uwe Boll could have directed it.Throw all the money in the world at this and it's still junk. Arterton is never going to be a leading lady, this and Clash of the Titans is enough to prove this. She may get away with some quirky British films but even then...Just after halfway through this film I was getting seriously bored. Kingsley was stereotyped and wasted as an actor, Jake is, well, meh. And as stated a few lines up Arterton is, well who cares and that's the point. She could have died early on and I'd have not not given a second thought.I don't care how much you throw at a movie and this had a lot of dollars, you can't take poo, cover it in glitter and call it a diamond. It seems this was expected to be the result from the makers. Oh how wrong. Sparkly poo is sparkly poo.If you get a choice, this over something else, watch something else. If your stuck and this is only option, see if you can make it to the end.Now perhaps, if your a Prince of Persia game junkie and have some kind of emotional link from gaming, your experience may be more enjoyable. Otherwise life is short and this film is wasting it.",4,2,4,22 September 2010
