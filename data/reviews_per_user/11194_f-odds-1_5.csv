Vertigo," A masterpiece of torpor
","It staggers credulity to read that this dull, plodding film with its embarrassingly silly plot has now been rated as the greatest movie of all time. I have watched it three times: in the early 60s when it was first released in the UK, again some 10 years ago and once again last night. Nothing has changed. Vertigo doesn't merit high rating even among Hitchcock's prolific output; to elevate it to all-time supreme status is an unspeakable act of self pomposity from the critics concerned.A film like Vertigo depends almost entirely on raising the viewer's interest in its characters. Disappointing, then, that its two principals play their roles as if they're half-asleep on drugs. James Stewart has many times played with success the seemingly slow-witted, slow moving character who's aware of a lot more than it appears. In Vertigo this Stewart stock persona is inappropriate. One wonders if they first shot the scene where he's mute, staring and unresponding in the hospital and he decided to continue in this mode but mouthing the script lines as they came along.How anyone could begin to fall in love with such a frigid, boring personality as played by Kim Novak is beyond comprehension. She is consistently out-performed by trees, buildings and props throughout the piece. Far from conveying an intriguing, sexually arresting character, she leaves the viewer marvelling that nobody thought to save budget by substituting a tailor's mannequin.Had Vertigo been directed by anyone without Hitchcock's reputation (one that's deserved but which, most unusually, seems to encourage enthusiasts to believe he never makes a clunker) it would have been written off as poor stuff — indeed it was correctly regarded as mediocre when it first came out. It isn't a bad film, in the sense of godawful, laughably inept. It's just so far from good that people with normally functioning eyes and ears will shrug and say 'ho-hum!'",1,66,114,5 August 2012
Black Swan," The worst kind of trash
","I can't resist writing the one-thousandth review! Just watched the movie on DVD. I thought this was supposed to be a great and compelling film about the pressures of ballet dancing. It's just a pile of tripe. No top-flight dancer, musician, athlete or anything else professional can be as self-absorbed as the heroine (?) of this film: they have to do a squillion technical things to get over their performance, otherwise they'd be replaced without hesitation. So let's assume it's all a fantasy in which the Natalie Portman character imagines all manner of hallucinations as she goes into the toughest role in the ballet repertoire (is it really?!). A good film fantasy makes the viewer interested, shocked, amazed, horrified. This one mostly makes the viewer bored, with an overwhelming sense of nausea at the stock characters (domineering mother, rivals out to trip up the star) and the stock situations (sexual interactions that may or may not be real, woundings and murders that may or may not have happened). For goodness' sake: this sort of thing has been churned out time after time in countless B movies and it's done here more expensively but not any better. The whole thing resembles a Ken Russell effort made on an extremely bad and mindless day.",1,7,12,4 November 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Stinker, staler: an epic in dull, plodding movie making
","This is one of those films in which everybody looks at everybody else deeply meaningfully, to convey a story that by now lacks both originality and interest (who is the mole in the organization?! wowee!). The characters even walk slowly and purposefully to ensure you realize they're involved in something terribly significant.Every small step of the plot is unfolded with the kind of heavy handed, overblown technique so beloved of the pretentious auteur directors of the 1960s. I thought they didn't make them like this any more, but unfortunately I was wrong. I'd like to give such an obviously high quality cast and production team the benefit of the doubt; that they caught me in a bad mood on a bad day. But when you see even railway trains overacting you have objective evidence that you're watching a film whose makers think they're a darn sight smarter than they really are. One cutaway shows a portion of railway track switching — presumably symbolism that someone in the story just got the point (geddit?).I'm sorry I couldn't like this one better; it is meant to give us a realistic view of the tedious but dangerous business of cold war spying. But it takes ponderous, pretentious movie making to new heights. Perhaps we should put it on the record as the first film in which the techniques of method acting are extended to infest everyone concerned, right down to the chief grip.",2,55,108,18 October 2011
The Book Thief," Trite and tedious
","This is an 'Oh my goodness!' film. With each change of scene you think to yourself 'Oh my goodness, has it not ended yet!' And what makes it worse is that from some allusions in the script and some flashbacks towards the end, it's pretty clear there's probably another hour's worth of footage that could have been included. Why Max leaves home hale and hearty (the first time we see him in the film) then arrives at Lisl's house a wreck (the next time we see him) is entirely up to the viewer to imagine. Many incidents are unrealistic: people secretly sheltering a jew during World War II just would not behave in many of the ways we're shown in the movie: they'd keep the lowest conceivable profile. When people are killed by bombs landing on houses they don't emerge nicely dressed but dusty and without a mark on them. The way the cast speak, in English with pseudo-German accents, might be acceptable, but throwing in occasional German words ('ja', 'nein', 'und') is just plain dumb. With its score that turns on swelling strings every time something heart rending happens and an unnecessary voice-over that inanely purports to come from some supernatural death or god figure, this film is clearly aimed at those with high appreciation of all things saccharine. The film is not moving, just tedious. The plot is neither convincing nor uplifting, just trite and often unrealistic.",3,10,18,4 March 2014
Avatar," Dances with wolves meets Ray Harryhausen
","This is an expensively made but dreadful film. It feels like sitting through 2 hours of a visually fine computer game. As many have already said, the plot is a rehash of Dances With Wolves (among many others). The ending is predictable from halfway through the movie and, because this is a Hollywood film we inevitably sit through a noisy battle climax in which the baddies are gradually wiped out till only the chief baddie is left for hand-to-hand combat with the chief goodie. Yawn.The many monsters that pop up as computer animations ad nauseum are consistently reminiscent of the earlier creations of the marvellous Ray Harryhausen and are used in much the same way: either in combat with the blue or white bipeds or as allies in the form of flying or galloping mounts.Unless you have a major cerebral dysfunction common to the producers of Avatar's cretinous plot (the main complaint about the film is that at root it's just plain dumb!) you'll need to look out for the many sources of unintentional amusement. Enjoy Sigourney Weaver's avatar's curious two-piece beach outfit, which stands out ridiculously against the other bare-breasted, loinclothed females, presumably because this actress refused to work topless. (The toplessness seems curiously gratuitous anyway.) Enjoy the countless continuity lapses and scientific idiocies (two helicopter props rotating on the same shaft will counteract each other's thrust: duh!). Think about what it would really take to transport the endless huge machines and other installations to another planet.If, at the moment you see the trolleys of bombs being loaded on the main aircraft, you briefly think it's a cargo of beer cans, you'll probably share my view of this film. In a year or two it will take its rightful place as an expensive movie curiosity. Meanwhile it will continue to be regarded as a wonderful experience by those too young to have watched anything other than similar computerized shoot-em-ups animated with less gloss and panache.",1,13,36,4 January 2010
