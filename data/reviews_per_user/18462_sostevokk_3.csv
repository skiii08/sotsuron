The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Blown Away
","I think it's been quite sometime since i enjoyed a film as much as i did The Perks of Being a Wallflower.I really had no idea what to expect as i had not even stumbled upon a review before seeing it let alone read the book and i was totally blown away by it.A brilliant story line and superb performances from Watson,Lerman and Miller to really bring these characters to life.I'm not going to gush over this element and that of the film i will just say that i would highly recommend seeing this if you have not already had a chance.It really is a bit special.It's not often these days that i feel delighted to have seen a film but thats the effect The Perks of Being a Wallflower had on me.I honestly just felt like watching it again straight away.I'm off to find the book next i just have to read it after seeing the film.",9,1,2,18 March 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," What on earth???
","I must say i was shocked at how poor this film was, complete nonsense from start to finish.I usually use this site to gauge if a film is worth watching and i'm shocked this film has such a high score, completely misleading.I hired out the movie to watch with 4 friends and not one of us was remotely impressed with any aspect of the movie.A huge let down.A film best avoided.I was really sorry i had made the movie choice and subjected them to such a poor movie, rest assured i will not be picking the next movie we see that's for sure.I was expecting something funny.I'm not sure if the movie was just a bad joke gone wrong.It's such an idiotic storyline and the acting is cringe.I really cant get over how dreadful this movie was.",1,16,35,27 June 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Dull as dishwater
","I was so let down by this movie.I had been really looking forward to this and had been harping on to my wife about it for weeks.When we got to see it she actually fell asleep watching it, to be fair i really don't blame her it has to be one of the most boring movies i have watched in quite some time.I really liked the soundtrack and the way the era was captured in many scenes but besides that the whole film was a massive let down.I was really excited by the cast and reviews were really good i don't think i was wrong to have high expectations but i never imagined i would be so disappointed.I watched it again a second time to try and give it a chance, big mistake it was still just as terrible the second time around i could not find any humour in a film described as a comedy.The two children are painful.Two mentally disturbed kids who fall in love, to be honest they don't even seem like they even remotely like each other let alone have developed a sense of love.Major let down.",1,88,172,24 September 2012
