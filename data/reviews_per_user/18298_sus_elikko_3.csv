Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much more a children's movie than the original Trilogy
","Frankly, I was disappointed at this one... Compared to the original Trilogy, it had too many 'obligatory comic sidekicks' such as Jar-Jar Binks, and too little to say to put up with the original SW trilogy. The only story point it makes is the early years of Anakin 'Darth Vader' Skywalker (pointing out that he was not all that 'twisted and evil' to begin with), and even with that, it really doesn't add enough to the original Trilogy to justify its publication. A pity that Lucas would even put this one in production. It really doesn't do credit to the original Trilogy, even with its improved special FX.",Null,0,0,28 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Science Fiction legend
","Basically, a classic fairy-tale with its young knight (Luke Skywalker), wise wizard (Obi-van Kenobi) and beautiful princess in distress (Princess Leia), and one of the most memorable Sci-Fi movie bad guys (Darth Vader), this one has definitely earned its place among the brightest stars of space operas. Its grand finale still brings tears to my eyes.",Null,0,0,28 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The most tragic part of the SW trilogy
","This one sees the Rebel Alliance at its darkest hour, having Han Solo captured and the Rebel base on Hoth destroyed... Meanwhile, young Luke learns about the ways of the Force. Though much of the film is set on the Dagobah system, it also has some of the most emotional scenes of the Trilogy, including Han Solo's capture... And Luke's desperate encounter with Vader. The end scene, again, is the pinnacle of emotion.",Null,0,0,28 April 2001
