10 Cloverfield Lane," boring
",old crap ....aliens n all....good background score ....good starting..especially the car accident scene but after few minutes .....all waste....don't waste money like this....instead help humans who really need money. I really don't understand why movies like this. I am bored from all this stuff.....seems like mind jammed....unnecessary creating disturbance....wastage of many things...aaahhhhhh in short too boring.....humans desire never comes to an end....zeal to do something new sometimes creates disaster for others.....this movie is best example of this. Wastage of technology. Best example to prove that whenever we have something in huge amount we just started misusing that thing...very peculiar nature of humans...lots of example in world....countries rich in natural resources just misusing those resources against humans...sick of all this...We 'humans' always forgot one thing that if we are able to possess anything than definitely we develop a system where we are able to know what we were in our past lives and what we will become in our coming lives....but that ability is not present in us...reason is simple ...that life is just another name of enjoyment...,2,0,2,6 July 2016
