The Double Life of Véronique," I want my 2 hours back! Or a Double Life.
","My Rating : 0/10I wish I had a double life : of which one life purely dedicated to watching rubbish arthouse movies such as this so that I can recommend that rare good arthouse blockbuster to the other life whenever that comes along (which takes an enormous time, I have to dedicate roughly 100 hours of movie-watching time to find a genuine masterpiece-level film).Nope, this isn't it, cool concept though - just that it ultimately doesn't make any sense or difference to me in my movie-watching journey. Kieslowski's 'Three Colors: Red' was a MASTERCLASS and I'm in love with it but somehow this just didn't click.",1,2,4,17 February 2019
Ford v Ferrari," A formulaic, overly long, utterly predictable biopic.
","My Rating : 4/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me. The story also has been embellished to confuse the facts for cinematic effect. A real downer!I am not 'H-A-P-P-Y' after watching it - that's for sure!",4,12,26,7 December 2019
The Lobster," What did I just watch??!!!
",My Rating : 1/10This was bloody awful! The most pretentious mind-numbingly flat and emotionally detached piece of excuse for a movie.Disastrous and grossly overrated.,1,3,6,1 February 2019
Blade Runner 2049," BLADE RUNNER 2049 HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FILMS OF ALL TIME.
",My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠This is visually one of the most stunning films I've EVER seen.Slow-burning science-fiction at it's finest.A STUNNING MOVIE EXPERIENCE TO BE WATCHED ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN...!,10,2,12,24 August 2018
First Man," Average movie execution of a legend's life.
","My Rating : 6/10This SHOULD have been SO much better. Instead what we have is a family drama plus scenes of space training/travel and of course the moon landing.Aspects of Armstrong's true brilliance is not captured properly and he is shown to be somewhat cold to his family.
They had some great subject matter on hand here but unfortunately the movie is cold, flat and leaves a lot to be desired. Boring at times, too.",6,1,1,22 January 2019
Vertigo," Review # 300 : VERTIGO - HITCHCOCK'S GREATEST.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠RUNNING TIME : 127 MINS
BUDGET : $2.5 MIL
BOX OFFICE : $3.2 MILTRIVIA -Hitchcock spent years trying to recreate the psychological state of dizziness or vertigo on film. He finally achieved it by combining a forward zoom with a reverse tracking shot. The effect is used several times in the film: in the opening sequence, when the officer falls from the roof of the building; and later, in the view down the mission stairwell (a shot that cost $19,000 for a mere few seconds).REVIEW -Brilliant but notoriously difficult director Alfred Hitchcock was given to playing often sadistic practical jokes on his cast and crew. Some say the idea for the film was driven by the director's own obsession with Vera Miles. The actress he wanted to cast but couldn't due to her pregnancy. So incensed at Miles' temerity in getting pregnant for the third time, Hitch told her 'that two was sufficient, but that three was really obscene'. He tried to replicate her with the many elegant blondes he cast in subsequent films. Novak paid for not being Miles when Hitchcock forced her to do endless retakes, reducing her to tears. Vertigo, his most personal film, reveals much about the director's own need for control and his obsession with the feminine 'ideal', and about his determination to find in art possibility to transcend daily life.The visual poetry, the pull of the film's haunting landscape, and it's portrait of the human longing for transcendence for love or art sends us down a new intriguing pathway. Old Hitch is still playing with our heads, but this time he breaks through to our hearts.ONE OF THE DEFINITE GREATEST MOTION PICTURES EVER MADE.",10,5,7,6 January 2019
Black Swan," A good, messy movie about obsession with perfection.
","My Rating : 7/10I think of Black Swan as a journey into the dark uncharted places in your mind. Aronofsky made The Wrestler two years earlier which I found absolutely brilliant so I suggest viewers to check that one out as well, they are both very similar in a lot of ways, the scene which ends both movies convey the same emotional punch which is of accomplishment at the cost of one's sanity and the mental and physical exhaustion and obsession with achieving perfection. I would like to have given an 8 or 9 rating and the reason for it not excelling as much is perhaps because I would have liked it to be even more twisted, I was looking for an element of horror such as The Shining or Rosemary's Baby in here which I didn't find. Also, I wished there was a more memorable background score to really tie the film neatly. It is more a psychological affair with Natalie Portman's character exploring her repressed emotions and her virgin-like innocence bothering her from becoming the black swan.",7,2,3,12 October 2018
Come and See," Truly disturbing Russian war drama.
","My Rating : 9/10THIS IS THE REAL THING! (Not Saving Private Ryan).Apocalyptic. Visceral. Horrific. Powerful. Emotional. Poetic. Expressionistic.These are just some of the words and feelings that come to mind when I think of 'Come and See' - the title is taken from the Book of Revelation.The destruction caused by wars as you've never seen before, from a different point of view. Often counted in the list of ONE OF THE GREATEST WAR FILMS EVER MADE.",9,4,4,5 January 2019
Requiem for a Dream," A haunting, thought-provoking masterpiece of modern cinema.
","My Rating : 8/10The film is a parallel story. It jumps between Harry's (Jared Leto) story about trying to score enough heroin with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to live out happy lives, and his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) story about her desperate attempts to get onto television. The film chronicles these four individuals, and their ups and downs through the course of three seasons of a year.Excellent performances, stylish camera work and quintessential Generation X film along with Fight Club. It is a visual treasure, and a true thought provoker.",8,3,4,11 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," A very silly movie
","My Rating : 2/10I didn't like this movie at all. It's utter garbage. A very, very cliched plot.Do not watch.",2,2,4,24 August 2018
3:10 to Yuma," A so-so remake of a classic. Average.
","My Rating : 4/10OK, it's not as good as the original. This is average though it is watchable, it just doesn't have the magic of the original.4/10 for me. Go watch the original instead.",4,1,2,17 November 2018
Hereditary," Waiting...waiting...waiting for something to happen!
","My Rating : 4/10Hmm. How should I put this? I was waiting for something to happen. There's so much build-up throughout the movie but it simply doesn't materialise.
I kept thinking there's potential right up to the end but it never converts to anything significant.
Twist Ending?...Meh.",4,1,2,25 August 2018
Casablanca," ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, and the always creepy Peter Lorre: what else would you need? I don't even think I have to say anything else, but I will - The film depicts a love triangle in French Morocco, which though unoccupied was part of the Nazi-puppet French government. Bogart must decide his future, and the fate of most are in his hands.'Casablanca' is a timeless classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood!",10,2,3,27 October 2018
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Loved it.
",My Rating : 8/10'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is no doubt a classic - rendering animated cartoon characters with live action footage and throw in a murder mystery with unforgettable characters you have an impossibly unique combination that can be enjoyed by everyone.This is a must-see for any film lover!,8,0,0,26 May 2020
John Wick," Slick one-track Actioner, Keanu doesn't stop kicking ass!
","My Rating : 7/10Forget storyline, dialogues, logic and acting - take Keanu Reeves and then give him a black suit and a bucketload of guns and ammunition and watch him go after the bad guys non-stop for 101 minutes!!!This is just what you need when you can't be bothered with time-wasting scenes and clever dialogues et cetera blah blah blah.For the best mindless entertainment ever...watch John Wick!",7,1,2,11 January 2020
Chinatown," One of the greatest films ever no doubt.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Roman Polanski's Chinatown is a slow, brooding film-noir reminiscent of the 40's. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are perfectly cast, the background score is sublime and the dark detective story is consistently engaging and very, very classy.A well-crafted film-noir, albeit a bit slow but if you don't mind the pacing it's rather riveting in places, especially the second half.Thumbs up for this mysterious suspense-drama if you're in the mood for a good slow-burner.Highest Recommendation.",10,4,7,9 February 2019
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga shines...!
",My Rating: 8/10A genius debut from Cooper as Director and Lady Gaga as an actress. Some of the best chemistry on-screen in recent times. Give it a whirl. One of the best films of the year easily.,8,2,4,21 October 2018
Gravity," Great Minimalist Space Film.
","My Rating : 9/10I REALLY enjoyed the film the first time when I watched it on the big screen. Revisiting it now in 2019 on a smaller TV screen certainly doesn't have the same feel and effect unfortunately and then you get to thinking how someone who hasn't experienced it in the theatre would feel.This was visually next-level and I hadn't experienced such wonder and marvel in a cinema hall before. It's just beautiful to experience that feeling of being in space which is what this movie pulls off so brilliantly.Those giving it a low rating I can understand because it's rather minimalistic and doesn't have an extravagant feel like Interstellar or Inception.Honestly a great, GREAT movie experience at the cinema and one I will never forget.",9,2,4,13 February 2019
The Death of Stalin," What an ABSOLUTE waste of time and talent this is!
","My Rating : 0/10I wanted to watch it as I found the premise to be intriguing. But it's bad, like REALLY bad, the jokes are not funny. It didn't make me laugh one bit.UTTER NONSENSE.",1,9,27,5 January 2019
Se7en," Slow-simmering serial killer thriller from Fincher.
",My Rating : 8/10Currently #21 on IMDb Top 250 so certainly a safe bet if you're looking for a thriller to watch. David Fincher makes some of the best thrillers and Se7en is one of his most iconic. Must watch for cerebral film lovers.'WHAT'S IN THE BOX?',8,1,1,18 December 2018
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides...!
",My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.,9,4,6,24 October 2018
Fury," Garbage.
","My Rating : 0/10This is by far the most terrible war movie ever made. I don't know where to start. Clichéd, dumb masculinity in all its shameful glory, pathetic characters, a bunch of idiots with weapons. The justification of rape, Pitt playing house with the two German women, even the Nazis as stereotypical bogeyman can't make anyone actually feel any empathy for those idiots which are presented as heroes in this mess.'Fury' is unrealistic, unreflective, ignorant, cliché-ridden and laughable. Garbage.",1,6,16,22 December 2018
Fight Club," ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Fight Club is one of those movies that is so unique and really shows how much movies have evolved since classics such as Double Indemnity or Vertigo or The Third Man. This movie is psychological testosterone. There's so much depth in the dialogues such as 'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time' or 'We're the middle children of history man' or 'You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world' and my favourite 'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?'I would go as far as to say that this is an important film. There is so much the film asks of the viewer. This is thought-provoking cinema at its finest.I have seen Fight Club several times and I simply love it from start to finish.It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.",10,2,4,11 September 2018
Citizen Kane," ONE OF THE GREATEST MOTION PICTURES EVER MADE.
",My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠What Orson Welles achieved at 25 years of age with 'Citizen Kane' is pure genius. There are so many interesting and ground-breaking filmmaking techniques in this one picture that one can learn on repeated viewings and interpretations. It has been 78 years now and it remains as iconic as ever.The boldness of Welles' approach in his debut is truly inspiring for anyone interested in the art and craft of filmmaking.A stunning achievement...a motion picture marvel...a splendour of epic proportions!,10,4,10,21 August 2018
Au Revoir les Enfants," Didn't resonate with me, was expecting more.
","My Rating : 5/10Very boring watching the students' life at the boarding school. Felt like a chore watching the movie unfold, just waiting for something to happen!Yes there is sadness toward the end of the movie but somehow it didn't feel like anything that I haven't seen when it comes to WW II drama.So I guess the lack of anything new really made me bored though I watched right up to the end.Alas, I've seen better dramas and documentaries pertaining to WW II and this didn't add anything to my movie-watching journey. On to the next one!",5,3,8,14 February 2019
12 Angry Men," Brilliantly executed courtroom drama...!
","My Rating : 9/10I absolutely love this movie! You can watch it again and again and never get bored. The characters, storyline and the setting of the movie are brilliant from start to finish.Highly recommended.",9,1,1,21 August 2018
Green Room," Easily the worst amongst its peers.
","My Rating : 1/10Stupid, stupid execution of an overall good premise. I don't think it deserves the high rating, everything falls flat with an awful, pathetic ending.What an enormous waste of resources! There WAS a half-decent thriller here somewhere however it never materialises. It's peers such as Don't Breathe, A Quiet Place and especially Hush have done a much better job at keeping the thriller genre gripping and entertaining.",1,3,10,5 October 2018
Us," Original but infantile execution.
","My Rating : 7/10'Get Out' was a genius movie from Jordan Peele and 'Us' tries to cover similar grounds however due to it's confused, incoherent and childish execution it makes for a good 'instant gratification' horror movie albeit not a timeless classic.I recommend watching it, there are many interesting theories floating about explaining all the smaller details and symbolisms and that makes it a worthwhile watch - every viewer can take away something and come up with their own way of looking at it.Good background score and constant tension elevate the movie and keep the viewer engaged. Downside is that it's not exactly a classic Mobius strip like it aims to be - a la 'Lost Highway' or 'Timecrimes' or 'Donnie Darko'.",7,1,2,3 April 2019
Oldboy," The OG Korean Thriller...!
",My Rating : 9/10'Oldboy' is the quintessential Korean thriller. Enough has been said about it so no point in me going into the details. Watch it for the brilliant acting performances and a killer plot. If you feel like a thriller with a plot twist ending this is your ticket! Enjoy.,9,2,3,24 October 2018
The Secret in Their Eyes," A Mind-Blowing Foreign Mystery-Thriller...!
","My Rating : 9/10A brilliant narrative, superb direction and excellent performances all round. A mystery/drama that is coldly tense, scary and intense. A bit slow at times but that can be overlooked for the fragile psychological state the audience is drawn into. A highly recommended crime/mystery told excellently. I'm going with 9/10.",9,2,3,24 October 2018
The Irishman," I Heard You Make Pictures, Martin Scorsese! - Memoirs of a Master Filmmaker.
","My Rating : 8/10An engaging slow-burning film from none other than Martin Scorsese! Now if only they could CGI Marlon Brando into the film to add to all of the innovations of de-aging the primary characters' faces - we'd get proper Godfather I and II vibes for sure!It's a brilliant technical masterwork from one of the best in the show business showing how to structure and pace a brilliant work of nonfiction (based on the 2004 book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' by Charles Brandt.)Reminiscent of classics such as GoodFellas and Godfather, 'The Irishman' has matched expectations for me both as a moviegoer and cinephile - the craftsmanship has been beautifully blended with entertainment creating a winning combination.Absolute must-see!",8,3,7,21 January 2020
The Fifth Element," Dynamic, entertaining and lots of fun!
","My Rating : 7/10I loved the director's vision of the 25th century world and all the costumes by Gaultier, colourful and bright and weird.For its genre, 'The Fifth Element' is one of the best - a comic action-adventure sci-fi not meant to be taken seriously. Enjoy yourself and I'm sure you'll like this movie if you go in with no expectations. I highly recommended it.",7,1,2,24 December 2018
The Mummy," A rollercoaster ride of non-stop action! A wholesome entertainer!
","My Rating : 9/10Massive gun battles, chases on foot, car and even airplane and lots of sword-fights, 'The Mummy' is maximum adventure with cliffhanger thrills and truly crowd pleasing humour.Arnold Vosloo as the mummy 'Imhotep' makes for a genuinely imposing villain and all the main characters are likeable and a lot of fun.Enjoyable and immensely likeable. One of my favourites.",9,2,3,23 December 2018
Orphan," Masterful Plot Twist.
","My Rating : 7/10A well-acted, slow-building suspense story with brilliant direction and cinematography. Good musical score and tension-building as well. Suspense/Mystery/Horror fans will love it for sure. A very, very good watch.",7,1,1,24 October 2018
The Hustler," The Hustler is a Classic.
","My Rating : 8/10'Eddie, you're a born loser.'Eddie Felson is a pool shark, and every day he's hustlin'... and drinkin'... and sleepin' around-you get the picture. A big-time gambler named Bert Gordon, who has ulterior motives of his own, takes it upon himself to call Eddie out on his self-destructive tendencies, hoping to make a better pool player out of him (and maybe make some big bucks off him in the process).Gordon does this by being blunt, telling him, 'Eddie, you're a born loser'-a comment that spurs Eddie into trying to figure out whether he's a loser or a winner. Internal conflict is always dramatic!Seedy smoke-filled pool halls surrounded by talented men akin to patient vultures gathered for glory and a taste of money and success.This is a classic and great for repeated viewings.",8,1,1,27 April 2019
Aquaman," A Superb Intro To Aquaman!
","My Rating : 8/10James Wan gives us some breathtaking visuals with the underwater world of Atlantis.The movie has solid action, plot and overall cinematography is really eye-catching and at 2 hours 22 mins it doesn't feel too long either which is nice.Thumbs Up!",8,2,5,28 December 2018
Midnight in Paris," MAGICAL AND FUN.
","My Rating : 8/10Woody Allen's contribution to cinema is massive - I've seen his interviews and he's just as interesting and knowledgeable as Martin Scorsese. Both have a similar output, upwards of 60+ movies. I might not agree with everything he says but it's interesting and something to think about nonetheless.'Midnight in Paris' - his ode to yesteryear writers and artists - is pure magic and is a real feel-good slice-of-life cinema that is instantly engaging and an absolute joy to watch.Something magical and special. A movie about dreams, aspirations and that rare gem in cinema that only someone like Woody Allen can realise on-screen.",8,1,2,17 March 2019
The Prestige," An Absolute Delight...A Must-Watch..!
",My Rating : 8/10Does Christopher Nolan ever put a foot wrong? This is miraculous! The Prestige easily is a solid 8/10 for me. Great film for repeated viewings with a brilliantly paced narrative and brilliant acting from all the leads.It's a Chris Nolan movie. Go watch it!,8,3,4,21 September 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," No fighting in the War Room!
","My Rating : 6/10Led by the always zany Peter Sellers this film takes a satirical look at the cold war and the threat of nuclear war. A general (Sterling Hayden) perceives a false threat from the USSR and sets planes carrying nuclear bombs to attack soviet targets while politicians as well as high ranking military men try to stop it from escalating. With a supporting cast coming from a lot of fantastic actors, most memorably from George C. Scott, this film will keep you laughing from beginning to end while looking at the absurdity of those who are in charge of the worlds fate. There may not be fighting in the war room, but there are laughs aplenty.",6,4,6,27 October 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," A magical fairy-tale.
",My Rating : 7/10Pan's Labyrinth is a delight to watch - the cinematography is one of a kind and just works brilliantly. One of my favourite movies to watch every once in a while when I'm in the mood for it.Highly recommended.,7,2,3,15 December 2018
The Way Back," Fantastic.
","My Rating : 8/10Peter Weir known for classics such as 'The Truman Show' and 'Dead Poets Society' directs this survival drama and does a good job of it.Superb cinematography, engaging screenplay, interesting characters makes this a great pick if you're out looking for a scenic movie with elements of adventure, hardship, endurance set against a WW-II Backdrop.I loved it - great for a one-time viewing.",8,0,0,26 May 2020
Battleship Potemkin," The Odessa Steps Sequence...
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. The highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events.This is a grand achievement.",10,2,5,22 September 2018
Taxi Driver," You talkin' to me?
","My Rating : 9/10Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet trying to return to normalcy in New York City. He suffers from insomnia and gets work as a late night cabby. These are the hours when the city is at its worse. Bickle takes it upon himself to do something about the scum-ridden city. De Niro brings the brilliant script of Paul Schader to life, guided by the genius of Scorsese's camera and the fantastic supporting cast comprised of Cybill Shepard, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel and a young Jodie Foster. Scorsese does a wonderful job, but the script is so powerful and the acting superb that he could have just turned on and pointed the camera in the right direction and let the story unfold.",9,4,6,27 October 2018
Life of Pi," An excellent movie for the whole family! Great re-watch value too!
","My Rating : 9/10I absolutely love Life of Pi. I don't care what others think of this gem, it's awesome! Two Thumbs UP! And it won 4 Oscars too!A wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and deal with their aftermath.Highly Recommended!",9,1,1,9 October 2018
Lost in Translation," Make it Santori time ðŸ¥ƒ
","My Rating : 8/10I've seen 'Lost in Translation' many, many times and think it's absolutely magical.It's 'Lost-souls-in-a-foreign-land' sweet premise is a breath of fresh air. Bill Murray, a washed-up actor now, is visiting Japan to film a few commercials on a Whiskey brand with a nagging wife absent physically but very much present through her flustered calls, faxes and FedEx deliveries. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is a fairly recent university graduate and also a relatively recent newlywed to a photographer husband on an assignment who seems to be away a lot and not really present for her mentally, leaving her miserable and lost.It is a humanistic portrayal of how two strangers meet. Sofia Coppola directs and writes this downbeat, subtle, short-lived romance between two lost souls who meet in a foreign land dealing with it's culture and language differences and share their mutual feelings of feeling abandonment and loneliness. It reminds me of other classics such as 'Brief Encounter' and 'The Bridges of Madison County'.'Lost in Translation' is hushed and intimate just as that whisper at the end. An absolute must-see and one of my favourites!",8,1,3,15 December 2018
Barry Lyndon," Masterful.
","My Rating : 9/10Kubrick never made his Napoleon biopic but with Barry Lyndon he shows what he could have accomplished had the production budget been met.Pitch perfect and epic, filmmaking from a master of the medium.Well worth the 3 hour long runtime.Go watch it.",9,2,4,23 June 2019
Interstellar," Sweet, Emotional Sci-fi Affair
","My Rating : 9/10This along with Gravity are two of the best sci-fi epics of the last 10 years.A beautiful movie to watch, deeply engaging albeit a bit confusing with the science of it. I watched it twice in the theatre just because I didn't really get it fully the first time around and also because it's a great movie experience to be enjoyed on the big screen. I don't think it would have the same impact watching on a smaller TV screen.I have seen majority of Nolan's movies on the big screen and I sincerely think he's an artist that best shines on the biggest canvas.Epic.",9,1,2,13 September 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Interesting plot, wasted potential.

Fargo," The Screenplay is Perfected Executed
","My Rating : 8/10So I read the screenplay (well, most of it anyway) before watching the movie as I wanted to STUDY the movie. And then while watching the movie, I kept going back and forth with the screenplay and the movie playing.It is an absolute delight to see what the Coen Brothers have conjured up. The characters, the actors chosen, the setting in Minnesota/Minneapolis, the dialogues, the attention to detail all work cohesively. It's a brilliant work of creative filmmaking.I was spellbound from beginning to end. I think you really feel like you're there with them in the year 1996. Filmmaking has come a long way since then however a classic piece of filmmaking simply cannot be overlooked.I give this 8/10 for the amount of madness the Coen brothers have been able to squeeze in 1 hour and 38 minutes. Real good then.",8,1,1,28 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," FANTASTIC.

Bird Box," Too long and pointless.
",My Rating : 2/10The buildup of tension in the first half is pretty nice however why is there no explanation of the creatures?! That's a real dealbreaker for me. As a viewer we are not given any closure what it is EXACTLY that the characters are running from or staying blindfolded from.At 2 hours it's much too long and boring. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.,2,468,808,24 December 2018
The Killing Fields," Tale of hardship and friendship in the Khmer Rouge regime.
","My Rating : 8/10A very, very realistic war movie. It is about the years of brutality (between 1975 and 1979) in Cambodia by the Communist Party of Kampuchea which is also known as the Khmer Rouge.Very detailed, very brutal. The actors do a terrific job and the cinematography is magical and surreal. War violence is shown accurately and 'The Killing Fields' is ultimately a story of human survival.Please watch if you have any interest in war movies.As doctor/survivor/actor Haing S. Ngor - who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Pran - stated in 'A Cambodian Odyssey' - his own autobiography : 'Had the film portrayed the actual severity of what had occurred, no one would've been able to sit through it.' This is easily among the most harrowing tales of friendship and loyalty to have ever made it to the big screen; a film very much worth seeing.",8,1,1,24 December 2018
Baby Driver," A good kick-ass film for the big-screen audience.

","My Rating : 9/10'The Revenant' is terrific to look at - Emmanuel Lubezki deserves that Oscar - no wonder he won in this category three times, becoming the first person to do so in three consecutive years, for Gravity (2013), Birdman (2014), and The Revenant (2015). Masterfully orchestrated fluid, uninterrupted camera movements during particularly significant scenes in the movie is his specialty and he makes it look like a piece of cake.An absorbing drama that offers punishing challenges - and rich rewards. Highest recommendation if you are in the mood for a good slow-burner.",9,1,2,31 May 2019
American Psycho," I have to return some videotapes. (Or Netflix and...Kill?)
","My Rating : 9/10Christian Bale is PERFECT as Patrick Bateman.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders 'twenty, maybe forty people.''American Psycho' is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is : Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Bateman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair. It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.Highest Recommendation.",9,3,4,24 December 2019
The Shining," Actually, a fun watch!
","My Rating : 8/10Here's something I like seeing great directors tackle : Horror!Kubrick does a wonderful job and keeps the momentum going. While it didn't scare me or anything, I loved the visuals and acting performances of Nicholson and Duvall.All of Kubrick's films are fun to watch and 'The Shining' is no different and while Tarkovsky is way better he hasn't done horror and so Kubrick wins when it comes to covering different genres out of the two.",8,1,4,23 June 2019

Apocalypse Now," DARKNESS MADE VISIBLE.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Coppola's megalomania, Brando's behaviour, Sheen's heart attack - all of the behind the scenes stuff, 'add' rather than distract to the overall viewing experience of 'Apocalypse Now'.Terrifying, brutal, experimental and an effective expressionistic War film masterpiece. A stunning piece of art and a filmmaker's apocalypse getting it made.Coppola kept shooting and shooting and shooting, accumulating miles and miles of exposed footage without knowing precisely what story he wanted to tell or how he wanted to end it. Back in the bad old days Coppola claims in press notes for the new and improved Apocalypse Now Redux - 'We were terrified that the film was too long, too strange and didn't resolve itself in a kind of classical big battle at the end... 22 years ago I was under more pressure to make this into what was then considered a 'normal' war film. Now I have the opportunity to widen the focus.'Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy the Kurtz compound after he was finished shooting. He photographed it being blown up and decided to use this footage over his closing 35 MM credits. The destruction of the compound was later confused as an alternative ending to the film.It is well-known by now that the making of Apocalypse Now was fraught with trauma. Sheen had a heart attack, the Philippine locations were politically and meteorologically unstable and Coppola was reportedly in a paranoid coke frenzy to name a few. Somehow it only makes the grandiosity of the end result all the more impressive.George Lucas was originally set to direct Apocalypse Now based on a screenplay by John Milius. Lucas's initial plan was to shoot the movie as a faux-documentary on location in South Vietnam while the war was still in progress. Coppola who was to be the executive producer tried to get the film made as part of a production deal with Warner Bros. but the deal fell through and Coppola went on to direct The Godfather (1972). By the time both men had enough clout to get the film made, Saigon had fallen and Lucas was making Star Wars (1977). Milius had no interest in directing the film and Lucas gave Coppola his blessing to direct the film himself.Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks, the filming ended up taking 16 months. The cow slaughter in the climactic scene is real. According to the editor Walter Murch, it took nearly 2 years to edit the movie with an average of less than one cut per day.Apocalypse Now can be either seen as a stunning work of cinema - or a mixed bag of raw excess and ambition.HATCHED IN AGONY AND REDEEMED BY RECKLESS SHARDS OF CINEMATIC BRILLIANCE.",10,1,2,30 January 2019
Bad Teacher," Foul-mouthed, trashy, funny?

Underground," A Very Strange Imagination
","My Rating : 6/10The first few minutes are simply genius.Imagination runs wild. Underground is weird cinema. There's nothing predictable about it and it's hard to explain. I don't know if it's a good thing in this case however. It has won quite a few awards along with the Palme d'Or so people obviously loved the madness. The storyline is bizarre and the scenes are over the top one after the other. I can't believe someone can come up with this.I want to give it 8/10 however it did not hold interest for me towards the end (it's 5 hours 20 minutes long, I watched the Extended Version) and the structure/plot is very muddy. Hence I'm going with 6/10.",6,0,0,14 September 2018

","My Rating : 9/10This is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!Now on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.Thumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!",9,3,9,26 April 2019

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Nothing happens!
","My Rating : 5/10Slow, boring aside from the banter between the two awesome leads which is the highlight of this Tarantino feature.Tarantino is certainly trying to pull off another Pulp Fiction but fails due to the lack of fun factor that the 1994 classic had unfortunately.A faster pace, a tighter storyline and more memorable scenes and dialogues would have certainly made this a classic however it's far too inconsequential for that.Overall, I'm disappointed - Alas we'll always have the cult of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill', along with 'True Romance' which is QT-written and deeply underrated.",5,4,5,20 December 2019

","My Rating : 1/10Boring!! There's nothing happening in it's 2 hours and a bit long runtime. Far too pretentious for my taste. The leads give a convincing performance however I feel the script doesn't do justice to them. It's slow-paced, Italian-city landscape theme has been done a myriad amount of times before and so I think this doesn't do anything original or inspiring to add to that. Too lazy, too meaningless according to me. How about you call me by my name and I call you by yours? Avoid at all cost.",1,9,36,24 October 2018

Children of Men," Over-hyped piece of pretentious rubbish
","My Rating : 0/10An absurd premise which doesn't work. No plot development. No character depth. On top of that serious low-budget-feel cinematography and a script without any poignancy. Nothing in this movie makes it worthy of its high ranking. Totally out of place action-shooter war-scenes and the cheap Hollywood appeal on the senses which initially seemed to be left out, magically appears (alongside the terrorist cell) during the urban shoot-out and henceforth during the so called ending of this movie. The boat being called 'The Tomorrow' is the Human Project that's mentioned throughout the movie and made me bite my teeth till they finally broke off one by one.Really imdb? 7.9?

Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood's emotional rollercoaster baby!
","My Rating : 8/10Winner of four Academy Awards, Million Dollar Baby starts off as a tale of determination to chase your dreams but it ends in a sad tale of dealing with difficult situations and the power of friendship. The film's brilliance earned Eastwood his second Oscar for his work behind the camera, it helped that in front of the camera he was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and was paired with Hillary Swank who won for Best Actress and the always wonderful Morgan Freeman who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Mulholland Drive," Review # 400 : GORGEOUS. DARK. SURREAL. MULHOLLAND DR. IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITES.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Mulholland Dr. is PERFECT Lynch.There is a beauty in the first viewing and an ugliness in the second. There's a LOT open to interpret here and that is the point of the film, according to me - for the viewer to have infinite interpretations simultaneously.So here's what I thought of it.Some of David Lynch's personal favourite movies are Sunset Blvd. (his #1) and Persona. I think the movie explores the fantasies of a young woman trapped by the illusions and grandeur of Hollywood - the glamour, the fame, the magic of the silver screen - she dreams and hopes to become a movie star some day.All of her dreams unfortunately are destroyed because it's a cut-throat world and she can't fulfil her big fantasy so she dreams up an even bigger nightmare to overshadow the fantasy.OR it's a movie within a movie about two women and the end is a wrap-up party.It's a Möbius-Strip and a must-watch for lovers of psychological movies.",10,4,6,3 March 2019

Up," One of the best animated films of all time. Two thumbs UP!
","My Rating : 9/10A wonderfully-done animated film, as most Pixar films are. Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

It's a Wonderful Life," You can't always get what you want.
","My Rating : 9/10'George Bailey, I'm going to love you 'til the day I die,' whispers an adolescent Mary (Donna Reed) into George's (Jimmy Stewart) one deaf ear. Her words echo through time, imbuing the film with a sense of predestination. It's a good thing that George can't hear Mary, because he'd probably tell her to take a hike; he has other plans and none of them can be carried out in Bedford Falls. George wants to see the world: 'I...I want to do something big, something important,' he insists. Herein lies the conundrum of 'It's A Wonderful Life', which explains why the film wasn't popular when it was released. Though the luminous - and often sentimental- spiritual center of the film is the power of courage and friendship to surmount any obstacle, it is a dark film. What lingers even after George looks at how empty the life of his town, and his family, would have been had he never existed is the fact that George wanted more out of life, but fate always got in the way. Ironically, because of problems with the film's initial copyright, the movie fell into the public domain, and ultimately became extremely popular through repeated viewings. Having the film fall into the public domain seems like an act of grace performed by Clarence himself. Had we not had the opportunity to see it again and again . we would missed the indelible power of this film. Every event in the movie - George's rescue of his brother from drowning, his discovery of the poisoned medicine, his terrible disappointments about not being able to leave Bedford Falls - and the depth of his love for Mary speak of something fundamental, something true abut life. Like a great fable, it resonates with our feelings about living in the world.",9,1,1,31 May 2019

This is a realistic thriller about a tough CIA-chick who goes on a mission to track down Bin Laden.Captivating little thriller - just don't become too caught in the controversial nature of it - it's just a movie at the end of the day.,8,2,5,26 April 2019
12 Years a Slave," Slavery is inhumane.
","My Rating : 8/10Based on a true story, '12 Years a Slave' is superbly acted, paced and photographed - it has a brilliant cast - it goes deep into where one does not want to go; it's a difficult and shameful period in human history where human dignity has been stripped off like the whipping of innocent lives.I recently revisited the film and it moved me to tears and also angered me. A chapter of history that is a disgrace to humanity.",8,1,2,8 April 2019
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career.
","My Rating : 9/10Paul Thomas Anderson took the first few pages from Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! and ran with them taking creative freedom to bring us this modern day classic. Oil! is more focused on the political and socioeconomic side of the oil boom that occurred in California during the early 1900's and the class warfare that was being waged, whereas Anderson's screenplay is focused on a story of a man, his son, and their relationship which makes for better cinema than the original source material. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career (obviously in my humble opinion) as Daniel Plainview: a wealthy independent oil man, who battles with the big oil conglomerates along with a vengeful Evangelical Eli Sunday (played fantastically by Paul Dano) all the while trying to do right for himself and his son. Anderson delivers a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word and it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it was beat out by No Country for Old Men. Though No Country is a great film it is nowhere near the level of There Will Be Blood.",9,3,4,27 October 2018
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is Rebellious,Transcendental Psychotherapeutic-Art in film-format.
","My Rating : 8/10'Put on a Happy Face' - dark, gritty comic book movie is a character drama that's drawn more toward real-world troubles than to capes and crusading.Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely perfect as the Joker! I loved every second of his portrayal of the good-guy transformed into a make-up wearing vigilante hell-bent on destruction of everything in his path.Interpretations are subjective and Joaquin's interpretation of Joker is perfection (or as close as possible) to me. On par with Heath Ledger, the sadness and helplessness of a man born into poverty slowly transforming into a menace to the system is impeccable.A truly dedicated performance. The descent into madness, violence and chaos is art of the highest order. Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King of Comedy' certainly influenced the makers and nothing wrong with taking inspiration from the very best.",8,3,5,6 October 2019
Downfall," Bruno Ganz IS Adolf Hitler...!
","My Rating : 9/10'Der Untergang' or 'Downfall' is a movie experience I can't get out of my head. Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler is both terrifying and seductive. His mannerisms are too surreal.I remember the first time I watched it I wanted to watch it again immediately. Powerful, gripping, ruthless and shocking drama about Hitler's last days.
This is what you call a true gem of cinema (unlike Schindler's List, Forrest Gump or Saving Private Ryan which are annoyingly overpraised).",9,2,3,7 October 2018

Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Sublime Gothic Romance
","My Rating : 7/10This one's a guilty pleasure. It's not perfect and it is indeed weak in a lot of places (Keanu Reeves' casting is fine, I don't like Anthony Hopkins' as a matter of fact) however I still enjoy it thanks to Gary Oldman's excellent take on Dracula.The visuals are undoubtedly wonderful and the overall texture of the film shines through the use of the background score, the use of the right hues of the colour red whether it is costumes or blood or symbolism. I enjoy it as a guilty pleasure - a comfort watch every now and again.",7,1,3,7 October 2018
The Wrestler," Honest, touching drama. Mickey Rourke shines as Randy 'The Ram'.
","My Rating : 8/10Darren Aronofsky teamed up with screen writer Robert Siegel to give Mickey Rourke the role he was born to play. Rourke portrays an aging wrestler who struggles with his life as he is faced with retiring. Rourke looks like a man who has been beaten up by life and in the ring so he fit the character perfectly and along with fantastic performances from Marissa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood who play his stripper love interest and estranged daughter respectively. What this mix brings is a wonderful story that is more about the struggles of life than it is about sport and is another film that makes you feel all sorts of feels if you have emotions like a normal person, but if you're like me it is just a real good film. Recommended for sure.",8,2,3,27 October 2018

Arrival," INFINITELY MYSTERIOUS AND EMOTIONAL.
","My Rating : 9/10The first time seeing 'Arrival' in a theater confused and bored me to death and I couldn't understand anything having lost interest mid-way - also I wasn't such a cinephile 2 years ago. But a second viewing completely changed everything! Kudos to the film for surprising me so beautifully and keeping me fully engaged!How would I describe it? It's a hybrid of 'The Tree of Life' and 'Interstellar' except not as expansive - it's very minimal - though extremely well-edited to have maximum impact.It's more a fairy-tale for adults using interesting concepts of time, language and adding in aliens because aliens are cool and intelligent. Yes, there is some suspension of disbelief required on part of the viewer to ignore the plot holes and cliches, so if you're able to 'buy into' the fairy tale you're in for a philosophical, emotional ride.Using communication and the idea of how as people we are limited in our understanding of the world because of 'thinking' in a particular language 'Arrival' explores our fundamental reason for existence - Why are WE here and what if we had the ability to see the future what would we do and how would we live and make choices going forward? Would we change anything along the way or not?Honestly, I am really overjoyed at having seen this movie - it really offers the viewer a variety of perspectives - the movie is like the heptapod and we the audience playing the protagonist and figuring out how it all fits in our own lives!Brilliant piece of filmmaking. The only reason it's not getting a 10/10 is because of some plotholes which are kind of cringe if you know what I mean.",9,1,2,13 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope Versus Fear.
","My Rating : 9.5/10'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'This is the thoughtful and paradoxical tagline of the prison-drama saga entitled 'The Shawshank Redemption'.With a runtime of 2 hours and 22 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption is truly director Frank Darabont's baby. But does it serve to be a dream come true for the viewers? The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight.The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : 'These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.' This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences.The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10.",9,1,1,1 October 2018

I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.What stood out for me personally was the acting from every cast member, the superb cinematography and the most laugh-out-loud hilarious infusion of humour and superbly crafted comedic, sad and horrific moments juxtaposed so as to play with the emotional state of the viewer in a most artistic way only a skilful filmmaker like Bong Joon-Ho can.All in all, technical mastery From Mr. Bong Joon-Ho.

Inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, the film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.

Annihilation," OVERHYPED.
","My Rating : 1/10I just came here to say it's a bad film. I found it to be a confused mish-mash of an Adventure film and Sci-fi film thrown together along with action and horror elements and some arthouse drama to make it seem more important than it actually is. It just doesn't deliver on an overall good premise according to me. It was very, very slow in a lot of places and lost my engagement throughout the viewing.If the movie stops being entertaining and engaging and simply continues to drag on and on only towards a climax as per the script then it's a waste of time. I don't know why it's on everyone's favourite list of 2018 movies. It just doesn't have that quality and pace that makes a good film which is all I am after.",1,5,9,30 December 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The holy grail of non-sense comedy!
","My Rating : 7/10This film is not for everyone, I will admit that, but it is a fun humorous take on the Knights of the Round Table as only Monty Python could do. A lot of the humour in the film is quite dry as is most of British comedy, and some of it takes a moment to process, so if you don't mind the Brits or thinking about a joke this film is for you. Obviously not all the jokes are thought-provoking, some of them are just plain stupid, which is great because it goes well with the film as a whole. We follow the Knights on their quest for the Holy Grail as they fight the French, battle against temptation, fight an evil rabbit, encounter the black knight, and the knights that say 'Ni'. Will they accomplish their quest to obtain the Holy Grail? Or will they fall short because of some heinous murder? Only time and you watching the film can find out.

The Godfather," ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.
","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.",10,4,6,1 October 2018
