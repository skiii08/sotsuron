Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A landmark movie in one way...
","...CGI. Spectacular example of how CG might one day be used to mix fantasy with reality. Unfortunately, the script, inconsistency and cardboard actors didn't do the effects justice. Unlike Snow White, Toy Story & Jurassic Park, which were all first and best: PM is merely first. But for that reason it's worth seeing in the same way you have to visit Disneyland at least once in a lifetime - for the experience - it's a spectacle.However, so many of us wanted the child reawakened by a once-genius who has either been spoiled by the experience of 'real-life' or was just lucky that the restraints put on him in 1977 actually made him leave out bits which would have spoiled a classic. (And did when the 'Special Edition' was released.)What could have been better (hindsight is so easy!) :**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!**<ul><li>Anakin should have been older. The relationship would have been more believable with Amidaala, and maybe his lines wouldn't have been written quite so stupid!</li></ul><ul><li>The force should have remained mysterious, and so should Anakin's origin. (I think Lucas didn't like the fact that religion was using his idea as a metaphor for theology. Too bad.)</li></ul><ul><li>There should have been more purpose in the movie. Too much blind luck in a universe which is about the conflict of control in the force.</li></ul><ul><li>Jar Jar (if he HAD to be there) should have developed into more than a clumsy comic oaf, and become a war hero.</li></ul><ul><li>Darth Maul should have chased the Jedi's himself instead of sending out robots.</li></ul><ul><li>Lucas should have worked much harder on the comradery and banter which made Star Wars work so well. His new characters are cardboard.</li></ul>What did I like about it? Three classic actors: Palpatine, Brian Blessed and E.T.(!)At the end of the day, I'm glad Lucas tried. He gave us a thrill, but sadly the odds were stacked against him. It's very hard to satisfy the imagination, so he shouldn't try to. I don't think he ever understood this, just got lucky the first time round.I personally would like to see him expand the Willow universe, but I'm starting to think that he's lost 'the master's touch'. I think I need to emotionally detach myself from the two trilogies to avoid utter disappointment next time...will it really get any better?",6,0,1,4 March 2001
Finding Nemo," Masterful animation
","Pixar are my favourite studio and they do not disappoint with 'Finding Nemo'. However, it was, for me, not quite as entertaining as their previous four feature masterpieces. Maybe the formula is starting to show through (there were some blatent reuse of comedic style from previous movies in the dialogue) or maybe it was because it was aimed more directly at a young child audience more than the others, but the entertainment didn't feel as rich, the humour not quite so funny. That said, what was lacking slightly in the originality of story and script, is more than made up for in the quality of the animation. The animation is rich and fluid and, well, just wonderful. I can't wait to scrutinize it more in November when the DVD is released. I don't know how many of you know Dame Edna, but it shows that Pixar know their comedians when they chose her alter-ego Barry Humphries to voice the Shark. I'm not, however a fan of Ellen and this spoilt my enjoyment of the sidekick fish a little - but I also think her character in the film bordered on annoying more than funny in some scenes. I'm being brutally critical here. The film's definitely worth watching and confirms my opinion that Pixar are at the top of their craft and are showing up in-house Disney productions of late.",8,0,0,11 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Worthy sequel - and still just as mindboggling!
","Even though it could be argued that the start is slow, it kept my attention and got my grey matter going. I personally really liked the sequence where they arrive in Zion. An artistic moment which echoes those grand starship arrivals in the original Star Wars trilogy. There are some parts which I think computer programmers relate to a bit more than the general audience. The concept of backdoor hacks in the Matrix is fascinating! I think that calling the meeting place of Zion a Temple and then turning it into a sleazy nightclub was cheap. On the other hand, I think there was an intelligence to the film that will only be realized on future viewings (it was the same for me with the original Matrix.) In fact I think it may contain some of the most eloquent dialogue of any action/sci-fi movie I have seen. Few action sequences make me go WOW, and fewer make me FEEL wow these days. There were two of three of these moments in this film.
However, in some of the action sequences it is obvious that Neo is CG. Takes the edge off the stunt it for me. Bullet-time is sometimes replaced by CG in this film and it doesn't work so well. I have a feeling that perhaps some stunts may have been physically impossible to put bullet-time cameras on, so they had to resort to CG. There is no question that the car chase sequence is better than the motorcycle chase in T2, and the end of that sequence is the one that made me FEEL WOW! As for the deeper plot of the Matrix Reloaded, one can only hope that the questions and seeming flaws are answered in the third film, otherwise the Wachowski brothers will have a lot of very disappointed movie-goers to deal with. It kind of leaves you wanting to see the next one as Fellowship left you wanting the Two Towers. But overall I personally enjoy the context of Lord of the Rings more. Even though this film is very good, if I HAD to choose one more movie to watch in the theatre this year it would be Return of the King.",8,0,0,15 May 2003
The Emperor's New Groove," Comes close to Monty Python - You'll be laughing 'til the Llamas come home...
","When Disney started touting this movie, my first reaction was 'Weird'. The previews didn't do it justice. I don't think Disney quite knew how to market this crazy rollercoaster laughter trip. We finally had an afternoon free to see it as a family at the dollar movies. To my surprize we all enjoyed it, and were laughing out loud at this great off-beat comedy we weren't expecting. Fabulous performances by Eartha Kitt (Yzma) and Patrick Warburton (Kronk). She's the best Disney Villain since Cruella, but silly rather than sinister. And Patrick's performance as Kronk is priceless. So after watching it again a couple of times on DVD I realized that the comedy is so rich and clever, it reaches the wit-level of the classic Monty Python (but without any of the crudeness). So many great lines. The most memorable part that had me in stitches? When Yzma and Kronk follow Kuzko and Pacha's map trial. Great visual humour. Has to be seen - classic stuff! Well done Disney for breaking the ice and pushing the envelope. I think the fresh approach and stupendous success of Pixar's masterpiece 'Toy Story' really woke them up. (Note how there are no main characters singing in this one either. Would have been unthinkable for a Disney animated feature a decade ago.)",Null,0,1,16 November 2002
