Requiem for a Dream," very odd
","This movie kept making me think of the guy from south park.  'Drugs are bad, Ok'  The movie just went nowhere you didn't really like any of the caracters so you didn't feel bad about what was happening to them.  It was like ok your a bunch of junkies and your lives just keep getting worse.  I did not enjoy the movie it didn't make me think.  Maybe made me worry more about the state of this country I didn't need that.",3,7,14,7 October 2002
Coyote Ugly," good still like cocktail better
",This was a great movie not because the story line was that great or the acting was that great.  It was just a fun movie that is great for a date both men and women will like this movie.  It had lots of fun times and a good story to go along with it.  You really get to like the characters.  I especially liked John Goodman as the father he plays the big tuff guy that is not really that strong on the inside.,8,0,0,4 February 2001
Men in Black II," Decent not as good as first
",This was not a bad sequal it was fun.  I didn't love it but I did enjoy it. I think that a 3rd should not be made but since this makes money most likely we will see J and K again.  Most of this movie is just the same stuff from the first one it did not really break any new ground.,6,0,0,5 August 2002
